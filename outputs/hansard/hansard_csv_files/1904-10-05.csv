5,Mr Mauger,"My honourable friend isMr G. B. EDWARDS -Most of the members in the Opposition corner voted for the exclusion of the public servants. self, and will leave them to speak for themselves. There is one incident in connection with that vote which is"" worth noting. The right honourable member for East Sydney, Who was then leading the Opposition, did his best to bring about an arrangement with the leader of the Labour Party to procure the defeat of the Government of the day. It is well known to every member of the House that, although he was professing to be with the Government on the question, he tried to bring about an alliance, or a coalition, or a conjunction, or whatever name he pleases to give it, with the Labour Party, against whom he is now fighting. sav when that was? vernment, in which the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was Attorney General, threw the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill under the table, refusing to go further with it. My right honourable friend must know well that the Barton Government was trembling in the balance while he was trying to negotiate with the Labour Party, to use them as a lever to turn it out of office. However, the House went to the country, and I stated to my constituents that I had voted for the inclusion of the railway men in the Bill, and intended to do so again; but, to my certain knowledge, I lost hundreds of votes by the further declaration that, if my action would be likelv to put the Deakin Government out of office, and allow the leader of the Free-trade Party to take possession of the Treasury benches, I would not vote for the inclusion of the railway servants in the Bill. I took that stand, because I knew that the right honourable member was opposed to arbitration, and to the policy which has given us our industries. at nothing. honourable gentleman been identified with the policy of arbitration? When has he ever championed it? it to be of immense moment that the railway men should be included in the B ill , I preferred their exclusion to allowing the right honourable gentleman to obtain possession of the Treasury benches. of putting labour first at that time. I am speaking for mydered easier by the fact that the right honourable gentleman announced that he would vote with the Government on the question. That robbed the division of all party semblance, and made it improbable, if not impossible, that he should be sent for by the Governor General. More than that, I knew -and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat will bear me out in this statement-that it was the policy of the party with which I was allied, and"" of its leader, to sit in the Ministerial corner, and to be in the House what the Labour Party had hitherto been.

My position was discussed very freely in the leading free-trade journal, which made the following statement :We ascertained definitely to-day that in the tion Bill, but not on the question of the event of such a combination Mr Mauger would not follow Mr Deakin, but support the present Administration. It went on to say that it was my full intention to do my very best to secure for the Watson Government fair treatment and a reasonable tenure of office so long as they conducted the business in a manner which, in my view, was in the best interests of the country. Although my attitude was clearly and definitely known,. I was afterwards invited to the caucus meeting convened by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. I went to the meeting, and did my very best there-and . with the aid of -others, succeeded-to induce the caucus to definitely and emphatically declare against any coalition with the Free-trade Party at that juncture. parliamentary party, and not a caucus. and purposes a caucus. admit that the minority were free to do as they chose after the decision had been arrived at by the caucus. kind. I acknowledge that the majority were free to do as they liked with regard to the Arbitration Bill, but not to go beyond that.

The Watson Government was assailed on a proposal to recommit a vital clause in the Arbitration Bill. In my judgment, the action of the then Opposition was unwarranted, unparliamentary, and unfair. I may be wrong, but that is the honest conclusion at which I have arrived. The Prime Minister was anxious to turn out the Watson Government. No honest attempt was made to arrive at a decision with regard to the clause in dispute; but the right honourable gentleman made use of his majority to prevent the Bill from being recommitted.

So far as I am personally concerned, every one of my actions was fullv made known ""to the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. Some honourable members, including the honourable member for Laanecoorie, have spoken of a project to form a new organization. I know nothing of any new organization, and I frankly believe that there was never any serious proposal to establish one. I told the honourable and learned member for Ballarat that I was not aware of any such project. that if there were any such project I should I am quite certain that no not support it. I think so. A t any that I thought it was merely proposed that the Liberal-Protectionist Party should remain intact and consider the best course to follow under the then existing circumstances.

I have no desire to rake up past events, but the honourable and learned member for Ballarat knows perfectly well that years ago I indicated that a junction between protectionists and the Free-trade Party would come from the Ministerial corner, and that we looked forward to the time when it would come. attend the meeting issued by circular or by letter ? through the public press. My honourable friend, however, need not trouble himself to inquire into the matter, because he was not interested in any way. I have endeavoured' to make it clear that we did nothing behind the back of our leader, that we did nothing to destroy, the Protectionist Party, that we left the door open, and that we entered into the present alliance at the request of the leader of the Labour Party. observe the absence of his leader from that meeting ? it. That, however, was entirely his own business, and not mine. Haying explained m"" personal position, I now come to the reasons which impel me to support this no confidence motion. In the first place, I am opposed to the Government because I object to the way in which they secured possession of the Treasury benches. I have a lively recollection of the present Prime Minister,"" when sitting in opposition, pointing the finger of scorn at the honourable member for Bland, who was then leader of the Government, and saying""When the honourable member gets upon the Treasury benches by the votes of the people of the Commonwealth, he will have JOHN FORREST -The honourable something, to be proud of . "" I repeat those words to him to-day. When he obI beg the right hontains possession of the Treasury benches by the votes of the electors of the Commonwealth, and not by intriguing and by shameful political demoralization that is a disgrace to those who are parties to it, I never received a hint of he will have something to be proud of. he adopts that tone, is one of the most brazen specimens I have seen. He is logrolling every moment of Iris life. The Ministry had not manner in which the right honourable gentleman secured possession of the Treasury benches. It is well known that had he tabled a direct no-confidence motion against the Watson Administration, he would have had not the faintest hope of carrying it. It is an open secret that a number of honourable members supported the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, under shelter of which the present Prime Minister secured office, who would not have dared to vote in favour of a direct motion of no-confidence. As invitations to a matter of fact, some of these, gentlemen had actually gone to the then Prime Minister and assured him that so long as he conducted business upon the lines' he was pursuing he would have their moial support, and would command their votes. Consequently, I repeat that had a direct no-confidence motion been tabled by the leader of the Free-trade Party he would not have secured office. Prime Minister have obtained office under the same conditions? D i d the honourable member analogy between the two cases. The leader of the Labour Party did not seek for office; he did not want it. He came into . power because of the action of unprincipled wreckers upon the other side of the House, who, in order to displace the Deakin Government, voted for an amendment in which they did' not believe. description in a majority of eight or nine.",16,Confidence

I sav that it was openly and publicly stated by honourable members that they would vote for the amendment which displaced the Deakin Government, not because they believed in it-as a matter of fact, they were absolutely opposed to it was made in this House. they had two dbjects in view, the first being to wreck the Bill, and the second to wreck the Deakin Government. The present Prime Minister did not raise his little finger in order to prevent conduct which tion? He said in a speech at Warrnamseems to me both inexplicable and politically immoral. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo, in trying to explain his present position, wished to know what the contention was all about, and urged that the Victorian Factories Act and its system of Wages Boards was quite as efficacious as any Arbitration Act which we could put upon the statute-book. He said that there was no preference to unionists under the .Victorian Factories Act. of the whole question. I say, with all respect to the honourable and learned member, that his remarks showed that; he knew nothing whatever about the working of factories legislation in Victoria. It is a notorious fact that employees' representatives upon three or four at least of the first Wages Boards were turned adrift, and that some of them are begging for work in the streets of Melbourne to-day. I could give their names. I have a list containing the names of no less than thirty-eight really good men and women, who were prominent as representatives of the employees on the Wages Boards, and wbo have been dismissed for some reason. Of course, they were not dismissed for being members of Wages Boards; that cause was not assigned. But they have been dismissed. I contend that some such clause as the preference clause is necessary in order to protect such people, and to give them security that when they are doing the work of their fellow employees and of the country, the employers shall not make scapegoats of them and -turn them adrift. It is notorious that four members of the Butchers' Board-som e of the best men in the trade-were dismissed by their employers. One or two have started in business for themselves after going through a period of difficulty and privation. Others are still out of employment, because they could not get work with other employers. Yet the honourable and learned member for Bendigo says that the Victorian Factories Act is effective. The facts show conclusively that the preference for unionists provision is needed. the statement. I am opposed to the Government also on account of their constitution. The Prime Minister has acknowledged that he was beaten, and has said that he is quite prepared to accept a truce and to carry it out honorably. But what did the right honourable gentleman say just before the last elecbool, in regard to the TariffThere must be no ambiguity as to his position. The Government was unpopular, and thousands of protectionists would support him, only they were afraid of what he would do. They would put him into power if they could do it without danger to their cause, but he was not to be bought or bribed by their support from his allegiance to the cause to which he was pledged. Has he been either bought or bribed? right honourable gentleman occupy his present position? He stated distinctly when before the electors that on no account would he lower the flag of free-trade, and that he would not occupy the Treasury bench except for the purpose of reducing taxation and removing anomalies in the Tariff. his speech? ing it. side when the honourable member is so angry with me. gentleman always did well for his side until he lowered his flag.

They are also creatures of inconsistency. Let me remark in connection with that quotation that, while the honourable and learned member for Ballarat had strong things to say in that speech against the leader of the Free trade Party, he had not a single word of condemnation to utter concerning the Labour Party. His whole condemnation was levelled against the leader of the Free trade Party. Yet here are these two gentlemen to-day, one the head of a Government, and the other supporting him ! No wonder protectionists in this House are opposed to the Government. The Prime Minister says that he is prepared to abide by this truce faithfully. But what do his friends outside say ? Do they approve of it ? Party doing? Labour Party directly. will-soo n enough. not only do I regard the present coalition as unwarrantable and immoral, but that it is so regarded by free-trade leaders outside Parliament. Take the Rev.

The party adopted the policy which appeared at the time to be best. But what do we find? Not three months elapsed before an agitation was got up in connection with our industries. I have been charged with introducing this matter into the House in order to help the Labour Party, and to injure the present Prime Minister. I am charged with doing this for purely party reasons. truce; is that honourable? Did this agitation begin in this House, ar did it begin outside this House? for party objects and from selfish motives, Or was it voiced here as the reflection of a vast and increasing public opinion, fast developing into conviction, outside? I shall show plainly that that was the case. The first people to move were the Trades Hall Council, and they moved some eight months ago, when they called for inquiries into the condition of certain trades. They collected evidence which showed unmistakably that men who had been engaged in the engineering and agriCultural implement trades especially were walking the streets, and that never in the history of Victoria had industrial enterprise been in such a dreadful state of stagnation. The Trades Hall Council were followed by the Chamber of Manufactures. They are distinctly separate from one another, and will not even meet in conference. They have positively refused to do so upon a question pertaining to their common good and future welfare. There can, therefore, be no suggestion of any coalition or mutual understanding on the part of those two todies in connection with this matter. The fact that industries were being injured was forced upon the Chamber of Manufactures. They appointed a special committee, and the results of their inquiries, as set out in the daily organ of the Protectionist Party, have demonstrated that a number of industries were being injured, especially those in connection with the iron trade, that there was stagnation, and that skilled workmen were leaving our shores. We are told that this is only a bogy, and that there is nothing in it. The honourable member for Grampians yesterday said that it was brought into the House for party pur22 poses, and that there was nothing in it.

On the 18th August lasta short time after the present Government had assumed office-in replying to the observations of some members of the Opposition, who had extended sympathy to me in my position, I am reported to have I am confident that the country saidI have this comforting reflection : that as soon as there is any deviation from the programme laid down, or the policy which I am here to support, the gentlemen who constitute the present Cabinet know that they cannot hope for any allegiance of mine. Is there any evidence of a coalition there? None whatever. I went on to say that I was then just as free to follow my own convictions and fulfil my own pledges as I was during the tenure of office of the Watson Administration. Can honourable members say that upon any occasion I have swerved in the slightest degree from my expressed opinions? Those who declare that honourable members upon this side of the House are opposed to social reform, merely make I can understand that bald statements for the purpose of giving them publicity, because they cannot substantiate them.

Yet, forsooth, these honourable members talk about the conservatives being ranked upon this side of the Chamber. There are honourable members sitting upon the Ministerial benches who are not going to warp their political convictions to please any one. What have the protectionist members gained by entering into this wonderful alliance? From its manifesto, I gather that each party is to retain its separate identity, that the alliance is to with industrial workers or with social reform. continue during the life of this and the next Parliament, and that each member of it is to use his influence individually and collectively with its organizations and supporters, to secure support for, and immunity from opposition to members of either party during the currency of the alliance. is not that a complete admission that they approve of the conditions under which the members of the Labour Party are nominated for election? Undoubtedly it is. What an illogical position is that occupied by the honourable member for Bourke, who at.the last general election denounced the practice? Why, to-day, he is a party to machine politics. ber might back up that statement with some The honourable memproof. some evidence of it, inasmuch as I have He dequoted from a clause in the alliance manifesto. binding on one partu as on the other. the whole of my point. The honourable member has entered into an alliance with the party which approves of forcing upon electors a candidate of .whom they know nothing. He is a party to that proposal at the present time. But I do not intend under wittingly to be drawn into any recriminations with honourable members in any part of the House. At this stage, I wish to repeat what I have already declared from many platforms, and also in this House.

The cry in regard to Socialism is merely a bogy. When we hear such a confusion of terms as we heard the other night, when some honourable members seemed to think that the resumption of land for closer settlement and land nationalization were identical, it is evident that some of us require a little more education in political matters.

A member of another place, who has the respect of every one who knows him, was another member of it.

What party is it that has done so much for the betterment of the industrial section of the community ? raise the fiscal question at this point, but there are men who, irrespective of their views on free-trade and protection, have given their best efforts, as far as their opportunities would permit, to create a standard of comfort and of living for the industrial classes.

M.r. KENNEDY -It is not the alliance I am condemning, but the machine by which one party to the alliance is dominated. The words of the honourable and learned member for Indi, by which he announced in all seriousness that the "" happy alliance "" had been consummated, are still ringing in our ears. I shall not attempt to disparage that honourable and learned member in any way. Many years ago in the State Parliament I greatly admired the way in which he conducted his case, when in charge of certain measures, and bad arrayed against him most of the legal ability in Parliament. ThoughI may have to differ from him in some respects, I shall be a life-lonpadmirer of his ability and his energy.

That is one case in which the leader of tbe party has asked those representing the leagues and organizations outside to ratify the alliance. Have we not another case, quoted here yesterday, and is there not an exactly similar instance in the remarks of Senator Dawson, the ex-Minister of Defence, who, speaking at Fitzroy, in that guileless way of which he is a past master, told his audience that the Opposition alliance have no desire for office at all, and that those who made the statement that they desired office were telling a deliberate untruth.

That charge against the Administration is a little too thin. uiged that the White Australia policy is in danger, presumably owing to some utterance of the Prime Minister in the last Parliament, or in his pre-election speeches. Now, honourable members who made that charge forget that it is recorded in Hansard that he has admitted to the House, as he has done in regard to the fiscal question, that he has not the numbers behind him. them. chance, and then see what he will do. the numbers to me, and I suppose that the honourable member would not object to that ? to-day ?

Is it statesmanship to refuse to take that course? Is the argument worthy of the "" higher and rarer atmosphere"" which we expected to find in this Parliament? No, that is paltry party politics. What a is wrong with the alliance? ness. But, before members of the alliance make these charges against honourable members on this side, they should look at their own home. It has been their trouble that they cannot bring the charge against the .Prime Minister that he has not assisted to preserve a White Australia, because they know that he has not been recreant to the oath which he took to ading gone back on the pledge which he gave to the people, that he would remove that Then it is legislation from the statute-book. would give him a sufficient number of followers to enable him to do so; but he has told the House that that is not his position. Therefore the only fault that honourable members Opposite can find with him is that he has not been recreant to his oath to administer the law as he found it. If the immigration restriction law is interfered with, those who stood shoulder to shoulder with honourable members opposite in passing it for the preservation of a White Australia will take the same position again. of honourable members opposite in regard to preferential trade and the fiscal issue ?

There was another clause which was fully discussed, and in regard to which certain honourable members were instrumental in providing the Government with a loophole of escape. 8 T 2 62. It was only after that clause was amended that the Prime Minister made the amendment in clause 48 a vital matter. The following proviso was inserted :Provided that no such organization shall be entitled to any declaration of preference by the Court when and so long as its rules or other binding decisions permit the application of its funds to political purposes, or require its members to do anything of a political character. It was only after fhat provision had been inserted that it dawned upon the late Prime Minister that it was essential for hiin to make the amendment of clause 48 a vital matter. quoted by the honourable member should also have been made a vital matter. was, to my mind, the determining factor. That was proved by the attitude assumed by certain honourable members, with whom I do not quarrel because of their action. I give them every credit for being sincere and honest. Just before the motion for What was his posithe recommittal by the present Government was agreed to, the honourable member for Kennedy, in his mild-mannered way, asked that clause 62 should be recommitted. So far as I am aware, there was no objection to that course being adopted, and when the matter came on for discussion, the honourable member asked that the clause should be excised. He saidWhen clause 48 was under discussion, and was carried, the general impression was that it was going to be recommitted, and, in those circumstances, this proviso was inserted in clause 62. ^ That was the famous bridge that was built by the honourable and learned member for Indi and the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs.

I wish to show that the political chaos which we have to-day is the result of the ambition of one man. He has already wrecked two Ministries, and he has also wrecked the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which he used for the purpose of attaining office. One can hardly believe that it was possible for a gentleman to allow his ambition to get the upper hand of his judgment, and of his sense of fair tactics in politics, to such an extent as the present Prime Minister did. What did he say concerning the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill when it was first introduced ? He saidI feel no reserve whatever in saying that the experiment is one to which there are a number of objections. It is an experiment which is surrounded by quite a multitude of fears, but there is one substantial gain which comes to us by this willingness on the part of those wbo represent the physical strength of our Commonwealth to place themselves under the reign of law and order, administered by a High Court of Justice. He referred f u r t h e r to the great sacrifices made by the labour organizations in agreeing to this experimental legislation. saidBut, still, we in this young Commonwealth, viewing the history of the great nations where these joint interests fight to a point at which human l if e is ruthlessly sacrificed-rememberin g that behind all these employers and workmen there stands that great helpless element in our national life, the women and children of Australia; remembering that the homes of labour w ill , under a B ill of this sort, be more secure from It will be the misery of poverty, and the agitation and dangerous ebulition of class feeling; remembering the great humanity which deals with this imperfect state of things-will , I hope, cheerfully pass this B ill , trusting that the time will come Then, look at when, under a more rational and voluntary arrangement of intelligent men representing these great interests, a method will be found of settling their disputes without any recourse to legal machinery. In the same speech the right honourable gentleman said that it was one of the greatest tributes to the representatives of labour in Australia that they had agreed to allow the Judge of a Court to settle industrial disputes, instead of ha;-ng recourse to the ; Despite the right honourable old methods. What has btome of all those noble sentiments and aspirations? I felt my blood warm within me as I listened to that speech. I thought that the right honourable gentleman was the great democrat who was going to stand at the head of the forward movement in this country. But some little time afterwards, I had a rude awakening. The scales were removed from my political eyes when I heard this very man denounce those who, in New South Wales, had practically kept him in office tor years. He is now making political capital out of the fact that the alliance endeavours to secure immunity from opposition to those who are supporting it. But what did the right honourable gentleman do when the Barton Government dropped the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill in the last Parliament ? Did he not move the adjournment of the House, and while the debate on his motion was'proceeding, was he not communicating with the Labour Party with the object of bringing about the defeat of the Government? Not only that, but the very thing that he is now condemning in the alliance-the granting of immunity from opposition-h e agreed to grant to every labour man who stood at the elections. Yet we have this same gentleman posing before the public and saying that the Labour Party is a menace to Australia. I am glad that the Labour Party did not accept his overtures. Immediately after that, he entered into other intrigues to bring about the downfall of the Deakin Government. It is idle tor him to say that simply because he voted He with the honourable and learned member for Ballarat he could not have prevented the downfall of that gentleman's Government. While the Prime Minister was shaking hands with the then Prime Minister",37,Honourable Members Hear Hear

397,Mr Poynton,"Nevertheless , it wasin voting with him, he was driving a political stiletto into the side ot his Government by the assistance of those who publicly declared that they voted against the Deakin Government in order ,io wreck the Bill, and the Ministry. The Prime Minister tacitly agreed to have the Bill killed Why? Because he thought .that if the Deakin Government were defeated he would be sent for. This is not idle talk. When the honourable member for Bland was sent for, did not the Prime Minister declare that he did not know on what constitutional grounds the Governor General could send for him, instead of for the leader of the Opposition ? He complained bitterly about it. But still the right honourable gentleman did not abandon his attempt to get into office. Further intrigues were tried. He approached the honourable and learned member for Ballarat for the purpose of forming a coalition. There was to be no immunity from opposition for labour men then, but they were to be fought against in every shape and form. While the right honourable gentleman's party were prepared to swallow a coalition proposal, the Deakin party would not agree to it. Matters drifted on until the Watson Government was threatened with a no-confidence motion. The newspapers said that the right honourable gentleman had left Sydney with a no-confidence, motion in his pocket. The honourable member for Bland, while Prime Minister, announced in a speech in Sydney, that if clause 48 of the Conciliaincorrect on that matter also. tion and Arbitration Bill were not amended in Committee in a certain direction, his Gorect that does not suit the Minister of Devernment would resign. right honourable gentleman's opportunity. fact that there are only five members on the Government side of the Chamber.

That was by assassination. The present .Minister of Defence was used for the purpose. It was not his first attempt in this direction. He had previously been guilty of assassinating a Government. An interview took place between those two gentlemen, and this matter was fixed up. rect. How is it that the honourable member for Barker was approached with .regard to the honourable and learned gentleman's amendment, if there was not some arrangement about it a fortnight before? is an invariable rule that when an honourable member gives a denial concerning a statement Which has been made, that denial must be accepted. I submit that that rule ought to be applied to the honourable member for Grey, who has refused to accept a denial made by the Minister of Defence. order which provides that an assurance given by an honourable member shall be accepted, but amongst gentlemen, as 1 have said several times previously, it is the custom to accept an assurance given. There is no point of order. statement which I have made is correctthat an arrangement was made between the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence to prevent the Watson Government from going into Committee on clause 48. Having secured a member to perform the act of assassination, they proceeded to look around for another person to help them. They hit upon the Chairman of Committees. I am sorry he is not in his place, because I am going to say something strong about him and I shall not screen him because he happens to be away. That was the fence.

410,Mr Poynton,"I think that any termstreatment which was meted out to the Labour Government. I say that there is no ber forgets the divisions which took place, precedent for such treatment. I was about on the Tariff. to refer to the Chairman of Committees, who is reported in this way in the Argusspeak on the question, except on the second readinto Committee to further consider a cering, and when the opportunity did come he f o l tain proposal? lowed could not understand this. It was above his mental able member refers, affecting the vote of level. Those who laugh last laugh best. It may be above my mental level to understand what the honourable member should have done in the case I referred to ; but I challenged him last night to show one case on record where a Chairman of Committees had acted as he had acted. The honourable' member pleaded as an excuse that he was representing his district, and that his vote should not be lost to his constituents, because he happened to be Chairman of Committees. honourable member accepted the position of Chairman of Committees, he knew, as you, Mr Speaker, know, that one of the responsibilities attaching to such a position is that the honourable member accepting it has frequently no opportunity of recording his vote. I repeat that there is no case on record where a Chairman of Committees has done such a thing as was done by the honourable member for Laanecoorie. If there is such a case, I challenge honourable members who have yet to speak to quote it. P arliament. the honourable member for Parramatta, who is only just "" barking "" because he is on the other side, to say that. ber used to "" b a r k "" with me until lately. ber were on this side, there would be no one more indignant if his party were subjected to the same treatment. It is the established practice of all parliamentary institutions I suppose, and certainly of all English Parliaments, that whenever a Chairman of Committees, or a Speaker, has to give a vote, it is recorded in such a way as will secure further consideration of the matter in hand. tablished practice. tion submitted in this case? Was it not such practice as that to which the honor1 a Chairman of Committees in the House. rectly stated the practice. a casting vcjte. merely a casting vote. I point out that the Chairman of Committees had no consideration whatever for Mr Speaker. I venture to say that if , in the course of a day or two, we have a division on the motion now before us , and which, from pre1 I venture to say that when the sent indications, is likely to result in a tie. Mr Speaker will be found following the established practice of voting in such a way as to give opportunity for further consideration. The Chairman of Committees, in the case to which I refer, not only liberated himself to vote, in order to destroy the Labour Government, but by his action, the honourable member prevented Mr Speaker from having a vote. Speaker would have been entitled to a vote ? orable member Suggest that any Speaker would have voted o_i a censure motion? all. WhatI say is that the immediate result of the course followed by the Chairman of Committees was to place Mr Speaker in such a position that he could not vote. Surely the Speaker has as good If the honourable mema right to a vote as has the Chairman of Committees ? Is it because the Chairman of Committees is an officer of their own creation that honourable members opposite claim that he should vote whenever they desire him to do so? I challenge the honourable member for Parramatta to state another case in which a Chairman of Committees has voted in the way in which the honourable member for Laanecoorie has done.

429,Mr Joseph Cook,"I have already toldable members to the action taken by one member of the Government, who is possessed of a conscience. right honourable member for Balaclava. When that right honourable gentleman learned that the question which was to be decided was. whether the House should recommit a clause in order to consider whether or not it should be amended, and that the Watson Government staked their existence upon the recommittal, he gave a pair in favour of the Watson Government, and gave distinct reasons for his action His reasons were that he had never in his experience known a case in which a Government asked for the recommittal of a clause, and when such a request was refused, and particularly when the Government staked their existence on the proposed recommittal. The Prime Minister said that the honourable member for Bland chose his own ground. I say that is a distinct fabrication, and the right honourable gentleman well knew it. We know the intrigue that was going on for some days in order to secure to honourable members opposite the possession of the Treasury benches. We are told that it is their intention to restore responsible Government. illustration of it? I invite honourable members to look at the exhibition of responsible Government which we have had during this debate? I ask them to consider the anxiety which the members of the Government have shown to remain a little longer on the Treasury benches. no anxiety to brjng this debate to a close. It is, on the contrary, their desire that it should continue. the. fact that at 10 o'clock at night an hongive h i m; but it is difficult to believe that orable member has only to get up and ask for the adjournment of the debate, when immediately a representative of the Government will rise to say that the request is granted. the lead of the last Government in that respect. the part of the Government is evident, we are being told that we are trying to delay the conclusion of the debate in order that the farmers may riot get an . opportunity to vote at the impending election. I challenge the Government to push the motion speedily to a division. I ' aim prepared to sit here night and day until the debate, is concluded; but we know that the members of the Government are 2 I can refer honorin no hurry to proceed with it. What an exhibition of responsible government it all is. Last night we had complaints about I refer to the the way in which the debate was being conducted, and about the evident lack of desire on the part of the Government to push it along, and one-half of the head of the Government, the honourable member for Gippsland, said that with the assistance of the leader of the Opposition, the Government would try to. push tbe debate to a conclusion. The honourable gentleman excused the Government in . the matter by saying that the motion had been tabled by the . leader of the Opposition. This Government assumed office in order to restore responsible Government, and have they no concern about the management of the business of the House? I say that the anxiety which members of the Government exhibit to remain on the Treasury Benches is a disgrace to this House. If they are conducting responsible Government, and really control fhe business of the House, why do they not insist that the debate should be brought to a close at an early date? The honourable member for Laanecoorie seems to be very anxious about his present leader. He has complained Have we not had a lovely that others have deserted their leader. When people live in glass houses they should be careful how they throw stones. Is it not a fact that the honourable member deserted his leader on two occasions when motions of want-of-confidence were submitted ? The honourable member now wishes to pose as a They have exhibited very loyal supporter. He gave expression to certain views at a banquet recently. I do not know whether what he said was due That is evident from to exuberance of spirit, and if it was, I forhe said these words coolly and deliberately. The honourable member is reported to have said thatThere had been an unseemly exhibition on the part of those who had just l e f t office, and he regretted, for the credit of the Commonwealth, that they had not followed the fine example set them by their predecessors in this respect.

436,Mr Poynton,"The honourable memdegraded the high positions held by them as to descend to tactics which would disgrace Billingsgate. That is the language used by the present Chairman of Committees, who, as I have already stated, has taken action which is no credit to him. When the honourable member makes such remarks about Labour members, I should like to ask him when the Billingsgate was used? last night was guilty of worse than ""Billingsgate,"" he was guilty of misrepresentation. ber is such a stickler for the good conduct of honourable members, why did he not protest when the Prime Minister used "" Billingsgate "" about a fortnight ago, and used certain dirty expressions when referring to the honourable and learned member for Corio. I have no hesitation in saying that the only man I ever heard use language in this House that might be termed "" Billingsgate "" is the present Prime Minister. Where was this censor of public morals that he did not bring his present leader to task on that occasion? It did not then suit the honourable member to do so, and I leave it to him to explain his inconsistency as best he may. Some honourable members on the other side think that when they attack us we suffer in public estimation. We are told, forsooth, that we do not represent the real workers, that we have never done any hard work, and that the honourable member for Kooyong, the honourable member for Flinders, and the honourable and learned member for Parkes are the true representatives of the honest workers. Let me assure honourable members that every insult directed to this side of the House'is an insult to the working men in Australia, and it is accepted in that way. Government. I object to them, first, because of the way in which they got on to -the Treasury Bench, and which, to say the least of it, was ""fishy,"" and secondly, because of the way in which they are deliberately misrepresenting the aims and aspirations of the Labour Party. Just imagine the Prime Minister standing up at a meeting of the Farmers' and Producers' League, and saying that the Labour Party would have an inspector on every farm. He knew that it was a base fabrication which he was addressing to his audience, and that fact and others of a similar nature make me feel more strongly against him than I should otherwise do. If he really believed these things, all honour to him for having the courage to express his thoughts; but he knows quite differently. At another meeting, he said that under the Labour Party the "" Government stroke"" would be instituted in connection with all Government undertakings. For five yeais he was Premier of New South Wales, and during that period a good many public works were carried out under his Government. It is a singular thing that he never discovered any sign of the "" Government stroke "" as a result of the labour movement. For five years his Ministerial existence depended upon the support of the Labour Party in that State, and a time came when he could not get them to do all he wished them to do. In view of that fact, it very ill becomes the right honourable gentleman to go before the electors of Australia, and try to throw dust in their eyes by saying that the aim of the Labour Party is to introduce the "" Government stroke"" everywhere. I am against the right honourable gentleman, too, because he took part in a meeting of the Women's League of Victoria, whose policy includes a plank for the purity of home life. That plank is an insult to every right-thinking man in this House, and I rejoice that the honourable member for Grampians refused to go upon their platform while their policy contained that plank. Does any one here imagine for a moment that we believe in a system of free love and the breaking up of home life, as is suggested by some of our critics? When the right honourable gentleman went upon the platform of the Women's League, he must have known that that plank was a lie from start to finish. And yet the honourable member for LaaneI am asked why I object to this coorie has not the courage to rise here and denounce that sort of thing. I am against the right honourable gentleman, too, because instead of trying to bring about conciliation between the two great forces, he is going upon every platform throughout Australia and stirring up class bitterness. He is stirring' up strife between employers and employee's, and posing as the only ""Simon pure"" in connection with this political crisis. He is appealing to the prejudices and passions of the great farming'community. He has addressed to them remarks which he knew were not correct, and which have been contradicted here time after time. He has made that admission on the floor of the",41,Honourable Members Hear Hear

438,Mr Poynton,"If the honourable memHouse, and yet he continues to make practically the same accusations, although they are couched in different words. amused at the sophistry of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, when in his laboured speech he tried to make the House believe that the Wages Boards and the Arbitration Court are synonymous. It was quite a revelation to me to hear his statement to that effect. His greenness was so conspicuous as to cause me some anxiety. There is no comparison between the Wages Board system of this State and the Arbitration Court sought to be created. The Conciliation and Arbitration Bill is based upon organization. Its provisions cannot be given effect to, except by organization. An award cannot be carried out without organization. An organization must consist of at least 100 members before it can go to the Court. The honourable and learned member's attempt to justify his' vote by the institution of that comparison was very lame, indeed. I was equally astounded at the new-born zeal of the honourable member for Echuca. It is certainly very refreshing to see the affection which he has bestowed upon the Prime Minister. It was only very recently that he used to describe the right honourable gentleman by such endearing terms as "" a political mountebank,"" "" a political humbug,"" and "" a political buffoon."" And yet, to-day, we see him practically hugging the right honourable gentleman, and discovering in him some wonderful qualities which he never perceived before. This may not be politic, but it certainly has the recommendation of being honest. The difference between the honourable member for Echuca and myself is that, while I speak what I think, he does not speak what he thinks. It is interesting to notice the warmth of affection which he displays for this new combination. His record shows that he has always been against a Liberal Government. He is only masquerading in a Liberal's clothing. He got into congenial company, I think, when he crossed to the other side. If we take away from that side the honourable member for South Sydney, the honourable member for Parramatta, and the honourable member for Dalley, the honourable and learned member for Wannon, and the honourable member for New England, what sort of legislation would suit the other members on the Ministerial benches? There is a degree of similarity between the honourable and learned member for Wannon and the honourable member for New England. The former is a renegade -single-taxer. The other night he admitted the soft impeachment of having been at one time a single-taxer; but he said that he has I was his political sight now. Singular to say, he only cut his politcal wisdom teeth just prior to standing for a country seat. orable member for New England, who is always boasting ot his consistency, and never misses an opportunity of attacking the Labour Party and others who sit on this side, tell us the other night? He said, in effect, "" I am a single-taxer. I do not want any of this land of trumpery legislation."" But when he was asked if he would impose a Federal land tax, what did he say? ""No,"" he said/'that was aproperthing for the States Parliaments to do."" This bold apostle of Henry George ran away from a State Parliament where it was possible to impose a land tax, and got a seat in the Federal Parliament, so that he should not have to vote in support of his view. From the honourable member for Richmond we had a nice display the other day. I have a great admiration for him; but I never take what he says very seriously. To me he is a political enigma, a sort of political' monstrosity-wha t is called a sexless politician. He has no convictions. He repeatedly says, Why should I consider about any policy, why should 1 do anything, why should I have an opinion? We pay the Government to have opinions."" Those are the lines upon which he proceeds. He is very much like a chip in porridge in that respect. When any one who knows the honourable member reads the newspaper reports of his remarks, he merely remarks,'""It is only Tom Ewing who is speaking. He is never in earnest, he is joking. Take no notice of him."" The Prime Minister, however, occupies a responsible position, and he goes before the public and deliberately misrepresents the aims of the Labour Party. On one occasion he said that he was against Socialism; but he has modified that statement, and he .is now against extreme Socialism. I wonder what he calls extreme Socialism. I should imagine that that plank in the platform of the Women's League of Victoriaa branch of the "" National Ass."" -to which I have referred, would be extreme Socialism. I am a State Socialist, and I wish to briefly refer to what State Socialism has done for New Zealand. The policy of State_ Socialism is put into practice there, and it approaches more nearly to the policy of the Labour Party than does any other policy in Australia.",42,Honourable Members Hear Hear

But, as the honourable member for Wilmot has not yet delivered judgment, we are all expected to emulate the ladies in the Vicar of Wakefield, by continuing the conversation, if not the argument. deavour to attain the merit of comparative brevity, by keeping as clear as possible of any attempt at extemporizing the details of honourable members' political careers by indulging in any personal retrospects, because I firmly believe that the electors are not particularly edified by our excursions into the domain of political inconsistency. By this time they have learned to take it for granted that a capacity to adapt one's self to circumstances is a condition essential to success in public life, and that in times, when principles are so often affected by the proximity of power, all of us, in the opinion of our opponents at least, fairly fit the portraiture of Dryden's linesStiff in opinions, always in the wrong; Was everything by starts, and nothing long. It seems to me that the electors are chiefly concerned with policy and method; with the soundness of principles, and the probable efficacy of machinery, though being like ourselves, indebted for half parentage to woman, they sometimes indulge in a little curiosity as toWhat's done i ' the Capitol; who's like to rise, who thrives, and who declines. Perhaps, however, we may find some little consolation in the fact that we are no better, and no worse, than the electors made us.

The fact is it seems to me that if a Cabinet has a majority in the House upon matters of current policy, it' should not resign upon any division in Committee, if that division does However, I shall ennot clearly indicate a want of confidence in its general principles or administration. The public who sent us here, as I mentioned previously, have a large interest in the stability of government, and the balance of principles which bind a party together should not be sacrificed owing to a difference of opinion among members generally upon one principle. The essence of party government is that honourable members upon some matters subordinate, while not abandoning, their personal convictions in the interests of unity on a great many others. like machine politics ? name it is called. I am afraid that we are too much the slaves of names. Undoubtedly it is the true principle of party government that, for the sake of power, members have, in some respects, upon matters of current policy to subordinate their opinions in order to gain momentum upon their others. It may be that upon a division in Committee the vote of an honourable member may be cast with a view to keep in power a Government which will further his views upon other questions rather than upon the matter immediately engaging his attention I would ask, is it a matter of precedent even on the second reading of a Bill that Ministers when defeated should resign? We know that it is contrary to the usual custom. Much less If it be true, as was said by Burke, then, should they throw up the reins of government upon a division in Committee. Some divisions which were taken in Committee upon the Tariff were very far-reaching in their effects. But no Government would dream of throwing up the reins of office because they were defeated upon them. In the last session of the first I am not speaking for Parliament, we had a far-reaching division upon the question of borrowing for the purpose of carrying out certain lines of expenditure.

483,Mr Glynn,"It was known to everymissions are not to be relied upon, and how futile they are, owing to the manner in which the questions inquired into are approached, and the sometimes prejudiced reports that are framed, I shall do so by pointing out that in the Times of a week or two after the report of Mr Chamberlain's Tariff Commission was published there are reports of lectures delivered before the British Association by Professor Lotz, of Munich, on the operation of protection in Germany, and another by M. Yves Guyot, a French authority on the effects of protection in France. Professor Lotz shows that in Germany, as the result of Tariff legislation and the restriction of exports of the produce of a good many industries, the raw materials of some industries are touched. He says thatSome very important branches of German industries suffered severely from the protection when the sense is small, given to others. Thus, a body of monopolists exercised supremacy over the makers of finished, articles, though the latter were three times more numerous. sav on the same subject ? what he says, but I do not desire to trespass too long upon the time of honourable members. on protection in France, pointed out that the French workman is under-fed, owing to the taxes which are imposed upon his general necessaries, but particularly upon his food. He saidNot5 per cent -no t one person in twentycould be found who was interested in protection. There were leagues in France against tuberculosis which made noise enough, but the hygiene of the beefsteak was forgotten, and it was that of which the working man was mostly in need, especially the working man in France. Again, in the last file of the Times that reached us an account is given of the working of the bounty system in favour of the 'production of pig iron in Canada, that Chamberlain's Commission. in a cold-blooded report-becaus e it is one .of the reports of the Board of Trade, not made for the occasion, but presented to the House of Commons on the iron and steel industry-referrin g to Canada, saysThough the bounty is on a higher scale in the case only lasted twentv-four hours'. of pig iron made from native ores, the pig iron produced in Canada from native ores is much less than that produced from imported ores, and the greater part of the Canadian ore is exported. Here, again, we have an experience of the working of the principle of bounties on iron production and manufacture, which is one of the chief planks, though not their's alone, of the alliance. I find, sir, that even on the question of old-age pensions, one which appeals to radical instincts and to our sympathetic natures, the views of the Labour Party have been somewhat modified, at least in expression, by the alliance into which they have entered. true. honourable members, that on this question of old-age pensions we find, instead of a straight-out advocacy, that the principle is to be advocatedon a basis fair and equitablewhatever the distinction between the two may be; the words seem to be multiplied to the several States and to individuals. Here, again, an opening is left to individual sniffings of position, a way out of difficulties that attach to definiteness of statement. I ask honourable members if , in reply to one of those election circulars with which we are complimented from time to time by electors, an expression of that M. Yves Guyot, in his lecture kind was used, what would the societies which send qut the circulars think of the candour of the candidate? orable members who are asking that there shall be an immediate change of Government, not on a question of administration -becaus e there is no attempt to contest that-bu t on policy !

494,Mr Glynn,"No doubt, but that Goequivocal ancl halting, scarcely up .to the morale of a party which has hitherto aspired to lead in matters of social amelioration. Policy seems to have become attenuated with the view of power, so that the policy of the Labour Party, as the result of new associations, is not up to the standard of men who aspire to represent the working classa class whose leaders have hitherto, with most unswerving fidelity and courage, held fast to principles until they came by force of reason to prevail-me n who always believed that what has been the experience of one reform may be made the experience of all, feeling, as they do, with Carlyle, that the truth that was yesterday a restless problem, has to-day become a belief burning to be uttered. I should like to mention also the result of this frequent change of power. Through the more accidental features in it, and tlie re-arrangement of parties on lines less of principles than petty expediency, the members of the alliance cannot, if they come into power, give the country a Cabinet with the essential British characteristic of unity of opinion in great matters of policy. Unanimity amongst the members of the Government on the broad matters of current policy is the essential feature of the British system for the past 150 years. vernment altogether. harassing my honourable friend, the member for Melbourne Ports, and, as I wish to be fair, as well as candid, let me say a few words on this much-confused issue of Socialism against anti-Socialism. take the platform on any cry of anti-Socialism, because I believe Socialism covers an immense amount of what is good in policy as well as sometimes mistaken in method. As the honourable member for Grampians yesterday suggested, the definitions differ very widely. We have a general consensus as to what are the aims of Socialism, but very often the true meaning is misrepresented, owing to the prejudiced ignorance of even writers of assumed authority. I find that Professor Ely, an' unprejudiced authority, in his little handbook on Socialism, saysEven a hasty examination of the vast majority of books written on Socialism or Communism snows how utterly worthless they are. authors start out with such an intense hatred of all socialistic systems that it is simply impossible for them to understand those systems. But the worse of it is, they couple their misunderstanding with such hard words and severe epithets as to excite bad blood and drive the various classes of society farther apart than ever. I say that when we find men like Professor Foxwell, who, I think was a lecturer on political economy in the Oxford University, and Professor Caird, of the University of Glasgow, saying that many of the principles of Socialism are legitimate deductions' from economic doctrines, we must not, with the cock-sure dogmatism of economic tyros, endeavour to blast it with a name. Its aim, as distinct from its methods, and there it is often less a matter of design than mistake, is, as we all admit, distributive justice. Its meaning is well suggested by the great master-poet of our nation, in the splendid aspiration which he puts into the mouth of Lear a9 he stands bareheaded against the elementsThat distribution should undo excess, and each man have enough. Now in the opinion of Profesor Ely, it seeks to improve the common lot of the working classes by the application of thoroughgoing measures. It refuses to believe, no. matter what the concomitants of an apparently heartless social evolution may have once suggested, that in the words of Mirabeau, "" the oppression of the poor, like the hail and thunder, is a thing inevitable, the ordinance of nature."" But the method is the great difficulty and subject of difference, and here I hope we shall be ready to be a little tolerant of each other's opinions, or perhaps mistakes. Buckle was not a man of conservative views; but he points out that the great difficulty is the method in legislation. It is on methods we differ ; the means of Personally, I always refuse to carrying out principles acknowledged to be good. Where the theorist suggests improvement, the difference of opinion in point of view of methods shows how many mistakes we are liable to.make in the furtherance of good aspirations. Continental Socialism is one thing, British Socialism is another. is another. the one side, the methods of Lassalle and Marx, both of whom condemn capital, describing it as theft, and, on the other, the methods of, say, Professor Thorold Rogers, who, I think was a professor of political economy in the University of Oxford, and The of the Rev. Dr. Fairbairn, who a few years ago held the position of President of the Congregational Union of England and Wales, and wrote some very able works",49,Honourable Members Hear Hear

498,Mr Glynn,"Between, for instance, onon social questions, the difference is very great. Ely, in dealing with methods, says there are very sharp lines of difference between Socialists. You have, for instance, pure Socialism, State and professional Socialism, Christian Socialism, French Collectivism, French Blancqueists, French Anarchists. Social Democracy, and international Socialism, all of which are radically different in method. Mill, strange to say-and it proves my point that method is the difficulty in legislation-is regarded by some as the protagonist of Socialism, and by others as the great champion of Individualism. istic in his old"" age; the older and wiser he grew, the more socialistic he became. culty of labelling people by abstract names. Professor Ritchie, who exhibited socialistic leanings, and was, I think, a professor of Oxford, speaks, in one of his books on this question, of John Stuart Mill as the protagonist of Individualism, and yet we find that this John Stuart Mill wrote that: The social problem of the future we consider to be how to unite the greatest individual liberty of action with a common ownership in the raw materials of the globe, and an equal participation in all the benefits of combined labour. John Stuart Mill was not one of those .pseudo-reformers who would attempt to frame in a day a programme for eternity. With the modesty of all great men and all deep thinkers, Mill said that he had not the presumption to suppose that he could foresee by what precise form of institutions these objects could most effectively be attained, or at how near or distant a period they would become practicable. He pointed out that it was only by co-operation between the various classes of society, between capital and labour, and through a system of culture, prolonged through successive generations, men could be brought up to the point of efficiency. The method here, again, is the difficulty; but are we, therefore, to allow our faculties to rust, and to sit idly by whilst human destitution calls for remedial means? I say ""No."" Some experiments must be made. Every healthy politician knows that there is a clear line of demarcation between the sphere of private enterprise and the sphere of Government interference. I say that nearly all the ameliorative measures which have been adopted during the last fifty or sixty years, were 2 originally deemed to be socialistic. Factories We find that Professor Acts, Health Acts, and agrarian laws, that changed the relations between landlord and tenant, were all expressions of socialistic interference. I remember reading that when the great Devon Commission of 1844 inquired into the state of affairs, respecting landlord and tenant in the Old Country, and particularly in Ireland, Lord Brougham, who was then described as a fingerer of John Stuart all things, condemned the probable outcome of the Commission as socialistic, and cautioned the members of it, and particularly Lord Devon, the chairman, against any interference with the sacred rights of property. The Times, replying to him, asked what were the limits of the interference asked for ? Did they not mean this in effect: the assertion of the, right of the poor man under God's charter to live and breathe upon this, the Almighty's world? and learned member should come over to this side. yet. If I may become a little personal, and only at mv own expense, I may say that if a belief in, or a leaning towards direct, as' against indirect taxation; if a belief in the leasing, rather than the sale of Crown lands, in the State ownership of railways, the State ownership and control of the post and telegraph system, of our printing offices, in municipal enterprise in connection with gasI do not exhaust the list, I am simply giving a few examples -waterworks , the health of the people, public parks', trams, is an expression of sympathv with Socialism, I confess that I have such a sympathy. excellent municipal enterprise for the benefit of the citizens that has been displayed in England during the last thirty or fortyyears, in Glasgow, in particular -that is in Scotland. who would correct a geographical mistake of that kind. I here use the term, "" England"" in the larger sense, as even including the better part of the United Kingdom, Ireland. I say that if the acceptance of the results of municipal enterprise in Glasgow, Birmingham, Berlin, and other great centres of population indicates a leaning towards Socialism, I confess to being affected' somewhat in that way.

The test I endeavour always to apply is this: The tesi that Government is formed to protect the individual against oppression, whether it be the oppression of physical duress or industrial monopolyBui beyond that it is not right to go, and the chief reason is that the State in its guiding power, the Legislature, is of a comparatively low intellectual level. As an organization it does not express the individual intelligence of its component members. level of every deliberative assembly, if we may trust men like Lambroso and others, is lower than that of the individuals who compose it. thing as the madness of popular assemblies. Buckle, to whom I have already referred, mentions that the history of every civilized country is the history of its intellectual development, which kings, statesmen, and legislators are more likely to retard than hasten. Almost every Empire of modern times, from the Roman to the Spanish, went down through the corruption or folly of its Legislature. I say, therefore, that except where monoply is clear, we must distrust the capacity of the legislative machine. Let us take,. for instance, the Socialist Marx, and the quotation I shall read shows how many mistakes may be made in the endeavour by Utopian methods to carry out a principle acknowledged to be moral. In dealing with Liberals, whose policy was somewhat analogous to what is best in the policy of modern Radicals, he saysAlthough the Liberals have not yet carried out their principles in any land as yet completely, still the attempts -which have been made are suffidirect our intellects and morals. I decline cient to prove the uselessness of their efforts. They endeavoured to free labour, but only succeeded in subjecting it more completely under the yoke of capitalism; they aimed at setting at liberty all labour powers, and only riveted the chains of misery which held them bound; they wanted to release the bondman from the clod, and deprive him of the soil on which he stood by buying up the land. They yearned for a happy condition of society, and only created superfluity on one hand, and dire want on the other; they desired to secure for merit its own honourable reward, and only made it the slave of wealth; they wanted to abolish all monopolies, and place in their stead the monster monopoly, capital; they wanted to do away with all wars between nation and nation, and kindled the flames of civil war; they wanted to get rid of the State, and yet have multiplied its burdens; they wanted to make education the common property of all, and made it the privilege of the rich; they aimed at the greatest moral improvement of society, and only left it in a state of rotten immorality; they wanted, to say all in a wotd, unbounded liberty, and have produced the meanest servitude; they wanted the reverse of all that which they actually obtained, and have thus given a proof that liberalism in all its ramifications is nothing but a perfect Utopia. That is a condemnation of the methods of some of the most logical minds of the times, teaching us again humility in our empirical legislation. MightI refer, On the danger of trusting to the omnipotence of legislators, to the Federalist, one of.the great organs of Federation in America? Speaking of the legislators down to 1787, it saysTbeI t may be affirmed, on the best grounds, that no small share of the present embarrassments of America is to be charged to the blunders of our Governments; and that they have proceeded from the heads rather than the hearts of most of them. There is, he said, such a What indeed are all the repealing, explaining and amending laws which fill and disgrace our voluminous codes, but so many monuments of deficient wisdom, so many impeachments exhibited by each succeeding against each preceding session, so many admonitions to the people of the value of those aids which may be expected from a well constituted Senate? But we are told by Foster in his recent work on the American Constitution, that the chief advantage of the Senate is to stop the mischievous measures of the House of Representatives. Should it not teach us modesty in our experiments, when we learn that in almost every case in America where the States have changed their Constitutions, they have made elaborate provision for checks upon legislative folly, whether by the referendum or otherwise, and also when we are told by Bryce that the Governor is appointed to watch and check the legislators as a cat watches a mouse? I decline to accept this legislative machine as one to to allow it to obtrude its ineffectiveness into every sphere of our industrial and social life, to endeavour to lay down, as if with the eye of omniscience, the lines and scope of development of a civilization which, where ever it has been stable and sound, has been the result of a growth for generations, and of unconscious adaptation and sustained evolution. Considering the record of mistakes that legislators have made, we ought to keep the State to its true province, which is to destroy monopoly, to afford to all equal opportunity, arid to leave to private enterprise, to individual intelligence and",51,Honourable Members Hear Hear

The House was constituted by the electors ' into three paities, which, as we know, were practically equal. however, seemed to think that such a state of affairs was absolutely fatal to the administration of responsible government under our Constitution. the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, in a speech he made before the House met, declared as a fundamental principle, that we must have two parties. Those who stood as members of each of the three parties took up a certain attitude with respect to their constituents when they were elected, and now it is sought by artificial means to try to compel honourable members who have found themselves bound by certain pledges to range themselves in two parties. tain extent has been successful, and the result is that during the last few days we have had a series of recriminations and attacks made upon persons for trying to adapt themselves to the conditions of two parties. Honourable members seem to think that two-party Government was a magnificent thing so long as they had two of the opposite parties sitting on one side of the House. But a number of honourable members find that by reason of the _ pledges and promises they gave they cannot adapt themselves to the position of sitting behind the right honourable member for East Sydney. been inclined to express the belief that the present state of the House indicates a certain weakness in the Constitution. I for one do not share that opinion in the slightest degree. That great instrument of government which was created by the people of this Continent is as stable and solid a piece of governmental legislation as was ever devised by any intelligent people. We have a Constitution giving us ample powers of legislation, and conveying to us splendid powers of administration. wanted in the Commonwealth is a party with confidence in the powers of government conveyed in the Constitution, and prepared to frame and stand by a policy on good strong national lines. out Australia 'spoke in favour of such a policy, as I think I shall be able to show. However, the issue before us to-night is a simple one, and it is whether or not the Administration which has been formed by the right honourable member for East Sydney commands' the confidence of the Hquse. I am not desirous of making any personal remarks during my speech. The Prime Minister seems to think that our feeling towards him is very much like that of Certain honourable members, the son-in-law, who on receiving a telegram informing him that his mother-in-law was dead, and asking whether she was to be embalmed, and buried, or cremated, wired We know that back. "" Do all three, lest there should be any mistake."" I can assure the right honourable gentleman that that is not the feeling which is entertained for him by honourable members on this side of the House. He has declaimed as strongly as did the honourable and learned member for Ballarat that we should have two parties in the House, that we should have party government, that we should go back to those great principles of responsible government The attempt to a cerunder which Great Britain became what she is. Andi f . as a result of his efforts, honourable members find themselves ranged on each side, I am perfectly sure that he will allow us that same right of conscience which he has claimed-that he will not continue the line of remark which he employed in Adelaide the other dav, when he said that the alliance on this side savours of office-seeking. gentleman's alliance did savour of officeseeking-and he says that all alliances doI can assure him that on this side that is Honourable members have also not the intention of the alliance. after office !

We can imagine the rejoicings which will take place across the seas when Mr Chamberlain receives a telegram'informing him that the right honourable gentleman has been appointed a member of the Imperial Conference to advocate preferential trade for Australia. These are possibilities which appear to loom before us. The right honourable gentleman at the elections was hopelessly beaten on every issue. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat had a clear constructive policy. His answer was, ""My native Throughout the Convention, and ever since, he has believed in the Constitution. He knows the gieat powers which the nation possesses under it, and he went before the electors with a policy which he believed would do something to build up industries in Australia. He recognised that the first Federal Parliament, although there were three parties in the House, had laid a great many splendid foundation stones. That Parliament passed machinery measures, none of which have yet been subjected to serious criticism"". It established a White Australia, enacted an excellent Electoral Act, with a splendid franchise, instituted a Federal Judiciary, framed a Tariff, and passed the legislation necessary for the proper administration of the great Departments of the Commonwealth.

He also believed in preferential trade, and he stood up for it. I suppose that no finer speeches were' ever delivered in Queensland than those of the honourable and learned member upon the subject of preferential trade.

He believed that we should stand by the existing Tariff, and the majority of the people of Australia agreed with him in the view that he put forward. He argued for fiscal peace, not as the mere suspension of the Tariff. He regarded the issue as being not between fiscal peace and fiscal war, but between national trade and foreign trade, between preferential trade and the rejection of the offers -made to us. Protection, in his view, did not mean the mere collection of duties at the Custom House, but an attitude of mind favorable to legislation in the direction of building up industries upon a firm basis, establishing satisfactory conditions between employer and employed, and providing that all persons in the community should receive fair remuneration for their services. He expressed his reliance in our magnificent resources. He pointed to the fact that we had groat deposits of minerals scattered throughout the Commonwealth, and an almost unlimited area of agricultural land, and the question, to his mind, was how we were to secure the best results, and obtain the best conditions for our people. Now, on the other hand, the Prime Minister's idea is that we should repeal all the Customs. duties, and let everything come about spontaneously. Perhaps he also leans to the view expressed by the honoiable member for Lang, who thinks that the standard of intelligence can be raised, ancl improved conditions can be secured by imposing a land tax-that all the blessings that we could desire would flow from the imposition of suGh a tax. The constructive clement characterized the whole of the policy of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. He said we must, first of all, ascertain how we could give the 2 people of the Commonwealth a market for their produce, and he indicated preferential trade as one of the means. Then he advocated the establishment of a Department within the Commonwealth, by means of which those engaged in the producing industries might be so guided that they would be enabled to secure the best results from their efforts. That led up to the idea of establishing a Department of Agriculture. He also considered it necessary to assist our pioducers by obtaining information with regard to markets across the seas, and with that end in view he pressed for the appointment of a High Commissioner. He believed ment, but wished to avoid industrial strife, and, therefore, proposed that protection should be afforded to the workers by means of a Conciliation and Arbitration B ill . His was essentially a constructive policy, whereas that of the Prime Minister is entirely destitute of that element. learned member deserted his leader in favour of the honourable and learned member -Sori n d i. gentleman held the same views as does the honourable and learned member for Indi he might be worthy to lead even the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. ITe honourable and learned member for Indi can claim that he has consistently stood up for his principles right through the piece. He has fought the fight from the beginning, and has no reason to be ashamed of the results. He has stood up for his principles, whilst many of those who should have supported him have arrayed themselves against him, and he has emerged from the struggle triumphant. We have no reason to be ashamed to sit. behind' him, 01 to be afraid to follow him, because his record in this House has been one of honour. Reverting to the policy of the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, I would point out that he believed that we should initiate an immigration policy, that we should encourage the development of our iron industry, that we should assist our producers by means of bonuses, and that we should pass a Navigation Bill to protect the seamen and others engaged in trading along our coasts. He also believed in the Western Australian railway.

That question had reference to the inclusion of States servants within the scope of the Bill. The honourable and learned member for Ballarat was entitled to take up the attitude he assumed upon that question, but 1 think that he made a mistake, and that subsequent events have proved it. so. there was only one point of difference between the two parties at that tune to prevent the House from carrying on business, and passing a number of the leading measures advocated by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. But, owing to the action of the Free-trade Party, the will of the people has been absolutely frustrated, and after a good deal of political engineering, the Free-trade Party have taken possession of the Treasury bench. After six months of inactivity, brought about by their action, we are here to-day. We are not following their bad example. We held that as soon as we found ourselves face to face with a Government policy with which we could not agree, we should, instead of blocking business, and intriguing, and whittling away this amendment, and that amendment, come straight out into the open, and say, "" We cannot support you. If you have a majority, show it by your numbers, and then proceed to deal with the legislation required by the country."" Why did not the Prime Minister take up that position ? If , when the House met six months ago, the right honourable gentleman thought he could Command the confidence of the House, why did he not table a motion of want of confidence, and show exactly what his strength was? Instead of that, he allowed legislation to go on, and amendment after amendment to be moved, so as to block legislation, and eventually endeavoured to remove the Ministry from the Treasury bench by a subterfuge. I think that the actions of the right honourable gentleman have been such that this House should condemn them in anticipation of the displeasure of the electors which will be visited upon him when he meets them. a few words as to the means adopted by the right honourable gentleman to obtain power. When the honourable and learned member for Ballarat met the House, he 2<s knew that there was trouble ahead in connection with the provision for including the public servants of the States within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. learned member for Indi was with him. "" orable gentleman, then. I am not denying that the honourable and learned member for Indi was following the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and I wish the right honourable gentleman would confine himself to relevant interjections. The then Prime Minister proceeded with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and was met by an adverse vote. What position did the present Prime Minister take up with regard to that very important question? whilst the honourable and learned member did not, and would not do so if he had a chance. is the view which the Prime Minister then expressedSo far as I am concerned, I say I most unhesitatingly adopt the attitude which the Government has assumed on this question. I have an absolutely clear view-it may be mistaken, but it is absolutely clear-that any such course as is now proposed would be a breach of the Constitution, and would be a seriousa most serious -assaul t on the integrity of a national compact in its most vital provisions. The honourable and learned member for Indi' entertained a somewhat similar view in that whilst he confessed that he was uncertain as to the constitutionality of the provision, he had no doubts as to its expediency. The present Prime Minister upon that occasion saidI feel, and I wish my position at the present time to be one of absolute clearness, that, if I were in the position of Prime Minister to-morrow, I should just as fearlessly and resolutely, to the very last, take up the position which has been taken-up. He said that he would resolutely take up that position and maintain it to the very last. Where is he now? Why, he is advocating the Bill now with the clause he condemned in it.

If he desires to save himself from the imputation of mere faction, he must endeavour to set up in its place a better Government. Then, upon page 552, he saysWe thus arrive at a further check. Since the Queen's Government must be carried on, those persons who have overthrown one Administration must be prepared to provide a substitute. From the nature of the case they must, in doing so, be subject to unsparing criticism. Thus, if the Ministry be responsible, an equal responsibility rests with the Opposition.

Here was an important provision which the present Prime Minister ancl the honourable and learned member for Ballarat had contended was of vital importance to the States. They urged that it struck at the very foundations of the Federal compact. The party upon this side of the House disagreed with them. They held that it was in their power to insert the provision in question, and they exercised that power in the interests of good government. How many free-traders sat upon this side of the Chamber then ? I think there were some fifteen or sixteen. Those honourable members, upon a matter -which it was argued involved the whole Constitution, were prepared to overthrow the Deakin Administration. learned member give credit to those who voted for their principles? orable members voted according to their consciences, but others deliberately voted to displace the Deakin Government. upon those who voted according to their consciences. ister declared that the honourable member for Bland, in accepting office, acted unconstitutionally. constitutional authority to show that the duty was cast, not only upon the honourable member, but upon those who assisted to displace the Deakin Administration, of seeing that responsible government was carried on. Honourable members opposite talk about responsible government, but do not cite authorities in support of their statements. We all know that the Watson Administration carried on for about three and a 'half months, and that members of the two parties, led by the present Prime Minister and the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, sat upon the Opposition side of the House. It was not long, however, before it became patent to everybody that there were forces at work which were extremely hostile to the Government, and to the particular piece of legislation to which every party was pledged. Whenever an opportunity presented itself of whittling away the powers conferred by the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, it was eagerly grasped. I do not find fault with honourable members for so acting, but I say that it was remarkable that a great many who were keen advocates of industrial arbitration quickly began to see that the foundations upon which they originally rested were of a very weak and untenable nature. learned member voted against the Bill. tain amendments upon some occasions. I did my best to give effect to the wishes of this House. In the interests of industrial peace, I desired to see an arbitration law placed upon our statute book. I repeat that parties began to manifest their presence in this House, and certain honourable members of the section led by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat were found constantly acting with members of the Free-trade Party. By association, I suppose, their ideas beW ill not the honourable and came assimilated, and that condition, perhaps, constituted the beginning of the coalition between the two great parties, 'which the honourable and learned member for Ballarat was so anxious to establish.

The honourable and learned member for Bendigo and the honourable member for The present Prime MinMoira, two as true democrats as are to be found in this House, from time to time voted with the free-traders.

Is it because he is not sitting behind the Government? The Watson Administration, I repeat, were defeated upon an amendment which was moved by the honourable and learned member for Corinella. That amendment was really a test one, and one which divided the parties in this House upon the true principles of legislation. elected to pass an industrial Arbitration Bill. Was it to be a mockery and a sham, or a piece of legislation which would give effect to the wishes of the people who sent .us here? It was intended that it should' promote industrial peace. It was not to be a Bill passed purely in the interests of either the employers or the employees. The public were to receive first consideration, because a strike falls more severely ""upon the people than it does upon -the parties who are immediately concerned in it. The electors sent us here to enact a law which would provide that strikes should cease, and that a Court of Arbitration should be used for the settlement of industrial disputes. Some honourable members urge that we should have only voluntary arbitration. They do not believe in compulsion. That is a logical position to take up. But I say that when we come to deal with compulsory industrial arbitration, the Court, when once constituted, should have the same liberty of action as is. possessed by a voluntary arbitration board, when it undertakes to settle a dispute. What is the present position? trade unions. Those organizations are faced by employers' associations. We know that disputes of many kinds can arise between them, but one of the ""most fertile sources of dispute is to be found in preference to unionists. That question is one which may be left to a voluntary board of conciliation and arbitration. I wish now to refer to a passage from Mitchell's Organised Labour, dealing with these unions. It readsThe British textile workers insist upon the emCourt will have to consider all the terms ployment of union men only; but, in this and in other trades, the exclusion has become so comand conditions surrounding an industry, plete that it has almost ceased to be felt. A and then to determine whether or not preunion card is a matter of course, and a matter of absolute necessity to a man desiring to engage in many British trades, and membership in a union is considered a privilege and not a burden. least twenty agreements granting preference have been voluntarily arrived at. States the position which the unions take up is that for arbitration to be effective the unions must have preference right through. I am not saying that I favour that position. I am simply pointing out existing facts; and from the statements made by Mr Mitchell himself in this book, it is clear that in England preference to unionists is a principle that is readily adHonorable members were mitted by very many persons connected with industry. To create an Arbitration Court, and not give it the power to grant a preference to unionists, is really to deprive the men belonging to those unions of a right which they have at the present time. It is a right which is clearly admitted in law, that people can combine and refuse to work with any person if they choose to do so. There is no dispute about that. Whether they are morally justified in giving effect to that principle is quite another question. But when you come to take away from men their right to settle disputes by the old method of voluntary arbitration, I say that whatever disputes they can submit to a voluntary arbitration board, ought to be capable of being submitted to the compplsory Arbitration Court. The Conciliation and Arbitration Bill merely allows that; and, as it was introduced by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, it gave the Court, in any dispute arising between employers and employed as to whether preference should be granted, the right to decide that question for itself. I found when I was over in New South We have a number of organized Wales that, owing to the remarks made in this House, many people there believed that the Court to be established under the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill would be bound to give a preference to unionists. That is an absolute misrepresentation. The Court will have only a discretionary power. presentation. tation was wilful or not I do not know, but the power proposed to be granted by the Bill is purely a discretionary one.

617,Mr Groom,"Whethe r the misrepresenference to unionists shall be granted. It is well known that in many voluntary agreements, which have been registered, preference was readily granted. I do not hesitate to say that, personally, I do not like the preference provision. But I can conceive of cases in which preference ought to be granted. I therefore believe that it is only right and just-seein g that at the present time such a preference can be given under a voluntary agreement-that we should not tie the hands of the Judge but allow him to give the same judgment as can be given by a voluntary arbitration board. Take, for instance, the great shearers' strike which occurred in Queensland some years ago. Honourable members know the terrible confusion that existed in our great State in consequence of that dispute. They know of the sufferings that the people had to endure in consequence of it, and they are aware of the class hatred that sprung up, and which is still rankling in the minds of the parties to that strike. What was the cause of it? The shearers made a claim to have their unions recognised. The squatters turned round and said, "" We claim the right to employ whom we please."" The shearers asked for a conference, but the squatters said, ""No, we will not have any conference on any conditions."" That was the essence of the dispute. shearers to give up their right to speak as a union. strike threw the whole community into confusion. Would not honourable members give the Court appointed to decide disputes of that kind the right to decide whether preference should be given to unionists? Is it not better that the Court should have such power than that the community should be subjected to a loss of tens of thousands of pounds, that bitterness should be stirred up to such an extent that the military should have to be called out, and that almost a state of revolution should be produced ? I am not taking the part of either the shearers or the squatters, although I think that the shearers' demand for a conference ought to have been conceded, because by means of free discussion a public conscience is aioused. which sooner or later is brought to bear upon the parties to a dispute. The late Government was defeated upon an amendment moved by the Minister of Defence. I must confess that, of the two amendments then before the House, there is not the slightest doubt that that proposed by the then Ministry was infinitely better than the amendment of the Minister of Defence. I am not prepared to say that if even the amendment of the Government had been considered in a fair and impartial way, something better might not have been devised. But what I do claim is that honourable members opposite took up a rigid attitude, and refused to allow the late Government the courtesy of an opportunity to submit a further amendment. It may be urged that there have been other cases in which the House has refused to recommit, but I do not know of any case where this House as a House wilfully and deliberately took the business out of the hands of the Ministry expressly for the purpose of humiliating them. There has been no precedent in this House for such a course as that. Honourable members who wished to bring about a change of Ministry were no doubt perfectly justified in adopting that attitude. Some honourable members voted against the recommital be* cause they wished to take the control of affairs out of the hands of the late Government. The right honourable member for East Sydney certainly was not enamoured of them, because, he was constantly reported to be going about with a no-confidence motion in his pocket, which was always to be moved "" next day."" That"" next' day "" was never reached, but he was evidently prepared to take advantage of any opportunity to turn out the Government. "" I say again that the amendment prepared by the late Government was far better than the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella, which provided that preference should only be granted to unionists if in the opinion of the Judge a majority of the persons affected in the industry who had interests in common were in favour of that preference. that a majority of the persons affected by an award, and having interests in common, must be in favour of preference being granted. A man has to go into Court' and make, his application. Before he went into Court at all, what evidence would he have to submit? He would have to submit the evidence of the majority of the persons who were affected by an award. Who are the persons affected by an award ? Are they only the persons who are immediately 'affected?

621,Mr Groom,"The purport of it wasthey the persons who alone are interested in tlie award? The terms of the provision are uncertain, but still more uncertain is the ""opinion of the Court"" concerning the majority of the persons affected. No man would care to go into Court until he had the strongest possible evidence-ob tained quite possibly by a ballot of the unionists affected, as well as of the non-unionists-in order to get the decision of the Court in favour of preference. When we consider that we are-dealing, not with matters in connection with some little area under a Factories Act, but with the whole of the vast continent of Australia, what would be the meaning of ""opinion of the Court,"" under a vague and illusive term like that used in the amendment of the honourable and learned member foi Corinella? Because it must be remembered that it is only a matter of the opinion of the Judge. It is a question as to which there could be no appeal from his decision. It is purely a matter of opinion. If in the Judge's opinion there was a majority, preference might be given. As a rule,' a Judge, seeing this language used in an Act of Parliament, would say"" It is the intention of the Legislature that I must be satisfied in my own mind that there is a majority."" That opinion would have to be formed on what kind of evidence? It is quite true that the Judge could act upon any evidence. The good conscience clause comes in there. But no matter whether it was hearsay evidence or written evidence, the Judge would require that it should be very strong indeed, and I am quite clear that he would almost certainly ask for statistics concerning the persons engaged .in the industries affected in the Commonwealth. Imagine the difficulty of getting those statisnever come before the Court, and there was tics concerning all the persons who might be interested in an award in this Commonwealth? The whole thing is impracticable and unworkable. Mi.

Yet we find him and his colleagues still sitting there. istry, after such declarations, would sit in office and support a Bill containing such clauses. those provisions. correct, the attitude of honourable members opposite is just the same. But the attitude of the alliance is clearly this-that we are quite prepared -to take the Bill back into Committee, and have a free discussion upon it. The alliance will never object to a free discussion upon any clause in any Bill. The other proposal before the House was as to whether the amendment indicated by the honourable member for Bland should be accepted. I say that that amendment was essentially a judicious and a wise one. It was a wise amendment, for this reason-that it was no mere empirical legislation; it was not an impracticable idea sprung upon the House,' but an amendment based upon the experience of the working of the Arbitration Act in New South Wales. It has proved, in common practice, to work out well. There have tice Cohen said that there had been some complaints in the newspapers, but they had no substantial evidence submitted to him as to its unsatisfactorines's. I say, therefore, that it was a workable amendment based on experience, and one which the House might have done the late Prime Minister the courtesy to consider. But it is evident that advantage was taken of the opportunity to "" clown "" the late Ministry. The present Prime Minister did not move a no confidence motion, because there was a belief that such a motion, if submitted by him would notsucceed. However, the effect was just the same. The Watson Government went out of office, and we then had brought into being the present Administration. It has been said that our alliance on this side was formed in a holeand-corner sort of way, and without due consideration with our colleagues.",63,Honourable Members Hear Hear

The first I heard of any alliance being proposed or suggested was when we were forced to take some steps by reason of certain honourable members of the party enrolling themselves under the free-trade banner. In view of the deep interests of the people of the Commonwealth involved in the proper exercise of the powers given us under the Constitution, we felt we were bound to come together to resist what promised to be a conservative alliance. When we saw honourable gentlemen taking office contrary to their own agreement, what other course was open to us but to see whether something could not be done to check what was in progress? a meeting of the party ? the party was called, and it would have been but a proper proceeding if , before any member of our party took office, he had approached our late leader and suggested to him that the party should meet in order to discuss the situation. orable and learned member know that that was not done? done, because no such meeting was called blast-the round-robin? there was a round-robin, signed by fourteen members of the party, before a single thing had been done on this side in the way of forming an alliance.

I regret that a good democrat like my friend the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is not here, where he ought to' be, helping me. However, the position is that there has been clearly expressed by the people of the Commonwealth a belief in democratic legislation. They have expressed the belief that' we should exercise the powers of the Constitution, in accordance with the democratic policies' which have been announced.

We know that part of that is quite incorrect, because we have approached this party On terms of equality and of mutual recognition of our respective parties, and we have formed an alliance which I believe will be found to be for the good' of the Commonwealth, to be practicable, and, to some extent, permanent. Opposition to that party is the sole connecting bond with honourable members opposite. from their agreementIt is neither desirable nor necessary to make any other question the subject of a binding party agreement outside the Legislative Chambers, in which members should always be, as far as possible, free to deal with proposals on their merits. There is to be -no cohesion amongst thern. The honourable member for Lang is to be still at liberty to advocate his land tax, and to propose that we should heavily tax the farmers in the Richmond district. hope that when the honourable: member for Richmond sets out on his election campaign he will take the honourable member for Lang with him, to explain to the farmers the virtue of a land tax. Perhaps he will also get the honourable members for Parramatta and New England to assist him. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -O r the honourable member for Barrier. member for Canobolas. member for Parramatta goes to address his constituency, and to advocate democratic legislation, he will, no doubt, be attended by the honourable and learned member for Parkes, who will stand out strongly for arbitration and conciliation, and who will probably tell tbe electors that he believes that the general trend now is towards Socialism. On the great question of preferential trade, we may have the two heads Of the Ministry on the same platform. The honourable member for Gippsland may say "" Yes"" to those on one side of the platform, while the right honourable member for East Sydney says "" No"" to those On the other side. The free-traders may be told to get behind this screen, while the protectionists get behind that, and they will be given anything they ask. Ministers will be able to Say to them, ""You can get anything you like, gentlemen. There is nothing vital in 8 u 2 2 our programme. We shall give a land tax to those who believe in it, and industrial arbitration to those who believe in it ; and we are prepared to give an iron bonus to the honourable member,for Eden-Monaro, although we do not ourselves advocate anything of the kind."" The right honourable member for East Sydney may denounce the proposal, and then say "" I have spoken. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro will follow me, and will explain the virtues of this proposal."" What is the position in which honourable members opposite find themselves under That is very clear their agreement. They have clearly only one policy at the present time, and that is to get into recess. Tfien we come to a most important question. The Prime Minister will not condemn Socialism. That would never do.. The right honourable gentleman believes in a modified Socialism; he disagrees with extreme Socialism. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Ho w far does the honourable and learned member go? I position, but at present I am not being attackedI am attacking. The Prime Minister defines the matter in this wayHis ideal was to use the national power in every conceivable way to advance the happiness and welfare of the whole community, and this second ideal was to leave individual energies and powers of the members of the community as free as they could consistently with proper national legislation. This mistake of the Socialist was that he went to a suicidal extreme, but he did not condemn the Socialist if he would confine his projects within proper limits. The honourable and learned member for Angas did not go to the socialistic extreme, but confined his Socialism within proper limits. This is an interesting part of the Prime Minister's statementAs far as any exercise of the power of government or legislation was concerned, he stood for no dogma at all. It is true he stands for no dogma at all, so far as Government legislation is concerned. We can now, to some extent, understand the right honourable gentleman's ""Yes-No"" attitude. Referring to the coalition, I should like honourable members who are protectionists, to consider the arrangements which the right honourable gentleman made with the Labour Party, because I think we ought to judge the Prime Minister by his own utterances.

The Prime Minister has condemned free traders in Queensland for not raising the fiscal issue, and for laising a dispute between the classes and the masses. when we refer to his programme we find that in many respects it is almost the same as that of the National Liberal Union, which raised the issues in respect of which he spoke. He has opened a war between the classes and the masses. He on that side is leading the classes while we on this side are standing for the masses.

First of all, he voted against preference to unionists. He used some very strong language on the subject.As I said on the second reading, there is a greater violation done in this Bill to the individual as they think fit. That is the posiliberties and rights of citizens of a civilized country than I know of in any other legislation in the British Empire. He was then speaking, not of the modified preference to unionists, but of the principle of preference to unionists. Again, when the question of political unions came up, he said he did not believe in political unions even being entitled to register under the Act. We remember in what scathing terms he denounced political unions. union were formed for industrial purposes only, and yet we find now that the clause is in the Bill which allows political unions to register, but will not allow them to have a preference. Again, he accepted the provision in regard to the inclusion of State servants. ever see such a "" swallowing "" policy as this ? Here are three matters which he mentioned as absolutely vital-preferenc e to unionists, which was a piece of legislation practically unknown to the Empire; political unions, which was a gross abuse and attempt to use the judicial machinery for party purposes; and the inclusion ot State servants, which was absolutely unconstitutional. He comes in now, and says he is quite prepared to accept the Bill with all those three provisions. He was very vigorous in opposition, when he was on this side, but now that he is on the other side he says, in effect, "" Oh, I am so complaisant that I am prepared to adopt anything you like to put in. So long as you wiil allow me to sit here, I shall let you pass anvthing you want."" Mr G. B. EDWARDS -That is the attitude of other honourable members. of responsible government under our Constitution ! The Prime Minister says the High Commissioner Bill is to be postponed. He will adopt the proposal for the survey of the Transcontinental Railway, even as proposed by the Labour Government. The Naviga> tion Bill was introduced by the Labour Government, and referred to a Royal Commission, and, therefore, he will accept the measure. The Papua Bill contains some clauses in respect of non-alienation, which he does not like, and he will accept that too. He will also take the Trade Marks Bill. He is willing to negotiate under the Seat of Government Act. But in regard to the Iron Bonus Bill, at last his back stiffens, and he is going to be firm. The Government will not take charge of the Bill, but will allow a private member to do so, and when a division is taken Ministers will vote tion in this National Parliament, where we have only laid, as it were, the foundation stones of a great edifice. People are waiting expectantly to see on what lines this great Commonwealth is to develop. They ask 'for a policy. For over three years the right honourable gentleman has been criticising the administration of affairs. He has told us that he has a scheme for developing the Commonwealth, that he can set things right, He did not mind if a and restore public confidence. Now that he has come into power, what does he do? He has adopted a few of the minor measures introduced by his predecessors, and is willing to swallow anything, so long as he is allowed to stay there. He offers no single piece of original legislation to the Did honourable members people. He says to them, "" Parliament has been in session for six months, and has done nothing; therefore let it do nothing more, but go into recess."" Who was responsible for displacing the Deakin and Watson Administrations? Was it not the right honourable gentleman who now wishes to do nothing but get into recess? That is his first and only plan. There are other important matters with which I should like to deal, but I feel that the hour is getting late. We have sought from this coalition a justification for its formation, but what justification have we got? Not a single member of it has been able 10 justify it. A ll that has been done has been to attack the alliance; and particularly the members of it who sit in this corner. Why are we so bitterly attacked? If three or four of us were to transfer our allegiance to the.other side we should be perfectly safe; but because we do not do so we are subjected to all sorts of attacks and ridicule. During the whole debate honourable members opposite have tried to ridicule the terms of the alliance; but we are not ashamed or aft aid of their attacks, which have left us unscathed. afraid. breaking my pledges to my constituents, though I have not done so.

686,Mr Groom,"I have been attacked forfiscal peace; but that does not mean the absolute cessation of legislation. In Queensland the great sugar question remains to be dealt with. To show the attitude of some of the Queensland people on that subject, I will read the following extract from the National Liberal programme. Speaking of the sugar bounty., they sayWe do not propose to alter this law at the present qn foot which would bring in more' retime. In view, however, of the fact that the period allotted for the test is too short to enable it to be effectively made, we advocate an extension of the period for the payment of the bonus. If the bonus is not maintained, then the industry .will languish, and the employment of white men in the sugar industry, and in other industries dependent upon the production of sugar will be very limited. The Act expires on the ist January, 1907, during the currency of the present Parliament. prevent us from dealing with that important question, which strikes at the root of an industry which gives employment to thousands of people, and, according to present indications, appears likely to be one of the greatest and imost profitable industries in the Commonwealth? It would be monstrous to say that, because the people have declared that the time of this Parliament shall not be taken up with Tariff details, that important question is not to be dealt with. The sugar bounty is paid out of the excise duty on sugar. AlthoughI believe in a fiscal truce, if it be shown that persons are famishing for. want . of employment, that industries are being sacrificed, and capital is going out of use. I think that Parliament should give such remedy as an investigation into the matter suggests. I state that on the ground of pure humanity, and I do not fear the effect of such action on my constituents. I was elected without opposition, and. did not address a meeting before the election. I promised the then Prime Minister a general support. Beyond that I gave no pledges to my constituents; but referring to this matter afterwards 1 saidI would vote for all those duties which would protect existing industries and tend to the developso complacent that they have found a new ment of the magnificent resources of Australia. I spoke on those lines, and voted on those lines, and if the matter comes up again I shall continue to fight on those lines, because I have faith in this Continent. I have faith in the young men and women who are natives of this Continent, as well as in our fathers who are working equally well for the development and advancement of the Continent. Now that we have an instrument of Government which gives us the powers of a nation, it would be wrong of us not to exercise our powers to buifd up our strength, so that in time of need we can stand by the mother country. That was a clear and definite statement. I believe that the people of Queensland do not wish the Tariff to be re-opened. The finances of no State have suffered more under Federation than have those of Queensland, and if there were a movement venue to the States, the people of Queensland would be glad of it. It is unfortunate that the financial provisions of the Constitution are inextricably interwoven with the finances of the States, and that the present revenue Tariff is every year tending to decrease the Queensland revenue. "" Last year there was a cpnsiderable falling off. and apparently this year Queensland will suffer a further loss of at least Will fiscal peace £70,000. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -The higher the duties, the more Queensland will suffer. leader voted against the tea duty, which, unfortunately for Queensland, was not agreed to. For these reasons, the Commonwealth is restricted in its public works expenditure, because it is afraid that by reducing their revenue it may cause trouble and confusion to the States. But, although a larger revenue would be welcome to Queensland, a continual tinkering with the Tariff, and a perpetual alteration of the incidence of its duties, would undoubtedly cause confusion to the States Treasurers, because they could not properly estimate what was coming to them. The Prime Minister, however, did not accept the proposal for a fiscal peace, and now he calls it a fiscal truce, because he knows that a truce is merely a cessation of warfare, and he is ready, when the session is closed, to fight for free-trade again. A l ready the alliance has done a wonderful amount of conversion. A Select Committee was suggested by this side of the House for the investigation of the operations of the Tariff in regard to such industries as the House might specify, and the proposal was spoken of as a breach of faith. But now those who sit behind the Government are plank for their platform, and are prepared to give us a Tariff Commission. the honourable member for Laanecoorie are prepared to give immediate relief.

Edwards',"The Watson Goin Austialia, from workers in the factories to those in the counting-houses, from the occupants of shepherds' huts to residents in Toorak mansions, when I say that no Parliament in Australia has had so poor a record as this the second Parliament of the Commonwealth. We are wasting our time in juseless discussion, and ignoring the duty that we owe to the public. The small consideration which honourable members are exhibiting for the best interests of the people is really shameful. It is now proposed byhonorable members opposite to place an additional burden upon the people by involving them in the unnecessary expenditure of ,£50,000 or ,£60,000 upon a general election. Who wants a general election? I do not think that any honourable member on this side of the House has any such desire, and I am confident that not one honourable member on the other side wishes to go to the country. It is not so long ago since we had a general election, when most of us spent almost our last shilling in contesting our seats. We have had no time in the interval to save anything out of our ""starvation"" allowance. A dissolution at the present time would serve tbe purposes of only a few disappointed office-seekers, and would Involve the country in an additional expenditure at the rate of about ,£20,000 per annum for the next three years. consider that the motion is unwarranted. The business of the country, as we are all aware, has not progressed during the period that we have been in session. The speech of the leader of the Opposition, in submitting this motion, was an exceedingly poor effort, and I was greatly disappointed with it His utterances are usually of a very high standard, being full of life and enthusiasm, but upon' this occasion, his heart did not appear to be in his work, and thereto disturbing the fiscal peace now reached. The fore he contented himself with delivering a long lecture upon Socialism which he had to perform. duty which he had to discharge. We know that outside of this Parliament there are certain. organizations which compel the leader of the Opposition to play the part that he does, and which compel his suoporters to appear anxious to obtain a dissolution when in reality they do not desire it. lutely incorrect,and the honourable member knows it. hear that denial from the honourable member. I entertain the very highest regard for every member of the Labour Party, but I am speaking of them politically. I claim that they are prone to indulge in socialistic legislation. The honourable member for Bland utterly failed to assign a single reason why the Government do not possess the confidence of the House. to be personal. tempt to advance a single reason in support of the motion. He gave no explanation why the Labour Party had allied itself with a group of members who have nothing in common with its aims and aspirations. member say that, after hearing the speech which has just been delivered by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs? the speech of the leader of the Opposition. The malcontents, it is true, have made no secret of their determination to raise the fiscal issue, despite the fact that every honourable member had accepted the verdict of the country that the Tariff should remain unaltered, at least during the life of the preI sent Parliament. I claim that the honourable member for Bland cannot honestly assist in the raising of the fiscal issue, in view of the emphatic decision of the electors in December last. Honourable members are well acquainted with that verdict. The honourable member for Bland himself admitted that the present was not the time to disturb the existing Tariff. Speaking at Wagga on the 12th-September, he saidHe would not in any circumstances be a party Labour Party had been able to knock out a few taxes, which pressed heavily on the people, and in this way had reduced the revenue by a large amount. The proof of their prudence in cutting down the Tariff was found in the fact that, on examination, the Tariff, as adopted, would now appear to average about 15 per cent, all round. As it stood, it was a reasonable Tariff, and should be allowed to remain undisturbed. Again, on August 9, speaking as Prime Minister, he saidI believe there is no probability of any appeal for an alteration of the Tariff being responded to during this present Parliament. The people were assured at the last elections that it was desirable to have fiscal peace, at any rate for this Parliament, and I must say that I agree that it is desirable to have some rest from the eternal fight on the fiscal question.

I say that suffirately gauged, and the whole records were available for years, then I should say that there might be grave reason to inquire again into the conditions brought about by the Tariff. But we have not had time since the passing of the Tariff to get any clear idea of what its incidence will be in the future. I quite agree with that statement. Sufficient time has not been allowed to elapse since the Tariff .came into operation to warrant any alteration being made in it. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports is also reported to have saidWhile recognising this, he also recognised there was infinitely more to be gained by a period of rest than by re-opening the Tariff question. The protectionists were anxious to give the new Tariff a five years' trial, but that was what the free traders were afraid of. The honourable member could not have been very much in earnest at the time he made that statement, or else he must have made it with certain mental reservations. Otherwise he could scarcely have changed his views so rapidly. The honourable member for Hume, the honourable and learned member for Indi, and others, including myself, also declared that we would not be parties to disturbing the Tariff for some time to come. 1 hold that it is inconsistent and dishonourable for the honourable member for Bland to assist in bringing about fiscal strife with its necessary corollary, and dislocation of trade and commerce throughout the Commonwealth. Let us have fiscal peace and practical legislation. I am -sure that is the wish of those who have the best interests of the country at heart, as some honourable members will discover when they appear before the electors. The leader of the Opposition and his supporters have frequently complained that the Labour Ad-1 ministration did not receive fair play at the hands of honourable members on this side of the House. That statement is utterly incorrect. The fact is that the Watson Government could have been displaced during the very first week of its existence. It is well known that it never had a majority at its back. The Opposition, however, recognised that it was entitled to a fair trial, and I claim that during the period that it remained in office fair play was extended to it. The honourable member for Bland has also complained that the Prime Minister did not inform the House of the legislation which he proposes to bring forward nine months hence. Is it likely that any Prime Minister would indicate what his programme would be durMr R. Edwards. cient for the day is the evil thereof. The leader of the Opposition also urged that no mention was made in the Ministerial statementof policy of; an. old-age pensions scheme. While he was in power for four or live months he made no attempt to introduce old-age pensions. That should have been one of his first measures. member support it? was a feasible scheme. But we must see our way clear as to where the money is to come from. From that point of view, an old-age pension scheme cannot be hurriedly carried out. Is it not better, as the Prime Minister proposes, to consult with the States Governments as to the best way of raising the money? I understand that it would cost ;£i,000,000 or £1,500,000 per annum to pay anything like a moderate amount to the aged poor throughout the Commonwealth. must not quarrel with the States, but must recognise that this is a matter which will require their serious consideration. I shall certainly be prepared to support any feasible scheme for the maintenance of the aged poor. But we know that the policy of the Labour Party for raising money for old-age pensions is to impose a Federal land tax, which will cast additional burdens on the farmers. It is possible that the Labour Party may attempt to carry out a portion of Mr Tom Mann's socialistic policy to the extent of compelling the farmer to part with his land. That is one plank of the socialistic programme. I should like to quote what a working farmer has said with regard to taxing the farmers. It will be found in Hansard, page 2028, and is as follows:Mr Tom Mann is reported to have said, in answer to a question, that he would put such a tax on land as to make the farmers glad to get rid of it.

After many years of toil, the farmers of the heavy forest timber country of Gippsland and elsewhere, farmers of the Mallee, who have lost their all through the drought, and are still striving to make homes for their families, the backbone of the country, are told that they should be taxed off their homes.

716,Mr R. Edwards,"I say that noothers of his party, having experienced the sweets of office for a time, he is in a hurry to get back to the Treasury bench ? ber think that the party will get back, as the result of a dissolution ? but I can say that they will not get back if I can help it. I am satisfied that there will be no obstacle in the way of my coming back to the Federal Parliament, unless it be myself. I am opposed to a dissolution for many reasons, but if the House is determined to have a dissolution, let us by all means have it as soon as possible. No speeches which have been made since the motion was tabled, and no speeches yet to be made, will influence a single vote for or against it, and if a dissolution is desired, let us have it by all means as soon as possible, and squander the taxpayers money for no good purpose. I wish to emphasize the fact that honourable members on the other side, though they may not have signed the labour pledge, will in future be classed as labour members. They will be known in their true light, and it is right that they should be. I believe that every honourable member on the opposite side should sign the labour pledge, that the party opposite may become a compact body of Oppositionists. able members on the other side going to sign the monopoly pledge? pledges on this side. I sign no pledges for any man. I allow no man to influence me in any shape or form. I must be allowed freedom of action, and freedom to form my own opinion as to what is the right thing to do, even here in the Federal Parliament. I told the electors when I stood for Parliament, that if they wished me to come down here as a delegate, to do whatever might be wanted in the interests of a special class, I declined to come on those terms. I said that I must be allowed the free use of my own judgment and discretion as to what was best for the community as a whole. I will not encourage or support any class legislation. Our friends in the Opposition corner have entered into an alliance with the Labour Party. There are not many of them present to-night. They have run away j but I wish to say that they will have a poor chance of coming back here if a dissolution takes places. Honourable members who have joined with the Labour Party imagine that they will not be opposed at the general election. It is utter nonsense for them to I imagine anything of the kind, because the Trades Hall party must bring out a pledgebound candidate to oppose every other. It cannot help itself. Does the honourable member for Melbourne Ports or the honourable member for^Bourke believe that the workers' organizations have already forgotten what they said about them in December last ? forget, and that is perhaps a good feature. They make good friends and they make good foes. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports some little time ago saidI f he were returned lo the Federal Parliament it would be as a representative of the whole of the people, and not as a machine to be worked at the dictation of a small portion. If he did this (sign the labour pledge) he would be abrogating the fundamental principle of the Constitution by handing over to a few men, and a small section of the electors, the right to say whether or not he should be a candidate. The honourable member for Bourke was equally emphatic. He stated that he would not sign the pledge, and he further saidThe position was that some twenty or thirty personsa little clique at the Trades Hall-were to have the power to say whether they approved of a candidate, and if they did not approve of him he would have to stand down. Such things savoured of Tammany Hall and Russia. . . . The caucus did not allow any liberty; they must vote for the majority. They clamoured for the liberty of minorities, but they did not allow any liberty to their own minority. Now these two honourable members have fallen into the arms of the party which a few months ago they condemned in the strongest terms. It may be assumed that the labour organizations will prevent these two honourable members having a walk over. About three weeks ago Senator Dawson addressed one of the pleasant Sunday afternoon meetings. become customary for the Labour Party to have pleasant Sunday afternoon meetings. They are supposed to be semi-sacred meetings, but somehow they always glide into political meetings. Senator Dawson was addressing one of ""these meetings on the alliance of the Labour Party with the Liberal-Protectionists, and he defended the alliance. There was considerable opposition at the meeting, and I find the following in a report of the meeting, which appeared in the Age of 19th September :The Chairman (a member of the Fitzroy branch of the Political Labour League) took exception to the use by a number of the audience of the",75,Honourable Members Hear Hear

In a discussion which followed several of the audience expressed the view that the alliance threatened the fundamental principles of the Labour Party, ancl, therefore, was not justifiable. During the last election campaign I took it upon myself to say that the supporters of the.

He denounced in the strongest terms the alliance between the Labour Party and a few nondescript politicians. I admired his manliness and fearlessness when he saidI believe that this alliance is a mere pretence as he is ordered ? and no more-that it has never had any sound basis. The electors are likely to deal with the able member repeat that statement when he alliance, if there should be an election, in a way that I am certain will make it impossible for it is told that it is hot so? to exist in the next Parliament. It is not, to my mind, an arrangement of which any labour man honourable member for Perth was free to has any reason to be proud. I have exceedingly regretted the alliance, and have Opposed it, and express his opinions, still his vote is the will continue to oppose it. In doing that, I bepledged political property of the caucus. lieve that I am fulfilling a duty I owe to the electors who sent me here, and to the labour electors of the Commonwealth generally. That was a manly and straightforward speech, and such as might be expected to come from a man who was possessed of freedom of action, but it was spoiled by his concluding WordsI shall vote in support of the motion submitted by the leader of the Opposition. I admired his speech until he came to that point. He is willing, for party purposes, to vote contrary to his convictions, thus proving what has often been said in the House, that the members of the Labour Party have no freedom of action. It has been said here over and over again tha they have freedom of action equally with honourable members on this side, but'here is proof to the contrary in the action of the honourable member for Perth, who utterly condemned what was done on the I other side with regard to the alliance, and who must sacrifice his convictions in response to the demand of the majoritv ai a caucus meeting. member for Perth is in duty bound to vote in accordance with the decision arrived at by the majority of the caucus. has no foundation.

A proposal for such an alteration in our time of sitting, must be preceded by due notice to the House, and the suggestion was made at a time when it was impossible to carry it out. In connection with debates involving the position of the Government, the Ministry cannot act as it is often in a position to do when other matters of public business are being discussed, and bring pressure to bear on the House to shorten discussion. We have to allow every honourable member-and properly so. too-the fullest opportunity to express his opinions upon our administration. Both the leader of the Opposition and myself are anxious to do what we can to shorten the debate, and we had a consultation this morning to see if we could possibly bring it to a close this week. however, that a large number of honourable, members desired to address the House, and claimed the same right that had been conceded to-others, we came to the. conclusion that it would be impossible to close the debate this week; but we both hope that avote will be taken on Tuesday next, or on Wednesday at the latest.
