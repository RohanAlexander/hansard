The facts of the case are that this man is a gunner, and has been in the Army for five years and eleven months. He served in Africa, where he was wounded, and in New Guinea. He contracted malaria, and is now classified as B2. He is married, and his wife is in ill-health. On three occasions he has applied for his discharge, but his requests have been ignored. When I took up this matter with the Minister for the Army, I received the following reply:I regret to advise that as this man is on table. What is the position?

SEAT OF GOVERNMENT That leave be given to bring in a bill for an act to amend the Seat of Government Supreme Court Act 1933-1935. Bill presented, and read a first time. ter for Defence) [10.58] -by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. The object of the measure is to provide for the constitution of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory by a person who does not hold any other judicial office under the Commonwealth, and who can thus be available at all times for the hearing and decision of matters coming before the court. Under the act as it stands, the court must be constituted of a judge pf the Bankruptcy Court or of the Common-, wealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. Having regard to the large volume of business which those two courts are required to handle, it necessarily follows that the sittings of the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory must be so arranged as to interfere as little as possible with the hearing of the matters before the court of which the judge is primarily a member. Up to date, no cause for complaint on the ground of delay appears to have arisen; but, whilst the present arrangement has so far worked satisfactorily, it appears to the Government that the time is now opportune for the appointment of a judge whose first duty will be the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court. Accordingly, it is proposed that, instead of the judge of the Australian Capital Territory being a bankruptcy judge or a judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, power shall be given to appoint a person who is, or has been, a practising barrister or solicitor of not less than five years' standing. The qualification to be prescribed is similar to that provided in respect of judges of the Arbitration Court. It is recognized that, at the present time, the judge will not be fully occupied with the duties of his judicial office. The bill, therefore, provides that the judge may hold the office of Judge Advocate-General of any part of the defence force, or any other office, not of profit, which the Governor General may approve. It is confidently anticipated that the judge first to be appointed in accordance with the proposed provision will, pending the business of the court increasing to such degree as to demand the whole of his services, be able to give full and valuable service in other directions. In addition to performing the functions of Judge AdvocateGeneral of, say, the Army-for some time this position will make fairly heavy demands on his time-h e will be available to make inquiries on matters which heretofore, in many instances, have necessarily been performed hy judges of State courts. The Commonwealth is greatly appreciative of the co-operation of State governments in the past, in making judges available for these inquiries. It will, however, be invaluable to the administration to have a Commonwealth judge who will be readily available for some of these inquiries in the future. In view of the services which, it is proposed, the judge will be required to perform, it is proposed that the salary of the judge will be £2,500 a year, equivalent to that of the bankruptcy judge. His pension rights also are to be similar to those of the judge in bankruptcy. The measure represents an advance in the development of the administration of justice in the Australian Capital Territory. It will afford some relief to the judge in bankruptcy, who is fully occupied with bankruptcy matters, and will facilitate the general administration of the Commonwealth in various directions. I commend the bill to the House. adjourned. toThat leave be given to bring in a hill for an act to establish a Commonwealth office oi",18,Canberra House Tenancy Of Soldier S Wife

Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [11.2] -by leave[ move That the bill be now read a second time. [n the discussion in this House on the 26th July, 1943, consequent upon the motion of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) relating to education, I took the opportunity to set out in some detail the action that had been taken by the Government, and the action that was proposed, in regard to various matters of education which concern the Commonwealth. Two of the main matters that I mentioned were the setting up of a Commonwealth Office of Education, and the introduction of legislation to make the Universities Commission a permanent body. The Government has pressed ahead with the preparation of legislation for these two purposes, each of which is very largely related to the other. In view of the general interest expressed on both sides of the House, and the general concern that the Commonwealth Government should assist, to the utmost of its power, education in Australia, no lengthy explanation is needed from me in introducing this bill. I have previously given to the House some indication of the amount of Commonwealth expenditure on educational matters in recent years. I have referred particularly to education in the territories of the Commonwealth, to assistance to universities and research, to physical, wartime technical, and pre-school education, and to service education. In view of the Commonwealth's increasing interest in education, the late Prime Minister on my recommendation, established in 1944 a committee of senior Commonwealth officers, which reported on the need for a Commonwealth body to co-ordinate its educational activities. The office of education provided for in the present bill will meet that need, and the permanent Universities Commission will carry on special functions in association with tinoffice. This does not mean, of course, that the Commonwealth should take over the control of education, but rather that it should co-operate with the States in fostering educational development. The Government believes, and I am sure that honourable members all agree, that by co-operation with the States we shall be able greatly to increase the nation's educational facilities and resources. PartI . of the bill calls for no comment from me. Part II . provides for the establishment of a Commonwealth Office of Education. The functions of the office are stated briefly in clause 5 (2) as follows:i (a.) to advise the Minister on matter? relating to education. The requests received by the Government for Commonwealth action, or assistance, in educational matters and the frequent suggestions made are in themselves sufficient to warrant the establishment of a competent Commonwealth authority in this field. (6) to establish and maintain a liaison, on matters relating to education, with other countries and the States. The development of official relations on educational matters between the Commonwealth and other countries is long overdue. This particular need is heightened at present by the forthcoming conference to be held in London to establish a united nations educational and cultural organization. ""We have had inquiries from abroad as to the possibility of organizing exchanges of teachers with other nations. We must, too, ensure that Australia shall be visited by outstanding educationists from all parts of the world. I hope that it will also be possible to arrange for some of our own educators to travel abroad. Arrangements for continuous liaison with the States on educational matters are equally necessary. The liaison which can be developed through this office will, 1 hope, be continuous and effective. (o) to arrange consultation between Commonwealth authorities concerned with matter? relating to education. This was one of the functions of such an office which was emphasized by the report of the interdepartmental committee to which I have referred.",19,Education Bill 1945
35,Mr Dedman (Corio,"Minister for((J) to undertake education. There is, I am convinced, great and growing need for the development of educational research. Some of the State Education Departments have carried out important educational research, as have some of our Australian universities, whilst Australia has benefited, too, from the work of the Australian Council for Educational Research. Here, again, it is not intended that the office should replace these several existing activities in education. But it is hoped that, in collaboration with these agencies, original researches on matters of national importance in relation to education will be conducted. The remaining principal purposes of the office are(e) to provide statistics and information relating to education required by any Commonwealth authority; (/) to advise the Minister concerning the grant of financial assistance to the States and to other authorities for educational purposes. Already, this is a matter of urgency, and the particular need has been emphasized by certain requests made by the States at the last conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers. If the Commonwealth sbould decide to make additional contributions to educational development, it would be the responsibility of the Government to see that contributions so made should be allocated in accordance with a consistent policy, and in such a way as to provide the greatest benefits. I think this short outline of the functions of the office has shown that the Government desires to establish a body which will not conflict in any way with institutions at present established, but which should provide a beginning in augmenting and supplementing the present educational resources of this nation. The Government has been very fortunate in securing for the office of Director of the Commonwealth Office of Education the services of Professor R. C. Mills, whose record is well known to honourable members. His experience in the field of education, and also in the' field of Commonwealth activities, is considerable and varied. His work as chairman of the Commonwealth Grants Commission is well-known, and his successful chairmanship of the Universities Commission during recent years is also eviJ/r. Dedman. research relating to dence of his wisdom and judgment. 1 should like to pay a tribute to Professor Mills and his associates for the splendid work of the commission to date. Part III . of the bill provides for the establishment and constitution of a Universities Commission. As members are aware, the Universities Commission has functioned since the beginning of 1943 under National Security Regulations. One of the main functions' of the commission has been the administration of a scheme of financial assistance which was introduced as a war measure, but which we believe should be continued in peacetime. The regulations under the National Security Act will lapse in due course. It has, therefore, become necessary for us to provide for the continuance of the administration of the scheme of financial assistance. This is one of the main reasons for the present bill. In the recent debate on education, I said that the Government had no intention of continuing the direction of man-power so far as university students were concerned after the cessation of hostilities nor for any other reason. I pointed out that that direction had been a war-time provision and that as soon as the emergency had passed it was the firm intention of the Government to do away with the provision. Before the Japanese surrender had actually been signed, an announcement was made that there would be no selection of students for reservation at universities in 1946. Members will see that the present bill makes no mention whatsoever of reservation or of man-power controls. The Government has announced that it will continue to accept new students for financial assistance under the civilian scheme for at least five years after the cessation of hostilities. This means that new students will be accepted at least up to,, and including, the year 1950. The Government has also announced that students accepted in this way will he assisted, subject to the usual conditions, throughout the whole of their course. The Government has fixed this period of five years, not as the period in which it considers financial assistance should continue, but as a period of grace in which full discussions can take place with the States as to the method of providing the necessary finance, as to the means of administration, and as to the conditions of eligibility for assistance if the scheme is, as I firmly hope it w ill be, made a permanent feature of Australian education. For the present it is necessary to make some amendments in the method of administering assistance following the end of the war and the abolition of reservation, and the opportunity w ill be taken to spread the assistance more evenly between the various university faculties. Apartf r o m this, the Commonwealth Government does not wish to be thought to prejudge the issue as to which should be the final for m of a permanent scheme of financial assistance, and no sweeping changes w ill be made unti l after we have had the chance to consult f u l l y with the various States. In Part III . of the bill, clause 8 (2) provides that the commission shall be annual report by the commission to the a body corporate, capable of suing and Minister and for regulations to give effect being sued in its corporate name. It was to the matters dealt with in the bill. This. felt that this was desirable in a body set I think, w ill be sufficient to explain to up under statutory authority. Provision honourable members the purpose behind is made for the Director of the Office of the bill and the provision which it makes Education to be chairman of the comfor establishing what w ill , I believe, mission, and for the appointment of three become two very important Commonother members for periods not exceeding wealth instrumentalities in the field of three years. The functions of the comeducation. mission are set out in clause 14 in simple -and concise terms. They are(a.) to arrange for the training in Universities or similar institutions for the purpose of facilitating their re-establishment, of persons who are discharged members of the Forces within the meaning of the Re-establishment and Employment Act 1945. The commission has been acting as a training authority under the Common-, wealth Reconstruction Training Scheme 3ince that began to operate, and the commission's field of activities includes all training provided by universities and similar institutions. In general, regulations relating to reconstruction training will be made not under this bill, but under the Re-establishment and Employment Act 1945. (6) in prescribed cases or classes of cases, to assist other persons to obtain training in Universities or similar institutions. (c) to provide financial assistance to students at Universities and approved institutions. The conditions under which assistance can be provided to students w ill be prescribed in regulations under this bill. In view of the need for alterations in minor matters as they occur, I think that no apology is"" necessary for placing the details of this scheme in regulations rather than in the statute itself(d) to advise the Minister with respect to such matters relating to University training and associated matters as are referred by the Minister to the Commission for advice. One important provision made in clauses 15 and 16 relates to State committees. The present Universities Commission found it desirable to set up committee? of advice in the various States. The appointment to these committees of the directors of education and of members of the staffs of the education departments has, of course, only been made after consultation with the State Premiers. Finally, provision is made for an adjourned. Debate resumed from the 21st September (vide page 5786), on motion by Mr. That the bill be now read a second time. Acting Attorney-General( Mr Beasley) explained when introducing this bill that its principal provisions related to the position of the judge in bankruptcy and that the effect of several of the amendments was to give statutory effect to practices which had been carried out since the appointment of Mr Justice Clyne and which had, because of the absence of statutory provision, necessarily been done by way of executive minute. They relate in particular, to the salary and pension of the judge in bankruptcy. The Opposition has examined the bill and f u l l y supports it . If I may",20,Second Beading

37,Mr Holt (Fawkner) [11.15],"Th eintroduce a personal note, I support the bill with more pleasure, because for the second time since I have been a member of this Parliament, I have found the long arm of coincidence stretching out and linking me with former associates. In my first case at the bar, I was a junior to the late George Maxwell whom I succeeded in the federal seat of Fawkner. After having graduated at the Melbourne University and taken my law articles, I spent a year in the chambers of the then Mr Clyne, doing my reading as a very raw barrister. I only hope that I attain the success as a politician that he has attained as a lawyer. I believe that the Commonwealth is extremely fortunate to have this most distinguished and able jurist in charge of the judicial side of the bankruptcy administration. He had the reputation of being one of the leading case lawyers in the Commonwealth, and I know that he enjoyed a tremendously high regard amongst his former associates at the Melbourne Bar. As the law stands now no provision exists in respect of a judge of the Federal Court of Bankruptcy appointed from a State court or from the ranks of practising solicitors or barristers. The practise, I think has been to appoint a judge of a federal court as judge in bankruptcy. There is to be no increase of the salary of £2,500which Mr Justice Clyne has been receiving since his appointment. Provision exists in the bill for a pension to be paid on retirement at the same rate as the pension payable to judges in other federal courts with the exception of. the High Court. The proposed new section states-Where a Judge of the Federal Court of Baiikruptcy has served in that office for not less than fifteen years, he shall, on retiring, should be exercised. At present there is be entitled to an annual pension at the rate of one-half of his salary. Where a Judge of the Federal Court of Bankruptcy was, immediately prior to his appointment, serving in any judicial office under a State, so much of thc term of that service as does not exceed five years shall, . . . be added to the term of his service as a Judge of the Federal Court of Bankruptcy. That is for the purpose of calculating the rate of his pension. That will apply to Mr justice who, prior to his appointment as judge in bankruptcy, was a County Court judge in Victoria. The remainder of the Mr Holt. bill deals with machinery provisions designed to improve the operation of our bankruptcy law, and, as they should strengthen the capacity of the Judge, the court and the administration generally in dealing with bankruptcy matters, they have the full support of the Opposition. Many things of special importance to the Attorney-General's Department and the country should be said on the second reading of this bill. I am not satisfied with the practice of taking judges from State courts to appoint them to Federal courts. I think the rank and file of the legal profession should be served first. There have been notable cases of members of State Supreme, District and County Courts who have sought to improve their position by seeking appointment on a life tenure to the High Court, the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration and the Bankruptcy Court. I consider that that practice should cease. I do not know how much the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) had to do with these particular arrangements. 1 am not going to challenge in any way the statements of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) about Mr Justice Clyne's capabilities, but, at the same time, in principle, it is wrong, I submit, that a man already on the bench of a State court should be appointed to the bench of a Commonwealth court. Federal judges should be appointed from the ranks of the profession. There are many men capable of filling federal judicial positions with distinction. The act gives power to the Commonwealth Government to appoint two judges in bankruptcy, and that power one judge in bankruptcy, who has to serve the whole of the Commonwealth. I believe that there is some loose kind of arrangement whereby a hundred pounds or' two is paid to a Queensland judge, I think Sir William Webb, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Queensland, to look after bankruptcy affairs in Queensland. bankruptcies in Queensland.

Debate resumed from the 7 th September (vide page 522.7), on. motion by Mr first year of the operation of the fund, That the hill be now read, a second time; Leader of the Australian Country party) [11.39] -There is a degree of humour in the order of.business this morning, for the National Welfare Fund Bill is being' dealt with immediately after we have passed theBankruptcy Bill, and, as I shall show presently, the National Welfare Fund is bankrupt. fund is a trust account established pursuant to sections 62A and 62B of the Audit Act 1901-1934. Under that measure the Treasurer has complete control of the balances in sucb accounts, even to the extent that, without reference to the Parliament, he may direct that any trust account be closed, and thereupon the moneys standing to tbe credit of the fund' shall, after liabilities have been met, be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Consequently the Treasurer can at any time abolish the National Welfare Fund and appropriate the balance to its credit for general purposes.. This fund was established in 1943. as a political measure,, and its establishment coincided with the reduction of the income tax exemption to £104 a year. It will be remembered that the Curtin Government resisted as long as it possibly could every suggestion that incomes in the lower ranges should be subjected to income tax, but, in the end, it reduced the exemption to £104 from £150, at which it stood when the previous Government left office. The Government, of course, was reluctant to take the step, but it realized that under war conditions there was no escapefrom it.. The wageeamers in the lower income range who had never previously paid income tax were assured, at that time, that £30,000,000 per annum, or one quarter of the total amount received in income tax from individuals, whichever was the less, would be earmarked and placed in the National Welfare Fund to provide increased social benefits. In this way the blow they had suffered by being brought into the income tax field was softened. They were given the promise of a return in kind for the money extracted from them by taxation. The terms of the bargain werenot observed. In the 1943-44, an amount of £27,889,572 was paid into the fund and £2,364,174 was paid out of it in benefits, leaving a balance of £25,525,398. Of this balance no less than £25,500,000 was immediately replaced by treasury-bills and spent. So much for the benefits which the workers were to receive during that year! With a. mere £25,000 remaining in the fund in cash balances instead of more This than £25,000,000, there Avas not much hope of the basic wage workers receiving any benefit from this source unless, of course, the money was to be replaced by funds raised from loans and subscribed by the previous contributors, or by money obtained from increased taxation and also subscribed by tbe same people. This method of finance is naively described in high Treasury circles and by the Treasurer as "" the temporary use of Treasury balances "". As was to be expected, the same technique of painless extraction was employed again in 1944-45, when an additional £27,500,000 was taken from the fund. The aggregate withdrawals for the two years, by means of substituting treasury-bills or government IO U's, was therefore £53,000,000. This illusory credit balance must ultimately be replaced by raising tbe money from the taxpayers who already have contributed tbe £53,000,000. The fund is bankrupt, because it has been used for the general purposes offinance,and the amount withdrawn has been replaced by Treasury IO U's. I concede that it is neither illegal nor improper for the Treasurer",25,Beasle Y
54,Motion (By Mr Beasley) Agreed To,,26,Chifley
55,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"so to act, because tbe Audit Act provides that such funds may be represented by government securities, which are denned as including treasury-bills or the I 0 U's to which I have referred. Nevertheless, I ventilate the matter so that no one will be deceived as to what has happened to the fund. The fact should be made clear to the public that the money contributed to the National Welfare Fund has been used for purposes other tban those intended. In fact, the taxpayers will contribute twice for the social benefits which side. Since 1938, when the total amount ultimately they will receive. The trust fund balances, including the National Welfare Fund, replaced last year by treasury-bills, amounted to £32,000,000, making a total temporary use of treasury balances of over £96,000,000. This method of Treasury finance has been used for so many years that, like the financial agreement with the States, it is almost humorous to describe it-as the Treasurer does-as ""the temporary use of Treasury funds "". As far back as 1930, general trust funds amounting to about £3,700,000 were so invested at an interest rate of 4 per cent. When Mr House. The then Leader of the OppoTheodore was Treasurer, the Parliament rejected his ' proposal for a fiduciary notes issue.

It will be noted that Mr Theodore and other Labour' Treasurershexploited this in 1943, by £42,000,000 in 1944, and by method of finance to a greater degree than any other Treasurer until the advent of the present Labour administration. In fact, Mr Theodore's method of finance, according to the budget speech that he presented in 1931, was based on reductions of wages, invalid and old-age pensions, the maternity allowance, waT pensions and repatriation benefits on the expenditure side, and a partial increase of revenue, by the replacement of trust funds with treasury-bills, on the revenue used in this way was less than in 1933, no trust funds were so used until the Labour Government took office in 1941. A little history should prove interesting. It will be remembered that, as Treasurer, I endeavoured to tax the lower ranges of income, recognizing that that course was inescapable if tbe resources of the country were to be utilized fully for the prosecution of the war. I expected to raise an additional £2,000,000 by the reduction of the income tax exemption to £150, but my government was defeated in this sition contended that we were proposing to tax the people out of existence, and to interfere with their standards of living. The Curtin Government then took office, but did not immediately reduce the exemption from £150 to the £104 which ultimately was reached. From what needed, and thus obviate the adoption of then deteriorated further, and in the following budget the exemption was 3,700,000 reduced from £150 to £104; but in 5,300,000 order to quieten the new taxpayers, 8,800,000 the explanation was offered that the June, 1934 .. 13,300,000 object was to establish the National 12,200,000 Welfare Fund. During the terms of office .. 12,000,000 as Treasurer of the Leader of the Oppo.. 11,000,000 sition ( Mr Menzies) and the honourable . . 10,700,000 member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), .. 10,700,000 as well as during my occupancy of the .. 10,700,000 position, no trust funds were replaced by 12,500,000 treasury-bills, and the total of £10,700,000 .. 04,200,000 remained constant from 1938 to 1941. In . . 90,300,000 1942, however, it rose by almost £2,000,000. It increased by £9,000,000",26,Chifley
56,Mr Beennan,"The right honourable source did it obtain the £2,000,000 that it",27,Chifley
57,Mr Fadden,"This table, showing that course? It secured a"" breathing£32,000,000 in 1945, and has now reached the colossal total of £96,300,000, an increase of £S6,000,000 since the Curtin Government took office. Yet the country is asked to believe that this is a temporary method of finance! If these treasury balances are being used temporarily, whence will come the wherewithal to replace them? The National Welfare Fund will have to he replenished out of the pockets of the very people who originally subscribed the amounts that have been abstracted from it. The fund has disappeared, and is represented by treasury-bills. Can it be wondered at that the Treasurer has been reluctantly compelled to partition the general revenue, and to describe a portion of it as a social services contribution at the rate of Is. 6d. of the issue and extensive use of treasuryin the £1, which is estimated to raise £51,000,000 a year? He is creating a problem for the coming years. I suppose that future Treasurers will have to clean up the mess. I detect in this matter the hand that was apparent in the Financial Agreement fiasco. A little publicity in connection with this temporary-permanent use of treasury balances will do no harm; in fact, it may do much good, by shedding a little light on the ultimate destination of the so-called social services contributions of tlie average taxpayer after they have passed through the hands of the Treasury alchemists and have been transmuted into general revenue. The position of the National Welfare Fund is appalling. It was established only three years ago, but it and other trust fund balances are now represented by treasury-bills, which have increased from £3,700,000 in 1930 to £96,300,000 in 1945. That is a most dangerous method of finance. The Treasurer pointed with pride to the fact that the total of the treasury-bills issued had not been increased last year, but had remained stationary at £343,000,000. Yet, according to the answer given to a question that I asked recently, the old method has again been resorted to since the end of the financial year, and the amount has been increased by £20,000,000; consequently, the total on the open market under this heading is to-day £363,000,000, in addition to the £96,300,000 on account of trust funds. Yet Government supporters are satisfied with that method of finance! Honourable members who sit on this side of the House certainly are not. Tbere was very little substance in the speech of the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden). He has indulged in a good deal of destructive criticism of the method now proposed by the Government to provide finance out of revenue for the National Welfare Fund. He has roundly condemned past Labour governments on account of their financial methods, particularly in relation to the issue of treasury-bills, as well as Mr Theodore's proposal for a fiduciary notes issue in 1929-30. We may well ask what harm has come to the community by reason bills. What harm would the community have suffered if the fiduciary notes had been issued then? After the Scullin Government was defeated, the proposal to issue the notes was abandoned. Mr Theodore's proposal was to issue £18,000,000 in fiduciary notes, £12,000,000 of which would be used for the relief of unemployment and £6,000,000 for the relief of wheat-growers. I have lived to see, not a mere £6,000,000 in credits issued by the Commonwealth Bank for the relief of wheat-growers, but £20,000,000. At the time of Mr Theodore's proposal, members of the Opposition said that the country would be ruined if the fiduciary notes were issued. Later, their own Government used the national credit to the amount of £20,000,000 for financing the wheat-growers, and the country was not ruined. Neither has any harm come to the country by the issue of treasury bills during the war. On the contrary, there has been prosperity and full employment. The people have had food and clothing, and if there have not been enough houses, the blame rests on previous governments-no t necessarily federal governments, because the responsibility for housing is primarily a matter for the States. The Government's methods of finance has brought the country through the greatest crisis in its history. All this talk of ruining the country if its credit resources are used through the issue of treasury bills, or in someo'other way, makes me tiredj The"" only proper test -",27,Chifley
58,Mr Barnard (Bass) [11.58],"is the prosperity or otherwise of the people. The right honourable gentleman said that treasury bills had been issued against an amount of £96,000,000 in the National Welfare Fund, but there is nothing to fear in that. In any case, what would If the system of post-war credits which he advocated had been adopted, I have no doubt that he would have had to resort to treasury-bill finance, also, because the exigencies of the situation would have demanded it. Recent history has proved the falsity of many of the doctrines advocated by the supporters of orthodox financial methods. The right honourable gentleman condemned the Government's financial methods, but had no positive suggestions to offer for financing our social services. It is the same old story-as soon as the war is over there is nothing that he and his friends want less than a new order. If we are to have a new order we must re-orientate our ideas. The establishment of a National Welfare Fund is the first step towards the consolidation of social services. Money collected by income tax and the pay-roll tax will> be used for the payment of social service benefits. In its second interim report the Social Security Committee, discussing war emergency unemployment, statedThe simplest and most equitable plan in the present circumstances is to impose a general tax on every income-earner in the community, w it h the exception of those on the lowest scale. This tax should be graduated according to the income of the taxpayer, with a small exemption limi t varying according to the income and family responsibilities of the taxpayer. Juniors on relatively low incomes who have no family responsibilities are often in a better position than married men with larger nominal incomes, and they can quite equitably be asked to contribute. It. would probably be best, for reasons of convenience and in order to separate the operaservices can be or is collected from the tions of the scheme, to place the proceeds of the tax in a special unemployment fund, from which could be made all disbursements, both for benefit and administration. All deductions relatively few in number. Most of the should be made at the source, where possible, in the same fashion as present federal income tax. It was further recommended by the committee that this system should continue in. force after the war in order to provide a fund for the payment of unemployment Mr Barnard. and sickness benefits. .Similar recommendations were made in the third and fifth reports of the committee. In its seventh report, the following passage occurs:The committee believes that all social he have done? security measures should be financed hy personal contributions from those to whom the benefits under the scheme w ill be provided. Basing its opinion on the above principle, the committee believes it to be necessary that early provision be made for the consolidation of the existing social legislation in an appropriate Commonwealth act in which a l l future legislation of a similar legislation of a similar nature shall be included. The committee examined people from all walks of life, the witnesses constituting a cross-section of the community. Therefore, when I speak on this subject, I am expressing not my own opinions exclusively, but those of a very large number of people in Australia. The witnesses came from universities, trades halls, the parliamentary Opposition, and from among old-age pensioners. We were careful to call witnesses representing organizations, including the Housewives Association. producers? representatives, also. The committee recommended the consolidation of social services under one act, and I hope that a bill for this purpose will eventually be introduced. The committee believed that social services should' be financed by a graduated tax on all income, according to ability to pay, the proceeds to go into a fund where it would be protected from Treasurers who might be tempted to use the money in times of financial difficulty. It is, of course, argued that as everybody pays so everybody should benefit. I have never subscribed to the fallacious view that all the money for social wealthy. Such is not the case. The rich pay more individually, but they are burden is borne by the section earning between £4 and £20 a week. This section, in addition, pays the bulk of indirect taxation which should be abolished or substantially reduced. This is not the appropriate occasion to deal at any length with that aspect, however. It may be",28,Chifley

There is much to commend its abandonment, and I hope that the means for that will finally be found. For the present we can only work to that end. Under our present scheme, many benefits, such as maternity allowances, child endowment, pharmaceutical and hospital benefits are, in fact, paid to the whole community, irrespective of posedindividual incomes. I believe that finally the National Welsection fare Fund can, and no doubt will, develop paragraphs:into a national superannuation fund. As all pay so all will be entitled to benefit.

Proposed new section 5 (2) (b) has accordingly to be amended. The amendment of proposed new section 5 (2) (&) clarifies the position. The new sub-section 2 (b) provides for the fixed amount of £51,000,000 to be paid into the fund for the full year 1946-47 in respect of social services contribution; this is the budget -estimate of actual collections for that year.

I am particularly interested in his observations concerning the incorporation of the payroll tax in this fund. If the Minister means that this money is to be considered as a contribution by the employers towards the general scheme of contributory insurance be should say so. The payroll tax was designed to provide money distorting the proportion of for the payment of child endowment. The revenue from the pay-roll tax is increasing. I think that there soon will be a big surplus of receipts from that tax over expenditure, on child endowment, especially when industries start to absorb demobilized members of the forces. In dustry is entitled to look for a reduction of the pay-roll tax. But now the Government proposes to pay the receipts into the general social services fund, and I have no doubt that the pay-roll tax will be increased in order to help to bridge tbe gap between receipts and expenditure in respect of the National Welfare Fund, which, on the figures placed before honourable members to-day by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden), must be almost bankrupt. I am disturbed that an amendment like this should be placed before the committee at the last moment. The Minister should "" come clean "" and let us know what he intends to do about the pay-roll tax.

That is £345,661,286. Direct taxation yielded only logical.

71,Mr Harrison,"I know. The receipts from sales tax for 1945-46 showor services. The entertainments tax, too, is described as a direct tax. In my opinion, entertainments tax is no more a direct tax than is excise. It is interesting to note that it costs a man 12s. to take his -wife and two children to a motion picture theatre on a Saturday evening. He may bc aware that the admission charges are 9s., and entertainments tax 3s., hut he knows that he has to pay 12s. When those two items are added to tha ""indirect"" tax acknowledged by the Treasurer, the total "" indirect"" taxes which the people of Australia will pay this year will be £117,900,000, or more than one-third of the total receipts from taxation, direct and indirect. Every one should realize that the amount which he pays as income tax is. only a part of his total! contribution to Commonwealth revenue. Half as much in addition he pays in the form of indirect taxation. When the taxpayer realizes that, he will appreciate what the Opposition has been contending, namely, that the Australian taxpayer is the highest taxed individual in the world. The research officer of tbe Iron workers Union, Mr W. Baker, after having investigated the effect of taxation on working-class families, reported that many families paid in indirect taxation as much as 10s. a week. I emphasize that that contribution to Commonwealth revenue was in addition to their ordinary income tax. I cannot understand why the Treasurer of a Labour Government, who knows that indirect taxation imposes a heavy burden on the working clas^ is not prepared to grant to them a greater measure of rslief. He has reduced the sales tax burden by £1,900,000, which is less than 1 per cent, of the' total collections from indirect taxation; and the figures which I have cited prove that indirect taxation will yield an additional £3,000,000. Among tbe goods normally bought by workers, and on which there are heavy customs and excise duties, are beer, 4s. 7d. a gallon; tobacco, 10s. lid. per lb.; cigarettes, 20s. 9d. per lb.; matches, 8s. a gross; and _ on practically all articles of clothing there is a sales tax of 7£ per cent. Some lines of food were subject to sales tax of 12£ per cent, and many toilet preparations, to a Mr Morrison. tax of 25 per cent. Originally the salei tax on those lines was 2£ per cent. Razor blades and cutlery are among the manj other requirements on which indirect taxation has been levied. How can the Government justify its attitude? Taking into account tbe reduction of sales tax by 7 per cent, which the Treasurer has so generously granted, the estimated return of revenue from this source this year will still be equivalent to tbe yield in 1943-44. When we consider that a great volume of purchasing power will be diverted to consumer commodities, most of which are subject to sales tax, I sbould not be surprised if the yield from sales tax this financial year should he considerably in excess of the estimate. In fact, I shall be surprised if tbe return does not exceed the yield for last year, notwithstanding the small concession granted by the Treasurer. I appreciate the degree of relief, so far as it goes; but I emphasize thai sales tax was introduced as an emergency measure by the Scullin Government during the depression. Since then, the Labour party bas always declared thai the sales tax must be repealed as soon ae possible. Why,, then, has the Government retained it? Honourable memberi opposite retort that sales tax bears equally upon the wealthy and the working classes when they purchase food and clothing. Yet the Government is imposing an onerous burden on the working class by retaining the sales tax at its present high level on the necessaries of life. If thf Government must have revenue from sources otherthan income tax, let i l . retain the sales tax on luxury goods.

The repeal of sales tax on goods required for the home is most urgently needed. At present, every article from the front doormat to the kitchen sink is subject to sales tax. Why has the sales tax on clothing been retained? Household goods and clothing, in which ex-service men and women are particularly interested, are practically untouched by the proposed remissions. The effect of sales tax was graphically portrayed in an article which appeared in the Sydney Sun on the 7th August last.

A brake on progress, a poison to incentive and ambition, the burden of taxation grows. How long w ill governments be able to ignore the people's .plight and its demands for some relief? Let the Minister attempt to justify that! He also cited the following examples of This is not the time to expect higher the effect of the sales tax on prices in returns from sales tax.

I hope eventually to witness the final liquidation of this iniquitous method of taxation, wbich is comparable to the bad old system of farming out the collection of taxes. It is a tax upon a tax. Country residents feel its incidence more severely than residents of metropolitan areas. They suffer by the fact that sales tax is imposed not only on the selling price of a commodity but also on the freight charged for its transport to the country. I have here a letter from the manager of the Molong branch of Wright Heaton and Company Limited, a firm of distributing agents which handles foodstuffs and farm materials. Recently, I was interviewed by branch managers of the firm who showed how the sales tax reacts harshly against country distributors in comparison with metropolitan firms. The manager of the Molong branch of the company wrote to me as follows:As you are no doubt aware, -registered wholesalers in the country have to pay sales tax on freight, whereas city merchants simply add the tax to the invoice price, and the freight department, and is then, of c6urse, an item quite apart from the invoice and consequently non-taxable. You will readily see that this puts such companies as us, trading in the country, at a disadvantage to the city merchants', and besides making the cost to country traders and consumers greater, is directly across the policy of decentralization.

Last year it amounted to form of financial assistance, which could £26,671,802, and this year it is expected be conferred by the removal of this tax. to amount to £28,000,000.

Dame people living in the colder climates in southern Australia. that the Treasurer will give sympathetic consideration to the points that I have the most important materials used in the construction of homes is paint, but no provision has been made in the bill for its exemption from sales tax. In my electorate are some of the largest paint manufacturing establishments in Australia, and their representatives have brought to my attention certain facts regarding the production of paint and its importance in home construction and maintenance. Their request is that the Treasurer should consider an amendment of the act to provide for the exemption of paint, particularly that used for household purposes. Paint is the only basic raw material of importance used in building construction which is not already exempt from this tax. The approximate value of the annual production of paint in Australia is £4,000,000. It is estimated that, under present conditions, about two-thirds of that production is subject to sales tax, and, at the rate of 12£ per cent., yields £292,000 per annum. The remaining one-third, being for government, shipping and export use, is not subject to sales tax. The average cost of the paint that is used on a house newly constructed, taking into account brick, wood, and other forms of construction, and including exterior and interior painting, is estimated to be £20, the sales tax on wbich is £2 10s. On this basis, the additional burden on housing cost3 due to sales tax, on the erection of the 40,000 or 50,000 houses per annum now proposed, would be from £100,000 to £125,000 per annum. It is estimated that approximately 80 per cent, of the total houses erected cost less than £1,800. These, very largely, are privately owned homes, from which the owners get no relief in respect of the additional cost of the sales tax that is required in connection with the painting maintenance of their properties. The balance of the houses, .flats, &c, are largely owned by investors, who get some relief from the additional burden of sales ENID LYONS -Particularl y tax, in that they are allowed to deduct from their incomes the cost of maintenance for income tax purposes. The estimated use of paint produced prior to the war was: New building construction, 10 per cent.; building maintenance, 50 per cent.; shipping and export, 10 per cent.; and industrial and other uses, 30 per cent. Tbe proportion of the total paint production used in connection with new building construction during tbe next ten years is likely to be considerably higher than 10 per"" cent. I understand that some consideration has already been given to the exemption of paint from sales tax. The information that I have furnished may be of assistance in a review of the position. The Government desires to reduce the cost of postwar building, and has taken action to exempt from sales tax other building materials. There are strong grounds for the exemption of paint. I urge the Treasurer to make that necessary provision, in the interests of tbe homebuilders of this country. of the Australian Country party) [2.38]. -The sales tax was introduced as an emergency financial measure when the Commonwealth Government was looking for means by which revenue might be increased, but, like the poor, it is still with us. Income tax was first introduced in the British Empire by Pitt, at the time of the Napoleonic wars, and was regarded as a temporary expedient, yet it, too, is still with us. ""We appreciate this bill, because it will afford some alleviation of the infliction that is designated sales tax. According to the budget papers, the estimated receipts from sales tax for the year ending the 30th June, 1945, are £2S,000,000, which will be £1,600,000 less than was received for the year ended the 30th June,. 1945. It is obvious that the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) has based his estimate on the static economic conditions that existed during 1944-45. The war was waged during the whole of ithat period. It is apparent that no consideration has been given to the probability of an expanding economy during this year. We should be pesr '.mistic were we to",35,Examples Of Sales Tax On Feeight

88,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"Leade rconsider that the outlook for Australia during the unexpired portion of this year, and in future years, will be no better than were our experiences during the grave years through which we have just passed. Surely we are entitled to a feeling of optimism, based on the demobilization and civil re-employment of servicemen which must occur if the Government's policy of full employment is to be implemented. There must be an increased production of goods, with a consequent expansion of the volume of sales, as the result of not only the proper implementation of full employment, but also the operation of the new conditions that we are about to experience in a neriod of peace. There must be large imports of manufactured goods to fill demands that have been held in check for six years, and as reciprocal trade for the heavy overseas demands that are anticipated for our primary products, especially foodstuffs. The lifting, or at least the alleviation, of rationing, in respect of goods and commodities on which sales tax is payable, should be an incentive to increase production. If all, or even some, of these factors he given due weight, the aggregate receipts estimated by the Treasurer must be exceeded; otherwise, we shall have little to hope for as the result of the cessation of hostilities. Consequently, larger concessions could be granted than are proposed under this bill, particularly in certain directions and in certain circumstances. A far-reaching effect of taxation in any form is that, if its incidence is too heavy, the object of revenue production is gravely impaired. Tbis is known technically as the law of diminishing returns. An unduly heavy sales tax merely results in industrial stagnation, the non-production of useful and necessary goods, and a lower standard of living. As a matter of fact, we must appreciate that sales tax is a pernicious impost. We realize, of course, that it had to be introduced, having, regard to the few remaining avenues that were open to us for the raising of revenue. Nevertheless, it should be withdrawn as soon as possible. A lessening of the burden pf tax, on in order to reduce household drudgery, the other hand, not only returns revenue l t has been estimated that the sales tax of an equivalent or a greater amount, but on the furnishings of a working-man's Mr Fadden. also aids industrial recovery, provides markets and other facilities, raises consumption, increases the volume of employment, and ensures progressive relief from the frugal and austere mode of living which has been necessary during the war years. Bearing in mind these considerations, the Treasurer should study afresh utility items, the tax on which might be reduced to a greater degree than the reduction from 25 per cent, to 12^ per cent, proposed by the bill. That would be sound economy. I refer specifically to cutlery for domestic purposes, household refrigerators, washing machines and vacuum cleaners. Many housewives, especially those with young families, have heen greatly inconvenienced during the war years, and some have suffered in health through lack of domestic assistance. They should now be given every encouragement to purchase mechanical appliances which will reduce household drudgery. Not only would that have beneficial economic effects, but also tbe provision of these domestic aids would tend to increase the population. An indispensable factor in natural increase is a lessening of domestic drudgery. For instance, a refrigerator is not a luxury but an absolute necessity in every home in tropical Queensland. Yet a tax of 12£ per cent, is imposed on refrigerators. That exorbitant tax should be removed, especially on keroseneoperated refrigerators which have to be used especially in the country, where no electric power is available. Other items in this category which are excluded from participation iu the reduction of sales tax from 25 per cent, to 12^ per cent, are kerosene lamp3 and hurricane lamps of the wick-burning open-flame type. What is the reason! If it is an anomaly caused by an oversight, it should be rectified without delay. Sales tax on electric light fittings for domestic purposes, wash boilers, coppers, water heaters, and many similar appliances used principally for household purposes is still at the rate of 12^ per cent. If the Government's housing plan is to be effective, many thousands of these domestic appliances will be purchased modest home amounts to £45. It would be futile to pay a gratuity to a soldier with one hand, and take it away with the other hand by demanding sales tax on the furnishings with which his home is equipped and on the appliances installed to provide some relief to his wife. If , as is usual, finance has to be obtained to suable a home to be purchased, the heavy incidence of sales tax adds to the capital cost, and necessitates the payment of interest on a greater capital sum for many years. The principle is obviously both financially economically undesirable. Having regard to all these circumstances, and the probability of the revenue from sales tax exceeding the estimate, the Treasurer sbould adopt the juggestions which I have outlined. It is worthy of note that nearly £5,000,000 was collected from sales tax during July and August of this year. It will indeed be a poor prospect for this country if production and the volume of sales during the remainder of the financial year remain at the low level of the first two months. The logical conclusion is that the bill does not include concessions which a more accurate estimate would indicate could safely be granted. There is need for a more thorough survey of the items which affect the cost of living, and particularly the cost of providing shelter. There is need to review the sales tax on all articles associated with the building and furnishing of homes. If sales tax cannot be entirely removed, it should at least be wisely applied. There should be greater recognition of family responsibilities and the needs of country dwellers. Particular attention sbould be given to items which reduce domestic drudgery, so that housewives will be encouraged to have children. In my opinion, the articles on which concessions are to be made have not been wisely selected, nor has recognition been given to the prosperity which might reasonably be expected now that the war is over. I hope that, long before the end of the financial year, reductions of sales tax will be made on many other goods along the lines that I have indicated. Mr LC.2ZARINI (Werriwa-Minister for Works and Housing and Minister for Home Security) [2.52] I have taken a note of the remarks made during the second-reading debate, and will submit them to the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) with a request that consideration be given to them when the sales tax is again under review.

That was only six years ago, but to-day most of that £100,000,000 would be required for social services alone. Under this legislation citizens are required to contribute to a common pool on the chance that they will be able to draw something out of it should misfortune overtake them. It is obvious that the Government cannot give something for nothing. That fallacy may have been acceptable to those who believed that tbe rich only were being "" soaked "" to pay the cost of government at a time when basic wage earners were free from the liability to pay direct taxes. Now, the percentage of people paying direct taxes is much greater. They are, in consequence, more conscious of the cost of government and of the fact that they themselves are paying for their own social services. Since so many",36,Examples Of Sales Tax On Feeight

This measure is based on and National Service( Mr Holloway) a contribution of Is. 6d. from every f l saidof income over £104, and it is collected without regard to the rights of the conany interference, or tampering, with the basis tributor. In fact, the contributor, when siders he seeks to benefit from the scheme, will widows and orphans on the same basis as the be subjected to a means test. The Treasurer has foundit necessary to raise money for social services and he proposes to do it through the present income Tax Act, which was designed fcr a different purpose. When a person takes out an insurance policy, he enters into a contract which gives him the right, in return for paying premiums, to receive definite monetary benefits at some definite to alter the policy of Parliament hy transtime in the future. The payments which he makes are scientifically calculated by exact actuarial methods, and bear a strict relation to the benefits to be derived. The Labour men were to support this bill as it Government's scheme, however, has no such advantages. It is economically unscientific, it is actuarially unsound, and it is politically unjust. Many a person now contributing to a superannuation fund will also have to contribute for social services, but lie will enjoy no cona swindle to place the burden of financing tractual right to receive subsequent benesocial services on the already over-burdened fits. Because of the means test, he will be unduly penalized for his thrift and self-reliance. A man would have to save about £5,000 and invest it in government bonds at 3^ per cent, in order to obtain the equivalent of the old-age pension for himself and his wife. Under the present proposal, even if he paid his social services contributions regularly every year,-he would still not be eligible for a pension. On the other hand, a spendthrift and ne'er-do-well, who may not have contributed one penny to the social services fund, would be entitled to receive the old-age pension upon reaching the prescribed age. Admittedly, many old people find themselves without means of support because of ill health or misfortune or some other unavoidable cause. Social justice demands that they be not left to starve; it also demands that the provident should not be unduly penalized for the benefit of the improvident. During the debate on the National Health and Pensions Mr Fadden. The Labour party is definitely opposed to of our pensions scheme. Moreover, it contliat pensions should be provided for invalid and old-age pensions. The money to provide these social services should be obtained by taxing the persons who enjoy high income* in this country. The Minister for Defence( Mr Beasley) saidHe, the Treasurer, said tliat iu the conrsiof a few years tlie expenditure in respect of pensions would reach a.n alarming figure, which would perturb future governments. For that reason this Government is seeking ferring the burden of social services from the shoulders of the-whole community to those ot the workers, for whom the benefits have been chiefly provided. If , in such circumstances, stands we should be untrue to principle« which have governed Labour policy since the party first became a power in Australia. The Minister for Transport ( Mr Ward) statedThe scheme appears to be nothing more than poor. The Government is asking the workers to increase their existing poverty in order to provide against their future destitution. The Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin) expressed himself thusI n every way possible the Government la seeking to levy from the people who can least afford it the cost of this insurance scheme, which should be nation-wide in its application as regards both benefits and costs. The M in is t e r for the A r m y ( Mr. F o r d e ) statedWe, as a party, refuse to destroy the principles upon which the Commonwealth system of invalid and old-age pensions has been established for upwards of 30 years, and we retuse to agree to placing the pension for widowhood on a contributory basis.

The Ministerf o r A i r ( MrD r a k e for d ) h a d this to sayLabour now says quite frankly to everybody that it believes that the reward for good service for those who are unable to"" provide for themselves should be a pension from the nation, without any contribution other than the good service' they had rendered over a lengthy period.

That is the argument wbich he seeks to avoid. My point is that the public servant who is compelled to purchase units under the superannuation scheme prejudices his right to obtain a benefit greater tban that to which he would become entitled had he made no contribution at all. The Government should be consistent in this matter. It insists upon the contributory principle in respect of superannuation benefits, but ignores it entirely in respect correspondence on the matter, and take of social services benefits. To be consistent it must either abolish the present method whereby public servants are compelled to purchase units under the superannuation scheme, or acknowledge the contributory principle in respect of social services benefits, and devise a social sertold that, as he was 65 years of age, he vices scheme on an actuarial basis. The Public Service superannuation scheme is actuarially sound. If the contributory principle be correct, and obviously it is, no person in the community is entitled to receive benefits unless he makes some contribution towards them. He then becomes entitled to such benefits as a right and not as charity; but the benefits to be provided under this scheme bear th© stigma of charity. I have heard ad nauseam the argument of honourable members opposite that all old-age pensioners have contributed towards the prosperity of the country by their pioneering efforts. As a matter of fact, they have done less to pioneer the country than those who by thrift have contributed to the nation's wealth, and, at the same time, have supported themselves, and by their industry have contributed to the national welfare. capacity to save. able member for Eremantle ( Mr Beazley) contend that it is impossible for workers receiving the present basic wage to save?

The honourable member makes no contribution to this debate by uttering generalities of that kind. had many opportunities to preach all these doctrines to the Government of which he was a member. these doctrines at that time. The Treasurer will remember that I was a prominent member of a cave which arose in that Government over the provision of national health and pensions insurance. Therefore, I am consistent in this matter. I register my protest against this proposal. I have received considerable this opportunity to place on record some of the views expressed in that correspondence. A correspondent of mine, when he could not work through illness, although he had contributed towards sickness benefits, was refused them, being could apply for an old-age pension. He could not have applied for and received an old-age pension, because he had a small amount of capital tied up in an industrial plant. Owing to the war restrictions, the plant is inoperable and thus is' not returning him any income. So he cannot earn the income that he was earning before illness overcame him, he is refused sickness benefits, and, because he has capital, which is not, and cannot, under the conditions prevailing to-day, return him any income, he is also unable to draw an old-age pension.

The sooner the Government establishes a contributory insurance scheme on a sound actuarial basis the sooner we shall have justice. Then those who have contributed from their resources to the National Welfare Fund and have also been thrifty, and those whom life has not treated well enough to allow them to contribute at the same rate or at all, or, perhaps, have been unthrifty, will all be on the same level in respect of social benefits.

FOOD CONTROL. for the Army) -by leave I lay on the table a report which was prepared by a committee of officials and experts from the United Kingdom and Australia for the Combined Food Board with the object of comparing the levels of civilian food consumption in the United Kingdom and Australia in the years before the war, in 1943, and during 1944. A similar report had been prepared some months earlier regarding the civilian food consumption levels in the United Kingdom, the United States of America, and Canada. These comparisons were necessary in order to provide the Combined Food Board with a clear picture of the food position in the principal allied countries. The figures in this report represent the average quantity of food available per head of population and do not take into account irregularities of distribution. Despite this limitation, the report does present an interesting picture of the conditions prevailing in the two countries. Before the war the average Australian diet was more varied and palatahle than the average diet in the United Kingdom. Australia had more meat, sugar and fruit and also a higher consumption of milk and eggs. It is interesting to find in the report that even before the war there was a substantially consumption of fish.

Also the nutritive value of the average diet was compared with a standard, which, it was considered, would guarantee adequate health and nutrition of the population. The report reveals that in both countries the supply of all nutrients was sufficient to meet this standard, with the exception of the consumption of calcium in Australia. The lower consumption of calcium in this country is closely allied with the comparatively low milk consumption here. This finding was confirmed in an investigation conducted by the Nutrition Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council into the levels of food consumption in some 2,700 homes in Australia last year. The report draws attention to the fact that, in the closely settled United Kingdom with its short lines of internal distribution, and because of the comprehensive food rationing programme in force in that country, the great majority of the -people were able to, and in fact probably did, consume a diet very close to the statistical average. In Australia, with adjourned. its greatly scattered population, and the attendant transport difficulties, coupled with the comparatively arid nature of parts of the country, it is doubtful if anything like the same percentage of the population consumed a diet equivalent to the statistical average. People living in some parts of the country and in some ifr. Forde. sections of the community probably consumed considerably more than wa6 necessary for adequate nutrition, and other people considerably less. The figures in the report covering the consumption in 1944 were prepared in October of that year. They have now been reviewed from data showing the actual disappearance of food and the figures are very similar to those in this report. The revised data and the projected consumption figures for 1945 will be available shortly. The Government is concerned at the In the fact that calcium intake in Australia is below that considered necessary for adequate health of all sections of the community. It is well known that the principal source of calcium is milk, of which there is a comparative shortage at the moment. As soon as supplies are plentiful again and we can meet to the full our obligations to the British Ministry of Food, to our own services and to the Allied services, the Government will review the problem with the object of developing a scheme which will ensure an adequate supply of milk, particularly to those sections of the community who need it most, and especially expectant and nursing mothers, infants and young children. The Government is arranging for Dr. Clements, the chairman of the Nutrition Committee, to bring the matter before his colleagues and submit a plan to the Government to be brought into effect as soon as supplies are sufficiently in excess of other insistent demands to justify sucb action.

Lack of information from the Japanese regarding transfers of prisoners from one camp to another, and their extreme dilatoriness in reporting deaths is only one confusing feature of the task of tracing prisoners about whom no information is yet known. It is, therefore, impossible, at this stage, to make any reliable estimate of the number of prisoners of war out of the number of 4,926 still outstanding whom it might be expected may be recovered; but new names STO being received daily. It is regrettable, lization of members of the Australian however, that, based on general reports received, the death roll in several areas may be expected to be heavy, and it will take some considerable time to ascertain with any degree of certainty the names of the members concerned, though naturally those working in the recovery areas are endeavouring to obtain authentic information regarding them as rapidly as circumstances will permit. Since the commencement of the homeward movement of recovered prisoners of war, the names of nearly 700 members of the Australian Military Forces who have returned or are returning by air have been notified, while the names of over 4,700 who have returned or are returning by sea to Australia have also been notified to next of kin, or have been published in press lists. Members of the Australian Military Forces comprise a relatively small proportion of the recovered personnel to be repatriated from the areas where major recoveries have or are being effected. For example, the Australian personnel on Singapore Island were only one-sixth of the total number of prisoners held there at the cessation of hostilities. Similarly, the number of recovered Australian personnel held in camps in Manila under the control of the Australian Prisoners-of-war Reception Group is also less than onesixth of the total of British Commonwealth recovered personnel in those camps. Those figures are mentioned to indicate that the recovery and repatriation of Australian personnel to their homeland is a small part of the task of great magnitude which is proceeding as rapidly as it is humanly possible to do so with the resources available. It is understandable that Australian recovered personnel should wish to be returned to their homeland at the earliest possible date, and while it is noted that complaints are being made in isolated cases of the lack of transport facilities and the suggestion is being made in some quarters that more transport should be allotted for this purpose, it should not be' forgotten that complete priority is being given at the present time to the transportation of recovered personnel to Australia, and that until this objective is secured the repatriation and demobiMilitary Forces overseas from all areas in the Pacific will remain practically at a standstill. Every endeavour is being made to obtain additional transport to return prisoners of war and serving members of the Australian Military Forces to Australia. It is unfortunate that the demands on the available Empire and Allied resources are far in excess of the transport available; but the Government will continue to press for additional transport facilities. I flew to Sydney last night and at 7 o'clock this morning went on board the hospital ship Oranje. I had an opportunity to meet the 600 returning prisoners of war on that vessel. Addressing them over the loud-speaker system, I was able to extend to them on behalf of the Australian Government and on behalf of all parties in this House, a very hearty welcome back to their homeland. Although these men had heen through very trying ordeals during the last three and a half years, they showed magnificent fortitude. Despite their sufferings, their spirits were high and they were delighted to be back in Australia. It will be some time before many of them will be restored to normal health. Unfortunately, many of them probably will never again enjoy good health, but I know I am voicing the opinion of all honourable members when I wish them a speedy recovery and a rapid return to community life. The whole of Australia rejoices in their homecoming. That the House do now adjourn. The action of the Minister for the Army( Mr Forde) in flying to Sydney last night for the purpose of extending a welcome to returning prisoners of war on Oranje was a gesture which will be appreciated by all; but the persons whom the prisoners of war are most anxious to see, and bc welcomed by, are their own next of kin.. The Government has made arrangements, whicb are not working satisfactorily, for the transport of next of kin from country districts to the disembarkation points, so that they shall be able to greet the men on their arrival in Australia. I have received complaints from residents of country districts, and notably from the Lismore branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia that these arrangements are not satisfactory, as the result of lack of organization in providing means for the relatives to proceed to the disembarkation points. I communicated with the Minister of Transport in New South Wales, Mr O'Sullivan, and various transport officials who might have been expected to advise me on procedure, and they informed me that the next of. kin of a prisoner of war should make application to the appropriate department-the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, or the Department of Air-and would later be issued with a travelling voucher. The Minister, who has an intimate knowledge of conditions in country districts, knows how difficult it is for farmers and others to obtain information regarding the exact procedure to be followed. They do nol know whether to apply to a department in Sydney, Melbourne or Brisbane. The result is that many next of kin have not been able to avail themselves of the facilities which the Government has granted to enable them to welcome returning prisoners of war. The Lismore branch of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers, and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia suggests that shire clerks, town clerks, police officials, stationmasters or some other' prominent local personality, who knows the exact position in regard to these relatives, should be authorized to issue a pass, under such conditions as may be prescribed by the service departments. This morning, I interviewed the secretary to the Minister for Defence( Mr Beasley) regarding this matter, and was informed that about 90 per cent, of the applications should be made to the Department of tbe Army, and the remainder to the Department of Air or the Department of the Navy. As numbers of prisoners will be returning within the next few weeks, it is urgent to resolve this matter without further delay in order that next, of kin may avail themselves of the facilities which the Government has provided for them. I hope that the Minister will consider my suggestion. Although this facility exists in name, it does not really exist in fact. obtaining information about the arrival of ships bearing the returning prisoners of war. or do not the people know where to applv? do not know where to apply.

I regret two very relevant observations. The that the honourable gentleman is not first is that Mr Chippindall is a most present, because I do not like making interested party, and his reply, delivered this reply in his absence. However, it per medium of the Minister, must be is not my fault if I have to do so. About read in that light. In other words, it three weeks ago, I placed before this is far more reliable to call in an outside House certain disquieting information auditor to certify to the accuracy of which had been brought to my notice the financial statements regarding one's from widely separated quarters in business if any doubt has arisen, than Queensland regarding the activities of rely upon the person who may be rethe Commonwealth Disposals Commissponsible for the position. My second sion. I made it quite clear that I had observation concerns a well-known rule no definite information, nor could I of evidence which has been incorsubstantiate the allegations which had porated in the Crimes Act. It is been brought to my attention. But I that the onus of proof lies on the considered that it was my duty to raise person accused when the facts are the matter in the House, and I dispeculiarly within his own knowledge, or charged it. The types of articles inif he is supposed to be cognizant of volved were refrigerators and motor them. Tbe application of this rule to vehicles, including motor cycles. My statement was made in the House of disposals needs no further elucidation. at 11.5 p.m. on the 6th September, and the very next day, early in the afternoon, the Minister for Defence( Mr were the original subject of my comBeasley) read, in reply, a statement preplaint. The very day on which my pared by Mr Chippindall, who, first, allegations were made, the Minister had obviously not read the Hansard text representing the Minister for Supply and of my charges, and, secondly, had not Shipping replied to one of my questions had time to investigate, in the half-day on notice stating that only eight reor less available to him, fhe transactions frigerators had been sold in the Brisbane at Tolga, near Cairns, in north Queensarea, and seven of them were wrecked land, and other happenings at Enoggera, machines.

My first point is proved by overnight, but also the number of reMr Chippindall's reference to my frigerators disposed of apparently inhaving confused the Commonwealth creased rapidly, for the very next day the Disposals Commission with the SalMinister stated in this House that vage Commission. Whilst such an no fewer than ten refrigerators had. delivery of my speech and the Minister's reply. It is fairly obvious that Mr Before dealing specifically with the both the ministerial head of the department concerned and the officer in charge I now come to the specific items which",45,Adjournment Australian Prisoners Of War Com Monwealth Disposals Commission Animal Eats Australian Capital Territory Parliamentary Repre Sentation
111,Mr Fadden (Darling Downs,"been sold at £52 10s. each, and that another four, which were in need of repair, had been sold at as low a price as £32 10s. each. All of these transactions occurred in the Brisbane area, and there is a grave discrepancy, with respect to number, value and description, between the answer given to my question and the Minister's subsequent statement, which were given within 24 hours of each other. My original allegation was that some refrigerators had been sold for about £7 each to friends of the commission's officers. This information was checked when I was last in Brisbane and my informant, who unfortunately will not allow me to use his name unless he can secure a guarantee of protection, assured me tnat at least two of the refrigerators were sold by alieutenant iat Enoggera to friends commissioned officers in base jobs-for £7 and £9 10s. respectively. These two refrigerators are now being repaired, the approximate costs of repair being £5 and £25 respectively. I shall now quote some further allegations, which the Minister will be given an opportunity to disprove in accordance with a suggestion which I shall make. In late July or early August this year, there were at least twenty electric refrigerators at the Enoggera auction compound. and others had parts missing. should like to know what happened to each of them, what prices were paid for them, and who purchased them. It is also alleged that, about June this year, a number of kerosene-operated refrigerators were sold to a Brisbane foundry which is known to me for about £10 each, well below their actual value. Is this information correct, and were they all sold to the same firm? Have kerosene refrigerators been sold minus burners, which makes them practically useless, and have the burners been sold to the same purchasers a fortnight or so later? Does this practice bring refrigerators within the category of "" wrecked machines "" as interpreted by the Minister's advisers? The truth with regard to these refrigerators can be very easily determined. No machine can be taken from Enoggera without the production to the gateifr. Fadden. keeper of an official receipt. The duplicates, or counterfoils, of such receipts obviously must be carefully preserved for audit purposes. Consequently, I make this very simple, yet effective, request to the Minister: That he obtain and lay on the table of this House for. my inspection, before the parliamentary recess, the duplicates or counterfoils of official receipts for the sales of all refrigerators, whether kerosene or electric, in Queensland during the past six months. Will he also arrange a conference between me and the Auditor-General, giving me authority to suggest the lines of an investigation to be made by Mr Abercrombie's officers with a view by ascertaining the truth or otherwise of the allegations made to me. If the Minister refuses these requests, it is a fair inference to draw that the Commonwealth Disposals Commission is unable to face the acid test which I have proposed. The second item concerns the disposal of motor vehicles, including motor cycles, and motor tyres. With regard to motor tyres, the Minister stated in reply to my questionEvery tyre made available to the Commonwealth Disposals Commission is marketed as quickly as it is received, but, unfortunately the vast majority of releases at the moment, including the 13,000 referred to by Mr Fadden, Some were complete, consist of non-commercial types of tyres, suitI able only for use on war department designed vehicles. I draw particular attention to the reference to ""non-commercial types of cars, suitable only for use on war department designed vehicles"". I need do nothing more than to quote Army Activities Bulletin No. 2, issued by the Minister for the Army on the 15th September, which statesItems in excess of Army requirements due to obsolescence and the reduction in Army strength, and declared to the Commonwealtb Disposals Commission between the 1st January, 1945, and the 25th August, 1945, included 35.231 tyres and tubes suitable for commercial vehicles and 1.7,383 motor vehicles. Obviously, either the Minister for the Army and I are wrong, or the Minister for Defence has been misinformed. 1 leave it to the Ministers to resolve their differences. With regard to delays in the disposal of motor vehicles the Minister saidThe commission will continue to liquidate surplus vehicles at the maximum rate until the absorptive capacity of the Australian market has been reached. Ln this connection, the official bulletin sponsored by the Minister for the Army statedDuring the week ended the 25th August, 1945, 1,003 vehicles were declared for disposal, tions of receivers would do nothing towards the commission sold 133 and purchasers took delivery of 152. f n other words, a mere 13 per cent, of the vehicles declared were sold.

I recognize that it would be difficult to provide more butter, meat, &c, but I am convinced that there is a great waste of fats which could be conserved and sent to Britain. When the problem of sending supplies to the Old Country became acute, and it was announced that rationing in Britain was to be further reduced, I made certain inquiries. In response to my request I have received a letter from Mr Bankes Amery, in which he statesSir Ben Smith, the present Minister for holder donated only 1 or 2 lb. of sugai. food, announced upon the eve of V-P Day it would be a most valuable gift, and i i that there was very little prospect of increaswould involve very little sacrifice. 1 ing the meat ration above Is. worth a week before the end of the year, and that the reduccommend that suggestion to the Governtion already made in the issue of canned ment for its consideration. meat under the points rationing scheme could not be increased. He added that serious difficulties would arise in regard to maintaining the reduced bacon ration of 3 oz. a week and that he could see no possibility of restoring the cut in the cooking fat ration from 2 oz. to 1 oz. at the present time. He added, too, that further national economies would have to be made in the use of sugar, but that he did not propose to reduce the domestic ration below i lb. weekly. He also said that in future the allowance of dried eggs would have to be on a lower scale, and he added that there was little chance of an increase in the cheese ration above 2 oz. Most housewives are not careful to conserve, for use in other directions, all the small pieces of fat that are cut away from meat. If fats were not allowed to be sold in the retail markets, -but were reserved for manufacturing purposes, a large contribution could be made for the purpose of increasing the supplies available to Great Britain. I am informed that about 5 lb. of solid fat, such as suet and kidney and caul fat, can be cut from a sheep of average size, and from 25 to 30 lb. from every beef beast. Housewives could easily manage with the quantity of fat now supplied with the meat purchased in butcher shops. I speak from experience of handling foodstuffs on a fairly large family scale, and am sure that from the meat now used by householders sufficient fat could be provided for domestic purposes without having to purchase suet or dripping from butcher ahops. In Great Britain, under the latest reduction, the allowance of 1 oz. of cooking fat includes the allowance of Dame Enid Lyons. shredded suet. As fat is of tremendour value in the food supply, the Government should give consideration to thi? matter. Literature supplied to me by MT . Bankes Amery shows that the i-lb. ration of sugar formerly allowed in Britain at Christmas-time cannot be granted this year. If the Governmeut could sponsor an appeal to householders throughout the Commonwealth to make a voluntary contribution of sugar as a Christmas gifi to the people of Great Britain, it would receive a ready response. If each housedraw attention to a matter of vital importance to the people of the Australian Capital Territory and make a strong appeal to the Minister for the Interior( Mr Johnson) and the Government to approve, and take the necessary steps to grant, parliamentary representation to the people of this Territory. I urge the Government to consider the matter during the forthcoming parliamentary recess, as no delay should occur in granting the people'* request. This matter has been considered on several occasions. Wheni t was last under review, the request was not granted on the ground that it would have to be deferred until after the war. The war now being over, the matter should be again considered. The opening ceremony in connection with Parliament House, Canberra, occurred on the 9th May, 1927, and the Parliament assembled here for the first time in that year. Since that time, the population of Canberra has steadily increased and I am now officially advised that the present population is over 12,000. When the Northern Territory had a population of between ,6,000 and 7,000, parliamentary representation was granted to it. The representative elected by the people of that Territory was entitled in those days to express his views and make appeals on behalf of that scattered community, but he was not accorded a vota Later he was granted that privilege.",46,Adjournment Australian Prisoners Of War Com Monwealth Disposals Commission Animal Eats Australian Capital Territory Parliamentary Repre Sentation

Those figures show that people in the United Kingdom received 42.9 lb. of sented :butter fat a year, compared with 40.7 lb. in Australia. get more butter than do the people of Great Britain. and other edible fats as a whole, the people in Australia receive less than do the people in the United Kingdom. The summary continuesThe per capita consumption of the nutrient fat was almost identical in the two countries, namely, 122.9 lb. and 121.1 lb. in the United Kingdom and Australia, respectively. The honourable member for Darwin also advocated that Australia should send sugar to the United Kingdom as a Christmas gift. Compliance with that request would not be easy because of transport difficulties. When the late Prime Minister, Mr Curtin, was in Great Britain last year he offered an additional 100,000 tons of sugar to the British Government, but that Government could not accept the offer because of a shortage of shipping. The same reason underlies the placing of a limit on the weight of parcels which may be sent to individuals in Great Britain. That limitation was imposed in order to ensur* the most equitable distribution of foodstuffs to the people of Great Britain rather than that favoured individuals should receive more than others. Realizing the ordeal through which the people of the Old Country have passed and are passing, the Government is sympathetic to these requests, and it will further examine the position. If possible, 1 Darwin with further information regarding it next week. In the meantime, 1 hope that she will read the report to which I have referred. Consideration will be given to the referred.

117,Mr Fobde,"Yes, but taking butterThe following answers to questions were circulated:senting the Acting Minister for Health, upon notice1. What is to be the future position of alien doctors who, during the war, have been perirjitted to practise their profession? 2. Will these doctors be delicensed or will they be absorbed into some scheme of extended medical services in this country, if they desire to remain here? 3. Will he supply the fullest information possible on the matter? ister for Health has supplied the following answers:1. All licences held under the provisions of National Security (Alien Doctors) Regulations lapse on the day on which the National Security Act ceases to he in force. After that date, the registration of medical practitioners and the control of practice becomes entirely a matter for each State. Except in its own territories, the Commonwealth has no authority in the matter. At the Conference of Ministers for Health of the Commonwealth and States on 0-7th December, 1943, it was agreed that each Minister would take back to his Cabinet a recommendation that the registration of alien doctors who have been licensed during the war should be continued after the war. It is understood that in no State has this recommendation been adopted. In two States legislation provision exists for a limited and regional registration of alien doctors. 2 and 3. See answer to 1 above. upon notice1. Did& Royal Australian Air Force Liberator from Tocumwal recently carry prisoner-of-war passengers from Manila to Australia arriving approximately 30 flying hours overdue for its 50-hourly overhaul? 2. (a) Are aircraft from Tocumwal on the Manila-Moratai run using reclaimed lubricating oil? (6) Has this oil been partly responsible for the development of faults in these aircraft? (c) Has there been an unduly high incidence of mechanical faults on this run? 3. Isi t a fact that there-have been delays along the route because of lack of trained ground staff to service and check relief aircraft? 4. Are air-crews required to do work ot these aircraft during their resting periods? 5. Is it a fact that there is no Royal Australian Air Force ground staff organization in Manila? 0. Are Royal Australian Air Force arrangements for billeting and feeding air-crews on this run considered adequate? 7. Has there been criticism within the Royal Australian Air Force of the condition of thes» aircraft, also of the servicing and maintenance arrangements? 8. Is there an adequate safety margin comparable with conditions for civilian travel? 9. Is he satisfied that there is no unnecessary delay in handling passengers and storeBl the honourable member's questions are as 1. Yes; one aircraft returned, having flown 28 hours after a routine inspection became due. The aircraft was despatched at short notice to Manila, carrying medical supplies and, according to technical advices, the decision to postpone the inspection was quite justified in the circumstances. 2. (a) and (6) No. Reclaimed oil is not used in these aircraft, (c) No. Mechanical defects have not been exceptional, either in nature or in frequency. 3. Inquiries have revealed that there have heen no undue delays, notwithstanding that large-scale commitments in relation to prisoners of war had to be undertaken at very short notice. It is quite possible that some calling points were not fully equipped to meet the greatly increased flying commitments, hut, having regard to the extreme urgency of providing all assistance to prisoners of war, everything possible was done with limited facilities at some places. See also reply to 5. 4. Air-crews are given adequate rest on all occasions, except where the saving of life is involved, when their rest may be necessarily curtailed. 5. Manila is outside the Royal Australian Air Force area of responsibility, hut a small party of Royal Australian Air Force technical personnel has been sent to Manila to assist in the handling of Royal Australian Air Force aircraft, but major facilities are supplied hy United States authorities. This follows thegeneral principle of reciprocal aid always followed in this theatre. 6. Yes. 7. No. 8. Yes. 9. Yes; but in an emergency such as exists at present in assisting prisoners of war, there may be cases where reception facilities leavesomething to be desired. Where this occurs, everything is being done to improve the conditions.",52,Papers

The amount of £90,195, spent during 1944-45, covered the payment of compensation resulting from the High Court decision that the Commonwealth should have paid, in respect of the 1942-43 season, a price higher than that determined, and also the writing off of seed debts owed by growers whose crops, failed during the previous season.",54,Thewas Japanese Stfbbendeb At Koepang
