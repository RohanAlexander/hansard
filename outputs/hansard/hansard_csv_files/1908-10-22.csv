24,' Mr Deakin,"The answers to theI move That the Contract Immigrants Act should be amended so as to prevent the employment of coloured or Asiatic labour upon or in connection with ships in Commonwealth ports during the lime of industrial disturbance. The Parliament has not hesitated to go as far as it has deemed desirable, necessary, and proper, in the exercise of the powers conferred upon it. by paragraph xxvii. of section 51 of the Constitution, in pursuance of which it has passed the Immigration Restriction Act, the Pacific Island Labourers Act, and the' Contract Immigrants Act. Under the Immigration Restriction Act, No. 17 of 1901, as amended by the Act of 1905, power is taken to exclude from the Commonwealth "" any person who fails to pass the dictation test."" There were exempted from the operation of those Acts the master and crew of any public vessel of any Government; and the master and crew of any other vessel landing during the stay of the vessel in any port of the Commonwealth, the intention being entirely confined to preventing' the landing of persons whom it is desired to exclude beyond the period of the_stay of a vessel in port. The Contract Immigrants Act of 1905 has an entirely different purpose. It provides that every person who is uncier contract to perform manual labour in the Commonwealth must compiv with certain conditions, and that the terms of his contract must be approved by the Minister. If it is made in contemplation of, or with a view of affecting an industrial dispute; if the remuneration ancl other terms and conditions of employment are not as advantageous to the contract .immigrant as are those current among workers of the same class here; or if the agreement is made before the contract immigrant lands in the Commonwealth, then the Minister may not approve of it . It is very clear that the intention of that statute is to prevent Australian workers being subjected to the competition of cheap labour from other countries, and in particular to protect them from Asiatics and coloured labour. Under the White Australia policy we have declared very emphatically, and, I think, with the endorsement of nine out of every ""ten persons in the Commonwealth, that the competition of coloured labour is undesirable. [53] Under the Contract Immigrants Act, or other statutes which seek to secure the same object, we have not distinguished between one industry and another.. We do not say, for instance, that competition from abroad with bootmakers is undesirable, but that competition with carters or seamen is permissible. We extend the prohibition to al! industries, and the protection, whateverit is, covers the whole sphere of industry. That being so, we have toconsider how the Act operates. If, during the existence of a strike amongst carriers, there came into a Commonwealth port a vessel having on board persons who were willing, and conceivably capable, of performing the work usually done here by those on strike, there can be no doubt that they would not be permitted to land to take the place of the strikers. A contract of employment is"" not necessarily a written one. By far the greater number are not evidenced by one line of writing. A man goes to another, and says"" I wish to work for you "" -and after a few words have been exchanged as to the rates of wages, and hours of duty he is engaged. That procedure has always been regarded as sufficient. Let us assume, therefore, that a vessel comes into the port of Melbourne during the existence of a carter's strike, and that there are on board that vessel a number of passengers or sailors who profess their readiness to take the place of those on strike. In the circumstances, I submit that the Contract Immigrants Act would apply, and that they would not be permitted to take the place of the strikers. The Immigration Restriction Act could and ought to be applied in the same way. Let us assume that there is a. strike amongst sail and tent makers, and that seamen on board a vessel that has come into port, and is to be laid up for three or six months, as often happens, are ready to take on the work of sail-making. Let us assume that they are quite capable, as most seamen are, of doing such work, and that application is made to the skipper for permission to engage a number of them, whilst the vessel is in port, to enable the completion of some work of the kind. Compliance with such an application would be, I contend, a distinct violation of the spirit of the Act. I wish to bring mv illustration a little nearer the point that I desire to reach, and to see how this legislation affects persons engaged in loading and unloading ships. The loading and discharging of vessels is as much an Australian industry",13,Immigration
25,Mr Hughes (West Sydney) [2.39].,"as is the making of boots, clothes, pianos, or 'anything else. It is an performed The fact that part of the work is per' formed on ships belonging to persons in other countries is not at all to the point, nor does it affect my position in the slightest degree, because it cannot affect our right and power to regulate the conditions under which contracts of employment made and carried out in this country. pose that a foreign-owned ship goes into a clock of any sort for repairs. ship painters, dockers, shipwrights, boilermakers, and engineers, and so on, working on the ship. < working on a ship belonging to subjects of another country. would object in the strongest possible way if it were proposed to take from a ship's company an engineer, and to say to him : "" Now that the ship is in Mort's dock, go and work on her."" There would not during an industrial disturbance be one on the dock would turn to. have gone to the extent of declining to allow Australians to encroach upon their particular dustry. complain if the work which properly belongs to a shipwright is done by a ship's joiner, and vice versa; and particularly will an engineer complain if that part of the work which belongs to his trade is done by a boilermaker, or vice versa. When a ship is taken into a dock she is regarded in the light of an ordinary job-just were so much metal, wood, and brass lying about in readiness to build a ship. I venture to say that this must apply to all industries without any exception. begins and ends with the loading and discharging of ships, as regards both coal and general cargo. In coaling, as well as in loading and discharging, some men work on the ship, some men work on a collier, or in a punt or drogher alongside the ship, and some men work on the wharf. these men are equally engaged in loading and discharging or coaling the ship. pose that during a time of industrial disturbance a ship manned exclusively coloured labour comes to this port, it mav be that both parties to the dispute are resolved to submit it to a Court of Arbitration. the ship applies for men in the usual way either to coal, or to load or discharge cargo, she is told that as there is a strike in proMr Hughes. gress, she cannot get any men. Then the industry agent or the manager says: "" V e r v well ; by Australians in Australia. wo will put on our crew,"" and accordingly they put on, say, 200 men, and coal the ship. I understand that during a comparatively recent trouble, an offer was made to assist other vessels out of their difficulty by coaling them with alien labour. Now, the owner of a ship has no more right to be must be relieved of the consequence of an industrial Supdisturbance than has the owner of a warehouse on shore. There is no immunity atThere are taching to a ship-owner which ought not to attach to every person in the country. A ship-owner must comply with our navigaEvery one of those men is tion law, else he cannot make use of our ports. There is before another place a Bill Yet every one of them iu which it is proposed to exclude from participation in the advantages of trading on our coast all vessels which do not comply with local conditionsthat is, including rates of wages and conditions of labour. Now a vessel is permitted under the Immigration Restriction Act to who, under such circumstances, carry on its business with alien labour, In this country, unionists but it is not permitted to land that labour on the wharf until the captain has entered in other trades into a certain bond. It was surely never inintended that these alien labourers should A shipwright, for instance, will enter into competition with our own citizens. Yet after the security has been given, these men are permitted to land and to load ox discharge, not their own vessel, but any vessel. They are in Commonwealth territory and carrying on part of the functions of our industrial machine. It is only an accident, and a negligible accident, as if she that they happen to be on a ship which belongs to subjects of another country. Handling cargo on the wharf, lighter, collegislation lier, hulk or ship, is just as much part of the industry as is the putting on of a sole,, I come now to an industry which cutting out of the upper and finishing, parts of the boot making industry. Exactly the same division of labour marks the operations of the two sets of men I refer to. I submit that to permit persons who are engaged on a ship, simply because they happen to be sailors and bound to obey the lawful comAll mands of their officers, to do that which we prohibit all other men from doing, is to Suppenalize one particular industry and declare that it alone must be exposed to foreign by competition. We have gone to considerable trouble, and taken a great deal of money out of the pockets of the people, to protect When 40 per cent, or 50 per cent, of those who are engaged in the industries of Australia. I do not tie myself down to accuracy, but I venture to say that there must be excluded from tlie operation of any protective Tariff here all shearers, agricultural labourers, seamen, waterside workers, persons engaged in the building trades, and many others. They cannot possibly hope to gain those direct and real benefits which come from a protective Tariff in the trades where it operates. indirectly in the benefits. benefits consists in paying the extra price for the other fellow. While the benefits which one derives are direct and obvious, the benefits derived by the other are indirect, and not at all obvious. While we say to men engaged in the boot industry, "" We will protect you from competition by taxing the goods of other countries, and by preventing persons coming from those countries to manufacture boots here during an industrial disturbance,"" we say to the wharf labourers, coal lumpers, and seaman, ""You must be exposed to all the white, that may happen to be brought against you."" condition of things, and I am certain that it does not represent the intention of the Legislature. If the Act as it stands, permits this sort of thing, I say most emphatically that we have not exhausted our power to make it operative in the direction which I seek. our power in that connection, it is time that we sought an amendment of the Constitution, with a view to obtaining further power. M.r. , BAMFORD -The Government confess that they have no power to do what the honourable member seeks to accomplish. carefully to what the Government may have to say upon the question of whether or not we have exhausted our power. If they contend that we have no power to do what I suggest, and if we act upon such an expression of opinion, I claim that we shall be taking a very unusual course, ancl one which has not previously been followed. We all know that it has been the practice of the Government to take action in anydesired direction, irrespective of whether they possessed the necessary constitutional power, and to allow the High Court to determine the validity of a Statute. But apparently they now intend to anticipate the decision of that tribunal by declaring that they have no power to act in the direction I have indicated. [S3]2 can establish that position, I demand such an amendment of the Constitution as will place the persons whom I represent in this matter upon a level with every other workman in the country. Why should one set of individuals be protected against the competition of coloured labour, whilst another set is exposed to that competition? Of course, they can share Why should one class of persons be permitted to engage in an industrial struggle,, with the f u l l knowledge that nothing unforeseen can disturb the conditions of the local market-wit h whose factors they are perfectly acquainted-whils t the waterside workers may be at any moment exposed to competition, the nature of which they cannot foresee? Under the circumstances, I contend that vessels ought not to be permitted during times of industrial disturbance to undertake, with the' aid of their crews, work which is usually performed by citizens of Australia. I do not care whether those citizens are wharf labourers, painters, engineers, or bootcompetition, both coloured and makers. They should all enjoy-the same measure of protection, and if the law That is a most unfair does not allow us to extend it to them, we should amend the Constitution so as to permit of it. Of course, it may be held that under such circumstances, no contract exists, ancl so the Contract Immigrants Act cannot apply. But I do not think that the facts bear out this contention. I If we have exhausted understand that the person who superintends the stevedoring and coaling of ships is usually an independent contractor. Some ships are stevedored direct by the shipowners, but in the great majority of cases they are stevedored by an independent contractor at so much per ton, or so much per hour. And the coaling of all foreignI shall listen very going ships is performed by contract. Let us assume, then, that a number of persons are uncier contract with the owner or charterer of a vessel to discharge certain duties incidental to its navigation. Upon their arrival in Sydney or Melbourne, let us suppose; that another person who usually coals that ship with certain of his employees, has a dispute with those employees, and is unable to get a supply of labour. Let us further suppose that he goes to the ship-owner or the charterer of the vessel, ancl says to him, "" W ill vou lend me your men to coal your vessel?"" If the ship-owner or charterer consents to do so, I venture to say there is no earthly doubt that a contract for the performance of manual labour If they has been made which is forbidden by the",14,Contrac Timmigrantsact Amendment

I submit, therefore, :hat the provision contained in paragraph b would never be acted upon with a view to permitting a coloured person to claim exemption from the operation of the Act. Under the conditions I Have indicated there Is clearly a contract entered into by immigrants to perform manual labour in this countrya contract other than that made between them and theSr original employer. As this work is almost invariably done by shore labour, if their original employer asks the crew to do it, in effect a fresh contract of employment is made, because an order to do such work is not one of those lawful commands that were contemplated at the time of making the original contract. If it was contemplated at that time, the employer must have had in his mind the possibility of an industrial dispute. If he did have that in his mind, it was a contract within the meaning of the section, which makes Ministerial approval -of the contract conditional upon its not. -being madein contemplation of or with a view of affecting Aa industrial dispute. The set of facts upon .which I am moving related'to the coaling of a vessel. That is work which is invariably undertaken by an independent contractor at so much per ton, to deliver coal for the purpose of taking the steamer to its port of destination. The coloured or coolie crew of the vessel did the coaling, and so were, temporarily at any rate, servants performing manual labour for a contractor, and the contract was made in the Commonwealth. If it was not, if they were working directly for their old employer, if no fresh contract was made for that particular purpose, and Mt. Hughes. the old contract covered it, it must have been a contract made in contemplation of the industrial trouble. by the contractor under a special contract? in any case I submit that the payment has nothing to do with the question. The honfurther inducement held out to seamen to do something not included in their contract could net be recovered. I could' not say whether such an inducement is held out, case the crew worked for their principal employer, or for an independent contractor. In my opinion that is not material. Section4 of the Australian Industries Preservation Act of 1906 provides(1) Any person who, either as principal or as agent, makes or enters into any contract, or is or continues to be a member of or engages in any combination in relation to trade or commerce with other countries or among the StatesWith intent to destroy or injure by means of unfair competition any Australian industry, the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth, having due regard to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers, is guilty of an offence. Penalty : Five hundred pounds. (2) ' Every contract ' made or entered into in contravention of this section shall be absolutely illegal and void. That Act was passed in pursuance of the trade and commerce power given by subsection 1 of section 51 of the Constitution. I do not say that it will apply ,to this particular case, but in it there is clearly a power to prevent anybody, whether in the country or out of it, from doing something which has the effect of injuring or destroying any Australian industry by means of unfair competition. This is an Australian industry; competition by coloured labour must inevitably injure it, and tend to destroy it ; such competition exposes those in the industry to most unfair competition, and cannot be advantageous to the Commonwealth "" having due regard to the interests of producers, workers, and consumers."" Although it may be held that it is very desirable that the ship should get away, and that if labour cannot be obtained here the ship has a perfect right to employ her own crew in order to get away, still there is the Act.

It has regard only to the general effect of legislation. every Act that is passed involves hardship to individuals. legislation it must inevitably be so, but the intention of this legislation is clearly and unmistakably to exclude competition coming from foreign countries, particularly during periods of industrial disturbance. I ask the Government to declare, first, whether, in their opinion, the Act as it stands can deal with that matter-whic h I doubt-o r whether, failing that, they have power under the Constitution as it stands to provide for it . I think they have ample power to do so. They may say that they have doubts, but it is to be noted that when they had no doubts at all they went on cheerfully with legislation which the High Court just as cheerfully vetoed. The Government have gone on most enthusiastically passing Acts of Parliament of the most comprehensive character, apparently for no other purpose than to provide a chopping block for the exercise of the ingenuity and judicial foresight of the High Court. I want to know what the Government propose to do in the matter.

I take it that that is the honourable member's meaning. motion refers only to labour done upon, or in connection with, a ship, but I take it that the honourable member intends to deal with the broad principle. It is true, as the honourable member has said, that this Parliament has already considered the question of persons coming to Australia under contract with a view of affecting industrial disturbances. Undoubtedly the policy p f this Parliament has been not to encourage-in fact, to prohibit-the introduction of immigrants under contract, where a strike is in contemplation, or with a view of affecting an industrial dispute. Parliament has expressed that general policy. Speaking personally, I think that there is a great deal to be said in favour of the position which the honourable member has submitted, because undoubtedly the intention of Parliament was that immigrants should not be allowed to be introduced with a view of affecting any industrial disturbance whether on a wharf, or in a factory, or in the back parts of the country. If immigrants do come into Australia under contract to perform services in connection with what I may call wharf work, their introduction is in conI take it that the contravention of the policy of the Act. I ask the House to remember that our immigration legislation deals with two subjects. First of all, under the Immigration Restriction Act, we exercise what I may call a Commonwealth police power of keeping out of Australia all undesirable immigrants, including coloured immigrants. But under the Contract Immigrants Act, we deal with a special class of labour relating to those who come to Australia under contract to perform manual labour. The whole of our legislation contained in those two Statutes is based upon our power to deal with immigration, but as yet we have had no authoritative interpretation of what constitutes immigration under the Constitution.

The view taken by Sir Edmund Barton when he was administering the Department of External Affairs, and also the view taken by the then Attorney-General, the present Prime Minister, and by the late Mx. Kingston, was that the crews of vessels landing during the stay of the vessel and doing certain work ashore were not immigrants and did not come within the prohibition. That is the present position. The Contract Immigrants Act deals with persons who come into Australia as immigrants under contract ; and the essence of being under contract involves an intention to remain to perform the contract. But so f a r it has not been decided whether mere entry into the Commonwealth does constitute immigration. Section8 of the Act saysThe two last preceding sections do not apply are registered under the Commonwealth to an immigrant under a contract or agreement law. to serve as part of the crew of a vessel engaged in the coasting trade in Australian waters, if . the rates of wages specified therein are not people in Sydney are under the Commonlower than the rates ruling in the Commonwealth law. wealth.

That general policy is one upon which Parliament has legislated; but the honourable member for West Sydney asks whether persons who are so employed -come within the meaning of the Act as immigrants under contract to do the work. The view that has been taken is that, under the Act, such persons are not immigrants, seeing that they do not intend to remain in Australia, but are members of crews simply passing through the country. conclusion from the facts. a vessel calling at say, Sydney, desires to get away as quickly as possible, and, to that end, the crew do the work instead of the shore men. but we have to ask ourselves whether such persons are or are not immigrants. grants, what are they? crew staying for a time in Australia, with the intention of going on. ber of the crew undertook another job in town during the stay of the ship, would he not then be an immigrant? still come within the exemption. be altered ! pen. cases have happened.' paragraph k, of the Immigration Restricing during the stay of the vessel in any port in the Commonwealth : Provided ihat the master and before being permitted to clear out from or leave the port, muster the crew in the presence of an officer.

In that case members of the crew of a vessel went ashore, and loaded trucks with timber from the vessel. It could not be said that they were performing the duties of a crew, because they participated in an industrial work ordinarily carried on by our own people. I must confess that, in such a case, I find it difficult to distinguish them from contract immigrants as regards a matter of policy. The policy of the Contract Immigrants Act is to keep out of industrial occupations, during the time of a dispute, those whose presence might provoke a brqach of the peace. That is the principle.

I pointed out that while the employ6s in a Department are represented by one elected member on the Appeal Board, the Department is represented by the Public Service Inspector, and its permanent head. In my opinion the Appeal Board ought to possess three qualifications. In the first place, it should be impartial; it ought to be beyond suspicion, and to command the full confidence of the the reply given to the honourable member service and the public. I.want honourable unsatisfactory ? members to consider whether it possesses those qualities. I maintain that it is not impartial, for the reason that the Public Service Commissioner insists upon unithe various Departments.

I do not think that possibly give an unbiased opinion upon the Commissioner-o r even the Inspector. work with which he cannot possibly be on mature consideration, is likely to admit familiar? This Board ought to possess that what he did was wrong. The conthe confidence of the Department, and of sequence is that having the power he will ""the public, but it cannot do so whilst in at once say, "" The appointment I made in justices are perpetrated throughout the In another minute the dethe first place was quite in accordance with the merits of the officer."" I do not think that the history of the service will show that, in every instance, officers have been dealt with justly. The head of a Department has his favourites. If he desires a certain officer to be promoted to a vacant position he informs the Inspector that that officer is the most qualified to fill it , and the Inspector ' reports accordingly to the Commissioner, who, since 'his duties extend over the whole of the Commonwealth, cannot possibly make himself acquainted with the work of the officers in all branches of the service. He is dependent upon the advice of the Public Service Inspectors, who, in their turn, are dependent upon the advice tendered to them by the heads of Departments. Only to-day, I asked when the Public Service Inspectors in Victoria, New South Wales, and South Australia, had examined the work of all the officers in those States. The reply which I received was not satisfactory, because I am sure that, in one of those States, no examination of . the work performed by all officers has taken place during the past live years. that the' Inspectors had made themselves familiar with the work of the officers of The mitted to interject.

I could mention the names of officers who have been unjustly treated, but, inasmuch as they are not permitted to exercise political influence, I shall refrain from doing so. WereI to publicly innounce their names, they would, doubtless, be penalized for having committed a breach of the Public Service Regulations. I could cite numerous instances in which junior officers have been promoted over the heads of -their seniors, notwithstanding that the latter possessed undeniable qualifications. Thestereotyped reply given to appeals in this connection in the case of telegraphists is as followsNo appeal lies in connection with the advancement of telegraphists previously their juniors to the fourth class, and the expert judgment of the Department does not support their claims to be regarded as equal in telegraphic ability to the officers who have been promoted.

In his place we should have either a State Judge or a stipendiary or a police magistrate. The Board having decided whether an officer has been justly or unjustly treated, would forward its report straight to the Governor General, who would act upon its finding.

He has been prepared to demonstrate that he was equal to any duties that might be imposed on him in the Department.

There is nothing in the Act which gives the Public Service Commissioner or any other officer the power to say . that no appeal lies in the matters with which I am dealing, whilst the Act distinctly says that any officer may appeal to a Board, and it provides what the Board shall do after evidence has been taken in an inquiry. an officer to appeal when some one else has been appointed to the position, and the Commissioner tells him, "" It"" cannot be heloed ""? it stands, it is of no use at all, but under fhe amendment proposed by the honourable member for West Sydney, an officer would have some chance of securing fair play. all proposed appointments shall be gazetted before they are made. that the chief officer of a Department, or the elected representative of a Division, might be biased. He did not say that they would be. Mr HU ME COOK I said that in reply to an interjection by the honourable member for West Svdney. matter; the Minister made the admission that the chief officer of a Department and the elected representative of a Division on the Board of Appeal might be biased. But, presuming that that is so, what is clone uncier existing conditions is to call in another officer of the Public Service, who is sure to be biased, to decide between the two officers who might be biased. The Minister must admit that when a case comes before him the Public Service Inspector must give judgment in such a way as will insure uniformity in the service. Board is undoubtedly unfairly constituted. section the doubt about that. The Public Service Inspector is under the instructions of the Public Service Commissioner. I am. not saying that the Public Service Commissioner would do what he knows to be unfair. I believe that he does what he believes to be in the best interests of the community. But the view which he takes of any matter may not be the view which others would take of it. bound to uphold the opinion of his subordinates. ister admits that. The Public Service Inspector is an officer who, on account of the position he holds, and the view he is expected to take, must be prejudiced. The Minister says that the proposal of the honourable member for West Sydney would place the Commonwealth service in the hands of a State officer, and that that is something which has not been clone before.

All that is asked by the honourable member for West Sydney to be done is precisely what we have to do under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act.' The Judge of the Arbitration Court delegates his powers to a State magistrate. Surely, if we do that in a matter affecting the whole of the industries of the Commonwealth, we can do it in a smaller matter.

If it is considered that the power will be unfairly exercised, I am prepared to substitute a layman for the Judge. The Minister said that a Judge would have no knowledge of the principles which guided the Commissioner and the Inspectors in coming to a decision. That means that, in the Minister's opinion, a Judge could not take an unprejudiced view of the situations. It is also an admission that the Public Service Commissioner and his Inspectors never take an unprejudiced view. It is said that there are certain principles which guide the Commissioner and his Inspectors, and the Minister's objection to the Bill is tliat a Judge would not take the same view. that the Judge would simply sit, hear the evidence, and adjudicate upon the facts. He would not require to have a knowledge of the service, any more than the Judge of the Arbitration Court possesses a knowledge of the many ramifications of industry coming under his review. In the same way, the Judge, hearing appeals under the Public Service Act, would obtain whatever technical knowledge he required from the officers of the Department. If the head of the Department placed the case unfairly before him, the representative of the employees would point out the discrepancies in the evidence tendered; and if the Judge, was. not satisfied, there would Commissioner does not want an alteration be nothing to prevent his calling other witnesses, and making sure that he ascertained the true facts of the easel. I am certain that the Minister must be convinced that a fair thing is not being done to the employees at present. As Chairman of the Postal Commission, he must know that the service is seething with dissatisfaction. Anything that can be done to remove that discontent, if only temporarily, and as an experiment, will be to the advantage of the service. I am sure that the members of the service would cheerfully submit to any effort that was honestly made to better the system. I believe that it is the desire of the Government to have not only an efficient service, but one which we can show to the whole world as being a service, the members of which are well paid and properly treated, whilst their grievances have only to be stated to te remedied, if they are genuine. Tf those conditions were brought about, I am certain we s'hould very rapidly have a better state of things than exists to-day. Mr Hutchison. [5.56] -The honourable member for Hindmarsh has delivered what I believe to be a very good speech on this question. I have on previous occasions heard him make remarks as to the injustice done tb officers of the service. I have also listened to a very spirited address from the honourable member for Melbourne Ports on the same subject. It will be admitted that the Public Service is a difficult one for the Commissioner to manage. A more conscientious man for the post we could not have. That he fails to give satisfaction to everyone is only what we might expect. But it is my conviction that he does his very best to do justice all round, and to promote the true interests of the service. But I point out Where so many hundreds of thousands of pounds are spent we should be very slow indeed to recommend a change in management. But the change that is now recommended is not a radical one, and it is not made because the Commissioner's work has not been appreciated. I believe it is a change that would make a success of a service that at the present time unfortunately is regarded as anything but successful. sioner's view is that the change would have a reverse effect. made in the Act while he is at the head of the service; but I believe that if he occupied a seat in this House a similar proposal would be made by himself. We cannot expect the Commissioner to say that he has not given satisfaction to the service. Any honourable member who looks through the voluminous report that the Commissioner has presented to Parliament will realize how many are the difficulties with which he has had to-grapple. We also learn from his report that he has been approached by Ministers in the making of appointments of which he did not approve. have been made in defiance of the Commissioner's recommendation. Minister in particular persisted in his recommendations, and almost made himself offensive to the Commissioner in pressing the appointment of officers-as for instance, in pressing the appointment of an officer of the Post Office to be Assistant Secretary to the Department with a view",38,Second Reading

387,Mr Henry Willis,"Yes. One of making him Secretary in the future. These are interferences with the work of the Commissioner that have occurred quite recently. I know of a great number of cases where appointments have been 'made upon the recommendation of Ministersrecommendations that juniors should be promoted over the heads of seniors who have served a long time. It was a feature of the Public Service Act that was thought to be an improvement upon the old system that merit was to have consideration over long service. Buti f that principle is to be to promote the interests of any officer of -enforced generally, I can see that it will conduce to a state of affairs as corrupt as was theioid system. The head of the Department, having recommended a junior for an appointment as being a more efficient officer than certain seniors, the effect can only be to cause dissatisfaction to men who have, perhaps, been in the service for a very much longer period. Some time ago I brought under the notice of the House a case in Sydney, which was a public scandal. been remedied. where officers have been twenty and twenty-five years in the service and comparatively junior officers have been put over, their heads at higher remuneration. These are great hardships. The tendency on the part of honourable members is, I think, in the direction of putting the service under a responsible Minister. by so doing, we should simply have made political appointments similar to those which were formerly made. That would simply be going from bad to worse. At present an officer can appeal against the appointment of a person over his head. An officer in another State can appeal against the appointment of an officer, say, in Victoria, to a position for which he thinks he is qualified. I think that is a good system. The expense of hearing a case of the kind is a mere bagatelle in comparison to the injury done to the service if another officer efficient officer. He stood high in the seris wronged, and has no right of appeal. I cannot imagine what the Minister is thinking of in objecting to such an alteration of the present system as is now proposed. At the present time Ministers exercise a great deal of influence. When1 first became a member of Parliament I received a number of letters asking me to use my influence with the Minister. understood that a member of Parliament had not a right to be heard in such matters. I mentioned this opinion to the head of one of the Departments, and he said to me, "" Oh, you are mistaken; on this very matter we have already had half-adozen gentlemen here using their influence."" was before the Public Service Commissioner was appointed. have never been to the Public Service Commissioner since he was appointed, nor have I been to the head of any Department the service. member does not understand how to do it. Honourable members opposite know how these things are done. do this: If an officer has a case and states it to me, I send on his letter without comment. I believe that a public servent who writes to a member of Parliament concerning his position in the service It has not is liable to a penalty under the Act. If I know of other cases he writes to a member he does so at his own risk. I fail to find anything unreasonable in the proposal that a Board shall be appointed to hear appeals by public servants who consider they have been unfairly treated. might be in a remote part of the country But and, in such cases, these Boards might involve great cost. but members of the service would know that they would have to make out a good case, and would not rashly appeal. They would know that they must speak at once or for ever hold their peace. This Bill will give general satisfaction in the service, and, if carried, will protect the Commissioner from disagreeable insinuations of the kind that have been made in regard to him. The Public Service Commissioner is a most vice in New South Wales, and, before he was selected for his present position, I do not think any one heard a public servant speak ill of him. As it is, many are dissatisfied because they imagine that they are not advanced in the service as they ought to be. That, after all, is only human nature. I believe that the Commissioner I does his work fearlessly and well, but I do not think he does it so well as it would be done if he had the assistance of the proposed' Board of three members, to deal with malcontents.

I have only to say, in conclusion, that this Bill will, in my opinion, provide a remedy for many troubles, and that I hope it will be carried. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [6.9] I fully agree with the concluding remark made by the honourable member for Hindmarsh that it is of the utmost importance that there should be contentment in the Public Service. As to the interjection made by the honourable member for Parramatta that it might be necessary under this Bill to constitute fifty Boards of Appeal, I would reply that it would be far better to have even fifty Boards .appointed to deal with the grievances of the public servants, than to have a dissatisfied arid, consequently, an inefficient service.

To my mind, it touches only the fringe of. the reforms necessary, and might well be carried' a good deal further. ""Under the principal Act, we have what are called Boards of Inquiry, and also Appeal Boards.

WheneverI met him he acted as a gentleman, and so far as I could see he acted fairly.

So far as I know, he is a very fair man. matter ? Mr J. H . CATTS I am not speaking of the man personally. I now come to another matter. The Parliament deliberately enacted section 50 of the Act, which gives the right of appeal to the officers of the Department, and which saysAny officer (except officers of the Parliament) affected by any report or recommendation made report or recommendation made or action taken under sections 31, 46 to 49 inclusive, 65, 66, and 73 thereof may. Those sections do not apply to advancement in the service. Section 31 enables a special appointment to be made by the Governor General on the recommendation of the Public Service Commissioner. Sections 46 to 49 refer to matters of discipline and offences which are dealt with by a Board of Inquiry. Section 65 relates to questions of incompetency and provides for a reference to a Board of Inquiry. Section 66 deals with acts of bankruptcy on the part of officers, while section 73 relates to the retirement of officers at the age of sixty years. Those are the provisions of the Act which are exempted from the operation of section 50; but otherwise that section says that in all cases any officer, except an officer of the Parliament, shall have the right of appeal to an Appeal Board. For the last eighteen months in New South Wales, although there have been hundreds of grievances under section 50, the Commissioner has prevented every one of those cases from being referred to the Appeal Board.",41,Second Reading

I did not, and do not, desire to restrict legitimate discussion, but there must be a rule to confine honourable members in some measure to the subject before the Chair. press the matter further than to say that your statement, sir, clears the ground very much. As I understood it, the honourable member for Wide Bay was proceeding to refer to the construction of a trawler, which is provided for in the Estimates. It occurred to me that that was a matter we might legitimately discuss. I venture to. submit with the greatest deference that the whole question of private versus Government employment, and that, broadly, is Socialism, may be, perhaps, more properly than any other question discussed in connection with the Estimates. finance. member dealing with the point of order? the motion which I have handed in. As a matter of fact, we are engaged now in the consideration of Estimates the Standing Orders provide that, if vour ruling is to be questioned, action must be taken at once? In this case the honourable member for Parramatta did not raise the point until after the honourable member for Wide Bay had resumed his speech. whole objection. It is not worth continuing the discussion, particularlv now that the point is made clear. cuss a most important subject that_is interesting people in every part of the world, and receiving the attention, not only of those who are looking after our material welfare in this world, but of those who are concerned with our welfare when we are no longer here. It is a subject of interest to the most learned men in the world, to the leaders of advanced thought, and also to the man in the street, but it will be quite sufficient for me to discuss our own little attempts at concerted social action by drawing clear attention to a matter tliat : was discussed in this Parliament earlier, and in regard to which I regret that our best efforts to assist the employees engaged in certain industries in Australia, have not been successful. I refer to our endeavour in 1906 to discover a method whereby we could assure to the employees in those industries the receipt of fair and reasonable remuneration for their labour. No honourable member of this House, and no honest member of the community, can feel anything but the deepest regret at the failure of our attempt to assure to the employees in the harvester and other industries the remuneration that a Judge of the Arbitration Court considered that they were entitled to. secure that before, so you always told us.",44,Brown Ther E Is No Monwealth And The States Governments

He knows that I never said that protection could assure to the workmen fair and reasonable conditions oflabour. I have never been so foolish as to believe that it would, and that is why the Labour Party, from the beginning, declared that protection was not a solution of this social problem. That is why the one party that came to this Parliament with no definite fiscal policy to provide a cure, asserted that neither free trade nor : protection would protect the worker, and put forward the new policy that wherever protection is given to the employer, It shall be accompanied by assured protection to the employee. suming public? will have a share of the benefit. As an illustration, let me refer the honourable member for Illawarra to the Newport workshops, which are a State socialistic inwill swear again and again in cross-examistitution. I am glad the honourable member for Flinders is present, for he can confirm what I say. The evidence given before two select Committees and one Royal Commission in Victoria, showed that every equipment for .the railway service could be produced at those workshops 21 per cent, cheaper than they could be bought from a private firm. I think the honourable member for Flinders will agree with me there. Mr W. H . IRVINE I believe that locomotives are produced there as cheaply as they coulcl be obtained elsewhere. -that I read, was to the effect that there was a saving of 21 per cent. There we have a State monopoly where the workmen get better wages, the apprentices are better paid, the conditions of labour are better than those offered by outside u^rms, and yet an article can be turned out there for the rest of the people-the consumers -ra t ai cheaper rate than is charged by private enterprise. Why, if the workmen have improved conditions in every way, and the consumer gets the article cheaper, should we be afraid to give that advantage to the people? Why should we fear to take steps to provide better conditions of employment and at the same time a cheaper article for the general public? [54] Even taking the statement of the honourable member for Flinders, that the article is produced at as low a price as that ai which it can be obtained elsewhere plies in the case of the Sydney railway workshops. but I shall not confine myself even toP those illustrations to prove the fact.

We have found to our cost that the very desire of this Parliament to assist those manufacturers has permitted them to use the most contemptible means to deprive, the workmen of their just rights. They came pleading to the Government for assistance, saying, "" If you do not give us protection from capitalistic competition from abroad our industries will be destroyed."" I am not here to challenge that statement, for I believe there was a. good deal of truth in it. They said, "" It is not we alone that will suffer, for our workmen will suffer also if our industries are destroyed."" The Government therefore submitted their statement to Parliament, and Parliament agreed to give protection to the McKay Harvester Company and all the others engaged in similar industries.

WhatI am most concerned about is that honourable members shall agree to make provision for a referendum enabling the people to decide this question for themselves. whatever views they may hold upon the question, they will not take any action which would debar the people from an opportunity of saying whether they believe in the suggested' amendment of the Constitution or not. I go so far in the matter as to say that even if I were opposed to an amendment of the Constitution to confer upon this Parliament larger powers in the matter of industrial legislation, I should still be prepared to have the question submitted to the people for their decision. In my opinion, it would be a serious thing to deny the people an opportunity to express their opinion on this question. no doubt that honourable members will exercise their rights as representatives of the people, in deciding the form which the question to be submitted at. the referendum shall take. far, I trust it will be given the serious and fair consideration, which may be expected from any Parliament constituted as this Parliament is.

546,Mr Watson,"I desire to point out that; hat no matter what business appeared on *.he notice-paper, the discussion of it in detail might be anticipated. I submit that under the Standing Orders, while a general reference may be made to the question of naval defence, it is not competent for honourable members, in this debate, to go beyond such a general reference in dealing with the subject. with a motion. I do not disagree -with the ruling which you have given, in view of he terms of the Standing Orders under which we are at present working. But I propose to take action in this matter in urder to emphasize the necessity of some .alteration of the standing order on which your ruling is based. I can best achieve my object, I think, by giving my reasons ('or dissenting from that ruling. If it is to hold good, honourable members must see that it would be quite possible, at any time, for any member of the House, for the Government, or for any member put up by the Government, to put a motion on the paper dealing with any question, of importance, the early discussion of which might lie inconvenient, and then, by raising a technical point of order, founded upon the fact that such a motion appeared on the 'nisiness-paper, prevent the discussion of the particular subject with which it dealt. That, it will be seen, would lead to a state of affairs that would be intolerable in a free Parliament. I have not a shadow of -doubt that your ruling is given in accordance with the incomplete and very undesirable Standing Orders under which we are working.

I respectfully move That the ruling of Mr Chairman, namelyThat the Committee is not entitled to discuss the naval defence policy of the Government, notwithstanding the fact that a number of items affecting naval defence appear in the Estimates -be dissented from. member for Wide Bay has moved dissent from my ruling, "" That the Committee is not entitled to discuss the naval defence policy of the Government."" Let me say that that was not my ruling. I ruled distinctly that the honourable member was not entitled to anticipate a question already on the paper-that the honourable member would be out of order in discussing the details of naval matters, owing to the fact that a certain amendment, dealing with that subject, is already on the business-paper. Standing order 274 distinctly saysNo member shall digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion; nor anticipate the discussion of any other subject which appears on the notice-paper. tion now before the Committee? the Committee is that the vote for the President's salary be agreed to. The practice in this Chamber, has been to permit a general discussion on the financial policy of the Government to take place on the first item of the Estimates. defence is a part of that policy. this matter was that the honourable member for Wide Bay was not in order in proceeding to discuss details connected with the proposed naval defence, whilst I agreed that he was at liberty to make a general reference to the question. If I permitted a general discussion of the question by the honourable member, another honourable member might desire to continue such a discussion to-morrow or the next day. In the circumstances, I have ruled that the honourable member would not be in order in discussing the matter in detail. but at present T. am unable to see that there is any real conflict. If . I may be pardoned for saying so, the purpose of the amendment on the paper in the name of the honourable member for Flinders is perfectly clear. It is that we should not discuss land defence until we have determined our naval policy. It might be any kind of naval policy, and it relates only to the order in which the two questions must be considered. The honourable member proposes that we consider the naval policy first, and then the military policy of universal service. I think the honourable member for Wide Bay would at once accept that as a warning",52,Brown Ther E Is No Monwealth And The States Governments

555,Mr Deakin,"It may be my misfortune,that he should not discuss the question of whether the naval policy should be considered before the question of universal training, or whether universal training sliould be considered before the question of naval defence. So far as I heard the honourable member's remarks, they did not trench upon any such question. I understood him to be commending previous proposals in relation to naval defence, made by the honourable member for Southi Sydney when at the head of a Government of which he and the honourable member for Wide Bay were both members. able member for Wide Bay to commend those proposals on account of their likeness to certain naval proposals which are now being made. where those two arguments even cross. vented from discussing the policy involved in proposals on the Estimates, we may as .well close the debate. that the honourable member for Wide Baymust not discuss the subject-matter of the motion of the honourable and learned member for Flinders does not impose the slightest limitation upon his present line of argument. the whole question. at the present juncture. It will be time enough to discuss other possibilities when they become actual. I submit that you, Mr Chairman, are not called upon to withdraw your ruling, and that the honourable member for Wide Bay need not be asked to change the course of his remarks. Mr W. H . IRVINE I agree with what the Prime Minister has said as to the general character of the. amendment standing on the notice-paper in my name; but, although I think that we should try to find a way out of the difficulty, it does not seem to me that he has shown us one. A similar question arose earlier in the evening. The broad principle involved is whether, in the Budget debate, a member should be confined within the narrow limits which you, Mr Chairman, have indicated. Standing order 274, which applies to proceedings both in the House and in Committee, saysNo member shall digress from the subject matter of any question under discussion. enforce. Mr W. H . IRVINE-It must be considered a counsel of perfection rather than a hard and fast rule, and in the Budget debate must be applied with the utmost laxity, honourable members being left perfectly free to deal with the principles and policy of every political party. This freedom has led, and may lead to long debates; but it is the inherent right of any member during the discussion of the Budget. Therefore, I think the leader of the Labour Party was justified in asking for the decision of the Committee for f u ture guidance. We should settle whether we are to have the fullest liberty in the discussion of the Budget to deal with every question of policy in all its aspects. To limit us would be to depart from the traditions of not only the House of Commons, I am unable to see but the Parliaments of the States, and from the practice of this Parliament. stake in this discussion. The question which we are now asked to determine has cropped up previously, and has been ruled upon by other presiding officers, it having always been held here, as in the Parliaments ot the States, that, the Budget debate being practically a discussion of grievances, differs from all others in that those taking part in it may discuss in the not freest manner possible every question of policy involved in the proposals of the Government. It is true that if the Standing Orders were strictly applied this would not be possible, and the Budget debate would have to be very soon brought to an end, because so many questions have been anticipated by proposals on the notice-paper. But the practice has been to allow the widest latitude, other Chairmen', and even Mr Speaker, having held that the fullest liberty must be conceded to every speaker. On Tuesday last the honourable member for Corio took exception to the precedence given to a motion of no confidence, and his point, that precedence should not have been given, would have been incontrovertible, bad the matter to be determined only by reference to the Standing Orders. But Mr Speaker ruled, as I think you, sir, will rule now. that the usage of Parliament must also be considered. The Standing Orders provide certain rules for the conduct of debates : but if they were administered with absolute strictness, they would prove unworkable. There must be exceptions, of which",53,Brown Ther E Is No Monwealth And The States Governments

The Kanaka Bill now before the Commonwealth Parliament will, if carried into effect, seriously diminish the production of sugar in Queens-land, and on a large portion of the NorthEast coast tliere is no other agricultural industry their first allegation, that it was physiunder such legislation that can take its place. 3. That the proposed legislation, if it becomes law, may benefit ^ few large mill-owners in the south of Queensland and New South Wales, while, at,the same time, ruining a small number of small growers in North Queensland, many of whom, in good faith, and on the understanding that there would be no sudden alteration in the existing labour conditions, and that Kanaka introduction would not be abolished until a sufficient substitute was provided mortgaged their homes as security for loans amounting to 500,000. This was expended in the erection of co-operative sugar mills. mills will now, in many cases, be worth scrap iron. 4. The association protests against the treating of the sugar, tariff, and labour questions as one, maintaining that they are all quite distinct. As the Queensland sugar industry employs some men at high wages, men of European race, numbering with dependents about 2S,ooo, besides affording a large market for southern manufacturers and producers, it also is exposed to the most severe competition of cane sugars grown and manufactured entirely with coloured labour, costing is. a day in Java and Mauritius, and fromEuropean beet sugar produced with labour costing is. and 2s. a day, and State subsidies by export bounties, it is most deserving of protection, apart from the fact that it also employs ,9,000 Kanakas. We also point out that under the Federal Tariff the cost of production will be considerably increased because of the new duties on imp'Iements and machinery. We also desire to have it clearly understood that the sugar industry in Queensland claims protection to counteract the bountyfed sugar and sugar produced wholly by cheap coloured labour, quite apart from the question of Kanaka labour. Resolutions 5, 6, 7, and 8 aTe couched in a similar strain. Honourable members will observe that the first resolution declares that it is a physical impossibility to successfully grow sugar with white labour, and that the difficulty is not a financial^ one. The third resolution affirms that the legislation, which the Commonwealth has since enacted, but which at the time was under review, would injure the sugar industry in the north, and benefit only a few large mill-owners in the south of Queensland and in New South Wales. It also affirmed that the co-operative sugar mills, upon the erection of which £1,500,000 had been expended, would be worth only scrap iron. It further alleged that the industry was that it employed 9,000 Kanakas."""" In reply to these allegations, I invite honourable, members to look at the returns from the sugar industry to-day. The effect of seven years' experience of Commonwealth legislation has been to transform the position. One could forgive the cane-growers if they had proved to be wrong in only cally impossible for white men to successfully produce sugar.' When the Excise upon that article was £ 3 per ton,' and the bounty only £ 2 per ton, the planters were not anxious to get rid of the Kanaka; but immediately the Excise was increased to £ 4 per ton, and the bounty to £ 3 per ton -whic h increase did not make a farthing's difference to the Commonwealth revenue, but merely penalized the employment of These coloured labour to the extent of another pound per tona great manv of the growers broke their agreements with the Kanakas. Some of them had previously declared that the Pacific Islanders were employed for the religious instruction and' benefit of the latter. But the moment it became profitable to get rid of them, these same planters had no hesitation in breaking their agreements. History has also demonstrated that the growers were absolutely wrong in affirming that as a result of Commonwealth legislation the industry would"" suffer in Queensland, whilst in New South Wales it would be benefited. But the fact is that sugar production in New South Wales is decreasing, whilst in Northern Queensland it is steadily increasing. Mr J. H . CATTS -That is largely dueto the success of the dairy farming industry in Northern New South Wales. the cause may be.

That, of course, would be a financial absurdity. we have had to take that means of doing the right thing, because we are "" cabin'd, cribb'd, confin'd "" by the Constitution. If we had the original powers even of the smallest State we should not be in this diffitional embarrassments; because the five culty, which will continue to embarrass us -during the next two or three years. I presume that we shall have to put up with it . Personally, apart altogether from the fact that Queensland is the great sugar-producing country, and that the difficulty was chiefly felt there, I feel that any price was cheap to get rid of the great coloured labour question. One has only to think of the trouble that the United States of America have had to bear in that regard to realize what a blessing it is that we are practicallyfree from the race problem. The emphatic declaration of the Federal Parliament in -its first session for a White Australia, and its readiness to pav for it , had a good effect, not only here, but throughout the world. I shall always feel proud of the action which Parliament took in that regard. If the Treasurer could retain the ,£340,000 which is now lost to the Commonwealth Treasury through the operation of the Sugar Excise and Bounty Acts, I should be able to say a great deal more pleasant, things to him than I am able to say now with regard to old-age pensions. When I had the honour of submitting to this Parliament a motion affirming the urgency of making provision for Federal invalid and old-age pensions, I thought that the time had come to set aside some revenue for that purpose under the Surplus Revenue Act, which tlie Government have the fullest right to be proud of having introduced and carried. But I felt that we ought not, as a party, to let that opportunity pass without making it clear that an Invalid and Old-age PensionsB ill should be brought in, and an Act for the purpose put into operation at the earliest possible moment'. The Government are entitled to the credit of showing a legal means of accumulating a fund to enable old-age pensions to be paid. Holding that view, I moved in this House that the question was one of urgency, and that it be a direction to the Government to bring in such a B ill . The Government accepted the proposition. I admit that criticism was hurled at me and at the party to which I belong for not having taken action sooner.

That is the view I take of Government responsibility. Let me give, an illustration of what might take place. I can remember a time, in 1893-that is the year when financial disaster overtook the whole of the Colonieswhen the Defence Department of Queensland made a demand upon the Treasurer for a certain sum and its permanent head declined to do with less money. Tbe Minister who was in charge of tbe Defence Department could not cut down the Estimates; but fortunately the iPremier bad other ideas of what Government was. He told the permanent head to take back the estimates and reduce the amount by one-half. The permanent head said, that it could not be done. The Premier said, "" I asked you to do the work because I thought that you would have known best which half to strike out. Kindly leave my office and I shall do it myself,"" and he did. That is the kind of administration which is absolutely necessary if ' we are to finance the country in a difficulty. took the management of the Department out of the Minister's hands. available with which to administer the affairs of the Colony. He could not spend the amount required on defence and have a solvent Colony, and as the head of the Department could not cut down the estimates he did it for him. It was really marvellous how the Defence Department discovered what they could do with the one-half of the amount originally demanded. We did not notice any material difference, and the one-half was saved. I do not like the idea qf these revelations being made. It would be out of place for me, a much younger member than the Treasurer, to do more than express my views, in the hope that the precedent will not be followed. He announced that his Budget speech would be sent, not only throughout the Commonwealth, but perhaps to all the countries of the world. I regret that it contains comparative tables showing what the Departments wanted, what the Ministers said they wanted, and what the Treasurer was In my opinion a but also to a great waste of public money.
