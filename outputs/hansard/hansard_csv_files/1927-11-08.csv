The surrender of Grovernment ownership of the Commonwealth Line will act to the serious detriment of Australian producers and will subject the whole community to exploitation by the Shipping Combine against which thc Government Line is at present the only effective safeguard. I have adopted this course because I believe that tbe Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers is not being given tbe sympathetic administration which is necessary to conserve the best interests of the people of Australia.

3,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [3.2],"Ithe report which had appeared in the daily press regarding a contemplated disposal of the line correctly stated the intention of the Government. The right honourable gentleman replied that in the course of a week or two he would outline to honourable members the policy of the Government on the matter. We cannot afford further delay, because there is ample evidence to j u s t i fy tbe conclusion that the frequent declarations which have been made regarding the sale of progress. gentleman may in f o rm the House that no definite proposal to dispose of the Line is to be made by tbe Government. In anticipation of such a pronouncement I wish to place before honourable members a statement which appeared in last Friday's Melbourne Argus. It may be argued taken action on a newspaper report. My answer is that if this statement were incorrect it ' was the duty of to deny it at the earliest opportunity. It readsnet has definitely decided to dispose of the Confmonwealth Shipping Line. Its policy was endorsed to-day at a joint meeting of members of the Nationalist and Country parties held at Parliament House. For several years the conduct of the Commonwealth Shipping Line has been a source of worry to Ministers, and since the presentation to Parliament of the report of the Public Accounts Committee, which conducted an exhaustive investigation into the Government's shipping activities, further consideration has been given to the matter by the Cabinet. When members of the Nationalist and Country parties assembled to-day thoy joined forces, at the suggestion of their leaders, and were addressed at length by the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), who, after dealing with the history of the Lino, made it clear that he was of the opinion that it should not be continued as a Government activity. In view of the heavy financial losses that are occurring on the running of the ships under the stringent conditions prescribed by the Austerprise in the shipping industry. He tralian Navigation Act, he expressed the view that the Line should be disposed of. This view, he stated, was shared by other members of the Cabinet, who had given earnest con-"" , side-ration to the report of the Public Acit is not very great, and I do not think it is counts Committee. A similar statement appeared in the for continuing to carry on the shipping Sydney press. "" It is idle to contend that business. that does not j u s t if y my action. WA t that time the right honourable gentleshould have from the Government a man was a private member, and evidently well-defined policy that would leave in the minds of the public not the slightest doubt regarding tbe future of the Line. The welfare of the primary producers in particular is dependent upon their being saved at all costs from the clutches of the Shipping Combine in the marketing of their products overseas. It is necessary for action to be taken immediately to have the matter placed on a proper basis. I shall endeavour to prove to honourable members the Line bave hindered its that this Government has hampered The right honourable rather than assisted tbe operations of the Line. It is most unfai r to talk about placing the Line on a proper financial basis. Keeping down freights as it does, it cannot be expected to operate as profitably as a."" private company. What we have to consider is whether its continuance is conducive to the best interests of that I should not have Australia, by reason of the fact that it places primary producers and others in a position better than that which tbey would occupy if tbe Combine had control the head of the Government of shipping between Australia and the United Kingdom. I shall not trace the history of the Linef r o m its inception, but shall merely relate facts which w ill enable honourable members to obtain a grip of the position as it exists to-day. The first vessels of the Line weie purchased by the right honourable member for > No r t h Sydney( Mr Hughes) when Prime Minister in 1916. Nothing of importance transpired from, that time u n t i l November, 1921, wben during the discussion of tbe Estimates for that financial year, certain adverse comments were made regarding the Commonwealth Line. The right honourable member for No r t h Sydney, in reply, pointed out that up to that time the profits wbich had been returned by the Line to tbe people of this country amounted to no less a sum than £7,441,819. Tbe present Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) then indicated very clearly that he was totally opposed to State ensaidSomething has been achieved, I admit, but sumcient to justify the continuance of a Government venture. . . .

A composite government was formed, and there is no doubt that the retention of the Australian Steamers played an important part in its policy. was in favour of tbe continuance tbe Line, mainly because its operations had been of immense benefit to the primary producers of Australia. a policy was framed to meet that position. On the 4th July, 1923, about six months after the composite office, the present Prime Minister duced tablishment Shipping oud-reading that the board would be free from political influence or interference; ro say, shortly afterwards, when time dispute arose and vessels were being held up, he wrote to the board commenting on its action in entering into an agreement concerned. side of tbe House endeavoured but unsuccessfully to ascertain tbe nature of that conrmunication The right honourable gentleman, on that occasion, evidently did not consider that the board should be free from influence. Prime Minister publicly announced pending ment tbe Government invite tenders for the purchase of the Commonwealth course had been advocated by the Shipping Board, which had reported that it was impossible to operate the Line on an effective and profitable basis; that its unsatisfactory financial position was due to the high running costs as compared Mr Charlton. of becoming Prime with those of competing lines, and also He was to labour troubles; and that consequently, it had been decided that the vessels could Commonwealth Line of not pay while they were' on tbe Australian register and covered by Australian That pronouncement industrial awards The Prime Minister's decision to sell the Line under certain Soon afterwards an conditions undoubtedly lessened the prospect of running it at a. profit because supporters were defeated. shippers, w it h no certainty of regular shipping space, naturally looked elseaugwhere for their requirements. It is true that the conditions of sale precluded the possibility of their acceptance, but that made the position worse. The board reported that its vessels were at a disadvanCommonwealth Line of tage compared w it h vessels on other registers, but we must recognize that AusAt that time the Country party tralian conditions are altogether d if of ferent from those prevailing elsewhere.

Australia would make little advancement if , wben dealing with yet strange our national problems, we took the coma.maripetitive element into consideration. The following is an extract from the report of tbe Public Accounts Committee:with the maritime unions Running Costs of Steamers -The figures Honourable members on this placed before the committee showed that uuder Australian conditions of manning and pay repeatedly in force last year, a "" Bay"" steamer had to> carry a complement of 170--a t a cost, includand its results. ing overtime and leave, of £3,725 per month, whilst a vessel'of similar class on the British register would have a crew of 154 only, at a total monthly cost of £1,054.

There is a big disparity between labourcosts on Commonwealth ships and thoseon British overseas ships. Depreciation. also plays a very important part.

In support of my contention that the attitude of the -Government has been hostile to the Line, that the readiness of the Government to sell tbe ships has been prejudicial to the Line, and that this great Commonwealth -enterprise has not received a f a i r chance, I quote from the report of the Public lished a cablegram from London to .Accounts Committee:The attempt made to dispose of the Line in in 1925 had had, it was stated in evidence, a detrimental effect On its business, and has bine at the news that the Commontended to shake the confidence of regular wealth had decided to sell some of the shippers in the Line, and this had taken ships of the Commonwealth Shipping some considerable time to overcome.

The House w ill be interested to hear the -opinions of some men who are directly -concerned in shipping. About five years ago when the Commonwealth Line was actually paying its way, Lord Inchcape said:Mr Hughes would be infinitely better advised if he left the business to those in commerce and allowed the people to work out their own salvation. I hope Mr Hughes will be satisfied with the profit he hasmade out of the: ships and will' dispose of them. Lord Inchcape represents the shipping combine, and, although the Line was then paying its way, be urged that the ships should be disposed of. The Sun Piotorial of the 28th A p r i l , 1925, said :One well-known exporter said these vessels had always been run in a business-like manner. Shippers were so well satisfied, that long before the day of departure. The Line had been responsible for a freight reduction which enabled producers to place their goods on tlie London market at a reduced cost, and so compete with other countries. Although the Line has lost £400,000 a year, it has saved I Australia £3,500,000 in freights.

For example, it was claimed that the reduction of 10s. per ton in freight rates forced by Mr Larkin early in 1923 had resulted in a saving of over £2,000,000 a year in Australian freight charges. that every time one produces convincing evidence, and is proving orable member opposite desires to know, from ?"" The statement is taken from tbe evidence given before tbe committee by the people connected witb the Shipping Board. If this Line is surrendered, the primary producei-s of Australia will pay an additional £2,000,000 a year in * freights. It is necessary that the Government should consider whether it is advisable to retain the Line and face an annual deficit of £500,000, at tbe same time indirectly enabling our primary producers to save £2,000,000 a year in freight, or whether it will sacrifice tbe interests of those producers merely for a financial profit of £500,000 annually. I shall refer to a statement made by Mr J. T. Brennan, the manager of the Melbourne branch of the Line, whom I regard as an expert on shipping matters, whose pronouncements bave considerable weight. member immediately doubts the genuineness of the witness, because shipping is his business. Before adopting that attitude, it is his duty to prove that the statements are incorrect. The reference to Mr Brennan's statement is dated the 3rd October, 1927, and it readsThe manager of the Melbourne branch ( Mr J. T. Brennan), in a statement reviewing the troubles with which the Line had been beset since the war, claimed that it had saved over £2,000,000 a year since 1923 to Australian exporters and importers in reduced freights. As an indication of the trend of affairs not long after the formation of the Line, the following extract from the Times Trade Supplement, December, 1919, is in teresting :Freights charged by the Commonwealth Government Line, although in excess of pre-war rates, have always been much below those charged by shipping companies.

21,Mr Charlton,"The honorablewas 125s., Commonwealth Government Line rate was 120s. Later, when ruling rate was 235s., Commonwealth Government Line rate was 150s. In March, 1920, it was proposed to increase Uiiited Kingdom rates owing to the high price of bunker coal in England, but as our Line would not agree, the proposal was abandoned. Next month, in A p r i l, 1920, the North Atlantic lines increased their rates by 25 per cent, on rough cargo, and up to 50 per' cent, on fine goods, on account of high working expenses; bouth African lines increased rates by 10s. per ton, the reason given being the price of bunker coal and working expenses generally. The fact that the rates were increased by the North Atlantic and South African lines and not by the lines trading to Australia shows definitely that even then the Commonwealth Line acted as a Check. in operation? two "" Dale"" steamers. The extract continuesI n September, 1920, the Conference lines proposed to raise the. freight on scoured wool by Jd. per lb. Our Line woidd not agree to this,, and rates were not raised. In .1923, owing to economic conditions, Australian exporters and importers were seriously embarrassed by the ruling freight charges, aud to alford them the much needed relief, on 22nd January of that year the Line announced that rates to the United Kingdom would be decreased by 12$ per cent., refrigerated cargo by i d . per lb., f r u it by Is. per case, and butter by 6d. per box. Freiglits from the United Kingdom to Australia were simultaneously reduced by 10s. per ton, and in these reductions the Line was followed by the Conference lines. These reductions resulted in an enormous Saving to the producers and consumers in Australia, and were of very great benefit to the population of Australia as a whole. Again, on 12th July, 1926, the line announced a further reduction in freight rates from Australia of 10 per cent, on all general cargo, Jd. per lb. on all classes of skins, on wool, and on all classes of frozen cargo; a reduction of Gd. per box on butter and a similar amount on each case of apples and other f r u it . We estimate the average yearly tonnage of exports and imports to and from Australia and thu United Kingdom as over 4,000,000 tons and 10s. per ton represents a saving of £2,000,000 per annum, but this figure is very conservative, as the Line has reduced freights by considerably more than 10s. per ton since 1923, besides having prevented increases in rates before that year. That is a very definite statement from a man who understands his business, and shows clearly what freight reductions have been made by the Line over a series of years. If the Commonwealtli Line had been endeavouring to make itself a paying proposition, tbe management could easily have joined bands with the Conference Line, raised the freights, and in this way showed a. surplus. But what then would have been the position of the primary producers who had to market their products overseas? Tbe rigbt honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) bas asked me some questions in connection with this report, and it is unfortunate that we cannot get the evidence; we have only got the committee's analysis of it, because it was all taken in camera. I do not say that it was wrong to withhold it , because we do not know the facts. Sometimes evidence must be taken in private, and there may have been justification for it in this case. I ask the Country members of the House how they can justify their action if they agree to the disposal of this Line, in view of what it has saved the people they represent. ""What did they come here for but to look after the interests of country residents and primary producers? As tbe bonorable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has stated, they have been swallowed up by the Nationalist party. Tbey bave forgotten their own people, they have forgotten the benefits which they received as a result of tbe operations of this shipping Line, and they bave agreed that it should be sold. Tbe Government is paying bounties to enable the growers, including returned soldiers, to market their dried fruits overseas, and the position of the industry is still far from satisfactory. The President of the Dried Fruits Association in Melbourne, who has just returned from abroad, has stated that there is a glut in the market for dried fruits, and he advises the growers in Australia to restrict their planting in order to maintain prices. ""While there is this thin margin to work on, and while there is talk of further preferences on the Home market, it is proposed to abolish this shipping Linea course wbicb would surely lead to freights on produce being raised. No less a sum than £2,014,000 has been paid away during the last four years in bounties. What, I ask, is the use of the Government paying bounties to tbe primary producers on the one hand, and then, by the disposal of its shipping Line, enabling the private shipping companies to deprive the producers",17,Canberra Thursday Th E Federal Cabi

23,Mr Charlton,"Fiv e "" Bay"" andof all the benefits they are receiving from those bounties? If the Line is sold it w ill be necessary to increase the bounties very considerably, or the producers w ill be no better off than they would be now if no bounties were being paid. Here is an extract from the report of the committee, which shows the difficulties under which the management has been workingUnfair press criticism and a tendency to give undue publicity to any matters adversely affecting the Commonwealth Line and its operations, exercised, it was stated, an influence on its business. Instances were quoted in evidence of the prominence given in the press to happenings of a detrimental nature on Commonwealtli steamers,whilst similar episodes on other vessels were not mentioned. The committee itself had specific examples during its investigation. In one case a paragraph appeared in a Melbourne paper that passengers on a "" Bay"" steamer had complained that the food was poor during tlie voyage. The editor was asked if he could indicate the source of the information, and whether the names of the passengers were available, but a reply was received regretting tliat, although he had inquiry made, no such particulars could be fur. nished. In another instance a Sydney newspaper published, during the course of the committee's investigations, a paragraph headed Federal Ships-D o they pay-May all be sold,"" and then proceeded to quote, in heavy type, an opinion expressed by the Prime Minister, when a private member of Parliament, some three years previously. The committee's report states that for the financial years' ended 31st March. 192526-27, the Bay steamers showed a profit from United Kingdom to Australia of £72,83S, £44,309, and £64,974, respectively. the homeward voyage from Australia to the United Kingdom, the returns for the three years under consideration 1925, a loss of £26,775; 1926, a profit of £52,720; and in. 1927, a loss'of These losses are attributed to conditions prevailing at the time, and not necessarily to lack of support. the very thing I have been about, the doubt existing from time to time as to whether the Line would continue operations, or be disposed of , certainly had some effect upon the earnings. Possibly that effect was not sufficient to account for the entire loss, but it was certainly responsible for some of it. The profit on the voyages from the United Kingdom under review amounted ilr. Oha-riton. £182,121, while on those from Australiato the United Kingdom there was a loss for this period of £49,014. MrE . RILEY It should have been the other way about. honourable member for South Sydney that the results should bave been tbe other way about; if the people bad been loyal to their own Line there would have been a different tale to tell. Eancy there beinga substantial profit made each year on the trips from the United Kingdom to Australia, and a loss on those from Australia to the United Kingdom! The Government is paying bounties to the primaryproducers, and that course is justified, b ut the people as a whole should, in return,, support tlie Commonwealth Line that isdoing so much for tbem. No effort is being made to reduce tbe overhead expenseson the lines suggested by the committee. A typist has been dismissed, and £50 a year taken .off the salary of somebody else; yet when the board was appointed there were 52 ships to manage, and for some time past there have been only seven. No commensurate reduction, however, has been made in the cost of administration. The losses on the Linef o r a period of f o u r years, including balances on pending and closed voyages, total £1,882,960, which works out at £470,240 a year. Against this loss, the Line has saved approximately £2,000,000 ' a year to the the outward voyage froin the primary producers. Therefore, Australia as a whole is £1,500,000 better On off as a result of tbe operations of the Commonwealth Shipping LineI n the interim report which was prewere:sented to Parliament on the 11th August, 1926, tbe Joint Committee of Public £74,989. Accounts referred to the necessity for the drastic curtailment of the overhead expenses of the Line. Practically Nevertheless, nothing, however, was done in the direccomplaining tion of economy. Evidently there was reason for the use of the pruning knife. The administration expenses, according to the committee's report, were as follows:Statements placed before the committee indicated that when the board was established in September, 1923, the office staffs consisted of 169 males and 79 females with salaries totalling £64,387 per annum, whilst in Febto Australia for the period ruary, 1926, there were 144 males and 53 altogether to females, with salaries totalling £64,298.",18,Lighteni Ng The Burden

The private Colombo to Australia, in which trade the companies, by mutual arrangement, at Commonwealth Line took a prominent part. one time provided a weekly service.

To ship frozen beef to-day in large quantities is not a payable proposition, as frozen beef is practically unsaleable. This condition was brought about through the Argentine educating the public to eat chilled beef. Having had loug experience iu the chilled beef trade, I was engaged to carry out experiments from Australia as superintendent engineer. The first was made ou the C. and D. liner Port Darwin, time, 03 days at sea. This consignment was sold within id. a lb. of the Argentine prime chilled. The second shipment was on the s.s. Port Auckland, of the same line, from Brisbane and Wyndham, Western Australia, 53 days at sen. This was all sold at prices from ld. to 2d. higher than frozen beef. The second-grade beef from Wj'ndham brought 2d. per lb. higher than the first-grade frozen; in fact, most of the frozen went into store, there being no sale. The third shipment was made on the s.s. Port Hardy, 65 clays at sea. This shipment met a glutted market, owing to many chilled beef steamers being hold up by fog in the North Sea. This shipment was sold, and brought within i d . per Il>. of the prime Argentine. Had this consignment been frozen, it would probably be in store now. Frozen beef was offered on tlie market at the time at Is. 2d. per stone 8 lb. Now, my point of view is: I made a voyage from London to Melbourne on the Moreton Bay to get first-hand knowledge of the Commonwealth ships for this trade. I came to thc conclusion they were the finest ships afloat for thc chilled beef trade; their decks are just what are wanted; they have definite dates of sailing, which is essential to this trade; lastly, they have the speed, and are fitted with the brine circulation system, and are also installed with fans. For a small cost, these ships could be fitted up with the latest appliances for thc chilled beef trade, and thus recapture ior Australia this lost trade. The recapture of our lost beef trade is a matter of importance to Australia. out bis experiments witb the assistance of a private line of steamers, not the Commonwealth Line. continuesGraziers are at their wits' end to know what to do with their cattle, and works are closed down in Queensland, as it does not pay to ship frozen beef. Mediterranean ports are now asking for chilled beef in place of frozen. Australia used to do a large business with the latter ports. With the Commonwealth Line of Steamers the tradecould be saved. On the ship-owner's, side chilled beef is a good freight. It may be news to bonorable members, as it was to me, that there is no market in Englandf o r frozen beef because of the demand of tbe people for chilled beef. I desire to emphasize that Mr Rayson's sample shipments took from seven to nineweeks to reach England, whereas vessels belonging to the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers can do tbe journey in from 30 to 32 days. It is therefore clear that if those vessels were utilized to carry our chilled beef to the Old Country, the results would be better than those obtained by Mr Rayson. Honourable members should weigh Mr. Rayson's statement that if the vessels belonging to Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers were fitted for the carriage of chilled beef, Australia would recapture her lost beef trade. ambitious statement. our primary producers, it would be worthwhile to give Mr Rayson thc opportunity to prove his contention. In the Melbourne Age of 26th October last, reference is made to the proposal to sell the Line in the following terms:ITS PROPOSED SALE. Keen Interest in London. Conference line circles do not disguise their keen interest in tlie decision to sell the Commonwealth Line. At present these circles are very anxious owing to the varying prices and reports, and desire to know the precise conditions under which the ships will bo offered.

The Minister for Markets and Migration ( Mr Paterson), who, it is reported, favours the disposal of the the retention of the Line, because tbey Line, was responsible for the Paterson butter scheme, which, in order to assist Australian dairy farmers, increased tbe price of butter to Australian consumers. Realizing the difficulties confronting our dairymen, and the value of the dairying industiy to Australia, no strong objection has been taken to that scheme. I ask the Minister whether he has considered tbe effect on the primary producers of the disposal of tbese ships. I remind him that tbe Line was responsible for a reduction in the freights on butter, and ask him whether he realizes that increased freights will be inevitable if tbe Line is disposed of? What will be the result? If the Line is pur-' chased by one of its competitors the freights will be increased immediately, and tbe price of butter to Australian conacquired by the shipping combine? It is sumers will also be raised, thus further increasing the present high cost of living. tolerable. Tbe primary producers, many of whom I represent, do not wish the Government to dispose of a line of steamers which has been of great assistance to tbem in keeping down freights, because tbe other shipping companies will at once raise the freights to the detriment of the primary producers and consumers generally. What is the attitude of the members of the Country party in regard to our export meat trade in connection with which an export bounty of £146,482 has been paid during tbe last four years? been carried by these ships? How can Parliament, which provides bounties on certain commodities, dispense with a line of steamers which protects producers from, a shipping monopoly? Under the present system, meat exporters bave some opportunity of making a financial success of their operations; but if the Shipping Combine obtains control of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and immediately increases freights, the bounty will be valueless. It tralian fruit-growers have of successfully would be interesting to hear the opinions of some members of the Country party -one-hal f of the portfolios are held by representatives of that party-man y of whom when elected to this Parliament two years ago were strongly in favour of admitted that it was a means of keeping down overseas freights. They do not appear to see the position in its true perspective. They regard only the profit and loss account, and pay little attention to the indirect benefit of the Line to the whole community. Apparently, the members of this party are now under the influence of the Prime Minister, and will support the preposterous proposal which the Go%ernr ment intend to make. I again remind honourable members of the opinion expressed by a prominent authority in the meat trade, who said that freights should be as low as possible in order to assist Australian exporters. If that is the case, why should we' allow the Line to be the duty of the Prime Minister to say whether the Government intends to disThe position is becoming inpose of these ships, and I hope that in his' reply he will make the position quite clear. We have also to consider tbe position of fruit-growers, especially those who are drying their product for export. Year after year the Government has been assisting thousands of men, including returned soldiers, to settle on the land, many of whom have failed owing to the unsatisfactory pricoS obtained for their product. Fruit-growers in Australia have to compete with the growers of products from southern Europe where labour is cheaper and freights to the large consuming centres lower. What prospects have our fruit growers of making a success of their operations if freights are increased? They are now working on only a small margin. When in LondonI discussed with a leading business man the question of preference to Australian dried fruits, and was informed that if Ave supplied our product at a price at which it could compete with that from other' countries, it would sell well. He concluded his remarks by saying "" But business is first with us "". What chance would the Auscompeting with fruit producers nearer to the markets of the world if freights",22,London 24th October

The Prime Minister has; always been in favour of private enterprise as against governiental control. The right honourable gentleman favoured a similar proposal in 1921, and the action which he subsequently took with regard to the sale of the Commonwealth ships under certain conditions, when there was some difference between the members of tbe Nationalist party and the members of tbe Country party, showed that his opinion was then unchanged. At that time some members of the Country party were now they have gone right over tlie precipice. Tbe members of that party once suggested that tbe ships of the Australian Commonwealth Line should be sold to a company which would compete with the shipping companies, but they do not make any sucb stipulation to-day. Eveni f the vessels are not purchased by the combine, it will see that they are acquired by some company, which will with it whereby they will virtually be under its control. What is to become of our developmental policy, and our migration scheme if primary products cannot be carried from Australia to the home markets at a reasonable rate ? As the step which the Government proposes to take will be disastrous to tiie future welfare of this country, I confidently submit tbe motion, trusting that it will receive the support of all honourable members who wish this great Commonwealth to be developed, and its industries to expand. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [4.21] -A t the beginning of his speech ton), referring to his action in submitting a motion of want of confidence, suggested that I might point out that there was no need for sucb a motion at the present juncture. Having heard tbe speech of the honourable member, I say that he would have done much better had he waited for tbe Government to announce its policy in regard to the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. Then, if he had seen fit, he could have moved a motion of the course proposed to be followed. The discussion of such a motion would have been of greater advantage to the people than is possible when a motion of want of confidence in the Government is being debated. We all recognize that overseas transport is a vital problem to Australia. It is imperative and essential that Australia sliould have the most efficient service at the lowest possible freights for the conveyance of its produce to overseas markets. The Leader of the Opposition regards the running of a government-controlled line of steamers as the only means of achieving such a result. To him gostill on the brink, but vernment enterprise is a fetish, and tbe solution of every trouble that affects the community. I ask him not to approach the problem of marketing Australia's produce overseas in the belief that government enterprise is its only solution. He is correct in saying that from time to time. I have expressed my opposition to government enterprise and have advocated private enterprise. I believe that private indivienter into an arrangement duals can conduct an industry more efficiently than can a Government. But I bave not made a fetish of my belief.

Government believes that the most efficient way to conduct industry is by private enterprise; but I can assure tbe honourable member that no fetish of ours in regard to private enterprise will deter us from doing our best to safeguard tbe interests of the people when we are convinced that government enterprise is the best way in which to ensure the most efficient shipping service at the lowest possible freights, or to prevent the people from being exploited by private enterprise. I appeal to the Leader of tbe Opposition to follow our example, and not be bound by the doctrine that government enterprise is the solution of every problem. I ask him to realize with others who have sought to apply it in various directions, that it has failed, and that it is end it was sold by a Labour Government. time he changed bis views, and admitted that government enterprise has not proved a solution for every problem that faces a country. If he does so I am sure he will have the concurrence of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Theodore). There are many instances of the failure of government entei'prise. Many State Governments have taken direct action in regard to matters of vital importance to the people. One matter of very great importance is the supply of meat to the people. sought to safeguard its people by tbe purchase of cattle stations, just as tbe Leader of the Opposition suggests that the interests of the people can be safeguarded by tbe utilization of a government line of steamers. But after running its cattle stations for some years, the Queensland Labour Government bas come to the conclusion that it is not achieving the object it had in view, and the seventeen stations which it purchased are now up for sale. Between seven and ten-I not quite sure of the number-have already been sold. these cattle stations showed a loss of £830,000 from 1916 to 1926, and that the indebtedness of the State Treasury in regard to them is £1,367,000. I do not quote this instance of the failure of government enterprise in any party spirit, or for the purpose of scoring a political advantage; I Mr Iinwe. conflict of opinion some mention it to show that many well meaning people with a great faith The in the idea that government enterprise is tbe solution of every problem affecting tbe people of Australia, and an effective weapon for the protection of the interests of tbe people, have had the courage and frankness to recede from that position. I could mention many other examples of the kind in Australia; for instance, the State saw-mills at Craven and Gloucester, and the State trawling fleet of New South Wales; but a more nearly parallel example to the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line is the State shipping enterprise of Tasmania. It is interesting to note that tbe State Shipping Line, of Tasmania was instituted by a Nationalist Government, but it was soon realized that it was not achieving the object in view, and in the Many other examples could be quoted to show that men have changed their views as to the best methods to be adopted for tbe solution of the problems of transport, and have admitted that the solution is not inevitably to be found on the lines of government enterprise. I have already told the Leader of the Opposition that when I believe it to be in the interests of the people of Australia. I am prepared to run an enterprise under government control. As a matter of fact, Tbe Queensland Government the Government, as I bave already said, is doing this in the case of the Commonwealth Oil Befineries. At the same time. I ask the honourable member, when he is convinced that government enterprise is not the solution of every problem, to admit that it might be advantageous to the people to employ private enterprise. We are all agreed that the question raised by the honourable member in* his motion is a vital one, and one which should be considered from every angle, am and in order that the House may determine how best to deal with it, I think I understand that it necessary to give a brief history of the Australian Oommonwealth Shipping Line and to show exactly the part it has played in the past in the development of Australia. We all recognize as a piece of statesmanship the action of the light honourable member-for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) in acquiring a number of ships during the period of the war for the conveyance of Australian foodstuffs to the mother country, because ut that time, owing to the activity of pneuiy submarines, there was a great shortage of Allied shipping. Moreover, Australia was at a disadvantage as compared with the Argentine, owing to its greater distance from Great Britain. During the same period we also acquired a number of ex-enemy ships, which, too, for a time, earned considerable profits. The second phase of tbe Commonwealth's shipping activities opened with the cessation of hostilities. There was then an extraordinarily large surplus of-, world shipping, because during the war every nation had been pressing on with its ship-building programme. All shipbuilding yards were producing to the maximum capacity. Great Britain, being pre-eminently the leading ship-building nation in the world, headed the list with surplus tonnage. Because of the tremendous output in ships, when war ceased there came the inevitable depreciation in shipping values. In 1921 the suggestion was made in this Parliament that the Commonwealth Line should be sold, and consideration was given to that proposal by Cabinet. I should not have mentioned it at this stage but for the fact that tbe Leader of the Opposition referred to a speech which I then made as a private member. He clearly inferred"" that I was out of sympathy witb the Line, and that I was desirous of taking sucb action as would hamper its operations and prevent it, from being successful. On the occasion referred to, my purpose in directing attention to the surplus of world tonnage, and the inevitable depreciation that must take place, was to impress on Parliament that if we could dispose of the Commonwealth Government ships, we should be able to show a very large profit on the transaction, as the Line, up to then, had been profitable. I further suggested that the position of Australia might be met if , in any negotiations for the sale of' the Line, we took the necessary precautions with regard to over-seas freight. However, Parliament did not consider that the wisest course. Parliament determined to continue the Line. after I had made tbe speech referred to by tbe honourable gentleman, I joined the Nationalist Government as Treasurer. [40] It bas been suggested, in view of the importance attached to that speech, that the decision of the Government in 1923 to place the Line under independent control was an act of policy for which I , as Prime Minister, was responsible. I wish to make it perfectly clear that that course bad been determined by tbe preceding government, of whicli I had been a. member. In. tlie circumstances the honourable gentleman was hardly fair to me when he endeavoured to persuade honourable members that the change in tbe administration of tbe Line was an act of policy and due to my influence as head of the Government. We come now to the constitution of tbe Commonwealth Shipping Board. The board was appointed because it was felt that tbe Line would operate more effectively if it were placed under independent management. And because of the suggestion made by the Leader of tbe Opposition that I have never given the Line a fair chance. I remind him that when it was handed over to the board the value of the ships was written down substantially. Indeed, at tbe time -..ne of tbe charges made against tlie Government was, not that the values had not been written down far enough, but that they had been written down too drastically, in order to emphasize the losses of the Line and bring it into contempt. Actually, the intention of the Government was to give the Line a chance to succeed. Prices received subsequently from the sale of the ships completely refuted the charge that values bad been written down too far. The Line was given every possible chance to succeed. An analysis of accounts on page 6 of the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts shows losses amounting to £1,225,000 in connection with theoperations of the Austral ships, the sailers, the "" D "" and "" E "" class vessels, the ex-enemy ships for a limited period, and the Bay liners up to tbe date wben tbey were taken over by the Shipping Board; but the ex-enemy ships, whilst under the administration of the Prime Minister's Department, showed a profit of £3,673,000, so that, at Not long the date of the transfer to the board, the profit on the Commonwealth's shipping activities was approximately £2,44S,000. This has to be taken into account as against the amount which was written off to bring the ships down to their then market value. At tbe date of transfer the book value* of tbe ships was £12,716,000, and the original cost was £14,800,000. During the period prior to the transfer, values had been written down by about £2,100,000, and wben the ships were transferred to the board, values were further written down to £4,718,000. ex-enemy ships? bring tbem into account at tbe time. Altogether the value of the ships bad been written down by about £8,000,000. This might, I think, be described as deferred depreciation, and we should bear in mind tbe £2,500,000 by which the profits exceeded losses over the whole period. Mr G-. FRANCIS -Thos e were voyage profits. point raised by tbe bonorable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey). Tbe ships which were handed over to the board were unsuitable, and it was definitely understood that they were to be sold. The Australs were becoming old, the "" D "" and "" E "" vessels were not suited to the trade. Forty-seven of the ships which were banded over had been sold. I do not think that any person would cavil at that; it was to the advantage of the Line. strength of the fleet is seven modern vessels-fiv e "" Bay"" Liners and two ""Dales."" of the 47 steamers to which I have referred was £1,318,150. They realized £1,3.03,172. A fact which must be borne in mind is that the Commonwealth has not lost tbe amount by which the vessels were v -..ttcn down. Formerly, there was : an asset to off-set against a debt owed by the Commonwealth; that debt still exists, but, there is no asset. The result is that an amount in tbe vicinity of £250,000 has to be found annually. An examination must be made of the results from the time that an independent board assumed control of the operations of the Line, in order to ascertain whether losses may be avoided in future, and what action should be taken witb regard to the Line. The board commenced to function on tbe 1st September, 1923. Tbe losses carried to the balance-sheet from that date are as follow:1st September, 1923, to 31st Marcli, 1924 (seven months), f245,474. 1st April, 1924, to 31st March, 1925,. £593,879. 1st April, 1925, to 31st March, 1926, £503,076. 1st April, 1920, to 31st March, 1927,. £593,572. the making a total of £1,930,000. The hondore) bas asked wben the figures for the-present year will be available. Tbey have been in tbe bands of the Auditor General for some time. He has advised the Government of tbe completion of bis audit, and tbe posting of the figures. Type-written copies, which do not vary from those that have been passed by theAuditor-General, will be laid on the table of tbe House to-day. The only variation from the figures set out in the report of the PublicAccounts Committee is that the loss for the present year bas been discovered tobave been £593,000 instead of £575,000. Those results were arrived at after allowance had been made for depreciation. On tbe assumption that immediately after the writing downthere was. no necessity to take depreciation into consideration, no allowance under that head was made with respect to the seven months which ended on tbe 31st March, 1924. The figures for The present subsequent years are as follow:Year ended Slst March, 1925, £180,798, representing 4.46 per cent. Tbe transfer value Year ended 31st March, 1926, £179,584, representing 5.07 per cent. Year ended 31st March, 1927, £172,847, representing 5.60 per cent. I point out to bonorable members that there is a fractional difference between thefigures set out in the report of the PublicAccounts Committee and those that appear in the report of the Auditor-General; but it is so slight that it is not necessary for honourable members to attempt their reconciliation. The question that has to be considered is, whether the depreciation allowance has been sufficient to keep the fleet upon a fair competitive basis, having regard to tbe period when replacement e=p will be necessary.

I quote those figures to . stress the point that tbe Line cannot continue on the basis of the last three years. The working capital has been exhausted. Tbe proceeds of the sale of surplus assets are on tbe point of exhaustion. There are no funds upon which the Line can draw;.. and if it is to continue, this Parliament will bave to vote it a further sum for working capital. That may represent a considerable amount, because it will need to embrace floating capital to cover running costs, capital for Tbe"" Dales"" and the replacements which must be made as time goes on, and provision for additional tonnage. It must be obvious to every honourable member that if we are to have Taking no account of depreciaa Government-owned line of steamers, there must be a much bigger unit than that which at present exists.

I am unable to accept the suggestion of tbe Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) that the Line has lost a substantial sum because of any action of mine.

The factors set out in the report of the Public Accounts Committee as having adversely affected the Line have relation to the 47 vessels that have already been sold, should, I think, be left out of account altogether, because we must admit that they were unsuited to the Australian trade, and The capital account consequently placed a heavy burden on tbe Line. Therefore, we must confine our consideration to the "" Bay"" and "" Dale"" classes, wbicb consist of modern and up to-date vessels. In regard to these vessels the first factor relates to tbe difficulty of obtaining cargo due to The amount absorbed by those industrial trouble. AgainI do not wish",27,London 24th October

50,Mr Bbtjce,"The voyage account forto touch unnecessarily ufjon controversial questions, but we all recognize that tbe Commonwealth Line, a unit whicli is owned by the people of this country, has received extraordinarily bad treatment from tbe Seamen's Union. [Debate interrupted under Standing Order 119. Ordered-That all other business be postponed until after the motion of want of confidence now before the House is disposed of.] One of the contributing factors to the non-success of the Line has certainly been the industrial trouble with which it bas constantly been faced. ""We might hope for a betterment of the position in the future, but, unfortunately, up to the present we have seen few signs of a different attitude or spirit on the part of tbe seamen towards tbe Commonweal tb Line. The second factor relates to adverse press criticism, and we have to recognize that even if this House were unanimous respecting the desirability of continuing tbe Line under there would inevitably be adverse press criticism. Many people in Australia do not subscribe to government enterprise, and any attempt to stifle the public expression of their views would be an interference with one of our greatest traditions, the liberty of the press. The third factor relates to the additional cost of running and provisioning vessels under Australian articles, amounting in all to £127,268, or nearly equivalent to interest at 5 per cent, on the transfer value of tbe "" Bay"" steamers. The position is that the cost of running the Line under Australian conditions is much higher than that of running competitive British Lines. Mr E. Bin EST,-That applies to our' railways, also. ways do not compete with tbe railways of other countries. We have to face these facts in arriving at a solution of tbe nroblem. The Leader of the Opposition quoted figures as indicating certain handiministrative expenses were too high, the caps under which the Line was suffering and which, he said, might explain the losses. I entirely agree with much that he said, but, in addition, we have to consider whether in tbe interests of the people as a whole we are justified in incurring these additional losses, which bave certainly been a contributing cause to tbe non-success of the Line. It is estimated by the committee that the additional cost of running the seven steamers now in commission as compared ' with a similar number of vessels of the same class on British articles, would approximate £220,000 per annum. That is a substantial increase, and must be taken into consideration wben deciding what action we shall take. Another factor against tbe success of tbe Line is tbe uneconomical conditions under which the oversea shipping trade of the Commonwealth, is conducted, it being stated that there is more than double the tonnage on tbe berth from the United Kingdom to Australia than is necessary to carry tbe cargo offering, and in consequence the ships rarely carry .full cargoes. A great number of people in Australia fail to recognize the significance of that. If our ships are running direct, government control, without full cargoes, it is inevitable, unless witb a freight war tending to drive shipping off our coast-that high freights must be charged. In the interests of tbe Commonwealth, the ships should be running with full cargoes, and maintained on a well-organized basis, since by that means only will freights be lowered. Another factor to be considered is the administrative expenditure, and tbe Leader of the Opposition has dealt with that at considerable length. Those expenses the' committee found to be high, and there would appear to be considerable justification for the suggestion that tbey should be substantially reduced. I entirely decline to accept the charge made by tbe Leader of the Opposition that I am responsible for the administration. At the opening of his speech he said that my interference with the Line had caused it to be transferred from government control to that of an independent board; but later be took an entirely different view by asking why, if the adGovernment did not step in and reduce them. I am afraid that the Leader of the Opposition cannot have it both way*. We have to consider what are the prospects of the Line, and what can be done to reduce the existing administrative expenses of £90,000. It is quite evident that even had tbe management of",28,London 24th October
51,Mr Bruce,"The Australian railthe Line been changed from the most in efficient to the most efficient, it would have Kingdom. Coming to the deck compledone extraordinarily well to reduce expenses by 25 per cent.; but any such reduction, although an amazing performance, the problem, and would not ensure a decreased loss in the future. It is obvious that if the Line continues, there must be a substantial loss, ancl, in coming to a decision, we have to consider everything, including additional wages, capital and interest. We can gather a little information from other nations and tbeir experience of government shipping enterprise since the war. The fleet owned by the Government of the United States of America offers us an excellent example, because its losses have been colossal, amounting to over £600,000,000 Tbe establishment of the Commonwealth Line was a war necessity, and if we bave made losses, other nations bave made many more. We should recognize that, and not decry Australia and its efforts so much as many of us do now. What is more significant and serious in America is that the proportion of cargoes carried has been substantially reduced year by year, despite the fact that Americans do all in tbeir power to keep their trade for their own people. In 1921 their government-controlled fleet was carrying 49 per cent, of America's foreign commerce; in 1922, 48 per cent.; in 1924, 41 per cent.; in 1925, 37 per cent.; and in 1926, 25 per cent. any action we take must as f a r as possible benefit tbe producers and the people of Australia as a whole, but by continuing the Linei t is not altogether clear that we shall be doing that. If tbe Line were employing a considerable number of Australian seamen, and its operations were of inestimable value to Australia, there would be some reason for its continuance even at a loss, but thc committee's report is to the contrary. Fromi t we find that out of a total complement of 1,034 sea-going personnel, 514 are domiciled in Australia and 520 in the United Kingdom. of the figures shows that the difference is even greater than at first appears. There are 27 apprentices, all domiciled in Australia. Of the masters, five are domiciled in Australia and two in tbe UnitedK in gdom, and of the officers 57 are domiciled in Australia and nineteen in the United ment, we find that in almost every section the majority is domiciled in the United Kingdom. To give two typical would be no solution of examples, of the deck complement 85 are domiciled in Australia and 140 in the United Kingdom, and of tbe victualling complement 173 are domiciled in Australia and two in tbe United Kingdom. We are to-day paying £220,000 a year more than is necessary in order to keep those ships on the Australian register, witb the basic idea of building up an Australian mercantile marine. But die figures I have quoted show that that disbursement is really for the benefit of a very limited number of seamen, and is of no benefit to tbe primary producer. Tbe Leader of tbe Opposition almost burst into tears when he was referring to tbe primary producers; if they are tbe people about -whom we are mainly concerned, it is perfectly obvious that the primary producer w ill be more greatly advantaged if we get on to a true economic basis and save that £220,000 a year. It is worthy of grave consideration whether Australia is receiving any real benefit from that payment, which I believe is helping very little towards the building up of an Australian mercantile marine. We are told that the Commonwealth ships operating under Australian conditions are of tremendous advantage in the Most of us are agreed that interstate trade. There have been one or two instances in wbich tbe Commpnwealth Line steamers bave been of assistance in that direction, but they certainly do not offer a solution of the problem presented to us by the interstate trade. That is generally recognized. The Navigation Royal Commission went f u l l y into tbe subject, and tbe minority report, signed by Senators Duncan and Elliott, statedIt is not expected that the oversea vessels will enter largely into the cargo carrying side ot the industry, at least in the more thickly populated centres. They did not do so before the inauguration of the Navigation Act, An examination and they have no desire to do so to-day. Mr Anstey in a supplementary memorandum saidOverseas ships have not, except in isolated instances, carried interstate cargo on the Australian coast for many years. Only one overseas ship during twenty years carried interstate cargo out of Tasmania. That was in -1921 when the Red Bridge lifted 115 tons of timber for Fremimtle. Sir Owen Cox, representing overseas ship-owners, told the Sea Carriage Committee of 1920 that "" oversea vessels have never catered for the coastal cargo trade and would not do so."" The representatives of the timber industry told the commission that the industry had not chartered an oversea vessel for coastal trade during the last twenty years. sea vessels for local trade was a thing of the past, many years prior to the Navigation Act. carry interstate cargo. too much with the loading or unloading of cargoes to or from oversea ports. It was not a paying proposition, and so they left it alone. ""We cannot j u s t if y this Line either For the sake of the Australian mercantile marine, or as a means of solving the interstate shipping problem, which is one of the most difficult we have to face. I come now to the benefits that the Line has conferred, whether it can be relied upon to continue those benefits, and whether because if something it may do in future, Ave shall be justified in paying the large amounts A\'hich must be expended, and incurring the large losses that Avill be inevitable. Eor my OAVII part, I admit that the Line has been of considerable advantage in improving tralia. ment that Avas bound to come, rather than brought -about a change which, it, could bave been indefinitely Just after the war the great surplus of tonnage Avas mainly British, and the shipping companies Avere not inclined to incur large expense in the creation of new tonnage that Avould possibly be more suitable for tbe Australian advantageous to our exporters. The Commonwealth the "" Dale"" tbe did a great deal to stimulate companies building than they otherwise would have done. But the "" Dale"" and "" Bay"" ships have served their purpose; their day is almost past, if the Line is to be placed on the most modern basis. We are approaching the period of the Diesel engine, and from that Ave shall pass on to tbe engine driven by super-heated steam. If the stimulus tOAvards improvement is to come from the Government we shall have to build a Mr Bruce. large number of modern vessels at once in order to put the Commonwealth Line ""ahead of the rest of the shipping world. There is no necessity for us to do that, because a large number of other companies are building extra ships and placing them on the Australian The chartered overroute. Those competitors disappeared for a time during and after the Avar, but The regular oversea liners never did they are beginning to return, and to in It would interfere crease, and I quote the following illustrative figures:Year. Ships. Net Tonnage.

I agree Avith the bonorable members Avho at times have said that shipping companies are reluctant to expedite the improvement and modernization of their services. They hold to their existing fleets as long as they economically can in order to avoid the heavy depreciation the tonnage trading to Austhat changes involve. B ut the Diesel It has accelerated an improveengine is being adopted almost the Avorld over for tbe cargo trade, and, without although the very heavy expenditure in avoided. volved Avill be serious for some companies, they cannot avoid it . Similarly, Avhen the day of the super-heated steam engine comes, the shipping companies w ill be obliged to f a l l into line. It would be very difficult for the Commontrade and more Avealth Shipping Line to be the pioneer of all improvements and in the vanguard Shipping Line, by building of progress all the time in order to move ships, and accelerating the private companies to provide the pace of tbe "" Bay"" steamers, modern tonnage Ave require, and I beprivate lieve that sucb action is rendered unto undertake progressive necessary by tbe increasing competition programmes more rapidly all over tbe Avorld as shipping conditions gradually return to normal.. What benefit bave the people of -the Commonwealth received from this Government Shipping Line? What influence has it had in reducing freights or preventing tbeir rise ? I shall not deny that it bas done a certain amount to effect a reduction of freights and prevent rises, but the Leader of tbe Opposition rated tbe attainments of the Line too high. I bave already alluded to the tremendous surplus of tonnage after the war; many of the ships had been built under war conditions at very high prices, and as prices fell those vessels-had to bear a very heavy depreciation. Many ships were coming to Australia-probabl y twice as many as we needed. Such a hopelessly uneconomic condition inevitably tended to increase freights. In ordinary circumstances, a trade war would have been waged amongst tbe British companies, but postwar conditions were such that they could not afford to fight, so they endeavoured to amalgamate and arrange for the elimination of the surplus tonnage so that the business might gradually be placed on n more profitable basis. During that period tbe Commonwealth Government Line came on tbe scene, and it did much to force the private companies to reducp. freights faster than tbey otherwise would have done. But when we bave said that we have said all. Tbe Leader of tbe Opposition conveyed the impression that this Line had reduced freights repeatedly over a number of years, and that tbe private companies had not done so. In only one instance was the reduction by tbe Commonwealth Line not common to all tbe shipping companies within the combine. If tbe honourable gentleman had merely expressed his belief that the Commonwealth Line bad done something to check the rise in freights and effect, n reduction, I would have agreed witb him : but when lie gave tbe Line credit for having been wholly instrumental in keepingdown freights between Australia and Europe, he fatally overstated his cas<-. According to the report of the Public Accounts Committee, the "" Bay"" and ""Dale"" liners carry 7 per cent, of the total inward and outward cargo. was inclined to accept that estimate, but I have just received from the Commonwealth Statistician some figures that are rather startling. He says that of the from all countries, 7.13 per cent, was carried by vessels on the Australian register, and the corresponding proportion of outward cargo, carried by vessels on tbe Australian register was 7.82 per cent. Tbese figures refer to the year 1925-26. A special analysis of the figures of all cargo shipped to tbe United Kingdom during 1926-27 shows that about 2.7 per cent, was carried by the "" Bay"" and. "" Dale"" boats. These figures, of course, include all charter cargoes. Apparently the 7 per cent, mentioned by the committee included some other vessels wbicb did not belong to tbe Commonwealth Line. Tliere may have been charters that were actually on the Australian register. But even if the Line carried 7 per cent, of the total cargo on the route, we could hardly suppose that it could dictate freights and fares as tbe Leader of the Opposition said it did. He proceeded to say that on 4,000,000 tons of cargo tbe people of Australia had effected a saving of 10s, per ton, or a total of £2,000,000 a year, through the instrumentality of the Line. As I have already stated, the Line has exerted an influence in reducing freights, but the effect of the post-war conditions on shipping which I have outlined would certainly bave resulted.in freight reductions even if tbe Line had not been in existence. Tbe Leader of the Opposition mentioned wheat, and quoted figures for 1919-20, the just-post-war period, indicating how well the Commonwealth Line had done. Tbe honourable member would have been fairer had he brought his figures up to date. The. Commonwealth Line carries ajmroximately 1.2 per cent of the wheat exported from Australia, therefore that commodity does not enter into the question. The ships of all countrios of the world are carrying our wheat, the carriage of wbich is usually negotiated by charter. That procedure keeps wheat freights within reasonable bounds, and tbe position would not be improved even if the Commonwealth Line extended its wheat-carrying operations. I Similar remarks apply to tbe carriage of wool, of wbich the Commonwealth Line bandies only about 3 per cent. *When it is remembered that wheat 'and wool, according to statistics available, represent total imports into Australia approximately .45 per cent, of tbe total Australian exports, it must be realized that those two products cannot enter tbe picture when we are considering tbe future of the Commonwealth Line of steamships. We may rest assured that international competition will stabilize freights on those two commodities. Undoubtedly, the Commonwealth Line bas done something to secure the establishment of better rates and the stabilizing of freights, but it has done only a limited amount of good, and that under very favorable circumstances. Our duty now is to consider the future. British shipping companies have arrived at the stage when they have dealt with tbe tremendous depreciations which had to be faced to meet the war-time costs. There has been a progressive decrease in freight rates, and the establishment of a better organization, wbich now enables British shipping companies to fight strenuously for business. It is evident that competition in shipping circles is growing. Tbe Scandinavian countries, Germany, and Italy, are making determined efforts to consolidate and extend tbeir mercantile marine activities, and are causing Britain a considerable amount of anxiety We have to consider whether, in the circumstances, it is essential for us to maintain and extend the Oommonwealth Line in order, as bas been suggested, to safeguard the people of Australia. 1 suggest that it is not, and 1 shall give my reasons. I have dealt with the position as it affects tbe export of our staple products, wheat and wool, and am now dealing with refrigerated tonnage, wbich mainly concerns Australia at present. commodities may be left to look after themselves, as we can obtain for them all tbe tonnage that we need. The Commonwealth Government bas given the subject a great amount of consideration, and has realized that, if the Line is continued, it will impose on the people of Australia an annual obligation of £500,000, wbich amount must necessarily increase if we contemplate tbe extension of the Line, particularly as freight now tends to decrease. At present sufficient refrigerated tonnage is available. Should it at any time be necessary to safeguard our position tbe annual saving of £500,000 could be utilized for the purpose. My impression is that there is not yet the slightest necessity to pay anybody. £500,000 for refrigerated tonnage. money we are not left at the absolute mercy of tbe shipping companies. Suppose we found that we were being exploited in freights on refrigerated tonnage, we should have available an amount by which we could subsidize or take any action we thought fit in order to safeguard the position. I remind honourable members that things are moving very rapidly ih the shipping industry Some time ago proposals were submitted to the Government for the building of larger and faster ships for service on the Australian route. Those proposals were fully considered, and I said then, and repeat now, that if any one will submit to this Government a proposal for an improved shipping service on a basis satisfactory to tbe Government, and prove that be has adequate finance behind it, the Government will be prepared to favourably consider letting its mail contracts to that company, and assist it in every practical manner. Unfortunately, tbe money for the scheme which was submitted could not be found, and it was suggested that the Commonwealth Government should find a great portion of the money. To this suggestion I was unable to agree. The Government, after most exhaustive consideration, considers that the proper and wise course is to dispose of the Australian Commonwealth Line of « Other Steamers, if a reasonable price is offered. Such a step would be subject to the conditions tliat the Line is maintained on an Empire register, and that the purchaser undertakes, to maintain, for a period of ten years, at least equivalent services in ' regard to passenger, cargo, and refrigerated space. In considering any tender that might be received, preference would be given to any -proposition having Australian finance behind it, as suggested by the committee. The Government also welcomes the suggestion of co-operation that is contained in the report of the committee. It approves of the idea, that the project should "" receive the support, both in money and influence, of all associations of producers, both primary and secondary, as well as of the individual members of all Chambers of Commerce, is meant by and of Manufactures, industrial and other unions and associations, and of importers and exporters throughout Australia."" The Government, when considering tenders, would pay particular attention to the provision of refrigerated space in substitution for the service at present provided by the Australian >",29,London 24th October

Those are the terms on which the Government is prepared to sell, the rigid condition being that the Line shall have an Empire register. On a previous occasion the Government offered the Line subject to Gertain conditions, which were not acdpted. We now feel that possibly a number of interests would be prepared to make acceptable offers, and to give a service which would be not merely the equivalent of the present one, but very much improved aud widened. It appears to us desirable tp--leave it to tenderers to make suc^arroffer as tbey may see fit. It is much better that the tenderers should be invited to submit to tbe Government proposals for tbe service tbey are prepared to give, than that we should stipulate the service we require; but tbe absolute minimum acceptable is an equivalent of the existing service. As I said previously, preference would certainly be given to the tenderer who offered the best service, particularly in regard to refrigerated tonnage, and who made proposals in which tbe interests of tbe producers of Australia were expressly and definitely safeguarded. I regret that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) had not an opportunity to hear the Government's proposals before making bis speech upon what he terms a motion of want of confidence. I to consider this matter in the interests of the people of Australia, with a view to ensuring what is absolutely vital to us, the best, most efficient, and cheapest method of transport overseas. If the problem is viewed from that angle, I am certain that it will be recognized that the Government's proposals are those best calculated to suit our requirements, and honourable members will vote unhesitatingly against the motion of the Leader of the Opposition. gratulate the Leader of the Opposition on having brought this motion forward, because it has bad tbe effect of extracting from the Prime Minister a plain declaration of the policy of the Government in regard to this shipping line. Line of Steamers, This Parliament and the Australian people have every right to be informed by the Government of the decision which was conveyed to its supporters at the party meeting last week. In view of the want of frankness on the part of the Government the Leader of tbe Opposition is to be complimented on presenting this motion. Just prior to tbe last federal elections a secret agreement, or understanding, was entered into between the Nationalist party of Australia, with Mr S. M . Bruce at its bead, and the big shipping interests on the other side of tbe world. A very short time after tbe making of that agreement the people of Australia were able to see its results, the first of which was tbe British shipping strike, and the laying up of ships as a consequence in Australia on the eve of the election. The Nationalists, with a cry of "" Law and Order,"" and by declaring their determination to stop industrial strife, were able to snatch a further three years' life in office. The British shipping companies having rendered a service to the Nationalists by creating the shipping stoppage, it became .necessary for tbe Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) and bis Nationalist supporters to pay the debt of gratitude which they owed for that service. The argreement received the support of the wealthy people of our country, and it was not long before we had evidence of the manner in which the Government set out to repay those who had assisted it. First of all we find ask honourable members that relief has been afforded to the wealthy pastoralists by a limitation of the land tax. We see further that the Commonwealth Bank has been sacrified and strangled in order to play into the hands, and add to the profits of the huge banking corporations of this country. We also remember the un-Australian policy of the present Nationalist Government when it set out to placate the wealthy shipping interests of Britain by letting the large and valuable contracts for the construction of two cruisers to ship-building firms in the Old Country. Now we have the Government's final proposal To sacrifice tbe Commonwealth Line of ships. The Prime Minister is at the head of a party which calls itself "" The Nationalist party."" There is nothing whatever of a national character about the party or",33,London 24th October
54,Mr C. Riley (Cook) [5.45],"I conits leaders. It coined its name at a time when Australia was in the throes of war. The Nationalist supporters cried from the housetops that Australia, as a result of its participation in the war, had attained to nationhood. They prided themselves on the fact that the Australian soldiers were the best-equipped soldiers in the war, and were the best fighters. They said that the country was engaged in a war the successful conclusion of which would open up for the people of Australia a. wonderful new era of development and prosperity. But all Australia has got out of the war is a government, headed by the great imperialist, tbe man who asked the Australian people to think imperially, and who is now asking them to act in furtherance of wealthy imperial interests at the expense of our young nation. Australian people, at the earliest opportunity, will show in no unmistakable manner their disapproval of the imperialistic policy enunciated by the Prime Minister. It appears that the Prime Minister now considers this country unable to build its own battleships, its own cruisers, and its own and unable to manufacture even the ordinary commercial products from our raw materials wbicb it requires. He would have us continue to be the wood and water joeys of Great Britain, and is even taking the necessary steps to prevent Australia from having a national shipping line I consider it my duty, as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, to address myself to this most important question. The committee, in its inquiry, examined 30 witnesses, who gave evidence relating to the activities of the Line. Of these, 29 were examined before the committee presented its interim report. The last witness was tbe chairman of the Shipping Board, who has been associated with the Commonwealth Shipping Line since its inception, and has of t times spoken of the benefits to Australia through the existence of the Commonwealth Line. In the interim report presented to the House on 10t.h August of last year, the committee made certain unanimous recommendations. Among other things, tbe report statedInvfow, however, of emphatic evidence placed before the committee that, owing to the Australia, interviewed by the Australian Press Sir.. C. Riley. uncertainty whicli exists concerning the continuance of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, its business has been adversely affected the committee has deemed it desirable to submit to Parliament, prior to the approaching recess, this interim report. The report goes on to sayTo arrive at a decision, apart from the question of Government policy, as to whether the Commonwealth Government Line should be continued, there must be considered what benefits have accrued to the country by ""the establishment of the Line, aud whehcr such benefits have outweighed any financial loss incurred as a result of its trading operations The evidence so far placed before the committee indicates that not only has the Commonwealth Line beeu directly responsible for actual reductions in freights, but that the presence of the Line has exerted a material restraining influence against proposed increases. Whilst it is difficult, in fact, almost impossible, owing to the many factors to be considered, to indicate in figures the actual gain to Australia by such action, it Tbe appears to the committee, from the evidence already heard, that the shippers and primary producers of Australia have derived much bene; fit from the establishment of the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. The committee, therefore, recommends that, in the interests of Australia, the Line be continued. That recommendation was a unanimous one, and it was signed by the ex-member submarines, for Warringah ( S ir Granville R y r i e ) . This report was very distasteful to tbe Prime Minister, who had repeatedly expressed his determination to get r i d of the Line, and it did not fit in with the views of Lord Inchcape, and the representatives of the wealthy shipping interests in the Old Country. Therefore, steps were taken to have the decision of the committee reversed. The first step was to appoint Sir Granville Ryrie, H i g h Commissioner of Australia. That gentleman told me on a number of occasions, and also expressed tbe view in public, that. the Shipping Line should lie retained. He had taken the platform, he said, in support of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) and bad told the people that it would be a boon to Australia. How, then, could he afterwards tell the people that it was of no use? Tbe Government knew his views, and he was therefore relieved of his position as chairman on the committee, and was sent the other side of the world as H i g h Commissioner. Here is an extract from the Daily Telegraph of 30th September, 1927 :-Sir Granville Ryrie, High Commissioner for Association, stated that lie was not the least surprised at thc recommendation to sell the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. He must bave imagined that the other members of the committe were as ready as he to turn a political somersault. Personally, he favoured unconditional sale. ready sustained, and which, it must be reHe was satisfied that the Line could not be .made to pay, as long as it remained under the I disagree with the views of the majority Australian register, entailing Australian labour conditions. He recognized that unconditional sale might involve the removal of thc vessels from the Australian run, or even purchase by a foreign company. Nevertheless, he thought that outright unconditional sale at a reasonable price would be justifiable, as he did not believe that the presence of seven Comwritten down transfer value of ships forming monwealth Line ships on the Australian run in reality affected ' or checked the Conference Lines, with tlieir huge fleet catering for the Australian freight and passenger traffic on various routes. A month or two ago I read reports of the launching of an Orient steamer in Great Britain. The ceremony was attended by the H i g h Commissioner. launched the vessel, and both she and Miss Ryrie received handsome presents from the private shipping company. TheH i g h Commissioner was rather indiscreet when he made reference to a controversial political question. He remarked that he did not believe that tbe presence of seven vessels of the Australian Commonwealth Line on the Australian run could check the Conference Line. members that the last proposal by tbe Conference Line for increased freights was successfully resisted by the Australian Commonwealth Line when it bad only seven vessels. I feel it my duty to say that confidential details placed before the Public Accounts Committee indicated that tbe operations of this Line bad led to substantial reductions in freight. On otlier occasions, its refusal to agree to increases, proposed in one instance by both Britisli and foreign ship-owners, had a successful result. To my mind the committee's recommendations are so much camouflage, and are designed to pave the way to the treacherous act of selling the vessels of the Line. The committee has recommended that the ships be handed over but it suggests all sorts of guarantees of co-operation between the Government and the company. that the committee did not urge that the same measure of support be accorded tbe present shipping board as it proposes should be given to the new company. The committee statedThe benefits now accruing to the country by its existence as a governmental concern are more than outweighed by the heavy losses alluctantly admitted, are likely to continue. of the committee, and also with the opinion expressed by tbe Prime Minister. The committee further recommendedTo deal with the assistance which might reasonably be expected from the Government, it is suggested that the already generously the Commonwealth Line should be further reduced on handing them over to the proposed company, if and when formed, on the distinct understanding that interest and depreciation should be actually paid, and not merely owed, to the Commonwealth Treasurer. If it was rigbt for the committee to make such a recommendation as that, is it not Lady Ryrief a i r to expect a similar concession to the board now operating the Line? During the last three years, the Line has not had a chance. Much press propaganda has been indulged in, and this has been in spired by those anxious to bring about its downfall. To enable honourable members to record a proper vote on tbe subject of the continuance of the line, they should be in possession of the confidential cables exchanged between the London office of Let me remind honourable the board and its bead office in Australia relating to proposed increases in freight. I am not at liberty to disclose the contents of those cables; but, as a member of the Public Accounts Committee, I am in possession of certain information which the Government should make available to honourable members. A fte r perusal of those cablegrams, honourable members would be quite satisfied that the Line has been, and still is, a determining factor in tbe adjustment of freights. Unfortunately, much of the evidence taken by the committee was heard in camera, and we bad to depend on the Government making available documents, the contents of which I cannot reveal. The committee, in bringing forward its recommendation, to an Australian company; has exceeded its powers. It would have been quite proper for it to inquire into the expenditure of public moneys, review such I notice expenditure, and submit observations or recommendations regarding them; but it has brought in a recommendation in this case that affects public policy, which should be determined, not by the committee, but by the Parliament and tbe Government of tbe country. Let us consider what other dominions are doing in regard to the Government shipping lines. The Daily Guardian of the 18th March last, statedWhile the Federal Government is still .marking time in regard to the future of the Australian Commonwealth Line, the Canadian Merchant Marine, of somewhat similar origin, is making rapid forward strides. In connection with the recently concluded trade agreement between Canada and the West Indies, which provided for the inauguration of a fast passenger and cargo service by the Canadian Government between Eastern Canadian and West Indian ports, the Canadian Government Merchant Marine has now arranged to operate this service, and, with this object in view; plans and specifications are being drawn up, and tenders will be called for at an early date for the construction of five 14-knot vessels of approximately 10,000 tons each, with up-to-date accommodation for first, second, and third class passengers. These vessels will be fitted with Diesel engines, and will be equipped with modern refrigeration for the carriage of f r u it , which will methods are a deliberate and open violation of be one nf thc principal features of this trade. ]u addition to these five ships-tw o of which it is anticipated will be built in Canada and three in England, and which will bo ready for service during .1928-the company intends to purchase a smaller vessel and convert two vessels of its present fleet with Diesel engines, in order to properly cater for the West Indian trade. to Australian ports from the cast and west coasts of Canada with fast cargo steamers, and may extend their Diesel-engined passenger elforts to these services at a later date. The total gross tonnage of the Canadian nature, except to say that they differ Line is over 200,000, and tbe net tonnage entirely from the proposal now put forover 125,000. It is still losing money, ward by this Government. To give an but there is no suggestion that its activiexample from the United States of ties should cease.

Riley. total of £593,S79, or less than one-third of the total loss incurred by the Canadian Government's shipping activities. It is also interesting to note that the Dominion of Canada is determined to carry on its shipping line, to provide new tonnage, and to build some of the ships in its own couutry, while Australia, which is spending three times as much as Canada on defence, is not prepared to shoulder a loss of roughly half a million sterling on its shipping activities. South Africa has adopted au opposite attitude from that taken up by tbe present Commonwealth Government. A cablegram from Capetown, published in the Daily Telegraph News Pictorial of the 20th October last, statesA dramatic turn was given the South African freight war by the intervention of the Union Government. The new Conference Lines recently decided to give a special discount to shippers of wool from South Africa, provided these shippers would employ exclusively the vessels of the Conference. The Government warns the Union Castle Company thut sueh the mail contract, and declares that they must be stopped immediately, otherwise the Government w ill not only take action to terminate the mail contract, by giving the necessary year's notice, but will also exercise its powers under the Post Office Act, and impose countervailing dock charges. Thc enterprise runs regular services Since the publication of that report, the South African Government, I have been informed, bas taken certain other measures to deal with the Conference Line"". I am not at liberty to disclose their the United States Merchant Marine is permanent venture is the tone of New York Fleet Coroporation has been superseded by the title of United States Shipping implication of temporary existence, nnd made reluctant to sever old connexions and Under the authority of an act of Congress, interest on debentures, poration, and Mr W.

The hoard states that the American Merchant Marine is on the seas to stay, and is confident that any future action of Congress dealing with that organization w ill be such as to ensure its permanency. That is the kind of encouragement that the Commonwealth Shipping Line has been crying out for during the last three or four years. Its future has not been definitely assured. No statement has been made by the Government to place it beyond doubt that tbe line has come to stay. The Shipping Act placed 54 steamers under tbe control of the board; less than 50 per cent, being operated by the board; the remainder being considered unsuitable, they were laid up for disposal. I propose to deal with the "" B a y "" steamers and the ex-enemy vessels-the "" Bays"" because they are apart from tbe "" Dales"" the latest addition to the fleet, and the ex-enemy vessels on account of their unsuitability and the huge losses incurred by them. result of the first period of tradingfrom 1st September, 1923, to 31st March, 1924-showe d a profit of £17,126 on the "" B a y"" steamers, and a loss of £115,351 on the ex-enemy vessels. For the twelve months ended 31st March, 1925, there was a profit on the "" Bays"" of £40,996, and a loss on the exenemy ships of £118,050. For the following year the "" B a y "" vessels showed a profit of £94,604, and the ex-enemy ships a loss of £43.122. The profits made by the ""Bays"" total £152,776, whereas the total losses incurred in connection with the ex-enemy vessels amount to £276,523. figures show tbe extent to which the exenemy vessels burdened tbe Line; even the best of tbem could not earn sufficient to cover voyage expenses. vessels transferred to tbe board, only seven were capable of being operated at a profit. -ships were never operated. much of the time of the board and its officers was devoted to their disposal rather than to the profitable utilization of tbe remaining vessels. I do not know who was responsible for framing tbe legislation governing the operations of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, but it was certainly framed by no friend of the Line. The act provides that each year the board shall find the sum of £236,282 as interest, that amount representing 5 per cent, on the debentures issued to tbe Treasury for the total cost of the fleet. The value of the fleet still .remaining is £3,400,000. With the exception of interest on any cash balance remaining from the sale of old tonnage, £170,000, being 5 per cent, ou £3,400,000, is all the board should be expected to pay. It will, therefore, be seen that the act requires the board to pay £66,000 per annum interest ou steamers which bave not bean used. The seven vessels which are capable of being operated at a profit, to earn sufficient to cover interest and depreciation, as at present required by the act, must return voyage profits amounting to over £400,000 per annum. That is impossible in any circumstance. Tbe unsuitable tonnagethe ex-enemy vessels, the ""Australs,"" and the "" D "" and "" E "" steamers-hav e been an encumbrance; and their disposal The both troublesome and costly. Sitting suspended from 6.14 to S p.m. monwealth Shipping Act the Commonwealth Shipping Board has had to charge interest upon the capital cost of the ships transferred to its control in 1923. In order to illustrate the extent to which this provision of the Commonwealth Shipping Act has affected the finances of tbe Line, I may instance the Emita, which was transferred to the board on the 1st September, 1928, when the board was established, at £3S,500; but which on the 2nd July, 1926, was sold for Those £1S,750. The expenses incurred on the vessel prior to the sale .amounted to £9,632, making the net proceeds £9,11S, or, roughly, 25 per cent, of the transOf the 54 ferred value.

55,Mr C. Riley,"Unde r the Com5 per cent, over a period of one year and four months. I also wish to refer to the action of the Government in increasing the value of the ""Bay"" £100,000, after a leading firm of ship valuers in London had valued the vessels early in 3923, at £500,000. For some unknown reason tbe Government or the general manager of the Line, decided to increase this valuation of tbe five "" Bay"" steamers to tbe extent I have mentioned, and this in spite of the fact that ship values declined between the time of valuation, and tbe transfer to tbe board. I have not been able to discover tbe reason for such action; but I say unhesitatingly that such a policy has detrimentally affected the finances of the Line to the extent of £25,000 per annum, representing 5 per cent, on tbe amount of the increased valuation for four years, or a total of £100,000. It bas also been necessary for the board to provide for depreciation on the higher valuation which, at the rate of 5 per cent., shows that tbe accounts of tbe Line have been affected to the extent of £200,000. This has materially assisted in ing the Line in the minds of the public. posite are opposed to a continuance of Commonwealth shipping activities, principally because the vessels under the control of the Commonwealth Shipping Board are not paying interest and depreciation on the capital cost; but tbey must also remember tlie direct and indirect benefit these ships have been to the Commonwealth, and the manner in which tbey have prevented the exploitation of shippers by other companies. We do not expect the vessels of the Royal Australian Navy to pay interest on their capital cost. We realize that they are performing necessary and valuable work in protecting Australia's trade routes and assisting in ensuring the safety of the nation. In the same way, we have to admit that while the Commonwealth Line has not been able to provide for interest and depreciation it has protected Australia from the aggression and exploitation of the Conference vessels. The prolonged absence of the chairman of the board ( Mr Larkin) from Australia has also had a detrimental effect upon the board's activities. Mr C. Riley. years of the board's existence, the chairman spent only ten months in Australia. As a result of his prolonged absence boats by many differences of opinion and misunderstanding arose between the chairman of the board and the two Sydney directors, Admiral Clarkson and Mr Farquhar. The consideration o i important matters of policy as held in abeyance or unnnecessarily delayed owing to the absence of Mr Larkin, wbo endeavoured to control tbe Line from London. In these and other ways, the chairman has not acted in the best interests of the Line, and has not applied himself to his important duties in the manner in which the Australian people expected. He should bave controlled tbe Line from Australia instead of from London, where be was in close touch with Lord Inchcape and generally in an atmosphere antagonistic to our shipping interests. When Mr Larkin returned from 'Great Britain some time ago one of bis first utterances on reaching Fremantle was to the effect that unless there was a discontinuance of industrial troubles on tbe vessels, the Line would prejudihave to go out of existence. That utterance show-ed clearly that he was doing Honourable members optbe work of Inchcape and trying to basten the time when it would be necessary to sell the Line. It has always been tbe policy of the chairman to irritate unionists at every possible opportunity, in an endeavour, I suppose, to create industrial turmoil. Wben secretary of a trades union twelve years ago, I was brought into contact with the deputy chairman of the board, Sir William Clarkson, whom I always regarded as a stern man. When he came before tbe committee as a witness during the chairman's absence, I was not leaning his way; but I must say that he endeavoured to conduct the Line in tbe best interests of the Australian people. Wben the Line was under the direct control of Mr Larkin, there were continual delays; but on his return to Great Britain, Sir William Clarkson, the deputy chairman, conferred with the representatives of the maritime unions in an endeavour to prevent or minimize industrial troubles. Frequent reference has been made to the manner in which tbe vessels under the control of tbe board For the first three have been held up owing to industrial disputes, but as there bave been no sucb disputes for two and a balf years so far as this Line is concerned, honourable members opposite will not be able to urge that as a reason for tbe sales of these vessels. Differences of opinion arose between tbe chairman and the other two members of the board on many points. For instance, the two Sydney directors said that as the service to the west of England coast was unprofitable it should be discontinued at the earliest possible date; but tbe chairman contended that if such a policy were adopted the usefulness of tlie Line would diminish, and its prestige would 'be affected. Tbe Sydney directors, who maintained that this unpayable service, in which losses to the exnage in tbe trade balf filled at existing tent of £400,000 have been incurred should be discontinued, were unable to convince the chairman as to the wisdom of this, and that it should be discontinued. lost by the "" Dale"" boats in this service, although Sir William Clarkson and Mr Farquhar maintained that it was impossible to make the service pay. Moreover, ex-enemy vessels were employed on this route, although tbey could carry only balf tbe tonnage and took twice the time that the "" Dale"" steamers did to do the trip. Any one who has had experience in that trade, or who has reviewed the financial results of the Line, would recommend tbe immediate discontinuance of the service to tbe west coast of England. The directors also differed in regard to the laying up of unsuitable tonnage. It is only right to say that the two Sydney directors maintained that ships which could not possibly earn voyage expenses should not be allowed to continue in commission. Although every voyage made by an ex-enemy vessel meant the piling up of losses, the chairman of directors could not see the wisdom of putting the old ships out of commission. There was also the question of whether the vessels of the Australian Commonwealth Shipping Line should co-operate with those of the Conference Line. The Sydney directors maintained that the vessels under their control could carry on to greater advantage without such cooperation; but with that view the chairman of directors did not agree.. I refer to these instances to show tbe undesirable and harmful results arising from tbe chairman's absence from Australia for sucb long periods. tors, refused to lay up the boats whicli were not paying? deputy chairman, Sir William Clarkson. and Mr Farquhar, were in favour of the west coast service being discontinued, and the unsuitable tonnage being laid up; but to such proposals the chairman would not agree. The Sydney directors considered that it would be better to have their vessels in the Australian-United Kingdom service fully loaded at reduced rates than to continue the existing tonrates. Failing, however, to persuade the Conference Line, they determined on a further reduction of freight. It is an undoubted fact that the Australian CommonLast year £56,000 waa wealth Line of Steamers is filling a most useful purpose. It has certainly made tbe loss which has evidently formed the base of the decision of tbe Government to sell the Line, but I think we should look upon it as being in the nature of a subsidy to Australian industry. Last year on exported primary products tbe Government paid £781,000 in bounties. I do not propose to mention the whole of the industries assisted in this way; it is quite sufficient to refer to tbe enormous bounty paid on exported wine. This bounty, which is paid at tbe rate of 4s. a gallon on exported wine, amounted last year to £442,410 on 2,212,000 gallons. If this country can afford to spend such a huge amount of money to assist the export of wine, surely it can afford to bear the loss incurred in running a line of steamers which renders such valuable assistance to all primary industries. Referring to tlie work of control boards, tbe Treasurer in his budget speech saidThe average annual export of the products now subject to organized systems of marketing totals, approximately, £9,500.000. Witb tbe disappearance of tbe Commonwealth steamers, and the immediate in' crease of freights that is likely to follow, many industries which now receive assistance from the Government will be obliged to come to this Parliament for further aid. When talking of the losses on our Line of steamers it is just as well to remind ourselves of other, ways in. which public",38,London 24th October
56,Mr Charlton,"Who, of the direc",40,London 24th October
57,Mr C. Riley,"Mr Larkin. Themoneys are beiug speut. Eor instance, tlie department of the Postmaster-General loses £270,000 each year in the despatch of press telegrams. Tbe Government and i ts supporters are content year in and year out to incur an annual loss in tbe despatch of press messages to inform people in the city of the most trivial happenings in country districts, yet they baulk at a loss of £200,000, or even £500,000, on a national shipping line. It is just as well to review some of the benefits that Australia has enjoyed through the existence of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. In January, 1923, the Line brought about a reduction of about 10s. a ton in freight. One of Australia's largest meat exporters told tbe Public Accounts Committee that this reduction, which amounted to -Jd. per lb. on rabbits, beef, mutton aud lamb, when made by tbe Commonwealth Line was followed a fortnight later by a similar reduction by tbe Conference Line. In 1925, against the strenuous opposition of tbe Conference Line, tbe Australian Commonwealth Line took a full cargo of canned fruits at 50s. a ton. There was a big sm^lus of canned fruit to be exported, ancl the prevailing rate at tbe time was 70s. a ton, but since then it has remained at 50s. a ton. As 25,000 tons of canned fruit are exported from Australia each year, the saving on that one item alone is £25,000 a year. August, 1925, the Sydney directors of the Australian Commonwealth Line endeavoured to bring about a reduction in freights. other communications were exchanged with the chairman of the who was don, but no finality could be reached until the Sydney directors, over the bead of the chairman, issued instructions to the London manager to announce certain reductions of freight to take effect from the 12th July, 1926, It has been said that the reductions in freight made by the Australian Commonwealth Line have been simultaneous with those made by the Conference line. Tbat such has not been. the case can be proved by what happened at the time of the reduction in July, 1926. At a meeting of the Conference held in London on 9th July, 1926, there was a point-blank refusal to approve of the reductions proposed by the Sydney directors of the Australian Commonwealth Mr C. Riley. Line. The meeting adjourned on the Friday ancl was not to assemble again until the following Tuesday, but upon the receipt of tbe cablegram from the Sydney directors' of the Australian Commonwealth Line giving tbe instructions I have mentioned to tbe London manager of the Line, the Conference was able to meet during the week end and announce a simultaneous reduction of freight. Tlio Conference people were not able to specify exactly tbe items affected or the amount of reductions to be made, but they were able to anuounce their reductions simultaneously with those of the Australian Commonwealth Line. That is a clear instance in which tbe Australian Commonwealth Line was responsible for forcing a reduction in freights. The Sydney members of the board had for the best part of twelve months been struggling to get the Conference Line to agree to a reduction. In December, 1925, there was a proposal to increase freights by 10 per cent. The chairman of the board of directors of the Australian Commonwealth Line, who was in England at the time, was agreeable to an increase, but as the Sydney directors refused tbeir consent the increase did not come about. In October, 1926, tbe Conference Line and foreign ship-owners agreed to an immediate advance of 15 per From cent, on outward freights. The excuse tbey put forward was that an increase was justified by the coal trouble then in existence. The Sydney directors, howNumerous cablegrams and ever, knowing that their seven oil-burning ships could not be affected by any coal Board trouble, did not avail themselves of tbe at the time in Lonexcuse to increase freights, and owing to their determined attitude, the increase was not made. Last week I asked tbe Prime Minister whether he would make available to honourable members the confidential cablegrams that passed between the London and the Sydney offices of tbe Australian Commonwealth Line. If honourable members had an opportunity to peruse those documents, they would find that tliey bear out every statement. I bave made regarding the influence that the Australian Commonwealth Line has had on the freight question. In tbe minority report of tlie Public Accounts Committee it is recommended that, in lieu of agencies, the Australian Commonwealth Line should have branches. That recommendation refers particularly to the agency at Colombo, aud was made witb a view to removing some of tbe difficiiltics ancl obstacles that militate against the successful working of tlie Line. Tbe Australian Commonwealth. Line carries more tea from Colombo than does any other line. In fact, it has earned a reputation for the manner in wbicb it carries this particular cargo. Prior to tbe formation of tlie Shipping Board in 1923, an arrangement was made between Mr Larkin, the chairman of the board, and the Conference, to limit tbe number of calls of vessels of the Australian Commonwealth Line at Colombo to fifteen per annum. Our seven vessels could make eighteen calls each year at this port: but owing to this arrangement tbey cannot call whenever profitable cargo is offering. This has had a very serious effect on the earning of our steamers, because tea is the most profitable cargo tbey can carry. Some time back there was trouble witb the native labour at Colombo, and as a result one of the "" B a y "" boats was not able to get its cargo of tea wben it called. The management of the Line decided to despatch a ""Dale"" boat to pick up the cargo offering, but the agents of the Line in Colombo, who are also agents for tbe Conference Line, said that tbey could not load a ""Dale"" boat without the permission of the Conference Line. I have drawn attention to this in order to show how the activities of our steamers have been hampered, and how foolish and costly it is to employ as agents men whose business it is to find cargo for the Conference Line instead of striving to get cargo for the Australian Commonwealth Line. In order to show what some of our commercial men think of the Australian Commonwealth Line, and particularly of tbe way in which it handles tea shipments, I shall quote a copy of a letter sent to «the Commonwealth Shipping Board by one of tbe largest of our tea importers. It is dated Sydney, 15th June, 1926Thc Manager, Commonwealth Line of Steamers, 15 O'Connell-street, Sydney. Dear Sir, Adverting to the call yesterday of your marine superintendent, we have pleasure in confirming our verbal statement that we are very satisfied with the manner in which our tea cargoes have been handled by the Commonwealth Line of Steamers, and in furtheranceof this we enclose extract from a letter written; to our Colombo agents on the 10th February last, four months before the call of youimariiie superintendent. Wo find that by the "" Bay"" Line of Steamers the percentage of broken packages is much smaller. Secondly, that our claims arc met much more promptly than by other companies, whoalways endeavour to evade paying claims i i possible. Thirdly, the sorting of the various marks is done much more efficiently. Fourthly, since the other Lines have had the competition of the "" Bay"" Line they have improved very considerably their standard of shipping, and are now taking special care of tea cargo, where previously no care wa3 taken. Claims are met much more promptly than heretofore, and the stacking certainly has improved, although it is even now a long way behind the "" B a y "" Line. F if t h l y, the "" B a y "" Line has always been able to give us more freight in Colombo than we receive by the other steamers, which very often would only l if t half the cargo we required carried. We think this is one reason why the "" Bay"" steamers are carrying the tea better, because they have proper stowage room, where as some of the other boats stack our tea on top of cargo from London, and it has consequently to be removed two or three times to land other cargo at Fremantle, Adelaide, and Melbourne, and this extra handling results in a much larger percentage of breakages. This letter was signed by a director of one of our largest tea importing firms. He also forwarded for the information of tbe Line the following copy of a letter addressed to the Colombo agents of the company, under date 10th February, 1926 :Messrs. Heath& Co., Colombo. Gentlemen, We note from yours of 22nd January that the Gathay had no space available, and the Otranlo only 250 tons, but that the Esperance Bay has plenty of space for all requirements. We are rather pleased than otherwise, as the "" Bay"" Line of Steamers carries tea much better than any other Line. Tlieir sorting this end is much better, and the percentages of broken packages is practically n i l ; whereas the P. and O. do not sort out lines nearly as well, and their percentage of broken packages is much greater. Whenever there is a "" B a y "" steamer leaving about the same time, we would much prefer you to ship by it , and one wire strapping is quite sufficient for packages shipped by this Line. The following summary of the Commonwealth shipping activities clearly sets out tlie position:Capital cost to Government of merchant tonnage purchased or built, including Australs. sailers, exenemy vessels, "" D "" and.

The Line forced an all-round reduction in rates of roughly 10s. per ton in January, 1923. Since then the Line has carried approximately 800,000 tons of cargo into Australia, representing, at 10s. a ton, a saving of £400,000. The Line controls roughly 10 per cent, of total imports, therefore' the saving to importers to date is approximately £4,000,000. Since January, 1923, Mr C. Riley. the Line has carried approximately 850,000 tons of cargo from Australia to the United Kingdom, f representing, at 10s. per ton, a saving of £425,000, and, as the Line only carried 10 per cent, of exports, the total saving to primary producers bas been approximately £4,250,000. Again, in August, 1926, the Line forced another . . 14,890,000 reduction in. rates to the United Kingdom, which approximated 10s. per ton. 625,000 The Line bas carried from that date 150,000 tons of cargo from Australia, re.. . . 14,265,000 presenting a further saving of £75,000, or a total savings on all exports of £750,000. Thus it will be seen that our primary producers have benefited to the extent of £5,000,000, and there has been a saving to primary producers and importers and exporters of £9,000,000. Deducting from this sum, the amount lost on shipping activities, £5,298,000, we find that the Commonwealth Line has, . . £4.940,000 at a modest estimate, benefited Australia generally to the extent of approximately £3,702,000. The Com.. 203,000 monwealth Line carries^ roughly, £1,500,000 worth of freight each year. S30,000 It follows, therefore, that if it is to go out of existence, this amount, less loading 205,000 and discharging costs, which approximate 5,708 000 : 20 per cent, of the total, will pass into the pockets of the Inchcape group. This .. 8,557,000 explains the interest shown by the Australian representatives of the.Conference and two Line in the development of the Government's policy. The Prime Minister this .. 485,000 afternoon held out very little hope that the earnings of the Line would improve. I do not share his view. I believe that 41,000 the Line bas turned the corner, and that, 3,259,000 as tbe result of discontinuing the unprofitable trade with the west coast of England, the disposal of unsuitable tonnage, and concentrating on the London to Australia trade, its prospects were never brighter than they. are to-day. I feel 'sure that earnings in future will cover riot only administrative expenses, but also make available an amount towards interest and depreciation. I should like to point out, however, that it is impossible, approximately with only seven ships to comply with the whole of the requirements of the act. To do that, voyage profits to be earned by the seven ships should reach at least £400,000 per minim Tlie vessels of the Line are doing exceptionally well on the London to Australia run. The Ferndale and its sister ship the Fordsdale, are the finest cargo vessels engaged in the Australian trade. In A p r i l last the former ship left London with the largest cargo ever loaded by any steamer for Australia from that port. The Bay Liners, as honourable members are aware, come out from the United Kingdomf u l l of passengers and carry about 20 per cent, of the passenger traffic between Australia and tbe mother country. The majority report of the committee discloses little or no concern for the welfare of the Line, or for the benefits derived by the Commonwealth. One firm of shipping agents at Australia House controls the whole of the passenger arrangements in connection with migration. There is no reason why the Commonwealth Line itself should not do the work, and so add to its earnings. This money should not go into the pockets of private shipping companies. A t first sight it may appear extraordinary that greater support for the Line comes from the United Kingdom instead of Australia; but when we remember that certain business firms, such as Dalgety's, which are largely concerned in the wool industry in Australia, ancl finance the man on tbe land, are also shipping agents, it is easy to understand wby the Line lacks a f u l l , measure of support from this end. Sucb firms are not likely to do anything that w ill lessen their profits as shipping agents. Therefore, they influence shippers at this end to patronize otlier lines. The Government bas indicated that it intends to sell the Line. I regard this decision as a tragedy. The Line has been struggling for tbe last three years under a cloud of uncertainty. The Government has been neglectful of ' its interests. The Prime Minister sliould have made a definite declaration that the Line was here to stay. The Ministry should not have allowed this feeling of uncertainty as to the future to interfere w i th the earnings of the steamers. Shippers are not likely to patronize the Linei f there is a risk that it w ill go out of existence in the course of a. few months. In tbe United Kingdom, however, shippers are free to patronize any vessels that are offe/ing, but it is well known that the Conference Line has endeavoured to bring pressure to bear on tbem. It is on record that spies employed by the Inchcape group have been found on the wharves and in the sheds at the London docks, obtaining particulars of marks on the various packages and parcels shipped by the Commonwealth Line. Obviously it is the intention of the shipping combine to even up matters wben the Commonwealth Line goes out of existence. This is a lamentable state of affairs. The present propaganda for the sale of the Line is the culminating point after years of sabotage by an unsympathetic Government and the shipping ring, aided very ably by poisonous statements inserted in tbe newspapers in Australia and overseas. The following cable published by the Sydney Morning Herald on 26th October, 1927, is a sampleOfficials of the Conference Lines do not disguise their keen interest in the recommendation of the Federal Public Accounts Committee to sell the Commonwealth Line of Steamers. They are at present anxious, owing to varying reports, to know the precise conditions under which tlie ships will be offered. Their view is that the ships must be permitted to be placed on the British registry and to be worked on British rates of pay. They urge that €lie buyer must not be bound never to raise rates in view of ever-mounting handling costs in Australia. They also seek withdrawal of the condition that the buyer shall not be associated with the Conference. In this regard they point out that the Commonwealth Lino for several years has fixed freights and other conditions of business in conjunction with the Conference. That statement is not true. I have already pointed out that in January, 1923, the Commonwealth Line forced a reduction of 10s. a ton in freight rates from Australia, and that the Conference Line followed suit as quickly as possible. Regardedf r o m tbe point of view of ship-owners who are anxious to increase freights, the continual cry of increased labour costs in Australia is quite understandable. I point out, however, that in recent years the only increases which have taken place are those which bave been due to rises in tbe cost of living, in accordance with statistics that are compiled by tbe Commonwealth Statistician. The truth of the matter is that the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers has compelled certain reductions in freight rates, and on other occasions has prevented increases. Representatives of the overseas steamship companies were invited by the Public Accounts Committee to give evidence before it. Either they had none to tender, or tbey were content to leave the matter in the hands of the Prime Minister and his supporters. If tbe Line is sold to a private Australian company, the Conference Line will experience no difficulty in smothering it very quickly. All it will bave to do is to so arrange its schedule of sailings as to blanket tbe Australian company, and eventually crush the private company. The existence of the Commonwealth Line provides a means for determining whether importers and exporters are being exploited by other companies that engage in the Australian trade. beneficial to Australia in the event of an outbreak of war, because tbe seven vessels of tbe fleet bave been so built that they may be transferred into auxiliary cruisers. borne in mind that the recent Geneva Conference was a complete fiasco. It is common"" knowledge that the nations were not able to arrive at an agreement on the question of disarmament. In the light of the conditions that at present exist in the world, the sale of this Line would be nothing short of treachery. vessels were banded private concern and placed on 'the British register they would be commandeered by the British in the event of an outbreak of hostilities, and would not be available for the carriage of our produce or the transport of our troops. We would thus be compelled to shoulder another foolish and costly expenditure in the purchase of, perhaps, wooden ships from America. Kidmans and the Mayobs would be given a further opportunity to make profits totalling thousands of pounds out of the construction of ships with dummy bolts and other questionable features. Just as it is necessary to bave an Australian Navy, so it is also necessary to have a Line of Steamers. are being made by foreign shipping companies are reaching serious proportions and cause me, as an ex-member of the Australian Imperial Forces, grave concern. When I consented to take a part in the last conflict I beMr 0. Riley. lieved the statements that were made at the time that it was a war that was to end all wars, and make the world safe for democracy. Tbe returned soldiers have a right to be heard on this matter. In view of the strong hold that is being obtained by German, Norwegian, and other foreign companies, we should strengthen rather than weaken our position in the shipping world. The following is an account of a new German steamer that I have abstracted from tbe press:The recently launched German steamer Haiti, second of the seven 12,000-ton liners being constructed by the Nbrddeutcher Lloyd Company for the Australian trade, reached Melbourne on her maiden voyage on Saturday. She is a sister ship to the liner Alter, which left Sydney last week with 20,000 bales of wool for the Its retention would also be United Kingdom. It is desirable that our wool and other products should be carried overseas in our own ships and not in foreign bottoms. The Government prates-a great deal about It must be its patriotism and nationalism. If these vessels are disposed of there will be the danger of their eventually coming into the possession of a neighbouring foreign power. Wben we realize that the five ""Bays"" and the two ""Dales"" were specially strengthened to enable them to carry armaments equal if not superior If its to those of our cruisers, we must admit over to a that it would be an act of treachery to sell them. The economical speed of both the ""Bays"" and tbe ""Dales"" is 14* Government knots, but in case of emergency the former are capable of 16 and the latter of 17 or 18 knots. I am quite prepared to leave tbe decision to the people of Australia, confident of their refusal to sanction such a treacherous act. The the fastest cargo boats afloat? Australian run a vessel that can compare with them. The benefits which the existence of the Line confers upon Australia, cannot be measured in terms of pounds, shillings and pence. The enormous assistance which it renders to our Commonwealth primary producers in particular, and to The advances that Australia generally cannot be shown iu a balance-sheet. We should consider the influence that is wielded by the Line rather than the loss of a paltry £300,000. £400,000 or even £500,000. Tbe supporters of the Government are prepared to vote millions of pounds to defray the cost of constructing cruisers. Notwith-",40,London 24th October

59,Mr C. Riley,"There is not on thestanding the huge expenditure on tha Australia it was taken outside Sydney Heads and sunk after it had been a unit of the Australian Navy for only ten or eleven years. We must exhibit fairness avid generosity, and not allow tbe question of loss to overshadow tbe boon that the Line has been to Australia. The Prime Minister made a lengthy reference to refrigerated space, and said that if need be the Government could subsidize a new company. Each of the "" Dale"" boats has 160,000 cubic feet of insulated space, and each of tbe "" B a y "" boats 350,000 cubic feet. Their combined capacity, therefore, exceeds 2,000,000 cubic feet. They are the very vessels of which the Commonwealtli should retain possession. Because they have been engaged in tbe trade between Australia and the United Kingdom a better type of' steamer has been employed by the other shipping companies. Thc"" Bays"" carry 750 passengers, providing better passenger accommodation than the Orient and P. and O. Shipping Company's vessels which carry from 1,000 to 1,250. They are ideal for the transport of migrants to our shores, and if the Government is in earnest with its migration policy, it will reconsider its decision to sell them. If the Line is sold, and freights are subsequently increased, I shall hesitate to relieve the primary producers of auy difficulties due to an increase in freights, unless they protest against the action of the Government. If the losses that bave been incurred are a legitimate reason for selling, the Government, will find if very difficult to justify tbey may go. If the freight on wool is the continuance of other services on which tbe annual loss is greater. Tbe Prime Minister referred to the extent to wbich the Line had engaged in the carriage of wheat and wool, and said that that was not a factor in the fixation of rates on those two commodities. I maintain that it is a. factor which has been abundantly proved since the Line came into existence. The information which I have is that each year the Line carries between 50,000 and 60,000 tons of wheat and flour, in"" about equal proportions. It must, therefore, be considered a factor. The cargoes thiil; it lifts are at least equal to those carried by either the P. and O., or Orient vessels. Whoever may purchase the Line in the event of its being sold, they will not carry one ton more of wheat than is being carried at tbe present time. Mauy members of the Country party have argued that the Line is of no benefit to the primary producer, because the middleman derives the advantage that accrues from any reduction in freights. In the event of an increase being made, would it be borne by tbe middleman in the city? Certainly not; it is tbe primary producer wbo would suffer. Therefore, the Line is a. distinct advantage to him. Members of the Country party will be called upon at the next election to justify the actio:) which tbey take in respect of this matter. What would have happened to the primary producers during tbe British shipping strike if tliere bad not been Australian ships to carry their produce to the markets of the world? They would have been in a very sorry plight. Do honourable members imagine that the primary producers are agreeable to the sale of the Line, and the transferrence of tbe whole of the shipping business ;,o a conference that meets in London and fixes fares and freights without any regard to tbe interests of this young land? 1 believe that they are opposed to the taking of such a step. The Prime Minister referred to the carriage of wool. On a number of occasions the Line has been instrumental in securing a reductiou in the freight on that commodity. Woolbuyers from the United States of America, Japan, Prance and other continental countries are given instructions by their employers regarding tbe limit to wbicb reduced by one-eighth of a penny or one farthing a pound, they are in a position to increase tlieir bids to that extent. Thus the wool-grower benefits. The Prime Minister referred also to the establishment by the Queensland Government of State stations, butcher shops, and so on. I place this Line in an altogether different category of State enterprises. I could understand opposition by members of this Government to tbe establishment of a chain of butchers' shops or a State bakery, because they are bitter opponents of State enterprises; but seeing that we are 11,000 miles from the markets of the world, there can be no objection to a Commonwealth Shipping Line any more than to a nationally-owned railway system, post office or similar utility. The Prime Minister referred to last year's loss on the "" B a y "" boats. Unfortunately we have not the latest figures of the Auditor-General, but I understand that the "" B a y "" and the "" D a l e"" boats last year showed a voyage loss of £80,000. That loss cannot be taken as a guide for this year or future years, because the whole position has changed. The Shipping Board has dispensed with unsuitable tonnage and unprofitable services. Last year, owing to the drought conditions that existed in Australia, there was a great shrinkage in Australian exports, as shown by tbe following table:Exports for 1925-20. lb. Butter Wool Frozen beef and mutton Last year there was in our exports a decrease in butter of 31 per cent., in wool of 4 per cent., and in frozen beef and mutton of 35 per cent. must bave affected tbe earnings, not only of the Australian Commonwealth Line, but also of the other lines trading to Australia. There is no reason for basing our exports for next year on those of last year, because the position has undoubtedly improved since. Reference was made by the Prime Minister to the extraordinarily bad treatment that the Australian Commonwealth Line had received at the hands of tbe Australian seamen. Let me say that there has been no industrial trouble on the vessels of that line for the last two and a half years. Considerable harm has been done to the Line by the criticism of the Australian press, arid the failure of the Government to declare its policy. The Prime Minister referred to the domicile of the seamen employed on the Australian vessels, many of whom are domiciled in the United Kingdom, but I ask, how can we expect the seamen working on the Commonwealth owned vessels to transfer their homes to Australia when they do not know at what moment the Government will dispose of the Line. and ""Dale"" boats spend more time in English ports than in Australian ports, and therefore the seamen would naturally be domiciled in Great Britain. Sir. O. Riley. Government would state definitely that the Line was to be continued, Australian seamen would be eager to apply for employment. In conclusion, let me say, that the day of retribution must surely arrive. If tbe Government sells the Australian Commonwealth Line, and it is my privilege to be a member of the Federal Parliamentary Labour party when it is returned to power, those whomay have assisted in the disposing of the Line, without a thought for the interests of Australia and our export trade, will receive no quarter or consideration at my hands. Exports for 1926-27. appears to me that as the Prime Minislb. ter had already assured the House 107,470,000 115,457,000 that the Government would early 273,759,000 201,848,000 this week express its intention respecting tbe Australian Commonwealth 244,998,000 158,772,000 Line of Steamers, the submission of this no-confidence motion was premature, and entirely unwarranted. Of course, I realize that the members of the OpposiThat shrinkage tion are anxious to make as much political capital out of this question as possible, but I think that their ardour will be more or less dampened by the opinions of the authorities that I shall quote in respect of Government enterprise. Before proceeding with the history of the Australian Commonwealth Line-and we are mainly concerned with its operations since 1923I shall refer to some of the remarks of previous speakers. The honourable member for Cook( Mr C. Riley) bas told us that tbe Line has turned the corner-whateve r that may mean-bu t I do not think that it will ever enter the "" straight."" The only straits that it will ever reach will be financial straits. He also accused the Government of not being able to deal adequately with this national enterprise, but it suited bis book to eulogize the previous administration, which, in entirely different circumstances, found it necessary during a national crisis, to establish the Commonwealth fleet. I acknowledge that that action was very necessary, but it is apparent that the circumstances to-day are entirely differThe ""Bay"" ent.

60,Mr Gardner (Eobertson) [9.4],"I ttake advantage of the high prices that -were ruling at that time. The honourable member for Cook bas accused the Government of financial inexperience, but I would inform bim that its recent achievement of adjusting the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States has placed it high in the opinion of the people of Australia, and its action respecting the Commonwealth Line, when thoroughly understood and analyzed, will bring it further kudos. The honourable member also referred to the substantial reductions in freight that had been brought about by the Line to certain cablegrams, and to tbe members of the Shipping Board. As a member of tbe committee which submitted the report that is now being considered by the House, I gave serious consideration to the evidence that was adduced, and I honestly could not make up my mind whether the Australian Commonwealth Line was tbe sole factor in reducing freights, or whether it really had any influence in that direction at all. It was a perfect tangle to me. I could come to no decision respecting the relation of the Commonwealth Shipping Board to the -Conference Line. Wheni t seemed to suit the board, it was with the Conference Line, but at other times it suited the Board to be in competition. I believe that the press has already made public the fact that when a certain reduction in freights took place, which a majority of the members of the board believed would have come about in any case, the majority by cable insisted that it should be the first to make the announcement and thus reap the resultant kudos. Tbat was certainly not a gentlemanly action, on the part of the majority of the members of the board. I believe it was tbe Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Charlton) who said that this investigation should not have been undertaken by the committee. I disagree with him, and would'remind him that another title for the public accounts committee is tbefinancecommittee. investigation should not have been undertaken by tbe committee. member for Cook must have made that .statement. Mr 0. RILEY I said that the committee had exceeded its powers. Parliament as a whole could have obtained the details that were placed before the committee. Considerable evidence was taken from the Commonwealth Shipping Board, its staff, and other shipping and commercial interests. The Government has been twitted with being concerned about an annual lo3S of half a million pounds on the Line, and having no concern about expending millions on bounties. I do not think that the reference to bounties is very fortunate, because they are granted for the purpose of establishing industries in this country and giving employment to our'workers. In contract, the Line has been operating at a loss of £595,000 annually; no special industry is being established by it, and little employment is being given to Australian seamen. A great deal has been said about tbe primary producers reaping a direct benefit from the Australian Commonwealth Line. does not deny that they do? benefit, but it is very difficult to calculate in round figures. Tbe honourable member for Cook mentioned £2,000,000, but that is an ephemeral and not a concrete figure. No business person considering a proposition would accept an imaginary profit and loss account. We must get down to facts and I cannot agree that any sum can be calculated as representing the benefit that has accrued to the primary producer as a result of the operations of the Line. There may have been a reduction of one-tenth or one-sixteenth of ld. per lb. in the freight on wool, but one cannot say definitely from the evidence put before the committee that that saving actually went into the pockets of the primary producers, or that the price of wool in the sale room bad been affected, because many factors are at work there. In the absence of precise information, it is absurd to fix upon a round sum of £2,000,000 as having been saved to our people, to enter it in a fictitious profit and loss account, and expect business people to accept that statement as evidence.

65,Mr Gardner,"They reap somethe Opposition said that the Line had been detrimentally affected by the uncertainty as to its future. Evidence taken before tbe committee showed that press propaganda may have created some animus towards tbe Line. We read in the newspapers from time to time inspired reports, guesses as to what a committee intends to do, and speculations regarding decisions of Ministers. predictions of a section of the press that tbe Government intended to sell the Commonwealth ships may bave been somewhat detrimental to the Line at that time, but for a considerable period tbe enterprise has not been prejudiced in that way, and tbe cargoes offering left nothing to be desired. report mentioned that the Line was injured by frequent industrial troubles. The endeavour to place the Line on a business footing was frustrated at the outset by hold-ups and cessations of work. Tbese interruptions continued until June, 1925, and I suggest to the Leader of tlie Opposition that the attitude of the unions did more injury to the Line than any rumour of a projected sale. interim report submitted by the Public Accounts Committee in August, 1926. So far as I was concerned, that report was submitted in tbe interests of the Line. An interim report is never very satisfactory, but the committee thought it wise to prevent, if possible, the Line from sufsels could not maintain the require.' fering in the estimation of shippers through any suspicion that it was unstable. The public knew, however, that the committee had not completed the taking of evidence, or the consideration in detail of that which had been taken, and that its attitude would be known only when it submitted its final report. In comparing the Australian monwealth Line with private shipping enterprises, the Leader of the' Oppositior said that handicapped by being obliged to pay 5 per cent, interest on the capital advanced by the Treasurer. quently he referred to a British company paying a dividend of 12 per cent. Surely that dividend was a handicap in favour of the Government enterprise. Tbe Commonwealth Line was required by the act to pay taxation like any private company, but, unfortunately, there were no ilr.. Gardner. profits upon which it could be taxed. Its private competitors, however, are subject to a very high rate of taxation, and that gives a further advantage to the Commonwealth Line. Another charge made by the honourable gentleman was, that the Government had not assisted the Line as it should have done. Tbat was a somewhat illogical charge, because the GovernThe ment more or less staked its reputation on the Line when it transferred it to the control of the Shipping Board. I heard no evidence of the failure of the Government to help this State enterprise. The Leader of the Opposition said that £130,000 is paid to a private compaiij for tbe carriage of mails between Europe The committee's and Australia. As I understand that contract, only £30,000 a year is paid in respect of mails, the balance being a subsidy for tbe provision of refrigerater . 1 space so that perishable primary products may be carried to markets overseas. Another complaint was that assisted migrants are carried on the vessels of private companies. Under the Lang regime, it was easier for a camel to pas; through the .eye of a needle than for -Reference has been made to tbe migrant to enter the.State of New SoutWales.

Deciding to gi... the Line a fair chance, the Governmenvsecured tbe consent of Parliament ir 1923 to legislation that was very definitely of a helpful character.

In Subseone section of the profit and loss account, that interest charge appears, but it was never paid, and the accumulated arrears are now approximately £900,000. In an ordinary business, however, the charge would appear much higher, because compound interest would have been charged on the overdue balance. It is obvious that the board failed to comply with one of the main conditions laid down by Parliament for the control of the Line. Whilst depreciation has been charged in tbe profit and loss account, no reserve fund has been created for the replacement of lost or obsolete ships. I do not profess to be an authority on this subject, but it is obvious that tbe depreciarally speaking, setting out to curtail expendition charge was not high enough, and the actual financial positionof the Line is much worse than the statement of assets and liabilities indicates. considerable Liability for compound interest, and a further charge should be made for reasonable depreciation. On these two accounts some of tbe profits alleged to have been made by tbe Line must be considerably reduced. From a commercial point of view, the Line is now in an absolutely unsound position. From time to time we have heard the Leader of the Opposition, ancl his Deputy( Mr Scullin) deprecating the present policy of borrowing, and that such should be restricted to the ultmost extent. ment policy made by tbe Prime MinisterI am entirely in agreement with them; but after telling the people of Australia that we are borrowing too much money, they would, presumably, justify a loan bill to raise money for tbe purchase of new ships for the Line.

With such a testimony from a Labour Premier, it should not be necessary to carry this debate very far. Apparently trying to conduct State enterprises on sound business lines. Such a damning statement from a leader of a party which advocates the socialization of industry should help members to come to a right conclusion upon this censure motion. In regard to the announcement of Governthis afternoon, members of tbe Public Accounts Committee appreciate the fact that, although Ministers have not been able to accept all of their recommendations, effect is* likely to be given to some, of them.

Minister assured the House that due attention is to be paid to providing refrigerating space. Not only will there be stipulations regarding an Empire register and refrigerating space, but there is to be a guarantee of a ten years' service for passengers and cargo. When tbe negotiations are being carried out, I have no doubt that tbe Government will be able to satisfy the House that, the interests of Australia are adequately safeguarded. There are many stalwarts in the defence of the shipping Line on the other side of tbe House. do not think they will deny that they are doing their best in the interests of the trade unions on whose behalf this Line has, to a considerable extent, been run, although up to 1925 tbe industrialists did their best to wreck .it. We, on this side, would be quite logical in asking that tbe primary producers, if tire Line has been such a tremendous benefit to them, should be prepared to back tbe horse of their fancy, and come forward with the money necessary to take the ships over themselves. The same choice is open to tbe trade unions, and if they bad at their command the capital represented by losses caused through strikes, they would have suflicient wealth Woollen Mills. to buy tbe Line twice over. Those who consider that they have derived benefits from tbe operation of this Line, and who think that it ought to be continued, now have an opportunity to acquire the Line for themselves, nnd to bring it under the British register. bave much pleasure in supporting the motion brought forward by the Leader of the Opposition. Tbe action of tbe Government in attempting to dispose of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers is another illustration of tenderer. its wrecking policy. The Labour party is the party of construction, and has built up monuments to its greatness in variousState and Commonwealth instrumentalities. Immediately . a Labour Government goes out of office, the the die-hards, who dislike any progressivemovement, or anything which will affect the interests of tbeir friends, supportersThe Prime and subsidizers, are at pains to undo the work which the Labour administration has performed. An instance of this wasrecently seen in this chamber when, for the purpose of further hamstringing the Commonwealth Bank-that great menu-* ment to a great party-the general banking branch was separated from the savings bank department, upon a variety of illogical pretexts. Gradually the Commonwealth Bank has been made merely an in strument in support of the private associated banks. The Government has wrecked tbe Commonwealth Bank, or at least, for I the time being, has made it of no value to the people of Australia, in whose interests it was first instituted. Tbe Government professes to feel very strongly on the point that the people's money should not be wasted in prolonging tbe operation of the shipping line, and that is practically tbe only reason which has been advanced to support its determination to dispose of it. Practically all the arguments put forward bave been to the effect that the Line is losing money, and, therefore, it should not be a burden any longer on the taxpayers.

The Prime Minister also saidWe say that wo do not believe in trading ventures by tlie Government as being the right way to conduct thc affairs of this country. Honourable members opposite take a very different view; they believe in the nationalization of industry, production; distribution, expeople. change, and other things, and it is only natural that they should resent the sale of the woollen mill. That is quite correct. The Lahour party stands for nationalization, which is the ultimate goal of Labour, and of the people. We believe that the time is rapidly approaching when pivate enterprise will not be able to carry on the instrumentalities wbicb arc now being conducted inefficiently by it. The Line was established because of the lack of tonnage to 1 Australia supplied by private enterprise -during the war. Not only did private enterprise then fall down on the job in the matter of conveying our primary products to the overseas markets, but it also failed in regard to finance. Had it not been for the Commonwealth Bank, an instrumentality established by the Labour party in the interests of the people, wbich, during the war, raised over £400,000,000, Australia would have been in a sorry plight. But the Government and its supporters have no sort of thankfulness to such an institution; they are only concerned with tbe profits of their friends. tries get on without such an institution ceiving £850 a ye*ar, and on top of £9,500 as the Commonwealth Bank? in England and every European country, and also, fell down on the job during the war. Private enterprise is intbe country we have a number of capable of carrying on during times of highly paid officials ostensibly for the crisis. This Line was established during purpose of managing a Line which could tbe war to protect the people, and the be controlled by one man. There is a Prime Minister admitted this afternoon London manager, and a Western Austhati t had done so, and had been of great tralian manager; an agent here and an benefit to tbem. The war is over, and agent there. This is the way the great the world bas been made safe for Nationalist Government, composed of democracy!

As far as book entries are concerned I am convinced that, when all things were considered there would be no loss to the If the Line were disposed of, and war broke out again, we should have to re-establish this instrumentality, or "" pay through tbe nose "" to private enterprise as we bave done in the past. I protest against tbe Government's hostility and coldness towards the Line. The inefficient condition into which it was allowed to drift was due to the indifference of the Government, who tolerated many things which would not have been permitted in a private business. We have three directors managing seven vessels! This is done under a business government, an economy government, a government of sanity, a heaven-sent government to protect tbe people. It allowed three directors to draw £9,500 a year, the chairman receiving £3,500, and the others each £3,000 per annum. This is tbe business act of a Govermnent which brought all its business acumen to bear on the management of the Line! trols Cockatoo Island Dockyard. salary of one of the directors is debited to the Cockatoo Island Dockyard; but there worth of directors, we have a Sydney manager being paid £800 a year, a Melbourne manager receiving £1,100 a year.

Honourable their tongues in their cheeks when tbey speak of the losses on the Line. A f t e r the interim report of the committee bad been drafted and duly signed by the Government's supporters-it was a unanimous report, because it was on the lines desired by the Labour party-som e twelve months went by. Apparently it was then thought by the Government that the time had arrived for tbe Line to be abolished. And so tbe Government nominees on the committee had to turn a somersault. They did it very gracefully, and, in some cases, apologetically. majority report, not the Labour, report, statesWhilst fully recognizing and appreciating thu invaluable service rendered to Australia by the Commonwealth Line of Steamers during the war years, and the immediate post-war period, and the influence which it has throughtect the people of Australia. In October, out exorcised in reducing and restraining freight rates, the committee considers that the benefits now accruing to the country by its existence as a governmental concern, are more than outweighed by the heavy losses already sustained, and which, it must be reluctantly admitted, are likely to continue. The interim report was furnished upon the evidence given by 29 witnesses."" One gentleman gave the evidence on wbich this last report was founded. to believe that one man, by his eloquence and the weight of his arguments, has caused this complete somersault on the part of the majority of the committee. ness did not recommend the sale of the Line. position Whereas the majority report is general in nature, even in its apologies, the min ority report gives definite statements showing how tbe Line bas protected shippers to and from this country. It bas been, and w ill continue to be, a factor in keeping down freights and fares. In August, 1926, it was instrumental in securing a 10 per cent reduction in freights on commodities exported from Australia. Tbat reduction benefited our primary producers. Although the PrimeI t was not Minister sneered when the Leader of the Opposition spoke of protecting the interests of primary producers, there is members opposite have ample evidence of the practical assistance rendered to Australian primary producers by Labour Governments both Commonwealth and State. For instance, the rura l bank iu New South Wales is the creation of a Labour Government. The Commonwealth Bank, which has done so much for Australia, was established by a Labour Government with the ambition that it should develop a rura l credits branch, and the Labour party since its establishment has endeavoured to widen its scope still further in order to help our primary producers. So soon as The the Australian Commonwealth Line of steamers has been disposed of our primary producers w ill be at the mercy of the shipping combine so f a r as freights on exported produce are concerned. It is idle for the Prime Minister to say that after tbe Line has been sold he w ill pro1926, tbe shipping ring proposed to increase freights by 15 per cent. The Commonwealth Shipping Board was asked to f a l l into line. Apparently at that time the directors were not quarrelling, for tbey refused to agree to the increase. Had tbe vessels then been controlled by a p r i vate company such as that to which it is proposed to sell tbe Line after its value I refuse has been further written down, the position would have been entirely different. Private enterprise is concerned with securing big profits and the Government is doing all it can to help in that direction. Tbe Prime Minister has reluctantly admitted that the superior accommodation of the vessels belonging to the Australian Commonwealth Line of T h a t makes the steamers-refrigeratin g space, modern apall the more interesting. pliances and greater comfort and convenience for passengers-force d private shipping companies to provide similar accommodation on their vessels, to tbe advantage, not only of shippers, but also",53,Premier And State Enterprise
86,Mr Theodore,"In any case, that wit",54,Premier And State Enterprise
87,Mr Blakelet,"of passengers. That fact will doubtless weigh with the people when they are called upon to decide whether the Government wrongly in disposing of the vessels. While it is true that since 1923 the losses on tbe Line bave amounted to £1,900,000; it should be remembered that during that period goods to the value of £319,000,000 bave been carried to and from Australia. eent. of that cargo has been carried by tbe Australian Commonwealth Line of steamers, that proportion has been sufficient to keep down freights on the remaining 93 per cent, with the result that our primary producers have benefited. deavoured to ridicule tbe idea that the Australian Steamers could have any effect in controlling tbe Conference Line. He also contended that the Line was of little value I should like to know, before the conso far as the export of our two staple products were concerned. The reason that vessels belong to the Line do not carry wheat or wool to any great extent can easily be explained: vested interests have obtained such a hold of tbe shipping busitative in this Parliament of a small porness connected with wool and wheat that they will do almost anything to prevent Government competition with tbem. Companies like Dalgety and Company Limited, Gibbs, Bright and Company, and John Darling and Son, are not likely to permit any of the wool or wheat which they handle to be shipped by vessels belonging to tbe Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers. bers opposite make much losses incurred by the Line, but Australia is not the only country which bas lost money in connection with shipping enterprises. Almost every country which has engaged in tbe shipping business has lost money Canada has lost £1,800,000 on ber State-owned steamers, yet there has been not attempt by the Government of Canada to dispose of its ships. It knows that were it to do so the primary producers, and the people of Canada generally, would be left at the mercy of the rapacious shipping combine. Tbat combine is gradually extending its operations; tbe Inchcape group is already operating on the coast of Australia. It would be interesting to know whether the Mr lilnkeley. prize now being dangled before the shipping companies by tbe Government will be given to a "" pup"" of that combine. acted rightly or Who are the persons, syndicates, or companies which during the last six months have been in negotiation with the Government with respect to the purchase of its seven vessels? If negotiations have been entered into witb private enterprise for the purchase of the vessels belonging Although only 7 per to the Commonwealth, honourable members should be acquainted with their details. Every honourable member is entitled to know as much about these negotiations as is tbe Prime Minister himself. What is there to hide.

Do Commonwealth Line of tbe files contain more than aT""number of offers for the purchase of^ certain vessels for a specified price? clusion of the debate, if the Prime Minister will give honourable members ou this side of the chamber an opportunity to peruse the correspondence from tbese potential lucky investors. As a represention of Australia, I think I am entitled to the information. If Prance is not losing a great deal of money in the shipping business, she is at least spending large sums in subsidizing a big line of steamers. Germany subsidizes the NordDeutscher Line, and is spending a considerable amount each year in its support. Italy also supports a line of Honourable memsteamers, and Holland is interested in of the the Royal Mail Steam Packet Company. Japan subsidizes a couple of large shipping companies, and South Africa has its chartered vessels. Great Britain subsidizes shipping and shipbuilding, and during the war spent, and since has spent, an enormous sum in that direction. As mentioned by the honourable member for Cook( Mr C. Eiley), the fact that Australia had the Australian Commonwealth Line at its disposal during the strike of British seamen, prevented perishable commodities costing hundreds of thousands of pounds from rotting on the wharfs. If shipping is again held up in this way, and this Line is sold to a company which can register the ships in any part of the Empire, their operations w ill be subject' to the industrial troubles occurring in Great Britain's shipping industry in which black labour is employed. In tbese circumstances, such vessels are more likely to be held up than are those of the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers, which, generally speaking, are freer from industrial troubles than those of other shipping lines. majority report goes on to sayHaving regard to all tlie circumstancesI n this instance "" all the circumstances "" include tbe removal of at least one member from tbe committee who was favorable to the retention of the Line, and the appointment of two more with general instructions that the Line had to go. issued. untrue. tion. wbich examined 29 witnesses stated Empire.
