Rosters will be reorganised to ensure that services to Members will not be adversely affected; and  tightening of committee report printing and catering. I am conscious that a number of these measures will have an impact on Members and I am sorry that it has become necessary to implement them. I would be happy to receive the views of Members on these matters or any other suggestions for ways in which the Department can make savings. Unfortunately, the Department's budget projections are such that it may well be necessary to look at further savings in future years. I cannot guarantee that those savings will not also affect services for Members, the Chambers, committees or other areas. Finally, I should say that the Department understands that for many years, and for reasons that can be understood, Governments of both sides have applied the same basic approach to the funding of the parliamentary departments that they have applied to government departments. Yours sincerely Clerk of the House Treasury: Economic Modelling (Question No. 463) Mr Hockey asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 16 August 2011: How many times in the last three years has the Treasury undertaken economic modelling, and on which issues has this modelling been undertaken. Mr Swan: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Divisions across the department undertake a wide variety of economic and quantitative analysis, dealing with a wide range of issues that could be categorised as economic modelling. More formal and extensive modelling is undertaken principally by the Macroeconomic Modelling Division, Domestic Economy Division and Tax Analysis Division. Treasury's Macroeconomic Modelling Division has undertaken extensive economic modelling on the impact of a carbon price. Economic modelling was released in October 2008 and reported in the Government's Australia's low pollution future: the economics of climate change report. Additional modelling was released in July 2011 and reported in the Government's Strong growth, low pollution: modelling a carbon price report. The Macroeconomic Modelling Division also maintains and develops a range of models which are used to help inform policy debate such as tax reform and assist in projecting aspects of the economy. Treasury's Tax Analysis Division performs the key functions of revenue forecasting, developing cost estimates and distributional analysis, and undertaking other quantitative studies. Economic modelling plays a part in all these functions and, accordingly, amounts to a large part of the day to day activities of the division, rather than being some discrete exercise undertaken from time to time. The issues on which the modelling is undertaken cover the range of matters handled by the division. Treasury's Domestic Economy Division maintains a range of models which are used to help forecast different aspects of the economy. These models are typically used heavily during forecasting rounds, particularly ahead of the Budget and MYEFO but, because they are being continuously updated and refined, are often run more frequently. These sectoral models complement other sources of information, such as information from business liaison, when producing the macroeconomic orecasts. In addition, as part of the Review into the governance, efficiency, structure and operation of Australia's superannuation system, Treasury conducted modelling to estimate the possible long-run and short-run, direct and indirect impact of the review's recommendations on superannuation fees. Health and Hopsitals Fund: Dawson Electorate (Question No. 642) Mr Christensen asked the then Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 11 October 2011: In respect of the recent Health and Hospitals Fund, Round 3, did her department receive any applications from the Dawson electorate; if so, (a) can she indicate what projects they were for, and (b) were any such applications rejected; if so, on what grounds. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: I can advise that on 10 May 2011 the Australian Government announced that as part of the 2011-12 Federal Budget, funding of $3 million was being provided to Mercy Health for the expansion of the operating theatre at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in Mackay. This project will increase the hospital’s surgical capacity and service provision to the wider Mackay region. Superclinics (Question No. 644) Dr Southcott asked the then Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 11 October 2011: In respect of the GP Super Clinics Program, which (a) clinics, and (b) organisations, have been required to amend their operational plan at the request of the Commonwealth. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) and (b) The information requested relates to the business affairs of an organisation and its provision, as a response to the question, would be likely to damage the commercial interests of individuals or the organisation. Superclinics (Question No. 645) Dr Southcott asked the then Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 11 October 2011: Which of the 64 GP Super Clinics have notified the Commonwealth in writing of a variation to works under their funding agreements which would or might reasonably be expected to have an effect on the: (a) price of the works, (b) timeframes for completion of the works, (c) date for practical completion of the works, (d) fitness of the works for the designated use, (e) project plan, (f) project budget, and (g) approvals obtained in relation to the works. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) to (g) The information requested relates to the business affairs of an organisation and its provision, as a response to the question, would be likely to damage the commercial interests of individuals or the organisation. Superclinics (Question No. 646) Dr Southcott asked the then Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 11 October 2011: Which of the 64 GP Super Clinics have received consent in writing from the Commonwealth for a variation to works under their funding agreements. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The information requested relates to the business affairs of an organisation and its provision, as a response to the question, would be likely to damage the commercial interests of individuals or the organisation. Superclinics (Question No. 647) Dr Southcott asked the then Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Nicole Roxon MP, in writing, on 11 October 2011: How many (a) tier 1, and (b) tier 2, GP Aged Care Access Incentive payments have been made to a GP Super Clinic under the Practice Incentives Program. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) and (b) Payments under the Practice Incentives Program General Practitioner Aged Care Access Incentive (PIP GP ACAI) are made to GPs, rather than to a practice participating in the PIP. As the Department holds PIP GP ACAI payment data according to GP provider numbers rather than PIP practice identification numbers, it is not possible to report on how many PIP GP ACAI payments have been made to a GP Super Clinic. Superclinics (Question No. 648) Dr Southcott asked the then Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 11 October 2011: In respect of the Indigenous Health Incentive under the Practice Incentive Payment, how many (a) GP Super Clinics have received the registration payment, (b) registration payments have been made at a GP Super Clinic, and (c) outcomes payment (i) tier 1, and (ii) tier 2, have been made to a GP Super Clinic. Ms Plibersek: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: As at 26 June 2012, 26 GP Super Clinics were operational. Of these: (a) 17 have received the Practice Incentives Program (PIP) Indigenous Health Incentive Sign-on Payment1; (b) 12 have received PIP Indigenous Health Incentive Patient Registration Payments2; (c) (i) 9 have received PIP Indigenous Health Incentive Tier1 Outcomes Payments; and (ii) 13 have received PIP Indigenous Health Incentive Tier2 Outcomes Payments. When registering for the PIP, GP Super Clinics are not required to identify as such and do not necessarily use their GP Super Clinic name for the purposes of the PIP. The Department has therefore where possible, matched the address of a GP Super Clinic to that of a practice participating in the PIP for the purposes of this analysis. Innovation, Industry, Science and Research: Credit Card Breaches (Question No. 777) Mr Briggs asked the Minister representing the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and Research, in writing, on 24 November 2011: In (a) 2007-08, (b) 2008-09, and (c) 2009-10, (i) how many corporate credit cards were issued to departmental staff, and(ii) what was the total cost of all transactions made on these corporate credit cards.

Detail relating to functions which were transferred from the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relation to the Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education have been included in this response. Household Assistance Scheme: Roll-out of Set-Top-Boxes (Question No. 831) Mr Oakeshott asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 8 February 2012: Can the Minister indicate whether any tenders were received for the roll-out of set-top boxes throughout Australia as part of the Household Assistance Scheme; if so, were any received; if so, can the Minister indicate by whom, and whether any of the prices tendered were less than the one selected?

Australian Securities and Investments Commission (Question No. 892) Mr Tony Smith asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 29 February 2012: Was Mr Greg Medcraft's availability for his appointment (on 13 May 2011) as Chairman of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission verified before he was recommended to Cabinet, if so, (a) on what date; (b) by whom; and (c) on what date did Mr Medcraft indicate he was available for this appointment.

Mr Medcraft indicated that he would be available to Mr D'Aloisio as did others through the course of the appointment processes. Finance and Deregulation: Credit Card Breaches (Question No. 918) Mr Briggs asked the Minister representing the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, in writing, on 20 March 2012: In respect of departmental credit card use in (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, and (c) 2010-11, (i) how many times has the use of a credit card breached departmental guidelines, (ii) what was the dollar value of each breach, and what sum was repaid in each instance, and (iii) were any employees disciplined for such breaches.

Employees concerned were advised of their responsibilities as credit card holders and reminded of their obligations under the Chief Executive Instructions and Operational Guidelines.

Mr Clare: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) The below table provides details of Full Time Equivalent staff (FTE) by program for the period 2007-08 to 2011-12. Results for 2011-12 financial year are based on actual FTE to the end of February 2012 and forecast FTE for the remaining months of the 2011-12 year. 2006-07 information was not available.

Mr Clare: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) Program 1.3 – Border Protection and Enforcement, largely covers our Enforcement and Investigations and Intelligence and Targeting Divisions. It does not include cargo inspection activities, including inspection and examination of air, sea and mail cargo which is undertaken by the Cargo Division and reported under Program 1.2 – Trade Facilitation. The tables below outline the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service's estimated resourcing and Full Time Equivalents (FTE) staffing numbers for each of the requested activities undertaken under Program 1.3 – Border Protection and Enforcement. We have utilised data from the agency's Budget and Resource Management Framework which aligns generally, although not exactly, with the requested categories. Prior to 2009-10 Customs and Border Protection reported on an outputs basis, rather than Programs, as per the Portfolio Budget Statements (PBS). It is not possible to provide accurate details of FTE staff or funding on a detail basis for these years as there was no framework in place at the time to capture this data at the level required. In 2009-10 a new costing methodology was introduced which allows analysis at this level to be undertaken. As a result of the limitations noted above, we are unable to accurately provide reliable results for the years prior to 2009-10. Similarly, we have been unable to provide accurate cost figures, at the level required, for the forecast years 2012-13 through 2014-15 as Customs and Border Protection is still undertaking its internal budgeting and business planning processes.

Mr Clare: The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: All cargo reporters, including air couriers are required under Customs legislation to electronically report particulars of all goods they have arranged to be carried on an aircraft and are to be unloaded in Australia. Air couriers submit electronic reports (Air Cargo Report) to Customs and Border Protection through the Integrated Cargo System (ICS) not later than two hours prior to the arrival of the aircraft at the first airport in Australia. Information in this report is used by Customs and Border Protection to conduct initial risk analysis and assessments. Australia Post (Question No. 942) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in writing, on 22 March 2012: Under what circumstances is Australia Post required to report, in advance, to the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs), any shipment of any items they are due to carry; and is Australia Post required to report to Customs, what it is shipping. Mr Clare: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Australia Post does not carry or arrange the carriage of inbound international mail. It is arranged by foreign postal services. Australia Post is responsible for arranging the carriage of outbound international mail. All international mail is reported to Customs and Border Protection at the 'receptacle' level (by bag or air unit load device) by the operator of the vessel or aircraft carrying the mail. Australia Post does operate some import and export cargo services that are subject to full cargo reporting requirements, which requires the details of all individual items they are importing into Australia to be reported to Customs and Border Protection. This activity represents a small proportion of overall activity undertaken by Australia Post. In 2003, Australia Post and seven other national postal operators established the Kahala group to explore new integrated business models. The group now has 10 members comprising: Australia Post, China Post, Correos, Hong Kong Post, Japan Post, Korea Post, La Poste, Royal Mail, Singapore Post and the US Postal Service. In recent years, the group has focussed on new logistics frameworks that can be applied to the processing of parcels and Express Mail Service (EMS) items. The group is currently working on electronic reporting for EMS and parcels between group members. It is anticipated that implementation will commence in 2013. Australia Post (Question No. 943) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in writing, on 22 March 2012: (1) Were (a) standard, or (b) express, mail items used to allegedly import up to 220 Glock Pistols into the Sylvania Waters Post Office, and were any private air couriers believed to have been used by the alleged syndicate to smuggle these weapons and/or their components. (2) What type of mail items were allegedly used to import 140 Glock magazines into the Sylvania Waters Post Office, in particular, were they (a) standard, or (b) express, mail items, and were any private couriers for such shipments used by the alleged smuggling syndicate. Mr Clare: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) (a) No. (b) No. The consignments arrived via air cargo, not through the International Mail Gateway facilities. They were sent via air couriers, either express or premium express, and via air freight as general cargo. (2) (a) No. (b) No. The consignments arrived via air cargo, not through the International Mail Gateway facilities. They were sent via air couriers, either express or premium express, and via air freight as general cargo. Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport: Cargo Screening (Question No. 944) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in writing, on 22 March 2012: In (a) 2006-07, (b) 2007-08, (c) 2008-09, (d) 2009-10, (e) 2010-11, and (f) 2011-12, for how many (i) days, and (ii) hours per day, were colour x-ray scanners used at Sydney’s Kingsford Smith Airport for the screening of air cargo consignments, and how does this compare with the rates of this practice for each financial year of the Howard Government. Mr Clare: The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Since 2004, colour x-ray scanners have been available 365 days per year, 24 hours a day (at the premises of the four international Cargo Terminal Operators and one express carrier), located at Sydney’s Kingsford Smith Airport1 for the screening of air cargo. Prior to this, black and white x-ray capability was available. _______________ 1 Within the designated s.15 airport (the area appointed by the CEO as the area designated as an international airport and published in the Gazette) as identified in the Customs Act 1901. Australia Post (Question No. 945) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in writing, on 22 March 2012: (1) In (a) 2005-06, (b) 2006-07, (c) 2007-08, (d) 2008-09, (e) 2009-10, (f) 2010-11, and (g) 2011-12, how many international mail items have arrived by air as (i) Australia Post standard mail, (ii) Australia Post express mail, and (iii) private couriers. (2) For each mail item category in part (1), how many items were inspected, and of these, in how many cases were prohibited items detected. (3) What is the five year projection for the number of incoming international mail items arriving by air as (a) Australia Post standard mail, (b) Australia Post express mail, and (c) private couriers. Mr Clare: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (1) Volumes (i) and (ii) The following information was provided by Australia Post through the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy: Year Standard Mail Items Express Post Items (millions) (millions) 2005-06 139.6 1.52 2006-07 148.3 1.76 2007-08 160.5 2.32 2008-09 142.8 2.35 2009-10 183.2 2.93 2010-11 168.9 3.47 2011-12 182.7 (estimated) 4.34 (estimated) Standard Mail Items includes both letters and parcels. In recent years there has been a continuing and sustained increase in parcels. From a border risk perspective, parcels currently pose a much higher risk than letters. On this basis, Customs and Border Protection increased the number of parcels subject to inspection in 2011-12 and reduced the letters inspected. (iii) Articles classified as International Mail can only be transported between members of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). Australia Post is the only Australian member of the UPU and no other entity (including private couriers) may process international mail in Australia. (2) Inspections The term inspection includes any combination of x-ray, detector dogs, trace detection or physical inspection. For postal articles, Customs and Border Protection records inspection activity in two categories:  Letters; and  Parcels/Express Mail Service (EMS)/Registered articles. The number of articles inspected for each category of international mail is as follows: Table Two– Inspection Volumes International Mail-2005/06 to February 2012 Inspection Volumes 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 July 11(millions) Feb 12 International Mail Letters 118.00 117.73 131.33 40.52 41.51 40.38 14.17 Parcels/EMS/Registered 20.18 24.15 25.79 18.31 20.70 21.09 14.33 The number of detections (including quarantine referrals) found in international mail and air cargo are as follows: Table Three– Detections in International Mail-2005/06 to February 2012 Detections 2005-06 2006-07 2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 July 11Feb 12 International Mail Letters Not 23,085 26,204 682 849 1,316 1,970 Parcels/EMS/Registered available 22,018 31,070 40,183 35,281 The key to the increase in the number of successful detections is the implementation of an intelligenceled approach by Customs and Border Protection. In 2010-11 using this intelligence-led approach, Customs and Border Protection made 41,499 detections of prohibited items in international mail compared to just 23,085 detections in 2006-07. This represents an 80 % increase in detections in international mail from 2006-07 to 2010-11. (3) Forecasts (a) and (b) The following information was provided by Australia Post through the Department of Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy: Year Standard Mail Items Express Post Items projected projected estimates estimates (millions) (millions) 2011-12 182.7 4.34 2012-13 198.1 5.25 2013-14 211.3 6.3 2014-15 223.4 7.6 2015-16 233.8 8.8 (c) Articles classified as International Mail can only be transported between members of the Universal Postal Union (UPU). Australia Post is the only Australian member of the UPU and no other entity (including private couriers) may process international mail in Australia. Australia Post (Question No. 946) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in writing, on 22 March 2012: In (a) 2005-06, (b) 2006-07, (c) 2007-08, (d) 2008-09, (e) 2009-10, (f) 2010-11, and (g) 2011-12, on how many occasions have weapons or weapons components been intercepted and seized in air and sea cargo, or mail parcels arriving by sea or air at the point of Australian Customs and Border Protection Service screening. Mr Clare: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Customs and Border Protection record and report on weapons and firearms separately as these are differentiated in separate sections of legislation. 'Weapons' include (but are not limited to) items of warfare, bladed weapons, laser pointers, electric shock devices and crossbows. 'Firearms' include (but are not limited to) rifles, handguns and firearms and are controlled under different legislation to weapons. Number of weapons detained and seized in air cargo, sea cargo and international mail. Customs and Border Protection detains (intercepts) prohibited items at the border. On presentation of an appropriate import permit, detained items are able to be released. If the importation is not permitted or a permit is not presented, the item is seized. Table One-Number of weapons detained and seized in air cargo, sea cargo and international mail – 2005/06 to March 2012 Years Number detained and seized 2005-06 # 2006-07 14,674 2007-08 13,712 2008-09 13,958 2009-10 23,395 2010-11 32,851 1 Jul 201128 March 2012 38,002 # Data not available Number of detained (intercepted) undeclared firearms+ in air cargo, sea cargo and international mail. Undeclared firearms are where firearms are imported into Australia and are detected and identified by Customs and Border Protection as prohibited or restricted goods, and where they have not been declared to Customs in accordance with the import requirements. Some of these detained (intercepted) firearms may subsequently be released on presentation of a valid import permit. Table Two-Number of detained (intercepted) undeclared firearm detections+ in air cargo, sea cargo and international mail – 2005/06 to February 2012 Years Firearms, parts and accessories 2005-06 # 2006-07 # 2007-08 353 2008-09 972 2009-10 1,849 2010-11 899 1 Jul 2011-28 Feb 2012 914 + This data does not include commercial importations of firearms. # Data not available Customs and Border Protection advise that 85 per cent of gun and gun part seizures come from intelligence provided by law enforcement agencies before the parcel or container even arrives in Australia. Since the implementation of a risk-based, intelligence-led approach to intervention across the end to end cargo process in 2009, Customs and Border Protection's detections at the border have increased significantly. The figures above demonstrate the importance of an intelligence-led approach to detecting prohibited items at the borders. Australia Post: Clyde International Mail Centre Screening (Question No. 947) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in writing, on 22 March 2012: (1) In (a) 2005-06, (b) 2006-07, (c) 2007-08, (d) 2008-09, (e) 2009-10, (f) 2010-11, and (g) 2011-12, what number of staff were employed at the Clyde International Mail Centre by (i) Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs), (ii) the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS), and (iii) Australia Post.

This scanning technology is complemented by intelligence-led intervention, trace detection and physical examination. Australia Post (Question No. 948) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in writing, on 22 March 2012: What is Australia Post's involvement in the screening of post articles for the purpose of satisfying Australia's security and quarantine requirements, and which agency determines whether a particular post article is 'low risk' or below the 'low value' threshold. Mr Clare: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Australia Post's role within the international gateway is to handle international mail, including sorting and presenting the mail according to requests by border agency officers from the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs and Border Protection) or the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF). Australia Post is also required to open specific articles for examination by border agencies when requested under their direction and supervision. Customs and Border Protection and DAFF officers determine the risk rating of items in accordance with their risk-assessment practices. Customs and Border Protection is responsible for assessing items for revenue purposes, including those that meet the low value threshold. Productivity Commission Report (Question No. 949) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Home Affairs in writing, on 22 March 2012: In respect of Government's adoption of Recommendation 7.2 of the Productivity Commission Report Economic Structure and Performance of the Australian Retail Industry (9 December 2011), (a) when will the taskforce commence its investigation into low value parcels, (b) is the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service or the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service represented on this taskforce, and (c) when is this taskforce expected to report. Mr Clare: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) The investigation commenced after the Assistant Treasurer, the Hon Bill Shorten endorsed the Terms of Reference for the Low Value Parcel Processing Taskforce (the Taskforce) on 16 January 2012.

However the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service hosts and chairs the Secretariat which supports the Taskforce. (c) The final report from the taskforce is due to Government by no later than July 2012. Australia Post: Sydney Airport Mail Screening (Question No. 950) Mr Morrison asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 22 March 2012: Is it Australia Post policy to transfer all mail items upon arrival in Sydney Airport to the Clyde International Mail Centre for screening by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Services or the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, before those mail items are distributed to the postal network; if so, are there any exceptions to this practice, if so under what circumstances are exceptions made. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: Yes, it is policy for all airmail items received from Sydney Airport to be screened at Clyde Gateway Facility. There are no exceptions to this policy. Australia Post: Agents Licencing (Question No. 951) Mr Morrison asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 22 March 2012: (1) What process does Australia Post use for licensing Post Office Agents and monitoring compliance of these agents within the terms of their licenses, and are there any exceptions to these processes, if so what are they. (2) Why might a license be withdrawn, and what number of licenses were withdrawn in the calendar years (a) 2009, and (b) 2010, in what locations were these agencies, and for what reason were their licenses withdrawn.

Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) By way of background, the Licensed Post Office (LPO) Agreement is an indefinite term agreement subject to either party having the right to terminate the license/licensor relationship. Australia Post appoints the Licensee:  To act as an independent distributor for Products As an agent of Australia Post for the purposes of providing services Licensees agree to, among other obligations, comply with:  The Australia Postal Corporation Act 1989, a number of Post Office Rules and the LPO Manual All applicable federal, State and municipal laws, statutes, regulations and by-laws, in the conduct and operation of the LPO Australia Post and Licensees are also subject to the requirements of the Franchising Code of Conduct. Initial Licensee Assessment Prior to entering into a licensing arrangement with any party, Australia Post will assess the suitability of the prospective licensee against criteria that requires the applicant to be of good moral character, have sufficient business acumen and experience, and financial resources to operate the LPO through a formal assessment process. This assessment process involves:  National Character Check Psychometric Testing Credit Reference Check Business/Employment Reference Check Company Check (if applicable)  Successful completion of a comprehensive 6-week training program. Ongoing Licensee Suitability In accordance with recently amended Anti-Money Laundering and Counter Terrorism Financing legislation, existing licensees and key personnel will have a current Police Character Check as at 31 October 2012 (these are being done progressively from May to October 2012) and undergo mandatory 3-year checks thereafter. In addition, the ongoing suitability of the individual or licensee entity to be ""licensed"" to provide products and services on behalf of Australia Post will continue to be monitored through compliance with the following: Policies and Procedures The operation of the LPO is governed by:  LPO Agreement – contractual basis of relationship  LPO Manual– detailed standards around outlet operation and licensee obligations  LPO Operational and Accounting Procedures – day to day operational procedures  Post Office Rules– the broad range of written instructions issued to licensees Licensee Employees It is a requirement that the licensee conduct an appropriate Police Character Check on employees that the licensee engages at the LPO. Australia Post conducts Police Character Checks for any nominated manager at a LPO and approves all such appointments. Training Accreditation Licensees are required to ensure that staff in their outlet undertake a range of mandatory training at prescribed intervals. Depending on the specific training package, this may be undertaken on an annual basis, or every two years. A centralised database is maintained of training certification for LPOs. Current mandatory training requirements (subject to change as determined by Australia Post) are:  Anti Money Laundering – Counter Terrorism Financing  Aviation Transport Security Australian Consumer Law Dangerous Goods Privacy Site Visitation LPOs are subject to periodic site visitations associated with:  Operational review  Financial and Operational Compliance Unit Security Compliance audit Financial and Transactional Integrity A range of monitoring and reporting tools are utilised to oversee the financial/transactional integrity of LPOs. This includes ongoing exception based transactional analysis and the monitoring of outlet cash levels. Site financial and operational compliance audits are also undertaken as a result of the exception based transactional analysis/cash level monitoring.

Once released to Australia Post, mail is subject to normal delivery standards. (2) These standards have been in place since 2003. Australia Post: Clyde International Mail Centre (Question No. 953) Mr Morrison asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 22 March 2012: (1) What is the average duration (in days) for undertaking the screening process of mail items at the Clyde International Mail Centre from their arrival at the centre to their departure. (2) How does this figure compare with that for the calendar years (a) 2007, (b) 2008, (c) 2009, (d) 2010, and (e) 2011. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (1) Mail is screened at the Sydney Gateway Facility and released to Australia Post on the same day if the aircraft lands prior to 11am and on the following day if the aircraft lands after 11am. Once released to Australia Post, mail is subject to normal delivery standards. (2) These standards have been in place since 2003. Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Question No. 954) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in writing, on 22 March 2012: Is the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity currently investigating any matters in respect of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service; if so, what is the nature of the investigations, and when did they commence. Mr Clare: The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Commencing 1 January 2011, the law enforcement-related aspects of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service were added by Regulation to the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity (ACLEI). By subsequent amendment to the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006, commencing 6 December 2012, Customs and Border Protection was added to Protection were being investigated by the Integrity Commissioner. Four of these investigations were commenced on 10 January 2011. The others were commenced on 16 March 2011, 1 September 2011 and 21 October 2011, respectively. Each investigation concerns either information or an allegation that a staff member or members may have engaged in conduct that involves an abuse of office and/or conduct that, having regard to the duties and powers of a staff member, may involve corruption of any other kind. Since these investigations are current, it would not be appropriate to comment further. On 30 March 2012 I announced that the Federal Government will introduce legislation to conduct targeted integrity tests on Commonwealth officers suspected of corruption. This includes officers from the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Integrity tests are covert operations designed to test whether a public official will respond to a simulated situation in a manner that is illegal or would contravene an agency’s standard of integrity. Examples of integrity testing include:  A covert operative handing a wallet containing cash to officers and observing that correct handling protocols are observed;  Leaving valuable goods at a simulated crime scene or suspected shipping container to test whether an officer steals the item;  A covert operative offering a Commonwealth officer a bribe; and  Putting false information in a database to catch a person suspected of unlawfully disclosing information. Under the legislation the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity and agencies including the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the Australian Crime Commission will have the power to conduct targeted integrity testing. The Integrity Commissioner or the head of the agency will be responsible for authorising integrity tests. The Integrity Commissioner will have overall oversight of the integrity testing system and will be made aware of all integrity tests being undertaken by agencies. Oversight will be provided by the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. Employee representatives are also being consulted on the development of the system to ensure appropriate safeguards are in place. This legislation will build on the powers that the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity already has which include:  coercive powers to gather information through hearings and notices;  telecommunications interception and data access;  electronic surveillance;  controlled operations and assumed identities;  search warrants, and  scrutiny of financial transaction records. On 28 April 2012, I announced further reform to make law enforcement more corruption resistant: 1. Doubling of the number of enforcement agencies oversighted by Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. New agencies to be oversighted by ACLEI are:  The Department of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries – Biosecurity Staff (formerly the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service);  the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC); and  CrimTrac. 2. Doubling of resources available to ACLEI to oversee the Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs). 3. A series of new measures the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission are undertaking and the extension to Customs of the same integrity powers as the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Crime Commission. These include:  The power to authorise drug and alcohol testing;  The power for the CEO to make a declaration terminating the employment of an officer for serious misconduct; and  The introduction of mandatory reporting requirements, whereby Customs officers are required to report any misconduct or corruption activity. Australian Customs and Border Protection Service: Staffing (Question No. 956) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in writing, on 22 March 2012: Is it current policy of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service (Customs) to regularly rotate staff working in front line international (a) mail, (b) air freight, and (c) sea freight/cargo, screening areas; if so, (i) how often are staff rotated, and (ii) what is the longest time period that a single Customs employee has been continually employed on mail/freight/cargo screening duties. Mr Clare: The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: Customs and Border Protection has an organisational mobility policy, the Mobility Practice Statement that facilitates the movement of personnel between work areas. Mobility processes are conducted at a regional level to meet Customs and Border Protection’s operational requirements. Since re-institution of the policy in August 2011, mobility processes have been conducted in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia. The policy specifies that mobility processes will be undertaken in each region at the discretion of the respective Regional Senior Management Group (RSMG) and will be driven by identified business requirements and employee considerations. Customs and Border Protection does not record data in a way that would readily allow answers to be provided on the length of service of individuals in particular work areas. To attempt to provide this level of detail would involve an unreasonable diversion of resources. Australia Post: Kingford Smith Airport Staffing (Question No. 958) Mr Morrison asked the Minister representing the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, in writing, on 22 March 2012: Is it the current policy of Australia Post to rotate staff involved in the transfer of international mail from Kingsford Smith Airport to the Clyde International Mail Centre; if so, (i) how often are staff rotated, and (ii) what is the longest period that a single Australia Post employee has been continually employed on mail/freight/cargo screening duties. Mr Albanese: The Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question: (i) Yes, there are 330 Postal Transport Officer (PTO) positions at Sydney Transport Facility who work to a 24-hour rotating roster. It takes approximately 2.5 years to go through the roster once and the PTO's duties may include the transfer of mail from the airport to the mail centre. (ii) 53 years. National Secondary School Computer Fund (Question No. 964) Dr Jensen asked the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, in writing, on 8 May 2012: In respect of the National Secondary School Computer Fund, to date, (a) how many laptops have been installed, (b) what proportion (as a percentage) of these are still in service, (c) how does the Government monitor the failure rate of this equipment, (d) who provides funding for the repair and maintenance of this equipment, (e) what criteria are being used to define the success (or otherwise) of this program, and (f) when will the outcome of this program be reported on. Mr Garrett: The answers to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) As at 29 May 2012, a total of over 957,000 computers had been installed under the National Secondary School Computer Fund (the Computer Fund). (b) and (c) The purchasing ,management and maintenance of ICT equipment under the Computer Fund is taking place at a state, sector or school level. Consistent with the Digital Education Revolution (DER) National Partnership and Funding Agreements, government and non government education authorities provide bi-annual reports to the Australian Government on the number of computers each school receives on a six monthly basis. The July 2012 Progress Reports are currently being received and assessed. In addition to formal Progress Reports, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations (DEEWR) also monitors implementation of the Computer Fund through its engagement with education authorities on an as needs basis. In the event of reports that there were, for example, instances of non-compliance with the DER National Partnership or Funding Agreements or systemic problems associated with the deployment of devices, DEEWR would seek an explanation from the education authority involved. DEEWR is aware of individual instances of equipment failure but not of any systemic problems. Government and non-government education authorities are responsible for achieving and maintaining the one to one computer to student ratio (1:1 ratio) for all Australian schools with students in Years9 -12. Where computers are taken out of service, for example for maintenance purposes, it is the responsibility of the relevant education authorities to ensure that students are not unduly disadvantaged and that they continue to have access at a 1:1 ratio. (d) The Australian Government recognises that there are additional costs associated with the implementation of the Computer Fund. In that context, the Government has provided additional funding of $807 million to support the installation and maintenance of computers purchased under the Computer Fund. (e) and f) In line with the DER Evaluation Strategy, a mid-program review is currently underway, with consultations occurring during May-July 2012. The Department expects to receive the final report by September 2012. Once the report has been finalised and its contents examined the Department will undertake to release relevant findings within three months of its completion. Australian Federal Police: Solomon Islands Aid Program (Question No. 967) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in writing, on 8 May 2012: In respect of the Australian Federal Police (AFP) ingredient of the Solomon Islands aid program, does the AFP internally advertise expressions of interest, if so, (a) how, and (b) what measures have been undertaken to ensure (i) enhanced consultation with the Solomon Islands Ministry and Police personnel, and (ii) that a proportion of AFP personnel sent to the Solomon Islands has recent front line policing experience. Mr Clare: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: Does the AFP internally advertise expressions of interest: Yes, for selected roles requiring specialised skill sets. For general policing roles members of the Mission Component (i.e. the permanent deployable pool of experienced staff) are selected and deployed based on field of expertise. (a) How: The AFP advertises Expressions of Interest (EOI) for mission roles openly through internal communication channels such as all staff emails or via the AFP's intranet. A selection process is undertaken in accordance with internal governance documentation (Australian Federal Police Commissioners Order on Selection for Vacant Roles (CO7)). (b) What measures have been undertaken to ensure: (i) Enhanced consultation with the Solomon Islands Ministry and Police personnel: AFP personnel in the Solomon Islands are deployed through the multi-national Participating Police Force (PPF), the policing component of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI). The PPF Commander (an AFP member) also performs the role of Deputy Commissioner Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF). There is a great deal of engagement between the PPF and the RSIPF both at the executive level and at the rank and file level with PPF members working along side RSIPF members in an 'advisor' role, often as a one on one counterpart arrangement. The PPF remains engaged with the Solomon Islands Government Ministry for Police, National Security and Correctional Services, in partnership with the RSIPF Commissioner. The transition plan for the PPF was developed in consultation with the RSIPF including identification of key roles and areas of responsibility where an advisory capacity was seen as appropriate. The PPF structure, which is the catalyst for any internal opportunities, has been developed to complement the new RSIPF revised structure. (ii) That a proportion of AFP personnel sent to the Solomon Islands has recent front line policing experience: Selection processes for mission roles, either through an EOI process or through selection from the Mission Component, ensure that contemporary front line policing experience is delivered in mission roles. Mission Component members rotate between mission deployment and Australia based deployments. Whilst in Australia they perform a variety of front line roles to ensure contemporary experience is maintained. drawdown the PPF has been transitioning from front line policing to capacity development. This transition requires a broad range of both policing and non-policing skill sets, in a variety of traditional and non traditional policing functions. The PPF ensures that the correct balance of skill sets from the AFP and all other contributing nations continues to meet the ongoing requirements of the RSIPF.

Asylum Seekers (Question No. 1075) Mr Morrison asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 19 June 2012: Can the he confirm that his department is establishing a new facility at the quarantine station on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands to cope with the latest influx of irregular maritime arrivals; if so, (a) what is the purpose of this facility, (b) how many people can this facility accommodate, (c) how many arrivals is his department anticipating, (d) what will be the total cost of these new operations on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, including capital and operating costs, (e) what is the estimated charter cost of supporting these new operations, (f) how many staff have been transferred to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and (g) how long will this facility be in place. Mr Bowen: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: The Government is not building or operating an immigration detention centre on the Cocos Islands. As is appropriate, the department is making contingency arrangements to accommodate any irregular maritime arrivals who might arrive at the Cocos Islands for short periods until they can be transferred to Christmas Island. The department, in consultation with the Department of Regional Australia, Local Government, Arts and Sport, is considering options for holding irregular maritime arrivals for short periods on the Cocos Islands using existing infrastructure pending transfer to Christmas Island. Work has commenced on minor refurbishment works to the Quarantine Station on West Island. It is estimated that these works will cost $50 000. The Quarantine Station can hold approximately 80 persons on a short term basis pending transfer to Christmas Island. There will also be capacity to house agency and service provider personnel to support the response to any arrivals at the Cocos Islands. The department aims to transfer irregular maritime arrivals at the Cocos Islands to Christmas Island as soon as possible. Normally, this is within 72 hours. Due to the isolated nature of the Cocos Islands, the department relies on air services to respond quickly to irregular maritime arrivals at the Cocos Islands. Charter costs vary according to the size of the aircraft used and its routing. The department follows Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines to source aircraft for charter services and uses panel arrangements established by the Department of Defence. The department has a small contingent of officers on the Cocos Islands. These staff currently include a small number of detention service provider personnel and an interpreter, although staffing arrangements are under ongoing review.

Mr Bowen: The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: My Department has limited capacity to report on the composition of the family groups of 457 visa holders. However, my Department can report on the number of dependant family members that have been sponsored with the primary visa holder. On1 June 2012, there were a total of 90 221 subclass 457 visa holders in Australia. Of these, 53 896 had no dependants. Of the 36 325 with dependants, 17 933 had one dependant, 8063 had two dependants, 7633 had three dependants, 2169 had four dependants and 527 had five or more dependants.

Mr Gray: The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows: (1) (a), (b) and (2) The department does not routinely collate information on separations and I am advised that the effort required to collate the necessary information would be a substantial and unreasonable diversion of departmental resources at the present time.
