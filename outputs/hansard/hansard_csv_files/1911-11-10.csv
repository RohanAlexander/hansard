Strong feeling was expressed, and it was seen that the general desire was that the College, should be at Jervis Bay, in the Capital Territory. Labour members have shown by their speeches on the Estimates that they wish the Territory to .contain the Federal factories, schools, and central defence institutions. It was pointed out to them that the factories must be near the centre of the distribution of the raw material, but on the point that the Naval College should be at Jervis Bay, .whether the Sydney contribution came to hand or not, the feeling was overwhelming. I ask if the facts are as stated, and if the Cabinet has come to a decision respecting the site of the Naval College? If the College is to be in Federal Territory, will all clothing and other factories under Commonwealth control also be put in the Territory ? for what appears in the daily newspapers. aware that the Minister is not responsible for what appears in the newspapers, but he has. not replied to my question. I asked if the newspaper statements were true, and if the same rule is to be applied to all Comton. monwealthinstitutions. It is not right that honourable members should be treated discourteously. The Minister should either chair at 10.30 reply to the question, or say that he is unwilling to do so. ing questions founded on newspaper statements, although it has existed in this Parliament almost from the beginning, is steadily growing, and-1 desire to point but that it is not in keeping with the practice of other Legislatures,or desirable here.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE asked the Minister of Trade and Customs, ufon noticeWhether, at this late date of the session, with the amount of business to be transacted, he cannot say without delay if the most important and vital question of rectifying anomalies in the Tariff, which is likely to occupy tbe attention of Parliament for some considerable time, is to be dealt with during tikis session; or is the rumour true that until the referendum is again submitted to the electors this matter will not be entered upon? information to that already furnished to the honourable member in reply to his question of yesterday. It is not true that the rectification of anomalies must await the result of a referendumsubmitted to the electors. ON POSTAL SERVICES Debate resumed from 9th November STERThat, in the best interest of the public and of the Commonwealth postal service, the report of the Royal Commission on Postal Services should (in a general sense) be adopted by this House. General) [10.43] I am delighted to have this opportunity to congratulate the honorable member for Gwydir on the comprehensive exposition of postal administration to. which he treated the House last night. His speech meant the expenditure of considerable energy and intelligence, and he put before us a fund of information which would not have been available had he not so studiously devoted himself to the task which he accepted on becoming a member of the Royal Commission, appointed at his instance, to investigate the affairs of the Department. The information contained in his speech will, I believe, enable me to administer the Department more capably than I could have done without it. He asks the House to adopt the recommendations of the Commission "" in a genera] sense,"" to which I take no serious objection, if a liberal interpretation is to be placed on those words. I desire to make .it perfectly clear that the Government cannot, at the present time, at all events, approve of some of .the recommendations. The speech of the honourable member for Gwydir might fairly be'classed under the three heads of general management, finance, and control of the staff. From the first, in the history of all the States, so far as I know, and certainly in the history of the Commonwealth, Parliament has adopted a strong attitude in the maintenance of its right to have direct control of this great public utility. Parliament assumes the responsibility of refusing to follow the example set in the control of the State railways by Commissioners, and has decided tb keep the power in its own hands, so far as policy is concerned, delegating the control",13,Commonwealth Factories

22,Mr Frazer (Kalgoorlie,"Postmasterpf the staff to a Public Service Commissioner. The Post Office, in my opinion, is one of the greatest means for the advancement of settlement, providing, as it does, or should, reasonable facilities for communication to all sections of the community in every part of the Commonwealth. It is recognised by the Government that even if the Department is not a paying proposition, we ought not to seriously worry, so long as these facilities are given to outside residents in order to make their isolated life more attractive; and, with that end in view, the Government are prepared to accept the responsibility of meeting a deficit. A portion of the recommendations of the Commission is based on the idea that the Post Office ought to be self-supporting. While I am not prepared to deliberately say that the users of the Post Office should not pay reasonably for the facilities they enjoy, it would, in my humble judgment, be a retrogressive step to make it a condition precedent that the facilities afforded must, each one and all, pay. thing 1 is suggested that every individual service must, of necessity, pay, but rather that the telegraphic, the telephonic, and the postal branches should each in themselves pay; and I say that that is a policy for which the Government cannot assume responsibility at the present time. I have tried to understand from tlie Commission's report what is proposed in this Board of Management. I listened very closely to the honourable member for Gwydir last night in order to see whether it was the intention of the Commission that the Board of Management was to be placed in a similar position to that of the State Railways Commissioners. Mr J. H . CATTS -It would be foolish to enter into details like that. Mr J. H . CATTS I mean the detailed powers of the Commissioners. the whole alphabet 1 sion set out the duties to be delegated to the general manager, the postal director, and the telephone and telegraph director. The first is suggested as the chairman of the Board, to be immediately responsible for finance and general administration; the second is to be responsible for the management and general supervision of the mail services; and the third for construction and maintenance. There we have a certain amount of detail; but I desire to know what the Commissioners had in their minds as to the extent of the delegated poweis. information I can only make the statement. I am now making of the Government policy. The Government are not prepared to accept the condition of things such as prevails in the case of the State railways, in regard to which the Railways Commissioners, in regard to control, practically become independent of Parliament. case of the Board of Management. Postal Commission had in their minds? Mr J. H . CATTS -It is impossible to say that the Railways Commissioners are independent of Parliament in the long run. Parliament which has the right to bestow power on the -Commissioners has also the right to take away that power. In this particular instance, however, I desire to know whether that was the idea the Postal Commission had; and I am justified in asking the question in view of the recommendation that the Post and Telegraph Department should be self-supporting. If a general instruction be given to a Board of Management or a Board of Commissioners that the service shall be made to pay, it must, in my opinion, seriously retard the extension of postal facilities throughout the tremendous area under our. control. mendation 136 is to the effect that while the Commissioners are of opinion that the postal rate shall be made uniform at i d . per half-ounce, it is not suggested that this shall be adopted until the telegraph and telephone services are placed on a self-supporting basis. What does that mean, except that the service is expected to pay? With a recommendation of that nature, and in the absence of details as to the suggested powers of the Board of Management, the Government are not prepared to accept the responsibility of taking the direct power from Parliament and handing it over to Commissioners ;",14,Report Of Royal Commission

56,' Mr Frazer,"I believe it would.' vernment do the same in the case of a Board of Commissioners? If the Commissioners asked for £20,000,000, would the Government offer £5,000,000? probably be compelled to do so if we are to have parliamentary control over the expenditure. I believe that this proposition is now met half-way by the provision of ,£600,000, which is included in this year's Estimates, and will also be provided for in the Estimates for the succeeding year if the necessities of the service still demand it. There is only one other aspect of this question with which I am going to deal, and it relates to the matter of the staff. The experience of the people of Australia, in my humble judgment, is that a control of the service that is independent and entirely free from political influence is the most effective which we know at present. I do not say that it is perfect; I believe that there are a number of difficulties with regard to the control of the Public Service of Australia by a Commissioner at the present time, but such a system is infinitely better than would be a return to the bad condition of affairs that existed many years ago, when parliamentary influence prevailed. Mr J. H . CATTS -No one dissents from that view. for Gwydir appeared last night to entertain very strong objections, certainly in regard to the present Public Service Commissioner. I have had but a limited experience in this connection, but it has satisfied me that the two officers most frequently mentioned last night by the honourable memberMr the State rates for an equal number of McLachlan, the Public Service CommisCommissioner, are particularly able men. last night by the honourable member for Gwydir with regard to the position of the staff, and I think it only fair that I should In 1901 there was one sorter receiving present the case for the Government, as showing what has actually been done. I 'have selected, haphazard, the cases of the telegraphists and the sorters, which were given special prominence by the honourable -member, and I ' intend to show what was their position at the inception of Federation as compared with their position to-day: is following the lines laid down by the Commissioner. lines laid down by any one; I propose simply to .make a statement of fact, and I have before me official returns to enable me to do so. I propose, in the first place, to deal with the remuneration of the sorters. In New South Wales the Commonwealth minimum is £ 1 4 4 per annum, as against £ 6 5 per annum when the Department was taken over. It is noteworthy that in that State 126 sorters were in receipt of a lower wage than the minimum paid to these officers under the Commonwealth control. The average salary there in 1901 was £132, whilst in 1911 it is £162 per annum. misleading ? worked out with absolute accuracy. quoting from a printed document? to honourable members.

In Queensland, the average, salary of the sorters in 1901 was £ 1 4 3 , whereas in 1911 it is £162 per annum, and the increased cost as compared with officers is £1,786. the minimum and the maximum rates instead of the average rates? is the next State to which I am' about to refer, and I will give * fhe honourable member the information for which he asks. .£50, four receiving £ 7 0 , two receiving £ 8 0 , four receiving £ 9 0 , six at ,£100, six at, ,£105, one at .£110, one at .£115, six at .£120, two at £ 1 3 0 , four at £ 1 4 0 / one at £ 1 4 5 , and twenty-one at .£150.

In South Australia, under the State regime, there were about thirty officers receiving less than .£120, whereas in 1911 not one is in receipt of less than £ 1 4 4 per annum. I come now to the position of the sorters in Tasmania. In 1901 there was one receiving £ 7 0 per annum, one at £ 9 0 , two at £ 1 0 0 , one at £115, one at £120, two at £ 1 2 5 , three opener ! at .£126, and two at £135To-day there is one at £144, and not one of these telegraphists is very arduous. officers is receiving less than £ 1 4 4 P^ annum in Tasmania. the minimum iu New South Wales at the facts showing exactly how we stand in reinception of Federation, and the present lation to these matters. A shift goes on minimum ? in 1901, there were three of these officers has been in the habit of remaining on duty, receiving £ 6 5 , fifteen receiving £ 7 8 , one until a given time. They do not always at £ 8 6 , seven at £ 9 0 , five at £ 9 1 , one leave the office at the same hour. By way at £ 9 4 , one at £ 9 8 , eleven at £ 1 0 0 , of illustration I have selected the times twenty-four at £ 1 1 0 , two at £ 1 1 5 . at , £ n 9 ) twelve at ,£120, one at .£125* days in August and September, September, eighteen at £ 1 3 0 , and twenty-four _ at according to the records, being one of the £140 per annum. not one of these officers in New tion is based on actual facts, and if there South Wales is receiving under .£144 is any variation at all, it is in the interests per annum.

126,Sir John Quick (Bendigo) [11.27].,"Some of the hundred odd recommendations embodied in the report relate to pure matters of business detail and administration, whilst others go to the very root of postal policy and reform. Some of them may be carried out by tlie mandate of the Minister; others will require to be dealt with by legislation. Probably, the majority of the House would be willing to acquiesce in the bulk of them. 100 out of 175. orable member for Gwydir told us that 108 had been already adopted. I am disposed to assume and maintain a sympathetic attitude towards the bulk of those which have not yet been adopted, but there are certain other proposals of an organic or basic character, with which the House is entitled to have the opportunity of dealing separately, dissociated altogether from matters of detail and business administration in which we all concur. I contend that it is impossible for the House to adopt this motion in the wholesale formi in which it has been submitted. I wish first to take the opportunity of expressing my personal sympathy with the honourable member for Gwydir in the narration of his trials and tribulations as a member of the Royal Commission. I had 'the misfortune to experience similar trials and tribulations as a member of another Commission, but I think I can say that 1 endured them in silence. claim that the Postal Commission was the most colossal and important ever appointed. I have no objection to him blowing his trumpet as loudly as he can, but on behalf of the Tariff Commission I would point out that the Postal Commission held only 228 sittings, and the Tariff Commission 404; that although the Postal Commission examined only 190 witnesses, the Tariff Commission examined 618; that although the Postal Commission asked only 49,000 questions, the Tariff Commission asked 100,000; and while the Postal Commission submitted one moderately-sized report, the Tariff Commission submitted fifty-three substantial and bulky reports. In my opinion, the Postal Commission made a mistake in not submitting progress reports, as the Tariff Commission did, to enable the Government of the day to institute reforms, and to take legislative action if necessary. The Postal Commission delayed its recommendations. During nearly three years no report was issued. I invited the Chairman of the Commission to submit progress reports for the information and guidance of the Department, so that we might consider recommendations,and, if necessary, give effect to them at once. Had the members of the Commission been desirous to expedite the redress of grievances, and the introduction of reforms, they would have submitted progress reports dealing with urgent matters. I promised the chairman that if that were done the Government would give the recommendations favorable consideration. to the honourable gentleman that it could not be done. different view. To some extent the Department was hampered by the investigations of the Commission, it being felt that large changes could not be inaugurated while the Commission was taking evidence.

Heought not to complain that many of the Commission's recommendations were anticipated. plained. member seems to think that his work has not received sufficient recognition. That, of course, is a personal matter. A Royal Commission should not be too exacting in demands of that nature.

It was only by diplomacy and statesmanship that conflict was avoided at first between the statutory rights of the Secretary and the political rights of the Minister. When the Postal Commission was appointed, however, there were many complaints, one group relating to the grievances of the officers of the Department in respect to wages and hours and eonditions of labour, and the other relating to the dissatisfaction of the public, which was demanding improved facilities, in accordance with scientific advancement, and the increase of business. Parliament in asking for the appointment of a Commission was to secure an investigation which would enable the grievances of officials to be redressed, and the service to be put on a proper footing. as T can gather, the Royal Commission principally devoted itself to official complaints, rather than to questions of great public policy, calculated to improve the administrative working of the Department. into the telegraphic and telephonic administration ?

We are only human, and every member of Parliament, I believe, would be inclined to make concessions, and to grant increases of pay or improved conditions of labour to public officers if he could justly do so.

It must not be cast-iron; it must not go too far ahead rtor lag too far behind. An officer shows that he is a good man when, either as a member of a Board of Management or as Public Service Commissioner, he is able to read the signs of the times, and is alive to the necessities of the hour. What might be a reasonable rate of pay in 1901 would not necessarily be a fair rate in 1908. We must trust tlie man. If we cannot, the system itself cannot be trusted. Every system of government depends upon human judgment' and human discretion, and as long as we have a good man at the head of affairs we ought to make allowance for any errors of judgment which that good man may commit in the exercise of his statutory powers. I strongly object to the practice of ""nagging "" at the Public Service Commissioner which seems to have grown up. The Public Service Commissioner is placed in his office to do his duty, and we ought not to lose sight of the fact that the taxpayers of this country are just as much interested in the Postmaster-General's Department as are the members of the Public Service. It is our duty to insist upon a sound progressive policy in the administration of that Department. It ought to be both up-to-date and progressive. knowledge which I acquired whilst 1 had the honour to occupy the position of Postmaster-General, as well as from knowledge gained by me as a member of this House, I have to say that about the time of the appointment of the Commission, the postal, Honourable members are, no telegraphic, and telephonic services were not in that up-to-date and progressive position which they ought to have occupied. I believe that in point of strength and in point of a works policy the whole of these three services were far behind the demands and requirements of the tunes. Generally speaking, when I went into office and endeavoured, as any Minister might reasonably have done, to investigate the causes of the so-called postal muddle-as it was then tion of the officers, that the trouble was caused, to a very large extent, first of all by shortage in staff, and, secondly, by shortage of funds. orable member do to remedy it ?

I therefore adopted a scheme to carry out these various works by instalments extending over three years. Of the recommendations to which I have referred, provision was made in the Estimates for 1909-10 as follows :-Telegraph and telephone extension and improvements, £564,042; maintenance and repairs, £134,373; additions to engineering staff, £57>'is°Other staff additions were also to be made, totalling altogether 1,500 new appointments. I mention these facts and figures to show that in 1909, whilst the Commission was actually sitting-befor e it had sent in its recommendations, and, as a matter of fact, at a time when the Commission had refused to assist me by submitting progress reports-I , as the Postmaster-General of the day, with the concurrence and hearty assistance of the Secretary and the administrative officers of the Department, introduced this scheme providing for an increased staff and increased progressive expenditure. An instalment of that expenditure was actually provided for in the Estimates of 1909-10, which were submitted to the House by the then Treasurer, the right honourable member for Swan, who explained that we were entering upon a series of three years' instalments of expenditure for the improvement of the Department. was required to bring the Department to a condition of efficiency? the officers of the Department that an expenditure of £2,386,000 was necessary to place these various services in .a state of efficiency. works. that were required. Is it any wonder that there has been an outcry from the public on account of the inefficiency of the service, the defective old works, and the need for new works? I think it only right on behalf of the Department to make a statement showing that, in 1909, before the report of the Royal Commission had seen the light ofday, a policy of reforma policy to improve the conditions of the Department-wa s inaugurated within the Department itself upon the advice of its responsible officers, and with the conan rence of the Government of the day. evidence taken by the Commission.

Those reports may now be found in the Postmaster-General's office. mission proceeded with its work when those recommendations were made? was appointed in 1908, and the reports were made in 1909. I asked the Commission for assistance and advice, but they were not ready to give it, and I therefore launched upon this scheme on my own account with the concurrence and assistance of the responsible officers of the day. From the inauguration of that policy of carrying out reforms by instalments, a great deal of the public dissatisfaction began to tone down and disappear, and as the result of two or three years of expenditure that has been going on since then, and which the present Postmaster-General is still carrying out, the service, particularly the telephone service, has been greatly improved. We do not see as many complaints in the press now, or hear as many on the floor of this House, as there were before the institution of this scheme. The honourable member for Gwydir last night took the opportunity of claiming all the credit for the Commission, and it is only a matter of fair play and justice that I should mention these facts, which I do not think I ever had the opportunity of mentioning on the floor of this House before, in order to show that the Postal Department commenced, as far back as 1909, the series of reforms which have had such good results, and which are now being completed by my successors. They were carried on by the honourable member for Barrier when he was in office, and are being continued by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. I venture to say that all these works that have found their place in the Estimates prior to or since 1909 have been brought forward on the recommendations of the officers of the Department. They fully realized the necessities of the service, and informed me that in previous years the Department had unfortunately been hampered by want of funds. That was the excuse for this accumulation of ar-' rears of work. I am not here to criticise",25,Foster Hav E You Any The Matter I F We Do Not Average The Hon

179,Sir John Quick,"The Commissionthe attitude of any previous Postmaster General who allowed his Department to -be hampered by want of funds. There may have been special circumstances in our Fedechecking authorities vested in the Trearal history which prevented the Department launching into greater expenditure in the first six or seven years, and which do not exist at the present time. From 1909, I think, the Department in the way of expenditure and improvement has been on the up-grade, and has been getting into smooth and still waters so far as concerns overtaking the requirements of the Public Service in reference to telegraphs and telephones. > There are a large number of recommendations in the Commission's report which cannot be adequately or conveniently dealt with by the House in a motion like the present. The motion is altogether too comprehensive, and might, if carried, commit the House to proposals which upon later consideration may be found inadvisable and inconvenient. of many of the recommendations has been unduly inflated by the representative of the Commission in this Chamber. them relate to small matters of detail, such as account-keeping, balance-sheets, purchase of materials and suspense account, amalgamation of parcel and packet posts, payment of bulk postage by stamps, and so on. I venture to say that those matters of petty detail hardly required the time and expense of a Royal Commission. They are quite capable of being dealt with by anybody invested with the management of a great concern such as the Postal Department. tailed business matters which have been so elaborately dealt with by the Commission were, I venture to say, under the consideration of the Department when the Commission was appointed, and were being gradually adopted, and would have been adopted in the ordinary life and experience of the Department without the necessity of a Royal Commission. I wish to make a few observations on the general question of the management and control of the Department, and to draw attention to certain points in respect of which it is quite possible that we ought to have some improvement, involving the necessity of an amendment of the Statute law. There can be no doubt that at the present time the Postal Department is under a divided control or management. It is not merely under a dual control, but under almost a quadruple control. Firstly, certain powers are vested in the Secretary and the Minister. Secondly, there are certain supervising or sury. Thirdly, there is power vested in the Minister of Home Affairs to deal with public works; and, fourthly, there is the power vested in the Public Service Commissioner of dealing with appointments, promotions, transfers, and increments. I am prepared to express my concurrence in some of the observations of the Postal Commission to the effect that there ought to be a greater unity of organization, or a greater concentration of power of organization and control, in the Postal Department than there is at present. It was the opinion of Sir Robert Scott, the late Secretary of the Department, that the Department ought to have inherently within itself more centralization of control over management and policy than it has The importance had hitherto, and that there should be a judicious revision and amendment of the powers now distributed amongst four Many of separate Departments. The problem is, how can we remodel and improve the management of the Department without trenching upon or unwisely interfering with the powers which are at present exercised by the Treasury Department, the Home Affairs Department, and the Public Service Commissioner respectively? As the result of consideration and inquiry, I arrived at the conclusion that an amendment of the law should be effected on the lines to which I gave expression in a policy A lot of these despeech delivered at Bendigo in February, 1910, on the eve of the general elections, and reported in the morning papers of 18th February of that year. I there said that there ' should be an improved and strengthened central administration in the form of a Board or Commission of Management, at the same time reserving to the Minister the final decision of all questions of finance and policy. Honourable members will observe that by that provision I did not intend to take away from the Minister or from Parliament any of those grave and supreme questions . of policy and finance which are justly viewed with jealousy by Parliament itself. I do not wish to surrender to any Board or Commission of Management any of the great powers which Parliament ought still to exercise, but I am of opinion now, as I was in February, 1910-and that was before the report of the Commission, which did not appear until October, 1910-that the Postal Department is capable of being re-orgahized, improved, and remodelled as regards its central administration on the principles which I had enunciated. also be an improved and strengthened State administration. At present there is a division of authority and power between the Central Administration and the State administration. That, of course, is a Federal principle. Under the Act as it stands at present the Minister can delegate to the various Deputies certain powers and authorities. That seems essential in order that the Deputies may deal with matters of local interest and importance which ought not to be, and do not necessarily require to be, referred to the Central Administration. Those powers and authorities have been so delegated in order to relieve the Central Executive, not of responsibility, but of over'telephone branches, and an officer to deal burdensome work and duties. Local details may fairly be left to the Deputies, under proper advice. In making that suggestion, I also said that the Deputy Postmasters General ought to be relieved of construction works and the maintenance of lines-dutie s which might be intrusted to a competent engineering staff in each State, allowing the Deputies to attend to matters of management. when I was in office, because at that time the Deputies were terribly worried and overworked in attending to construction and maintenance matters. By an improved and strengthened State administration, I would relieve the Deputies of a lot of these details of clerical, maintenance, construction, and supervision work, and leave them to deal with matters of pure management and administration. ber mean to tell me that the Deputies used to interfere with the electrical engineers ? -did. They were always in consultation with them. The powers and authorities were -delegated to the Deputies themselves, and they, alone exercised them. The view of Sir Robert Scott, from whom I got the idea, Was that a competent engineering staff in -each State, and not the Deputies, should attend to the matters I have indicated. Honourable members have asked me to define in what way the administration of the Department may be improved and strengthened under a Board or Commission. I cannot say that I am prepared, any more than is the Chairman of the Postal Commission, with all the details of such a scheme. They may require time and consideration to work out, There should but an improved and strengthened central administration might be effected, without impairing Ministerial power and responsibility, by substituting for the present Secretary a Board or Commission. The advantage of such a body would be to divide among groups of officers a lot of administrative or management work, which at present is absolutely and exclusively vested in the Secretary. The work is big enough, and diversified enough, to justify the division of -the duties of the Secretary among three officers, each specially qualified in particular lines. We might have, for instance, a general manager for postal matters, an officer to control telegraph and with the staff and works. now. now under the Secretary. WhatI suggest is a Board, whose members would cooperate. Instead of the Chief Electrical Engineer being under, and dependent on the Secretary, he would be that officer's equal. ber think that the Secretary vetoes the recommendations of the Chief Electrical Engineer in any technical matter? . above all, and it would be better to have power and responsibility distributed among three specially qualified men. In railway administration responsibility is so divided. ways Commissioners under the Chief Commissioner ? Railways Commissioners, as they constitute Boards, work together. It is not assumed that there will be conflict between any group of Commissioners. I wish to give individuality to each of the three men at the head of the Postmaster-General's Department, making them responsible for the work performed by those under them. In that suggestion 1 have the concurrence of the ex-Secretary to the Department. I am not making a blow at any man or at any office, but suggesting a course which, I think, will increase the efficiency of the service: The question remains-ho w far a Board of Management could go, without",26,Foster Hav E You Any The Matter I F We Do Not Average The Hon

Mr Thomas,"In what way is there inbringing the Minister into conflict with the Public Service Commissioner, and fighting out the matter in Parliament. his way if that were done. sioner acts within his statutory rights. doing the same. Surely on a big question, such as an important appointment, the Minister would bring the matter before Parliament. of sufficient importance, of course; but a Postmaster-General cannot, in the multitudinous affairs of the Department, run to Parliament for an amending Bill to coerce the Public Service Commissioner. I am at present endeavouring to assist in the solution of the problem before us, and not in any way reflecting on the Public Service Commissioner, who has not exceeded his duty if he has refused transfers or promotions. 1 the Commissioner is right. by more centralization the Department can be equipped with greater equality, with the result of greater efficiency, it ought to be centralized. The Department is open to reform in management and control; and, without pledging myself to the detailed sugto take some steps towards the remedy. gestions of the Royal Commission, I invite the House to consider the whole of them in a reasonable and practical manner. would he a mistake, however, for Parliament to adopt these recommendations in globo, for there are many which require separate examination. The honourable member for Gwydir has, I think, achieved his purpose ""in emphasizing the necessity for postal reform and the redress of grievances, and has done his work fairly well and exhaustively. The matter now ought, I think, to be left in the hands of the responwe to go on with the same old system for sible Ministers. may, of course, be dealt with later on seriatim in connection with the Estimates; but it would be absurd, on a motion like this, to adopt them in globo, even in the general way indicated. The honourable member would have served his purpose better if, instead of occupying so much time in the discussion of minute microscopic details, he had directed attention to some broad principles which could have been grappled by the House. That would have been much better than frittering away our attention for so many hours on small matters of detail. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [12.50] The honourable member for Gwydir is entitled to recognition for the whole-heartedness with which he entered on this investigation into the undoubtedly unsatisfactory condition of the Postal Service. It is admitted by the honourable member for Bendigo, who was Postmaster-General during^ a portion of the time the Royal Commission was sitting, that there is room for reform in the Department; but the shortage of the staff and the starvation of the service were brought about by the party to which he belongs, though he now tells us that that is the party which was going to put "" the house in order."" The honourable member tells us that, during his term of office, certain reforms were going to be gradually brought into operation; but it is a noteworthy fact that these ideas were not made known until, for twelve months, the daily press had been flooded with evidence of the chaotic condition of the Department as the result of the Commission's inquiry. The Public Service Commissioner and the officials of the Department followed the evidence day by day, and had reports thereon submitted; ancl, as glaring instances of mismanagement were brought to light, they were compelled Ample justification has been shown for the appointment of the Royal Commission, and It for the attitude taken up by the honourable member for Gwydir. The whole system of management, which involves interference by the Public Service Commissioner in staff matters, has broken down. For eight or nine years the Department was run under the existing arrangement; and, until some outside authority interfered, the management was going from bad to worse. Are The recommendations another nine years until another Royal Commission is necessary to show where reforms are imperative? The difficulties have been proved to be absolutely inherent; and it is impossible to have success with a Public Service Commissioner who, independent of the Department, and without any responsibility for the working of it, can interfere with the recommendations of responsible officers. I do not make any attack on the Public Service Commissioner as an individual, because I believe him to be a very able officer, who",29,Foster Hav E You Any The Matter I F We Do Not Average The Hon

209,Sir John Quick,"That may be. I fhas performed his duties to the best of his ability; but, as I say, the difficulties lift in the system. Recommendations relating to the staff are sometimes "" turned down "" by the Commissioner; and that this should be done with suggestions by responsible officials shows that we have a system absolutely vicious. The Public Service Commissioner cannot be expected to be able to form an opinion on such matters with such precision as the responsible officers in the Department. carries out such recommendations, he shows his office to be useless, and where he deviates from them he is operating on an unbusiness-like principle. We saw an instance of that this morning, when the question was raised as to the number of hours worked by telegraphists. Honourable members, who have been carpenters, plumbers, or have followed other laborious occupations, immediately jump to the conclusion that a six hours' day in the case of the telegraphists must mean a heaven of delight. a telegraphist than six hours underground. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member has never worked for a minute as a telegraphist, and is not competent to express an opinion. This is one of the results of placing men in charge who know nothing whatever about the work. who have followed all occupations. Mr J. H . CATTS -Certainly not. T am replying to the honourable member for Barrier, who seems to think it marvellous that telegraphists should work only six hours. the honourable member for Cook; but, at the same time, I would sooner be employed as a telegraphist than in mining. Mr J. H . CATTS -There are, of course, certain disadvantages attached to mining, but even if that be so under private enterprise, is it any argument to be applied to the case of the Public Service? spoke of carpenters and others, and said they knew nothing of the work of telegraphists. Mr J. H . CATTS -And neither do they. If there is anything in the argument of the honourable member for Barrier, it is that telegraphists should work eight hours. The telephonists work six hours a day, and it is recognised that the strain placed on them and on telegraphists also is almost too much for endurance. telephonists. Mr J. H . CATTS -And so it is in regard to telegraphists, so far as I have been able to gather. telegraphist than as a telephonist. Mr J. H . CATTS -Although the honourable member for Barrier has been mostly When the Commissioner concerned with mining, I would rather have his opinion on the point under discussion than that of some honourable members who, quite new to the House, were scarcely able, until quite recently, to tell the inside from the outside of a post-office. Do such honourable members say that some reforms are not required? every day for the benefit of employees and the public. Mr J. H . CATTS -Not minoi alterations, but radical reforms, are required. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. Mr J. H . CATTS The time at the disposal of the House for the consideration of this very important matter is exceedingly limited. I know that other honourable members are anxious to address themselves to the question, and as it is very desirable that we should have a vote upon it, I shall curtail my remarks as much as possible. Before we adjourned for lunch I referred incidentally to one or two questions affecting the conditions of employees of the Department, but owing to pressure of time. I shall not touch further upon that aspect of the matter. As a representative I am always prepared to listen to the grievances of public servants, and, where I come to the conclusion that an injury or injustice has been done, to do whatever I can to remedy the trouble. At the same time, I recognise that Parliament does not exist only to deal with such matters. I should like to see such a system of organization and control of the Postal Department as would, I believe, minimize the necessity for public servants to be placing their individual and collective grievances before representatives of the people in this House. Parliament is quite incompetent to deal with the details of employment in any service. In order thoroughly to understand the grievances which affect letter-carriers, sorters, telegraphists, and others a very close investigation is required.

He has his ordinary parliamentary duties to attend to, and he would need to give the whole of his time to the work of the Department in order to be able to deal intelligently with the problems that confront him. the whole of his time to that work subordithe trouble to a very minor extent. My nate officers have to deal with it. giving the whole of his time to the work ? Mr J. H . CATTS -He has to be in the House all day. ' Mr J. H .

CATTS --That only shows that the Parliament itself makes calls upon the Postmaster-General, and to the extent that he meets them by being present in the House he cannot be manager of the Department. think that the Postmaster-General should be the parliamentary mouth-piece of a Board of Control? Mr J. H CATTS-No. speaking, the honourable member for Bendigo has represented my views. I think, for instance, that matters of finance could not be taken out of the hands of a Treasurer who is responsible to Parliament for them If the Treasurer cuts down the Postal Estimates to the last farthing, and so prevents the extension of country services, then Parliament must take the responsibility. Mr J. H . CATTS -Yes; and no alteration in that respect would be advantageous. Large matters of policy must always be dealt with by Parliament, but ordinary questions of management-question s relating to the staff, and the ordinary business transactions with the public, and so forth^ought to be entirely separated from great questions of policy. I am with the honourable member for Bendigo, broadly speaking, in his statement of the changes which his experience in the Department has shown to be desirable. Our present system of control of the Department has been ridiculed time after time in this House. It is agreed that things are not satisfactory, but what are we going to do to alter them? It is all very well to take up a non-committal attitude-to say that things are going on all right, that a few more "" i ' s "" are being dotted, a few more "" t ' s "" being crossed, and a few more commas being put in, but that willnot cure the existing deSo far as he is unable to devote fects. At the most, it can only alleviate desire is that there shall be some effective and radical change which will not only overcome existing difficulties, but obviate their recurrence. The investigation made by the Royal Commission has shown more than has anything else the shortcomings of the management of the Department. They have been proved out of the mouth of the Public Service Commissioner, so far as staff matters are concerned. The Public Service Commissioner's evidence has been quoted during this debate, and from what I understand of it he suggests that there should be a business manager in charge of the Department. Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member for Gwydir quoted extracts from his evidence last night. Broadly a business man should be put in charge. Mr J. H . CATTS -Something to that effect was quoted. The honourable member for Gwydir also quoted the evidence of the ex-Public Service Inspector of New that there should be a business manager in charge of the Department, and rebe appointed to that position, manager now*",32,Foster Hav E You Any The Matter I F We Do Not Average The Hon

He has his duties under the Public Service Act, and carries them out, no doubt, to the best of his ability. It is the system of control against which I am making complaint. Without going further into the minute details of the powers of a Board of Commissioners, I am in favour of the control of the Postal Department by such a body, reserving to this Parliament the right to deal with the great matters of policy andfinance,and making the Commission a Board of expert management for the Department in the way outlined by the honourable member for Bendigo. We come then to the question of the staff. I was very pleased to hear the announcement of the Postmaster-General that it was proposed to enable the public servants to submit their cases to the Arbitration Court, if they desired to do so. It must be distinctly understood that they are not to be compelled to go to the Court. Mr J. H . CATTS I tried to induce the Postmaster-General to make a definite statement to that effect in answer to an interjection. What it is proposed to do is really to offer another privilege to the public servants, not to take something from them. tunity which they need not avail themselves of unless they like. Mr J. H . CATTS -Certainly not. If they say they are being fairly dealt with without going to the Arbitration Court, they debate was to point out to these men that He deals will not go. A matter can come before the Court only if a claim is presented by some party interested. The Government are not likely to present to the Court a claim to reduce the rates paid to the Postal servants. He has, amongst other If there is any complaint it will be by the public servants against the Government, and if they cannot get the redress to which they think they are entitled, they will have the right to go to Mr Justice Higgins, saying, "" Wle have placed our evidence before the Government, and as they have not responded to our just demands, you can consider our case, and instruct the Government to do the fair thing by us."" he? It is a bed of have signed a petition against it. Mr J. H . CATTS -They did not understand what they were signing. well for their intelligence. Mr J. H. CATTS -They have been misled. Some two or three years ago these complaints of the public servants were being brought under my notice day after day, and I could get no satisfaction one way or the other. I said to these men, "" Why not organize in such a way that you will be able to present your case to the Federal Arbitration Court?"" I addressed mass meetings of the men, and induced a General Division Organization to agree to this proposal. In a couple of weeks I drafted a constitution for them, in compliance with the schedules of the Arbitration Act. I said, "" If you like to elect me president of the organization until its registration is effected, I am prepared to take the responsibility of carrying the thing through, so that you need not be apprehensive of your position in the matter."" I lodged the application for registration with the Registrar, and the honourable member for Darling Downs, who was then, I think, Attorney General, lodged an objection to the registration. I had some of the best advice that it was possible to get, and the effect of this was that the honourable member for Darling Downs had not ""Buckley's chance"" of succeeding with his objection. But the public servants, I think, became alarmed because tlie Government put their backs up against the registration, and without consulting me, who had taken all the trouble in the matter, they withdrew the application and let the thing go by the board.

Mr J. H . CATTS -They could appeal to the Government as representing this Parliament, or appeal to the Parliament as a whole. It is of no use to quibble about words. If , for instance, the public servants were working more than eight hours a day, ancl appealed to the Arbitration Court for an eight hours clay, and the Arbitration Court did not give it to them, they would have the right to come to this Parliament and ask for an eight hours law. No doubt, Parliament would be guided very largely by the evidence heard in the Court, and the decision of the Court. But to ask me to say that I would be a party to taking away their right of appeal to Parliament scribe to something to which I am not prepared to agree. the honourable As a matter of fact, in New South Wales the Railways Commissioners are a registered The railway men of New South Wales have certain privileges not enjoyed by the outside public; but, although there are some fifty or sixty awards which, in some respect or other, direct the Railways Commissioners as to the industrial conditions of their employees, there is not a single case in which any privilege has beenlaken away from a railway man by an Arbitration Court or a Conciliation Board. In fact, we have been trying to get those privileges incorporated in the awards, so as to deprive the Railways Commissioners of the right to lop them off at their own sweet will. I desire to quote, for the benefit of the public servants, an award which shows that the privileges of the Public Service have been really conserved by these Boards and Courts. The Commonwealth Arbitration Act defines industrial mattersthat is, matters which can be referred to the Court for determination-as including ""all matters relating to work, pay, wages, reward, hours, privileges . . . "" It is therefore provided that the privileges of employment shall be taken into consideration as an industrial matter. But rhe New South Wales Act is a little stronger in that respect, providing, as it does, that the customs prevailing in an industry shall be taken into account. At any rate, the definition of industrial matters in the Federal Act has now been made wide enough to enable the privileges and customs of an industry to be taken into account in determining any claims which may be made under the Act. In New South Wales the ordinary claims are put forward by the railway men as to pay and hours, and then it is claimed also that the existing privileges shall be incorporated in the award. I wish to quote in that regard from a recent award, so that it may be on record for the public servants to see, because I know they will be looking at Hansard for the results of this debate. I refer to the Tramway Permanent Way Award, published in the New South Wales Government Gazette of 1st November, 1911.

That has been a vexed question in the Com-, monwealth Public Service, and the honourable member for.

"" Mr J. H . CATTS -He should get the minimum rate for that grade. Mr J. H . CATTS -It has already been done in the case of tens of thousands of men. the honourable member's argument is that an officer who relieves a man at a lower salary should get only that lower salary.' Mr J. H . CATTS -Not at all. In New South Wales the principle adopted is that an officer relieving another of a higher grade shall be paid the minimum salary of that grade; but where, for the convenience of the service, an officer relieves another of a lower grade, it is not fair to reduce his salary. leave, or through sickness, the relieving officer is entitled to the minimum salary of the grade in which he is serving, although it may be only temporarily. at the rate fixed for the grade to which he belongs.

That is provided in the award dealing with the conditions of the New South Wales railway men. would not like to pay out of his own pocket according to that rule. Mr J. H .

CATTS -It should be paia from the time a man commences to do the work of a higher grade. In. the award to which I have referred this clause appears, Any employ6 ordered to act, or to relieve or. so employed, be paid the minimum rate payable to men in such higher grade, provided such minimum be not less than tbe rate he is already ' ' receiving. The members of the Postal Commission think that their recommendation is the last word on the vexed question of promotion,, but in the award from which I have just quoted an equitable principle has been re rr cognised after years of dispute. Clause9 of that award provides that(a) Seniority shall not depend on length of service alone, but shall be affected by such considerations as qualifications under the regulations, conduct, refusal to accept positions reasonably offered, and the like. (£) Lists of the staff in the prder of seniority shall be kept.

That last clause is absolutely fair, though' paragraph a is not satisfactory. If there is a vacancy where the rate of pay is ios. a day, the man with the longest service holding the position immediately below must be promoted, unless it can be shown that he is incompetent for the higher work.

256,Mr Laird Smith,"Has the honorableprinciple is in operation in the Commonwealth service, but I ask him whether the promotion is automatic in every case in which incompetence cannot be alleged ? has the first call for promotion. A junior would be promoted only if the senior could not do the work. Mr J. H . CATTS -There is nothing to complain of in that, but I think that an officer often says, "" I intend to promote the man I think most suitable for the work,"" and his regard for general suitability enables juniors to be promoted over seniors. I investigated a case of the kind in the Post Office, in which it was not denied that the senior man had done the work of the office to which a junior had been promoted. The head of the Department did not allege incompetence against him, but he said that there were others who were better. senior man was not competent? Mr J. H . CATTS -Then why was that not stated; and why had the senior man been allowed to relieve in the higher position ? Another provision of the award regulating promotion is thatWhere any employ^ is of opinion that he has been improperly passed over, he may apply in writing for an explanation, and an explanation shall be given him in writing. The privileges of the service are safeguarded in the following clause :No employ^ who at the date of this award is in receipt of pay at a. higher rate than herein fixed shall have his pay reduced, merely as a consequence of this award. Where a man by reason of long service was receiving a higher rate of pay, that advantage is preserved to him. The following clauses in the award preserve certain special privilegesThe following privileges, already existing and in consideration of which the rates of pay hereinbefore mentioned have been fixed, shall be continued, namely :-Every employ^ on the permanent staff, and every employee' not on the permanent staff, who has been employed for six months or more, shall be entitled to(a) A railway pass for himself, his wife, and his children up to the number of three and being under 18 years of age, during the period of his annual leave. (b) Four privilege railway passes during the . year, of which two may be used by his wife. . half the ordinary rate from the station Act. If they can get their grievances renearest his home to the station nearest dressed without going to the Court, let ' his work. (d) If he is a junior employ6, whose pay is not more than 5s. 3d. a day, a free railway pass from the station nearest his home to the station nearest his work. (e) If he is employed in the country, a railway pass once a month for himself or his wife or housekeeper to and from the nearest market town, and to the free carriage of two cwt. of goods; this privilege to be subject to the conditions and qualifications set out in the present market pass regulations. The privileges of the service are incorporated in the award, and placed beyond the caprice of the Railways Commissioners. Employes who are charged with offences are to be dealt with in this way(i.) Every employee^ summoned to attend before his superior officer to answer any charge shall be informed in the notification summoning him of the particulars of the charge preferred against him, and shall be entitled at the hearing to give and call evidence on his own behalf, (ii.) Every employee^ giving evidence shall be entitled to read over his statement before signing it. (iii.) Where an employee has been summoned to attend before his superior officer to answer any charge, he shall be paid for the time lost in attending, and any fare he may necessarily have paid shall be refunded to him, unless it is found he is guilty of the charge, or that his conduct has justified the charge being made, in which case such matters shall be in the discretion of the officer dealing with the charge. An employee summoned to give evidence in any such case shall be paid for his time, and be supplied with the necessary passes, (iv.) Every employee who has given notice of appeal shall be entitled to obtain, at his own expense,, a copy of all the evidence of the departmental inquirv, at least a week before the appeal is heard : Provided that, if the appellant consents, the appeal may be heard within less time than a week from the day he has obtained such copy of the evidence. There is not time to read the whole award, but I should like to point out that the special privileges of the service have not been interfered with, and privileges which had been acts of grace on the part of the Commissioners have been incorporated in the awards, and have thus been given the force of statutory enactments, so that they can be upheld in the Courts, while their infringement is punishable with heavy penalties. I therefore adhere to the advice that I gave to the public servants some (r) A daily or periodical railway ticket at years ago, to register under the Arbitration",36,Foster Hav E You Any The Matter I F We Do Not Average The Hon

258,Mr Thomas,"I s it not a fact that thethem do so; but if , having exhausted other means, they are still suffering, they should take their cases before an independent and unbiased Judge, and Jet him determine what is a fair thing. They need not fear that they will lose anything. experience of the railway men is that they have got awards regarding promotion and the like, and have had a legal status given to their privileges. There is also necessity for a properly constituted Board of Appeal to deal with the punishment of employees. At present there is a lop-sided Board, with a very limited jurisdiction, consisting of two departmental representatives and one representative of the staff. There ought to be a Board consisting of a representative of the staff, a representative of the Department, and an independent chairman; and the employees should have the right to be represented officers or by an advocate. ing with the discipline of a large service, scattered over the whole continent, the Deputy Postmasters-General and the Public Service Commissioner have to judge cases on paper; and it very often happens that, if they knew the type of man personally, a caution would be deemed sufficient. As it is, however, a case may look much blacker than it really is, and the punishment may be out of all proportion to the offence. kind in Western Australia a little while ago. Mr J. H . CATTS -There will always be cases of the kind in a huge service where employees are dealt with on reports. It is necessary to have some semi-departmental tribunal constituted as I have suggested, in order to decide, first of all, whether the case is proved, and, secondly, whether the punishment is adequate. If this were done, there would be removed a considerable cause of complaint. Briefly, I desire to see the Department, for ordinary business purposes, placed under a Board of experts, independent of political control as to details. Matters of policy and financial questions will, of course, have to be left to the determination of this House. I desire to see the staff organized into repurposes of the Labour party to solve. presentative unions, and not into a number of little tinpot bodies as at present. For the 12,000 men I suppose there are at least a dozen organizations which compete one against the other, and do more than anything to increase unrest and discontent. There ought to be a thoroughly representative organization, under the control of a governing body, with representation for particular sections on purely sectional matThe ters, but, on all matters affecting the service as a whole, speaking with a united voice. The grievances could then be thoroughly threshed out by representatives, and one section would not be played off against the other. There would be a guarantee of a reasonable case being presented, and, if it were necessary to go to the Arbitration Court, this large body, with its financial and moral backing, would be able to adequately protect the interests of the men. If there were business control of business affairs, provision for employees to appeal to the Arbitration Courti f not satisfied with the terms and conditions of their by their union employment, with some semi-departmental In dealBoard of Appeal with an independent chairman, we should have a very effective reform in the management. Peace and content would be encouraged, and better value and service obtained for the public money expended, than is the case under the present system of divided control. At present the Public Service Commissioner interferes in staff matters without any responsibility for the success of the Department; and the time of the Postmaster-General is taken up with a number of detailed matters to which he has no opportunity to adequately attend. The Minister is thus prejudiced in his efforts to deal with larger questions affecting the people as a whole. Having found out the lamentable inadequacy of the present system, we are entitled to ask for some drastic alterationsome improvement .of the kind I have indicated. We could take from or add to the powers of the Board of experts as experience showed to be necessary; and, developing on these lines, we should shortly evolve a system as near perfection as can be attained in a great business undertaking of the kind. We should then further justify State control of the Post Office, and, by showing its successful operation, we should encourage the people as a whole to embark on other Socialistic undertakings, and gradually eliminate those difficulties of private enterprise which it is one of the many be regretted that we have been obliged to tackle this large and important issue in the course of a few hours taken from other",37,Foster Hav E You Any The Matter I F We Do Not Average The Hon

260,Mr Fowler (Perth) [3.8],"It is tourgent public business. minds of most Of us have been running on the Budget, and the important duty that falls to all of us as critics of the financial proposals of the Government. However, since the honourable' member for Gwydir has introduced the subject, it is the duty of those who have been paying some attention to the work of the Postal Commission to say a few words. . I do not wish to detain the House very long, because I know there are others who desire to speak. The Minister in charge of this important Department has, I think, adopted a distinctly disingenuous attitude in regard to the motion. To accept such a proposal, putting one's own interpretation ""on it, is a perfectly safe thing, and any proposal so submitted might be nominally endorsed with such a reservation. shows that the Government are by no means of a mind with the honourable member for Gwydir with regard to many of his proposals. There is no doubt room for difference of opinion; but, as regards the suggestion to put the public servants within the operation of the Arbitration Court, I fail to follow the argument of the honourable member for Cook when he points out that it will be optional on the part of the public servants to apply to the Court. Nominally, it will be optional, but in reality it will be obligatory. When the public servants come to the Minister with grievances or wishes he will say, "" I am very sorry that I cannot see that we can grant these requests, but if you think you have a fair case you had better go to the Arbitration Court."" Any Minister, unless he were perfectly sure that the claims of the public servants were of a just and moderate character, would naturally take up that position; and if the Arbitration Court decided against the appellants, then the Minister would be immensely strengthened in his previous decision, and he would say to the public servants, "" You see that the Court has decided against you, and you cannot therefore expect me to go beyond that decision."" Therefore, I do not think that, in reality, the fact that appeal to the Court is optional will make it any the less obligatory. I think this proposal is only a method, and, perhaps, from their point of view, a justifiable method of enabling the Government to dodge a very awkward corner. I am very glad to see that the Royal cost of living, say, in Perth, and that on Commission fully realized the danger of the gold-fields or the remoter parts of the over-centralization; and this is a matter to State, and, therefore, a district allowance [9'] Naturally the which I hope the Government will give careful consideration. Undoubtedly outlying States have had the usefulness of the Post Office seriously interfered with by the over-centralization in the earliest years of Federation. The evil has been modified considerably of late years, largely, I believe, on account of the criticism and objection made by honourable members, like myself, from outlying districts. ber know what tends more than anything else to centralization?

Unfortunately, however, the State officers have been denied the right of decision in the past on so many matters of detail that the Central Administration has been deluged with matters that ought rightly to have been dealt with outside of it altogether. Central Office. centralization can yet be extended to a much greater degree than has been adopted. So long as the officers at the head of the Department in the different States are capable, it stands to reason that they must be better able to deal with local conditions than the officers of the Central Administration can possibly be. By way of illustration, I propose to lay before the Government two cases. Western Australia, as we all know, is not in such an advanced state of development as are some of the other portions of the Commonwealth, and living there is undoubtedly higher than elsewhere. Some four years ago, therefore, it was arranged that a special living allowance should be granted to the officers of the Postal Department in that State.

In other words, a man drawing a high salary receives a bigger allowance than does an officer of a lower grade who may be living in the same locality. That is unfair. The officer of the lower grade may have as big a family as the officer above him-h e often has a larger family-and undoubtedly the strict living expenses in any part of Australia, or indeed in any part of the world, are very much the same whether an official is drawing a large or a small salary. There are certain expenses in respect of the necessities of life that have to be met by every one, no matter what one's position in life may be, and I contend that the lowergrade officer, if he is in the same locality as the highly-paid man, is entitled to draw just as much by way of allowance as does the latter. Then, again, even in Perth we find certain disabilities relating to the Department. I have before me a letter from the secretary of the Society of Engineers in Western Australia, who points out what I have known for some time and have endeavoured, unsuccessfully so far, to rectify. He states that there are employed in the several Departments of the Commonwealth, and particularly in the Postal Department there, artisans who are not getting anything like the standard rates of pay in their own particular localities. He cites as an illustration the fact that there are in the Postal Department artisans paid at the rate of £132 per annum, whereas the ruling minimum rate in the district is us. a day, or £171 per annum. received by the permanent men? ceived by the casual employees? rate of wages in Perth for artisans outside the service. certain rights, and are paid for holidays, which the other men do not get. should be any radical distinction between the payment of permanent and casual hands. ber mean to say that the casual hands should get the same as the other men? permanent men in this case should be receiving the standard rate outside the service. The minimum should not, in any case, go below the standard for the district. This state of affairs is due to the trouble that exists with regard to the payment of officers upon a scale as uniform as possible over this vast extent of territory. Another complaint is that the allowance of 5 per cent., established in respect of officers in Western Australia, is not paid to those who are drawing a district allowance. In other words, officers in Western Australia receive 5 per cent, in addition to the ruling rate in the other States, but an exception is made in the case of those men who, under special conditions, are drawing a district allowance. Manifestly, the 5 per cent, allowed, as representing the difference in the cost of living in Western Australia, compared with the cost in the Eastern States, should be paid all over Western Australia, and should be received by every officer whether he is drawing a district or local allowance, or is not doing so. All this trouble arises very largely from the policy of centralization, under which an attempt must always be made to secure the maximum of uniformity, where local conditions are not fairly met, because they are not fairly understood. I hope that I have impressed on the Minister and his party the necessity for a greater degree of decentralization in order that local conditions may be dealt with by the men who understand them, and can deal most effectively with them. sire, in the first place, to congratulate the honourable member for Gwydir upon the information that he has presented to Parliament. He has placed both the House and the country under an obligation to him for the details with which he has furnished us. a day is reWith this introduction, let me say that I intend to occupy the attention of honourable members for only a few minutes because I do not think this House is the proper place to discuss further the details that have been brought before us. The details having been submitted, we are here to judge of them. The honourable member for Gwydir has told us that 134 out of the 175 suggestions made by the Commission have either been adopted or are being favourably considered by the Department.

277,Mr Carr (Macquarie) [3.25],"I defact in itself constitutes a triumph for the Commission. I think that if the honourable member had received from the Government some fitting acknowledgment of his services, it would not have been necessary for him to take up the time of the House as he did. member mean? honourable member for Gwydir had had his services recognised in some way the position would have been different. But as a matter of fact no comment, favorable or unfavorable, has been made on the work done by him. from the point of view of human nature. The right honourable member knows what I mean, for no one is more susceptible than he is to the virtue of duty well done. The Commission is to be complimented on the fact that so many of its suggestions have either been adopted or are being favourably considered. Tbe Minister at this late hour has supplemented that announcement by stating that he virtually accepts the report. It is understood, of course, that he does not accept it in detail. No doubt there will be many qualifications; I sincerely trust, at all events, that there will be some. I hope also that the Minister will not adhere rigidly to the statements to which he has given utterance. I wish to emphasize more particularly the point that the report of the Royal Commission proves indisputably that there has been mismanagement, and consequent unrest of the staff, and that as the result of the condition into which the Department has drifted, there has been much discomfiture on the part of the Department. That, I think, has been proved right up to the hilt. I agree with the honourable member for Bendigo that this House is not in a position to deal with the details of a great Department. Although we recognise that that is so, there is a tendency on the part of honourable members to be rather discursive in dealing with these questions, and if we adopt certain proposals that have been brought before the House, and manage all the means of production, distribution, and exchange, I do not know how we shall ever be able to get anything done. However, we are not here to deal with all these matters of detail, and we must, therefore, depend upon the gentlemen who are nominated to control the public Departments. We must make business concerns of the Departments of the Commonwealth, and [91]2 appoint managers of them just as we should do if we were privately interested in somp large establishment. We must secure the best men available for the positions, and make them responsible for the work intrusted to them. That being so, and as the affairs of the Department are not as they ought to be, we have a right to blame the managers whom we have appointed, provided that it cannot be shown that the fault lies with the system and not with the managers themselves. We have a perfect right to expect of our managers order and satisfaction in the Departments they control; but we find that there has not been, for some years, either order or satisfaction in the Fostal Department. In these circumstances, we must either blame the managers or the system. If the managers have blun : dered, then those responsible for the con: trol of the Department have committed a crime, and we cannot excuse or palliate their conduct by tolerating them further in the capacity which they occupied when they committed that blunder. 1 the system is largely to blame. system is not wrong, and that he is going to perpetuate it. If it is not, then the management is wrong, and the management should either go, or should have its functions diverted to some other channel. There is no alternative from a logical or business point of view. If the Minister says things have been wrong and have been remedied hurriedly as the result of the work of the Commission, there is no excuse. The Minister says the system is not wrong, and, therefore, we are going on as we were before. I say if it is not wrong we should not go on as we were going before. If the old system is to go on, the managers should be changed. I , however, admit that the management has done its best with certain limitations. As the report shows, there were cases in which culpable inj capacity was discovered by the investigation. they cannot be removed? It is the fault of the Public Service Act. the system which is at fault. When we, depute a Commissioner to staff our service, giving him the sole right to select the staff, there must be some way out for that gentleman, either by the dismissal of these men or by varying their employment. If that gentleman does not select",40,Foster Hav E You Any The Matter I F We Do Not Average The Hon

285,Mr Carr,"If that is so, again it is the staff, then I must misunderstand the position -bu t which I hope we shall not have the from the people in the service. that among six deputies in the States only one efficient man can be found ? Surely our Public Service has not degenerated to that forlorn condition. Either the system is wrong, or the managers are wrong, and I do not think the fault lies entirely with the managers. I think largely it is the system which is' to blame, and, therefore we should change that system; yet the Government are not proposing to change the system in its vital parts. We are told that the Commissioner is to go on as heretofore. I strongly advocate making a change, which would have been made at once if any similar private concern of this size had gone wrong. That change ought to be in the nature of appointing responsible general managers as heads of each branch of the Department with sub-managers in each State. dismissal. gers be responsible to Parliament, through the Minister. The question of an Appeal Board should also be considered in this connection. I do not favour the Minister's idea of handing these people over to the Arbitration Court, which will put them to considerable expense in the matter of counsel and so forth. That step ought not to be necessary, because we, as a Parliament, are here to-day to lay down certain lines to guide the Judges in their conduct of civil cases. If we are competent to do that, we are surely competent to instruct our own managers to lay down certain lines for the guidance and control of our own Departments and our own staffs. It is a regrettable confession of weakness on the part of the Administration to say, "" We must hand our own servants over to the civil Courts."" What is to hinder this Parliament from decreeing that there must be paid throughout the Civil Service rates of wages which shall not be below those awarded by Arbitration Courts to people in similar employments outside. That seems to be as far as Parliament can go in laying down a course of action for its own Departments. As others are anxious to speak, I shall content myself with urging the Government to change the system in some way, and not to let us be harassed any further by such interminable details as we have hacl to listen to-rightl y so in the circumstances painful necessity of listening to again. the Minister prepared to allow the debate to be adjourned? until the ordinary hour for adjournment. other honourable members who wish to speak on this important question. The report of the Commission has furnished a great deal of valuable information, and contains recommendations which may help the Minister in any future policy which he may be disposed to initiate. It is unnecessary to enter into a detailed discussion of the report at this stage. We shall have an opportunity of discussing the whole policy of the Department in detail on the Budget and the Estimates-in-Chief. The most important question involved in this discussion is the alteration of the principle of management of the Department. The Commission recommends the placing of the Department under a Board of Management. We have had sufficient experience of Boards of Management throughout Australia to have formed a good idea whether it is advisable to adopt that system in this case. I believe it is necpssary to place certain branches of any great public Department outside of political control altogether. We have already gone half-way in that direction by passing the Public Service Act, which places the staff under the direct control of the Public Service Commissioner. We have no time or opportunity now to discuss whether a single Commissioner is the best tribunal to finally determine all cases of appeal or adjustment with respect to the staff of a great Department like this, but we have, at any rate, placed the permanent staff outside of political control. That is one step in the right direction. We can also with advantage place under the control of a separate branch, if not out of political control altogether, the question of the construction throughout the Commonwealth of public works for the Post and Telegraph Department. When the system of control in the Victorian Railway Department was changed, the chief charges brought against political control were that the Minister had charge of the construction of new lines of railway, and also of the staff employed. Those were the two chief reasons why those two branches of the affairs of the Railway Department were taken from the direct jurisdiction of the",41,Foster Hav E You Any The Matter I F We Do Not Average The Hon

292,Mr Sampson,"There are manyMinister and passed over in one regard to the Railways Standing Committee, and, in the other, to a special Board of Commissioners. I have failed to gather from this debate, or from a careful perusal of the report of the Postal Commission, how it is possible to leave the control of the policy of the Postal Department wholly in the hands of the Minister, and at the same time to appoint a Board that will give us anything like efficient or independent management. I do not know where the two forms of control or management are to be separated. If the policy is to be left in the hands of the Minister, there is no necessity to appoint another Board of highly salaried officers to carry out the purely administrative part of the work. The Postal Commission make, in their report, a suggestion of some value, to the effect that a chief accountant should be apshall take a retrograde step, because the pointed to go into the details of the service. and has been doing work for some months. solutely independent of the whole Department, occupying the status of the Statistician or an officer of that kind. occupies that position. He is, of course, a member of the Department, but he cannot be controlled by anybody. unassailable position. Will he send in an independent report to be laid on the table of the House, in the same way as the Public Service Commissioner does, in order that this House may ascertain how far each of the services of the Department is being carried out on proper lines, and whether they are paying or not paying? now, and in his next annual report he will be able to show that to the House. port independently to Parliament? course, regard it as a report that should be to create a tribunal to which grievances. placed before Parliament. the Minister first, and the Minister might desire it to be amended. titled to have an independent report from the accountant himself. That is an absolutely necessary .reform. A good deal of ariticism has been levelled at the Public Service Commissioner, but I suppose, like ether human beings, he is not infallible. I do not know him, and have not had the pleasure of seeing him, but, from reading his reports and from the general way in which he has controlled the great Public Service of the Commonwealth, I am sure he is a strong and highly capable officer.. If we desire to establish the independent control of our staff, and prevent the return of political patronage to our Departments, it is the duty of this House, having appointed an independent officer of that kind,to support him in the fearless discharge of his duties. The best testimonial that could be given to the ability and impartiality of the Public Service Commissioner is the petition of 4,000 employees of. the Post-master-General's Department, praying Parliament not to bring them under the Arbitration Act. In my opinion, if we place the Department under a Board, we construction of important works in country districts would, as a consequence, be seriously impeded. That has been the effect of placing the railways under independent control. In the country districts of Victoria, the trains are 'slower to-day than they were when there was political management, and during the last wheat harvest it was impossible to send away the grain quickly enough, because of the insufficiency of the rolling-stock. Thus progress has been seriously hampered, and the experience should make us hesitate, before abolishing the Ministerial control of the Postmaster-General's Department No doubt the employees of that Department have in many instances good reason for objecting to their classification, but it was impossible for ' the Commissioner' to so classify them as to satisfy all. A great many of them were transferred from the' State services, where they were working under diverse -conditions, which had to be harmonized and brought within a uniform system. The surprising thing is that there has not been more discontent, and that the Postal Commission has not been able to lay bare more serious anomalies. So far as appeals are concerned, it might be possible could be submitted, even after the Public Service Commissionerhad dealt with therh. that many complaints never reach the Commissioner. the administration. would be independent is asked for. . ..'---",42,Foster Hav E You Any The Matter I F We Do Not Average The Hon

I have felt that some kind of appeal tribunal is needed. The honourable member for Gook has complained that the Public Service Commissioner has not sufficient knowledge of the business of the Postmaster-Generals Department to be able to satisfactorily regulate appointments, promotions, transfers, and the like, but in Victoria the Public Service Commissioner controls the staffs of half-a-dozeri Departments He investigates the evidence collected by responsible officers, and thus makes himself acquainted with the qualifications of the service and the needs of the Department. Coming back to the proposal of the Commission to appoint a Board of Management, which is the central point of the debate, while opposed to the proposed Board, I am of opinion that a subdivision of duties is necessary. The Deputy Postmasters-General might be given wider administrative powers, with a view to avoiding delays in the carrying out of works, and the Central Administration might be represented by a consultative Board of three Heads of Departments.
