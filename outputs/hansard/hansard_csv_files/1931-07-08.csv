I can see that it is merely butting one's head against a stone wall to suggest an amendment of the bill at this stage. ' It is claimed by the Government and the Opposition that this plan is not capable of amendment, as it represents an agreement that has been entered into by the Premiers and Treasurers of the Commonwealth and the States. If that is so, what a farce we have gone through during the last three or four weeks, debating something that is not capable of amendment. It was merely necessary for members of the Nationalist and Country parties to declare that they concurred with the action of the Government, and the bill could have been bludgeoned through. I hope that, when the measure reaches the committee stage, it will be eapable of amendment, in details. I realize that such a hope is almost futile, because, besides having the support of the Government and the Opposition, the plan is supported by the press. Those who oppose it are ridiculed, if, indeed, any publicity at all is given to their utterances. The supporters of the plan are taking advantage of their strength, and decree that "" It must go through. sacrifice in the interests of the nation, to tide it over the ciisis "". I point out that the people who are called upon to make the sacrifice are the very persons who did so during the war period. The old-age pensioners, too, are to be further penalized. Pensioners living in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and other coastal cities and towns are in an infinitely better position than are those who live in Western and Northern Queensland and New South Wales, where the cost of living is 25 per cent, higher than it is on the coast. Where, then, is the equality of sacrifice? Those who have pioneered our mining centres have put in an endeavour to re-open different fields. Those are the people who have been insulted by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition by being termed ""paupers"". able gentleman was quoting from a letter. understood the honourable gentleman, and am pleased to accept the correction. I have no desire to misrepresent anybody. It is declared that those who oppose the plan are traitors to their own country. A very big section of the community own very little of Australia. To them it is a doubtful privilege to live in the country, and if they had the wherewithal to get out of it they would do so to-morrow. They are denied the right to work, which is due to any^citizen. That comes from the Government overtaxing the most industrious section of the community, the producers, the tillers of the soil, who aresharing the present hardships with theworkers gentleman's time has expired. -This bill, which is part of the plan produced by the Melbourne conference, presents to all honourable members, regardless* of the parties to which we belong, difficulties of no ordinary kind. In a sense, it is revolutionary. At one sweep it brushes aside those standards which the people of this country, by incessant political and industrial agitation, have achieved during the last 25 years; It reduces wages, pensions, salaries, and The people must make the allowances of all kinds by one-fifth, and the irony of it is that we who, all our political lives, have "" championed the existing standards, and helped to achieve them, are forced by cruel circumstance to justify this measure and urge its acceptance by the people.

' But the alternative is default, with all that that connotes. Public servants, soldiers and old-age pensioners have to ask themselves, not whether this plan is harsh, but whether the effects of the only alternative, which would be immediate, would not be much worse.

BecauseI believe that budgets must be balanced, and because the alternative is default, I accept this plan, but with the greatest possible reluctance. I regard it merely as a measure to meet a great emergency. I refuse absolutely to regard these reducafter 30 years of this progressive century tions as permanent and so destroying the standards for which I have fought all my life. It is a temporary expedient, a means by which we can bridge the financial chasm, while awaiting the development of that process of rehabilitation which we are told will spring naturally and inevitably from this plan. To make that clear, I propose to move that the bill shall remain in force for three years, years. and no longer.

Mr Bughes. tain quarters with great vehemence that there must be a permanent lowering of our standard of living. I shall fight such a retrograde policy to the last ditch. The honourable member for Kennedy protested against the reduction of war pensions. I have had much to do with pensions. In the name of the oeople of Australia, I made certain pledges to our soldiers when they enlisted to fight overseas, and no man surveying the position fairly can say that those pledges have not been honestly kept, or that the We are like men on a soldiers have not been treated as their deeds merited. Certainly, no have been better treated than have those of Australia. I have kept my word to them in the past, and' I intend to continue to do so. The representatives of the soldiers' organizations have accepted the proposed reduction of war pensions subject to certain adjustments of its incidence, and therefore it is unnecessary for us to attempt to deal further witli them.

15,Mr Keane (Bendigo) [3.58],"W eour people have to look for work'. The Government, hy the arrangements made through the Loan Council, reduced its loan expenditure in one year from £43,000,000 to £14,000,000. proposed, by means of the reductions provided for in the financial rehabilitation plan, to reduce another £14,000,000. . This means that £43,000,000 less will be in circulation than was circulating at the time the Government assumed office. This must necessarily cause deplorable changes in industry. well as the Commonwealth Government, are under obligation to reduce their reduction. Department alone is showing a deficit of £2,000,000. Every possible economy has been practised in the railway services of the State; train services have been curtailed ; overhead costs have been reduced; and every award has been suspended. Any wages can now be paid to, and any conditions fixed, for the 24,000 men at present employed in this undertaking. Yet the accounts show a deficit of £2,000,000. The Premier of Victoria, like the Premiers of other States, has undertaken to balance his budget. So far as I can see, he can only do so by dismissing another 5,000 or 8,000 men. No steps are proposed in this plan to provide money for expenditure on other work to find jobs for the men dismissed. I suggest that we adopt the following slogan in respect to the balancing of budgets:"" To balance budgets, put men into work and not out of work."" An alternative slogan might be"" To balance budgets, restore the spending power of the community."" This cannot be done by dismissing civil servants or reducing their allegedly high rates of pay. Just recently the Public Service organizations voluntarily agreed to a cost of living reduction aggregating £480,000 three months earlier than it need have become operative. This was a great sacrifice. But it is now proposed to oblige them to make another sacrifice of £1,700,000. If this reduction is made, the spending power of the community will be still further reduced; and no additional employment will be provided. In fact, additional dismissals may be expected. I am anxious to serve the people who elected me to this Parliament. In my electorate I have business groups, secondary industry groups, primary producing groups, Civil Service groups, and others. The secondary industries are being well It is now catered for by our high customs duties. The primary industries have not been given as much help as they deserved; but expenditure by this is due to reasons with which honourable members are well acquainted. But civil servants and the aged and infirm have a right to be considered. This party was returned to power with The State Governments, as a special mandate to maintain our industrial arbitration system, including Public Service arbitration. But,' despite the In Victoria, the Eailway fact that the public servants voluntarily agreed to the cost of living reduction being made operative three months earlier than was necessary, they are now being called upon to make other heavy sacrifices without any reference at all to the Public Service Arbitrator. It must be admitted, therefore, that our 1929 election promises were so much hot air. I hold some unorthodox views in regard to arbitration. I believe that this Parliament should fix the minimum wage and the maximum hours of work for the community. I would not leave those matters to any court. But that is by the way. Our election promises were made from thousands of platforms in this country, and I am sorry that they have not been fulfilled. The present proposal involves the reduction of the basic wage in the Public Service, from £198 to £181 per annum, or £3 Is. per week. When I was elected to this Parliament a little -over eighteen months ago, the basic wage was £4 8s. per week. I should like honourable members to compare the proposed new basic wage of £3 Is. per week with their own expenditure. I admit, of course, that a member of Parliament is in a good position. But where would we be if we had suddenly to limit our expenditure to £3 Is. per week? Many public servants will, however, be put in that position. That wage is grossly inadequate to provide for the bare necessaries of life. I may be told that the existing basic wage was based upon statistical information compiled by the Common' wealth Statistician, and that since it was fixed the cost of living has fallen. My reply is that representatives of the industrial Labour movement have always"" contended that the present system of estimating the cost of living is unsound. It may be said that this is a wild generality. I know that the cost of food, groceries, and housing is estimated on a certain basis. House rents are fixed in accordance with the returns obtained from selected agents. course, to determine the price of bread, meat and potatoes. But many other costs which every person incurs are allowed for. Even under present conditions, the cost of medical attention and medicine will remain the same as heretofore.. Legal and school fees will not change. Municipal rates will increase somewhat; while the income taxation imposed by Commonwealth and State Governments will increase heavily. The interest rate on mortgages and small overdrafts is not likely to decrease by any more than 1 per cent. The price of coal, electric light, gas, and other fuel, will not change very much. In my opinion the increased costs consequent upon the imposition of sales tax and primage duty will more than offset all the decreases to which I have referred. The people will also feel the derogatory effects of the high customs duties imposed by the Government. The price of sugar will not f a l l ; and the price of tea has actually risen. These are two important items in the living costs of the ordinary householder. It is, therefore, absurd to say that the cost of living has fallen. The members of the Premiers Conference were excellent fellows. of them are known to me personally. fluenced by certain economists who, in my opinion, have no practical knowledge of every day affairs. IfI want medicine I go to a doctor, and if I want meat I go to a butcher. IfI want practical politics, I go to practical leaders of industry, and not to academic economists. These men have theories which change so frequently, that no one can place any reliance upon them. The economists urged that it was necessary to reduce expenditure by £14,000,000 this year, in order to balance our budgets. The fact that this saving would involvfe the dismissal of many men did not mean anything to these experts. The.plain truth is that a Mr Keane. fight has been going on in Australia for many months for the lowering of the standard of living, and those who started it have won. This is shown by the fact that all our arbitration awards have been brushed aside. I am not deluding myself with the idea that we are dealing with emergency legislation. If -.this bill is passed it will It is not difficult, of remain on the statute-book for many years. No secret is being made of the fact that the provisions of this measure will override the provisions of many acts of parliament now in operation. Eveni f we save £14;000,000 in our expenditure this, year we shall still fail to balance our budget. In the circumstances I believe that this party is not justified in sacrificing the advantages which it has won for the workers during a long period of years, particularly as the sacrifice will not result in the employment of any one of the 400,000 persons who are to-day practically starving in this country. Our standard of living will be lowered without any compensating advantage. ber seems to overlook the fact that his practical politicians, the Premiers and others, have endorsed the proposals of the economists. Surely he will admit that the Premiers and their brother Ministers, who sat in conference, were practical politicians. gentleman allowed themselves to be overruled by the experts. The Hills, the Hogans, and the others who attended the Most conference, know something about practical politics; but they overlooked the But they .were unduly infact that the so-called experts were out of touch with the majority of the people of Australia. The members of the expert committee do not know what it is like to struggle for a living. Their views on life are theoretical and not practical. These men put up a proposition such as, a glass will not hold more water than will go into it ; and from such flapdoodle they proceed to generalize.

17,Mr Keane,"In my opinion thesealthough I was prepared to give those measures a trial, I ""was not prepared to scrap the whole of our arbitration machinery, nor was I willing to sacrifice the interests of our old-age, invalid, and war pensioners, merely to save about £5,000,000 a year. To do this would mean the throwing aside of the beliefs of a lifetime. I have no doubt that the members of the Government are sincere. They have a long industrial history behind them, which began, in some cases, before I was born. to save £5,000,000 by slashing the wages of public servants, and I venture to say that, within a month of the passing of this measure, application will be made to the Federal Arbitration Court for a reduction of 20 per cent, in the wages paid to outside employees. It was contended, when the 10 per cent, cut in the wages of Federal arbitration awards was made, that the national income would be increased and that employment would be provided, but, from the date when that reduction was made, unemployment steadily increased. The reduction of wages will not guarantee the public servants against dismissal. This Sword of Damocles will always be hanging over their heads. We have been unable to secure an assurance that, if the cut now proposed is made, further dismissals will not occur. It seems to me that the most dangerous feature of the proposed reduction of the income of old-age pensioners is, not the slice of 12£ per jsent. off the amount they uow receive, but the proposal to reduce the value of the property they may hold without being required to. submit to a special deduction from their pension. In the committee stage, certain amendments with regard to this matter will ""be submitted. It is absurd to suggest that any human being can exist on less than £1 a week. On this side of the chamber are a number of men who are most economical. I do not pose as one of that number. I spend, legitimately, on odds and ends for myself, over £1 a week. If I had to house, clothe and feed myself on that income, I would not weigh 18 stone 9 lb. It is idle to suggest that, owing to the drop in the cost of living, an old-age pensioner can live on 2s. 6d. a week less than the amount to which he has become accustomed. I admit that the social services granted in the Oommonwealth are not provided in other countries, but the people of Australia have come to look upon the old-age pension as their right, The statement has been made that, while members criticize the Government's proposals, they offer no alternatives. I havo already mentioned one. I asked the Prime Minister recently what amount of overseas interest will have to be paid by Australia during the present financial year, and the reply that I received was It is proposed ""£28,568,45.2"" In reply to a further question, I was informed that the average rate of interest payable was £4 15s. 3d. per cent.. My suggestion was that Australia should retain that interest for a. year. We should thus save about £9,500,000 in exchange, and have the substantial sum of about £38,000,000 with which to relieve industry, help the farmers and provide work for the unemployed. [Quorum formed.] I also asked the Government what steps had been taken to secure the reduction of Australia's interest on the overseas debt, and the answer that I received wasThis is a matter for consideration after the plan of financial rehabilitation now before Parliament has been put into operation, and the financial standing of Australia in the overseas markets has been restored. Has one member of the Government or the Opposition made a solitary reference in this chamber tb the overseas liability? They are prepared to screw our own people down to the last farthing, regardless of their economic wants. They will slash the income of the aged and the ex-soldiers, but why not make a business proposition to our overseas creditors on the lines of the Hoover plan? I also asked the Government what would be the financial gain to Australia if the Hoover plan were adopted, and the reply was as follows:If the Hoover proposals are adopted, Australia will forgo her share of reparations for the present year, amounting to £830,000. At the same time, Australia will secure relief from interest payments during the 'present financial year on its indebtedness to the Government of the United Kingdom amounting to £3,920,000. The net gain to Australia for the year will thus be £3,090,000. The Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) said this afternoon that this proposal had been agreed to. If , for one year, we allowed the overseas bondholders 1^ per cent., or even 3 per cent., and compounded that payment, we could save nearly the whole of the amount of the proposed reductions that I am sure are unpopular with every member of the House. member suggest that we should retain this interest without the consent of the other parties to the contract? heard from the Prime Minister, or any member of, the Government, what they did in London towards achieving this object. I would not act arbitrarily, but I would make a proposition to Great Britain. Such a nroposal may have been submitted; I do not know. When I mentioned the matter recently, the Minister for Defence( Mr Chifley) remarked ""That has all been thought out"". An outstanding fact is that £38,000,000 could be kept in Australia to afford relief to the people which cannot be given under the present plan. British neople is very much worse than ours. am prepared to 'credit the bondholders with the interest that we would be holding back for a year. There may be a large number of small bondholders in Britain, as there are in Australia, and I would be willing to make a reasonable arrangement with them Under this bill, the gold bounty is to be cut down by half. I wish to emphasize the fact that the members of my party knew nothing about this proposal. Certain Ministers knew nothing of it. The Leader( Mr Lyons) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham), and the Premiers Conference, were not consulted about it. Other bounties have been reduced by 20 per cent., but the gold bounty is to be cut down by 50 per cent. In my opinion, the one measure passed by this Government that has put an extra man in a job is the gold bounty. To-day, there are 8,000 extra men at work in Victoria as the result of it, and in Western Australia the number is proportionately higher. Although the bounty will cost certain governments a large sum, it must Be remembered that the payment will not be made until the end of the year. The payment of this bounty is hedged round with more difficulties than are experienced in the allocation of any other. Wheni t was first proposed, Ministers-were not in favour of it ; its only attraction was that it would honourable draw overseas capital to Australia. Eor years,. Australia will feel the injurious effects of this reduction, and, in the committee stage, an effort will be made to I have not see that this bounty is hot reduced to a greater extent than others. Although gold is worth £5 5s. 8d. an ounce without the bounty, it must be recognized that the Government has not paid one penny yet by way of bounty, and will only have to pay at the end of the year on the gold that has been won. found out of this year's revenue. the Government £200,000, as has been suggested, the money will be devoted to keeping men employed and off the dole, while industry will be relieved to that extent of the burden of supporting those out of work. Let us consider what is being paid in other bonuses. Up to May I recognize that, and I of last year, the iron and steel bounty cost £1,800,000; the sulphur bounty, £280,000; the cotton bounty, £300,800, and the wire bounty, £1,318,000. I have no quarrel with those secondary industries, but they have, been receiving most liberal assistance. The gold bounty is the only one which has really provided work for the unemployed, and yet, without reference to anybody, it is to be chopped in half in this, arbitrary fashion. During the committee stage of the bill, efforts will be made to secure the same treatment for the gold industry as is being meted out to the other assisted industries. Whoever was the designer or prompter of this proposal at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, whether he was a politician or a scientist, his place is in a lunatic asylum. He was certainly not a statesman. The great task before us to-day is to find employment for our people. Everybody admits that it is a good thing to have men profitably employed if possible, without being under the direct supervision of a boss.

While some phases of the goldmining industry are not too desirable, it offers, at the moment, the only field for the absorption of unskilled or semiskilled labour. No railways are being built now, so that 40,000 unskilled workers, who formerly found employment on railway construction, have to look elsewhere for jobs. The building of roads has been stopped, because it is impossible to obtain moneyfrom overseas. Water conservation schemes are not being proceeded with, for the same reason. As a result, there is a great army of unskilled men for whom employment of some kind must be found. In England there is no less than £2,080,000,000 lying at call awaiting investment. Some of it would be invested in gold-mining ventures here if conditions were made sufficiently attractive. millions does the honourable member think would come to Australia ? Bill was before the House, I said that £8,000,000 could be obtained. Already £4,000,000 has arrived. No one in Britain will invest money in Australian land to grow wheat or wool, or in Australian industries to manufacture machinery or other secondary products. to manufacture sewing machines? Whatever capital is required for that purpose can be raised in my own electorate. The sewing machine manufacturing industry is going on quite well. Let me now summarize my argument. The reduction of wages is wrong. If the Government reduces wages and salaries it will be copied by outside employers. Such a reduction will not increase employment, as has been demonstrated by the reduction of wages by the Arbitration Court. The reduction of old-age, invalid, and war pensions is unthinkable. The cost of living has not been reduced by 12£ per cent. There is an alternative to the Government's plan. Under the Hoover plan, Australia will be relieved of the immediate payment of £3,090,000. A large proportion of the interest payable It is altogether wrong to inon our overseas indebtedness should, for the time being, be retained in Australia. This would relieve us of the payment abroad of £47,000,000, which would be available here for assisting industry, and absorbing the unemployed. Far from there being, the prospect of any such sum to help us under the Government's plan, we are faced with a certain deficit by the end of June of next year. Finally, our policy should be to balance budgets by putting our people to work, and not by reducing wages, and decreasing the spending power of the community. Let us not stultify the good work already done by the Government, but let us go ahead on constructive lines, believing that things will alter for the better in Australia, perhaps much more rapidly than the gloomy prophets on the other side of the chamber profess to believe.'

After mature consideration, I have resolved to support the measures submitted, although I am as reluctant to do so as is any other honourable member of this House. Some honourable members opposite, although elected as supporters of the Government, have not the courage to fall in behind it at this time of crisis, and support a policy which they know will be unpopular. They are shirking their responsibilities. only doing what the honourable member wants it to do. He should not complain. that interjection. I have never before advocated the policy which the Government is now seeking to put into effect. Honourable members will recollect that, when the Leader of the Opposition suggested some time ago that the salaries of civil servants should be reduced, I opposed the proposal, because the Government said then that it had other means of balancing the budget. ber's leader suggested the reduction of wages and salaries. sponsible for my own actions. honourable members opposite are not facing their responsibilities; they will not support the plan agreed upon at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, which included representative Ministers of four Labour Governments, although they know that there is no alternative except that of paying civil servants and old-age, invalid and war pensioners only 12s. in the £1 from this month. Honourable members opposite cannot refute the statements of the financial experts who advised the Melbourne conference. They are concerned only with the safety of their political skins. It is time that the electors of the Commonwealth gauged the actions of their representatives by their motives. For too long have the-people been fooled by politicians who advocate and support only those things which they think will make them popular. That attitude has been largely responsible for bringing about the difficulThe honourable member for Kennedy( Mr ties which face us to-day.

I am glad that it is not in that position to-day, and I hope that, if any party in this House ever does hold the balance of power, it will take a more serious view of its responsibilities than does the corner party opposite. Honourable members wno associate themselves with that section are evading a responsibility that should be theirs as supporters of a government in the National Parliament. The Treasurer ( Mr Theodore),. explained very clearly that every avenue had been investigated in an endeavour to lighten the burden as much as possible. The Commonwealth Government wa3 faced with the knowledge that if prompt action were not taken it could pay only 12s. in the £1 to its employees and bondholders, and this plan was evolved after careful deliberation. Our primary producers have already suffered reductions, and the salariedofficers of the Queensland and other State Governments have been subjected to reductions in income. If the Commonwealth officers do not share in the general sacrifice that is so necessary, those who are now bearing the burden will wait in vain for a restoration of prosperity. Just before the climax came, people were fond of saying, "" reduce the costs of Government"". They did not know what those costs represented. Actually the maintenance of the Federal Administration does not involve great expenditure. Our social services, which have been provided for so generously, represent the greatest expenditure. Pensions of all descriptions account for £21,000,000 per annum, as compared with a mere £77,620 for the maintenance of Eederal Parliament. Riordan) declared that several million",30,Setup

Ill-considered andinaccurate statements such as that can do only harm. The administration of the whole of the Departments of the Commonwealth costs less than £3,000,000, while that of the section which controls trade and commerce, a department that has a revenue from various sources of £39,700,000, costs only £265,000 per annum. Obviously some administrative charges must be involved in collecting so colossal a sum. If the whole of our Oommonwealth Departments were abolished, including Parliament itself, the saving ejffected would not be as great as that anticipated from the reduction in pensions. The burden should be spread.as equitably as possible over tKe community. A further reduction is to be made in the salaries of members of Parliament. I support that, as I supported the last reduction in members' salaries and I shall support any similar saving that may be considered necessary by the Government. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) confined himself to a virulent attack upon the supporters of this plan. He claimed that their only desire was to make an onslaught on the basic wage earners. That is absurd. The scheme does not touch the basic wage. Australia is in a position of dire necessity. The honourable member conveniently omitted to mention that Australia's shortterm indebtedness in Great Britain amounts to £38,000,000 and in Australia to £25,000,000, and that the limit had been reached. He did not remind his constituents, through you, Mr Speaker, that we are now paying an additional £10,000,000 in exchange and a further £10,000,000 for unemployment, as compared with normal years. Nor did he say that our accumulated deficit of £6,500,000 was not being reduced, and that we were confronted with an additional deficit of £14,000,000, or that our customs, excise, and income tax revenue has shrunken by some £18,500,000 per annum. The Government, was faced with default, and had to introduce some emergency provisions such as those embodied in this bill. It had not sufficient to meet payments for pensions, salaries and interest. A conference met in Melbourne. It consisted of Commonwealth and State Premiers and Treasurers, eminent economists, and political leaders of various shades of opinion. The meeting was inspired with the determination to assist the nation to deal effectively with the great problems that confront it. It was not moved by any petty desire to reduce the emoluments of the basic wage earner or to impose hardship upon pensioners. It was realized that the nation's earning capacity had decreased by £200,000,000, and that no loan moneys were available to stimulate industry and increase employment. The nation was further embarrassed by the action of the Government of New South Wales, which already has a deficit of £8,000,000 for the current financial year, and which is doing everything to harass the Commonwealth and to prevent successful carrying out of this plan. Faced with the facts, the representatives of the nation "" realized that reductions in social services were imperative, and that simultaneously there would have to be reductions in bounties, in the emoluments of the judiciary and in the rates of interest paid io bondholders. So, this plan was evolved. Yet we find the Government being assailed by .disgruntled members who are afraid to stand up to the obligations. I would far rather be out of Parliament than allow myself to pander to public opinion in an effort to placate my electors, to the detriment of the best interests of the nation. among us. be well for the honourable member to emulate Daniel. It was stated at the Premiers Conference that the necessity for these sacrifices is due to the inability of Australia to pay its way.

His' responsible leaders bave informed him that the reductions are nevitable, that if the plan were not put mto effect the country oould not pay more than 12s. in the £1 to its bondholders and employees. Erom a kerosene box on the Yarra bank the honourable member delights to tell the supporters who put him into Parliament as palatable a story as possible; he enjoys the applause which follows his declaration that he desires to preserve the incomes of unfortunate widows, and ward off any attacks upon pensioners. Those sentiments are admirable, and we should all like to give effect to them, were that possible. In the circumstances, it is not. The country is staggering under a burden that is beyond its strength, and all must help to lighten the load. [Quorum formed.] I will not have it that Australia is altogether responsible for the troubles that now beset it. I do not deny that governments have been extravagant in iborrowing and distributing money among the States; but there are other reasons. The world is suffering from a general depression, chiefly the result of the aftermath of the war. The sooner the United States of America comes to its senses and releases the countries which are so heavily indebted to it through borrowing to carry on the war, the better it will be for all, and the sooner £573,000,000. We have been assured countries will have credits to pay for the output of primary producing nations. The monetary policy of the United States of America has brought about a credit shortage. There are other reasons for our troubles, the principal of which is unemployment, which needs to be solved before attention is given even to disarmament, or to the economic ills mentioned by the right honorable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). A world conference on unemployment would do the greatest good. One of the principal causes of unemployment is mass production. The application of science to industry, and the resultant improvement of machinery and labour-saving devices, has made possible production on a gigantic scale. Because the rate of production is greater than the absorptive capacity of the nations, the world is over supplfed. But the displacement of labour that has resulted from Mr Bernard Corser. these causes cannot be rectified by a reduction of wages. The present disturbance of industry can be adjusted only by a reasonable distribution of the work available at fair rates of remuneration. If a world conference on unemployment were held, probably one of the easiest solutions that could be proposed would be the raising of the industrial and economic standards of cheap-labour countries to approximately those obtaining in Australia. The plan now before the House includes the saving of millions of pounds annually by reducing the interest payments on the internal public debt of £556,000,000. The reduction of interest is not popular, for it requires sacrifices by even the small bondholder. A suggestion was made that holders of bonds not exceeding £1,000 should have the option of being paid off in cash, or have their stock redeemed at an earlier date than is provided in the Debt Conversion Bill. I supported and .advocated an amendment to give effect to-that when the interest reduction bill was under discussion, but the Treasurer said that that concession would require the Commonwealth to find £100,000,000. Some critics of the Government's plan have urged that attention should be directed to the interest payable on the external debt of frequently that following the readjustment of the internal public debt, it will be possible to consolidate the loans owing in the United Kingdom, and effect, in respect of them, a saving of interest equivalent to that being made on the internal debt. We cannot, however, ask for a funding of our overseas debt at a lower rate of interest until we have given proof to the world that we are making sacrifices in order to put our financial house in order. External bondholders cannot be expected to accept a lower rate of interest until our own people have done so. The right honorable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) stated that he proposes to move an amendment to limit the operation of this bill to three years. Of course, everybody would be gratified if the position of Australia so improved that the period of sacrifice could be made even shorter than the right honourable member proposes. This is a measure to deal with a financial emergency. The right honourable member boasted that he had made certain promises to the soldiers, and that he had kept them. The truth is that he left the promises to be honoured by those who succeeded him. The Australian public debt £280,000,000 out of a total war debt of £400,000,000. sinking fund charges on the war debt and repatriation services amount to £21,000,000 a year. cost nearly £8,000,000, repatriation £11,250,000, other war services £293,000, or a total of £30,326,000. That is some of the cost of the war, to which must be added interest on the huge loans raised. No one objects to the payments to the soldiers, but if the right honourable gentleman had shown ! keener foresight would have been less than it is. He sold Australia's produce during the war period at half; the price the producers in other countries were receiving. Had he shown better judgment, some of the financial sacrifices which Australia has had to make would have been shared among the other nations which were not then contributing either "" men or material to the cause of the Allies. Some of the countries which made the smallest sacrifices derived the greatest benefit from the war, and some of the benefits were at the expense of Australia. Had the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), when Prime Minister, been more alert to the best interests of Australia, he would not have left a war debt of £400,000,000 to those who succeeded him. The honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) referred to the operation of this financial the soldiers' conference has been a great emergency plan in Queensland, and said that the reduction of Public Service salaries there was not so great as the Government proposes in respect of Commonwealth employees. I remind him that the Queensland Government took time by the forelock; it commenced to economize eighteen months ago, and it is now the duty of other portions of the Commonwealth, particularly New South Wales, to face their obligations, so that the sacrifices of the people of Queensland may not be unduly prolonged through the failure of some States to do promptly what is necessary and inevitable. The deficit in Queensland is only £842,000, as compared with £8,000,000 in New South Wales, and it included £500,000 for exchange. Actually, the deficit on the ordinary serof £1,100,000,000 includes vices of the year was only £342,000, notwithstanding that the revenue was lower The interest and than in any year since 1925, and £1,664,000 less than in 1929-30. Whereas War pensions Premier, the ' deficit was £500,000, although the revenue was £700,000 above that of the preceding year. The policy being pursued by the Government of New South Wales is inflicting hardship on people throughout Australia. The Premier of that State is playing the part of a Judas, and loyal Australians should take steps to put him out of office, Australia's war burden and rid ""the country of the reds who, through their control of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions, are dictating Mr Lang's policy. In regard to the details of the bill, a pleasing fact is that the soldiers have again shown their readiness to come to the aid of their country in its hour of need. Representatives of the various soldier organizations, having conferred regarding the Government's proposals, have submitted certain recommendations for a saving of £1,018,230. By these modifications of the Government's proposals for a 20 per cent, cut of war pensions, they have obviated any reduction of the payments to orphan children, war widows, disabled soldiers, sailors, and nurses, and widowed mothers of unmarried soldiers who were killed or died from other war causes. The acceptance by the Government of the suggestions of help to honourable members. has been criticizing the arrangement. honourable member has also criticized the Government. Criticism of any proposed reduction of something which people are now enjoying is popular, but the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) did not suggest any alternative to the scheme submitted by the Government^",32,Setup

Eighteen months ago he said that the House should not adjourn until it had solved the unemployment problem. That problem is still unsolved; but the honourable member's declaration was a good electioneering stunt. Now he is opposing a scheme which provides that the Government shall, as part of the general plan for rehabilitathe Premiers and Treasurers of the tion, negotiate with the banks to provide £2,500,000 for advances to necessitous wheat farmers, and £6,000,000, at the rate of £1,000,000 a month, for the relief of the unemployed. Here is a practical proposal to help the unfortunate people who are out of work. It is the only practical and concrete suggestion that has been put forward, and it merely requires ratification by the various Parliaments of Australia. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Keane) is not likely to place the true position before his elecexpenditure upon governmental salaries and tors. Those with whom he is associated wish to extend unemployment so that this country may be cast into the slough of despond, and thus bring about at an earlier date their objective, which is the general breakup of the conditions under which we live. Australia is not at present in a position of despair. If the world's prices for our commodities were to improve, Australia would immediately begin to recover. As our pioneers overcame the extreme difficulties which faced them, so will we overcome the difficulty -confronting this country to-day. Queensland is facing the position. The people have confidence in that State, and there is less unemployment there than in any other State. being established; settlement is taking place, and capital is being attracted there. If similar steps were taken in would soon be restored in this :ountry. The Premiers Conference has submitted a plan for the rehabilitation of Australia under which all sections of the community are asked to. bear their share in the general sacrifice. [Quorum formed.] Surely we should be guided by the opinions of those who attended the Premiers Conference. Their final resolution, according to the summary of main decisions and proceedings of the conference, readsHe has been very ready The conference unanimously passed the following final resolution:The representatives of each Government present at this conference bind themselves to give effeot promptly to the whole of the resolutions agreed to at this conference. That conference was attended by representatives of the official Opposition in this Parliament, the Prime Minister and various States, and those gentlemen, after a f u l l discussion of the whole plan, passed the following resolution:The conference including the Leaders of the Opposition in the Federal Parliament, having most carefully considered the financial position of the Commonwealth and the States, and recognizing the national inability to meet existing govermnent charges, is unanimouslyof the opinion that to prevent national default in the immediate future and a general failure to. meet government payments, all expenditure including interest on government securities and other interest, and wages, pensions, and other social services must be substantially reduced. These measures, drastic as they may appear, are the first essentials to the restoration of prosperity and the re-employment of our workless people. Those sentiments appeal to me. We on this side have repeatedly asked that all parties should get together in an endeavour to better the conditions of the unfortunate unemployed in this country. These men and their families have suffered severe privations during this rigorous winter. A young Australian who has just reached manhood is unable to obtain a start in life. In an effort to assist the unemployed we should bury what desire we have for political kudos at this moment. We should do the right but New industries are unpopular thing.

But before doing so, at the risk of being accused of resorting to tedious repetition, I wish to say a word or two about the arguments that have been advanced against the Government's proposals. Judging by the remarks-of some honourable members, one would think that those supporting the Government find a fiendish delight in supporting the drastic economies outlined in the bill. That is the wrong way to approach these proposals. After all, to simply condemn them without submitting an immediate and practical alternative is to be as futile -invariably pointed to the necessity for a as a dog howling at the moon. It is of no use suggesting what should be done in the future. The problem now confronting us is the only one that we have to solve. The only justification for the drastic economies outlined in the bill is the expected restoration of economic stability and prosperity, which the Government has prophesied will follow the operation of this plan. Personally I am not prepared to agree to these proposals being given effect unless other results are to follow. I hope that this Government will resolutely press forward with the conversion of our .external debt. I fully appreciate the fact that it is essential to put our own house in order before we start talking to our' external creditors. I take umbrage at the manner in which certain honourable members have scoffed at the idea of restoring confidence in this country. ber's argument is not likely to assist him at the next election. the consideration of political security to interfere with my attitude towards the Government's proposals. So long as I am convinced that what I am doing is right, 1 am prepared to take what is coming to me, and the threat of political extinction does not deter me from following the course that I have determined \upon. No man will lend another man money unless he has confidence in his integrity and his ability to repay the loan. Surely the whole structure of credit, in society as we know it, is based on that principle. It is absurd, therefore, for honourable members to scoff at the idea of restoring confidence in Australia. I sometimes think that it would be better to let the nation drift as it is now drifting towards bankruptcy than face the barrage of hostile and destructive criticism which has been hurled at this Government and its supporters. That would, of course, be taking the line of least resistance, and it might be preferable were it not for the disastrous results that would follow such a policy. Some honourable members have quoted the views of economists in regard to our monetary policy, but they have overlooked the fact that those economists have change in the internaitional monetary policy. A reform of monetary policy in one country only would have little or no effect upon the price levels that are to-day depressing the trade of the world. There must be an international reform of monetary and economic policy before' a speedy recovery can be achieved. This problem must be approached from that aspect. ""We all hope that international reform will be effected, because the seriousness of the present crisis is threatening the whole system of credit, and the security of civilized society as we understand it. . That, in itself, is the best assurance that we can have that reforms will be made. The problem which is confronting us to-day is world wide. Without going into details, we know that one of the gravest problems of America has relation to the collapse of silver currency, and its effects on South American and eastern, trade. When I passed through Washington a few months ago, I learned from the head of the Government and other quarters that the nrincipal difficulties which are facing the United States of America",35,Setup

It was pointed out by the Government of the United States of America, as early as last September, that the remonetization of silver as a medium of international currency was badly needed. If we can get international consideration to remedies of this kind, price levels will be restored, and our troubles, together with similar troubles in other parts of the world, will vanish like an evil dream. I know that views like these are scoffed at by some honourable members who claim to possess superior knowledge. I do not claim to be an expert economist, but I have some common sense. One must, of course, take some notice* of the claim which certain honourable members make to the possession of superior wisdom, but the views of experts who, over a long period of years, have given mature consideration to these important problems should not be entirely overlooked. I have said all that I desire to say along broad lines. The general discussion of these problems has been well covered in previous debates. But I have two or three suggestions to make in regard to the details of the bill. I urge the Government to amend clause 17 with the object of limiting the inroads that may be made upon the incomes of Commonwealth employees by means of special emergency State taxation, particularly for unemployment. It must be remembered that the members of the Public Service will be taxed upon last year's income. absolutely unfair. .1 was glad to get an assurance from the Minister for Defence that steps were being taken to remedy this anomaly.' Persons in ordinary employment will not sustain such severe and immediate reductions of income as those which will fall upon the members of the Federal Public Service, in respect of whom the Government has a peculiar responsibility. It should certainly see that its own employees are not subjected to drastic unemployment taxation in addition to the imposts which will be placed upon them under the provisions of this bill. The action of the representatives of the returned soldier organizations in conMr Coleman. ferring with the Government and suggesting alternative means of reducing repatriation expenditure without inter fering with the rights of disabled soldiers was gratifying to me. I have read in the press the details of the suggestions of the returned soldiers' representatives, including the proposal that returned men not affected by these reductions should be invited to refrain from collecting pensions, if in a position to do so. I hope that that proposal will be acted upon. We noticed in the press to-day that the Prime Minister had been notified by one returned man that, in the circumstances, he did not intend to continue collecting his pension. I suggest, however, that provision should be made in the bill to protect the interests of those who voluntarily refrain from collecting pensions to which they are entitled. It would be entirely unfair if the interests of these men were prejudiced, while the interests of those who did not adopt such a public-spirited attitude were left unimpaired. I hope that this point will be met when the bill is in committee. In regard to the suggested reduction of old-age and invalid pensions, I shall, in committee, offer some criticism of the cheese-paring methods that have been adopted. I hope that the Government will review some of the trifling economies which are making inroads upon the principles which have governed our pension legislation for many years past. There are some anomalies in the manner in which the pensions of inmates of beneThat, to my mind, is volent institutions and sanatoria are to be reduced. It seems to me to be paltry to take Is. from the income of these persons, some of whom, as the honorable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) pointed out, are dying from tuberculosis and other diseases. If the Government feels that, in order to spread the sacrifices over all sections of pensioners, it must make some reductions in these pensions, I hope that it will make them more equitable than is at present proposed. A reduction of Is. per week in the pension of 5s. 6d. drawn by hospital inmates is more than 12£ per cent: A 12£ per cent, reduction on 5s. 6d. would be only 8-Jd. It is, therefore,. proposed to take 3|d. more than the equity of the situation requires. It is proposed to take Is. 6d. of the amount payable to the institutions concerned in respect of each pensioner inmate, whereas 12£ per cent, would be Is. 9Jd. Most of these institutions are maintained by the State, and in some cases the inmates of them are self-supporting. The specific figures in regard to these reductions are' as follow: -Present pension payable to inmate, 5s. 6d.; proposed rate, 4s. 6d.; reduction, Is.; percentage, 18 per cent. Present contribution payable to institution,' 14s. 6d.; proposed rate, 13s.; reduction, Is. 6d.; percentage, 10 per cent. I suggest that the Government should reduce the pension payable to the inmate by 6d., bringing it to 5s., and the amount payable to the institution by 2s., bringing it to 12s. 6d. The reductions would then be 9 per cent, and 14 per cent, respectively. Such an arrangement would be more equitable than that which is now proposed, and would be more mathematically accurate. In regard to staff re-organization, I suggest that the Government should follow the example of the New South Wales Government, and ration the available work in preference to dismissing employees. It would be 'deplorable if the number of unemployed persons in the community, were increased by the adoption of a severe policy of retrenchment. This economy plan is a drastic expedient which must be judged by the results achieved. If the adoption of the plan does not lead to the provision of work for the workless people in the community; to the re-establishment of economic stability; to the release of credits by banks both here and overseas; to the funding of our overseas debts; and to the reduction of interest rates, externally as well as internally, it will not justify itself, and must in due course be condemned. [5.43] I listened with great interest to the speech of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who intimated his intention to move an amendment to provide that the plan of the Government should remain in operation for three years only. That was a drastic proposal, and I fully expected the right honourable member to advance some good reasons in support of it. Usually his speeches and suggestions in this House are worthy of careful consideration, but in this case he entirely failed to justify his proposal, and adopted an attitude which I can only describe as that of a rail-sitter. The right honourable gentleman is in exactly the same position as the rest of us. I do not suppose that one honorable member will support these proposals with any degree of pleasure. But we must recognize that honourable members who have expressed themselves violently in opposition to this course have failed to advance any practicable alternative to it. We have been forced to conclude that the putting into operation of the policy now proposed by the Government cannot be delayed any longer without courting the gravest financial disaster. Therefore, we have to support the Government's proposal. beaten the Government to its knees. that view. forward twelve months ago. gested by the Opposition that interest rates should be reduced, but when the Government brought down the drastic proposal to reduce interest, and said that on the authority of the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in Melbourne, that reduction must stand or fall with the others, we on this side, to be logical and fair, had to agree to it. It is most deplorable that we have to break our contract with the bondholders. Nobody will deny that this measure involves a breach of contract. It is of no use to demand continually that something be done to save Australia from financial disaster, if , when the Government brings down a concrete proposal, we run away"" from it, as some honourable members opposite are doing; I refer, particularly to members of the Lang group, and I am sorry to notice that its numbers are growing in this House.

I was elected to support, and that is more than the honourable member for Bendigo can say. Eighteen months ago, he was regarded as a Labour stalwart, with a promising political future, but the first time he is called upon by the Government that he is pledged to support to stand fast, and help it in this time of difficulty, he deserts it. I gave my word to the Government that, if it brought down a proposal that represented the matured opinion of the economists, the financiers, and the State Premiers, I would support it, and I stand by that promise now.

This is the greatest exhibition of courage by a government that we have seen in the political history of the Commonwealth. The Government has very little to gain and everything to lose in submitting this bill. In carrying out a most disagreeable task, it calls upon the public-spirited men of this chamber, irrespective of their party views, to support it, and I consider that I have sufficient public spirit, whatever the cost may be to me, politically, to stand behind the Government. All I ask it to do is to remain firm, and refuse to be stampeded, by the members of the Lang group, who are trying to demoralize it on this issue. If members of the Government have any faith in themselves, and in the future of the Labour movement, they must realize that, eventually, they will win on the rehabilitation proposals which will help to restore confidI said that apparently the ence among the people of Australia. Long after the noisy members in the corner occupied by the Lang group, and to the verge of ruin and rebellion, are forgotten, the Government will be remembered. The members who support the present proposals, unpopular as they are, will be regarded as the political saviours of their country. It seems to me that the right honourable member for North Sydney has drawn a red herring across the path, though he did not reveal his motive in doing so. It is to be regretted that he has suggested that we should fix a definite period for the operation of this measure. He said that these reductions of wages and pensions should be limited to three years, but he did not mention that the reduction of the interest of the unfortunate bondholders is to take effect up to 30 years. If this is to be a logical scheme, each part of it must be accepted, and if its operation is to be"" limited in any way, we should announce to the bondholders that, at the end of the period of its operation, the old rate of interest will be restored. I do not think that honourable members opposite would agree to that. If it were now proposed that, at the end of three years the old rates of interest should be reverted to, members opposite would immediately show their teeth, and reveal the fact that they are prepared to cut down the interest of the bondholders for all time. repudiation. is unfortunate and disastrous, and I am supporting it only because there is ho",38,Setup

I would sooner see the bondholders receive some interest and save their principal, than witness the financial crash that would, inevitably, occur if these proposals were not adopted. If the right honourable member for North Sydney desires to limit the operation of the plan to three years, he must include the interest of the bondholders, otherwise, he could not logically claim that pensions and the wages of public servants should be restored in three years to the old level. On that test alone, I think that his amendment falls to the ground; but other tests may be applied. deplored the alleged fact that this scheme provides for a general reduction in the standard of living in Australia-""the great standard "",. he said, "" which we have fought all our lives to maintain "". But he did not substantiate his argument. I claim that these proposals do not involve a reduction of the standard of living in this country. The actual standard has fallen automatically, and this Parliament had no power to prevent that. The cost of living figures show that as much can be purchased to-day with 17s. ld. as could be bought with £1 two years ago. made by the honourable member in his speech were based mostly on theory. The fact that the cost of living has fallenin Australia is indisputable. There is plenty of evidence of it, apart from the theorizing of the statisticians and economists. If the honourable member for Bendigo stances, such as the imposition of primage ( Mr Keane) can show that they are duties and sales tax, affect prices ? wrong, why does he not do it ? member understand that those figures do portant fact that appears to be the not include eighteen items that I menweakest spot in these proposals.

They average all the factors indirect taxation at the same time we over the whole range of economic possibilities, and base on them the resultant calculations. I do not attach any importance to the suggestion of the honourable member for Bendigo that this is mere theorizing. There is nothing else to go on. I also dispute the statement of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) that this plan lowers the high standard of wages and pensions that' previously existed in Australia. The avail"" able statistical data totally disprove that He contention. The actual reduction is inconformity with the economic value, of money to-day. If any regard is to be given to statistics, it may be assumed that we are on perfectly safe, ground in. making these reductions; that they will leave our old-age and other pensioners on the same economic basis that they were on twelve months or two years ago. There is every probability that within the next -twelve months the cost of living will decline still further,, which will make the position even better. There now exists a world-wide tendency for prices to come down, and it is the accepted opinion of economists that prices will not rise for a considerable period of years. Any improvement in the prices of wheat and wool may be only of a temporary nature, and no one can claim with justification that, at present, we Gan look forward to a substantial rise in the price of primary products. been determined that we must reduce the It is ill-advised in imposing additional taxaDifferent indiviadditional taxation, at least for a",39,Setup

If it is the Government of which "" was deterimpossible for'the Commonwealth Government, with its heavy commitments, to balance its budgets in any other way, I am prepared to support even that section of the proposal, though I do so reluctantly. It is the weak point in the plan. There is another factor that deserves consideration. It seems a tragedy that we should have two sets of sovereign parliaments, each legislating for the same people, each facing the same problems, and yet totally isolated from each other. Our Federal and State impose on the same people taxation which is similar in nature, and which covers the same economic field, yet neither takes cognizance of what is being done by the other. The legislative work of the States is ignored in this chamber, and it is rare to read in the debates of the State Parliaments any reference to what is going on in the Federal Parliament. Legislative proposals involving higher taxation are even now before the State Parliaments. They have been brought down by persons who have not taken the trouble to ascertain what the Federal Parliament proposes to do along similar-lines. Recently we had a striking example in New South Wales, when the tragic Premier of that State almost caused a revolt by introducing a confiscatory proposal to take prac.tically one-quarter of the earnings of the' people. He sought to crucify income earners, and smash business. There was a deliberate proposal to lift £16,000,000 out of the depleted resources of the taxpayers of New South Wales. Mr Lang must have known very well that any plan for the rehabilitation depends for its success upon the freedom of the Federal Parliament to extract more taxation from the taxpayers of New South Wales, as well as those of other States. aspect of the case, or point out to the people of New South Wales that, in addition to the £16,000,000 that he contemplated filching from them, the Commonwealth Government was also likely to introduce legislation that would collect an extra £15,000,000 from the taxpayers of Australia. wealth's participation in the matter was never mentioned. Mr Lang concentrated Mr Thompson. upon the liability of New South Wales, mined to solve its own problems"". In effect he said, "" To hell with the Commonwealth "". The right honourable member for North Sydney based his speech upon the allegation that we are whittling away our old established standards of living. He failed to prove his case, because he was unable to show in what direction those standards are being attacked. The right honourable gentleman ignored the fact that, while it is easy to talk glibly about a standard of living Parliaments for the community, that standard varies with its various sections; that actually it is impossible to say that any community has a set standard of living that can be either improved or attacked. After all, what standard of living have the unemployed? Does not this plan aim at providing a standard of living for those who now have none? That is also being ignored by honourable members in the corner who belong to the Lang faction. They will not face the facts. In parrotlike fashion they screech that they are the only persons in this House who are fighting for the unemployed. They carefully refrain from mentioning that the proposals before this Parliament seek to relieve unemployment, and to put the people ""back at work. If one out of every four male adults in Australia is at present out of employment, and this plan is seeking to restore confidence and replace those people in work, surely it is for the better! If it cannot improve conditions, it certainly will not make matters worse. When this Government came into office the unemployment figure in Australia of Australia was 12 per cent.; to-day it is nearly 30 per cent. Although an immediate improvement may not be possible, this plan should enable us gradually to cut down the prevailing percentage until it He did not consider . that again reaches 12 per cent. Will that not be helping to improve the standard of living in the Commonwealth? The right honourable member for North Sydney exhibited remarkable remissness in not drawing attention to that point. I consider that his proposed amendment constitutes a very serious menace to the The Commonsuccess of the proposals now before the House. The danger cannot be overrated. Honourable members on this side, who are staking their political existence in supporting these proposals, should have some consideration from the Government in the matter. I know that it may be said to be audacity on my part to criticize one who claims that he was the author of our. former standard of living. The right honourable gentleman declared, "" I gave these pensions. I made certain promises to the people, and I kept them."" Does the right honourable gentleman seriously claim that he is the custodian of our standard of living for all time? He merely enjoyed that right temporarily, while occupying the high office of Prime Minister of Australia. If he granted certain concessions in times of prosperity that does not absolve him, as a legislator, from the duty of assisting to take back that which, in the changed circumstances, constitutes too heavy a burden for the nation to carry any longer. The right honourable gentleman said that this is a world-wide problem that cannot be solved by any aotion taken by Australia only. What greater challenge to his own speech could he have advanced? At one stage he said that all would be well in another three years; that this is merely a gesture that we should hold out to the people. If we did that, we should be very sorry for it, as the people would expect the promise to be redeemed at the end of the three years. In view of the position of the country, it would not control. be fair to hold out any such promises to the people. The very best that we can say, as individuals, is that if conditions quiry in progress now into the economic so improve within three years that we depression. are able to restore pensions to the old basis, that will most certainly be done. Buti t would be an unpardonable action posed amendment of the right honourable to make, as a parliament, promises that member for North Sydney implies that we know very well are not worth a snap we have it within our power, by the of the fingers; that are merely a political application of certain methods which device to hoodwink the people. Our pose may or may not be adopted, to restore of frankness would eventually be exposed, in three years those benefits of which and branded by the people as a piece of the Government proposes to deprive civil political trickery.

In one part of his speech he saidThis is a great world problem, and it cannot be tackled or solved by any one nation. If he admits that, why does he affirm that it is within the capacity of Australia to solve the problem within three years, for that is what his proposed amendment implies? Again, the right honourable member saidThere is need for a world conference to deal with this problem of depression. It is, unfortunately, more urgent than a conferenoe to deal with armaments. That is a very important statement, coming from the right honourable member for North Sydney, and it, too, disposes of his assertion that Australia can solve her problem within a period of three years. In one breath the right honourable member says that the problem cannot be dealt with by any one nation, and in the next he says' that Australia is not only competent to deal with it, but can solve it in three years. Further on in his speech the right honourable member saidI again say that nothing will restore prosperity in Australia unless it involves an increase in prices of our stable products.

In that pamphlet of his, Bond or Free, he asks the same question, and answers it himself. At that time he had no doubt of the alternative. But the situation has since become awkward. I presume that most honourable members will recognize that a vast change has come over the scene during the last six weeks. Six weeks ago I this Government was cursed and denounced by the press from one end of Australia to the other. In all the land there was none to call it blessed. Members of the Government were described as drifters, panderers, repudiationists, and disruptionists. No opprobrious term was too bad to apply to them. Now, what a change has taken place. Members of the Government can go to sleep, soothed by the lullaby of praise from the great daily press, and they can wake up again with the same sweet music ringing in their ears. ber has himself been asleep for a long time. but I wake up now and then. Not only does the Government now get the plaudits of the press, but every criticism and condemnation that was previously levelled against it is now directed against the minority of the Ministerial party that dissents from the Government's policy. The Nationalist and Country parties and the majority of the Ministerial party are now linked in holy matrimony; they are welded together for one great national purpose. God bless them! We who constitute the minority of the Ministerial party are denounced and abused. repudiators. and others which were previously directed against the Government, are now laid against the minority of. the Ministerial party. In the daily columns of the press we read that the opponents of the plan are wreckers, blind, misguided, vindictive, idiotic and criminal, and ought to be extirpated. In a free land the minority, if it consists of only one man, has a right to be heard. It is not a crime to raise one's voice in opposition to the majority; yet in this so-called free Australia, newspapers declare that the minority should be extirpated.

124,Mr Anstey,"I do not expect allnever a government in any country, or at any time, or a ruler, however absolute, who had not the desire to establish stability and general prosperity, because upon such conditions their positions and security depended. Therefore, this title is a mere placard to disguise purposes which the Government is ashamed to. declare on the front page. purposes are to reduce wages, salaries, and pensions. So far as the reduction of wages and salaries applies to the postal employees, who constitute nine-tenths of the Public 'Service of the Commonwealth, this Government, and the majority of the Labour party, are acquiescing in the very policy for which Mr Bruce and his party were swept into political oblivion. to-day what we denounced the Bruce Page Government for proposing nearly two years ago. Honourable members on this side who are supporting the reduction of old-age and invalid pencallous act is being perpetrated. sions well merit the cheap applause which they are now getting from honourable members opposite. has n home valued at £500 will suffer a reduction of from 12£ to 20 per cent. in his pension; but the pensioner who has a home valued at £700 will suffer a reduction of 50 per cent. In the case of two old-age pensioners living in one home, each will suffer a reduction of 25 per cent. The pensioner v/ho has a home valued at £750 will suffer a reduction of 60 per cent, in his payments. Every pensioner who lives in his own home has to meet, various expenses such as water rates, municipal rates, repairs, and so on. In one fell swoop this legislation will, in some instances, take away from the aged and infirm who own the houses in which they live the great bulk of their pension. Many pensioners who have a little home of their own will be in a worse position than those who have no home. I come now to soldiers' pensions. Had this Government attempted, in the national interests, to reduce soldier pensions, the full force of the soldiers' organizations from one end of Australia to the other would have been brought to boar in opposition to it. An entirely new situation arose when the Government allied itself with the Nationalist party. One would naturally have thought that 3fr. Anstey. the high command of the soldiers' organizations would immediately attack every honourable member of this Parliament who proposed to vote for a reduction of soldier pensions, irrespective of the political party to which he belonged. But as the high command of the soldiers' organizations is linked up with the Nationalist Those* party, it has adopted an entirely new attitude in the present instance, and today it is working throughout the country to secure the acceptance of the agreement which it has made with the Government, so that the interests of certain Nationalist candidates may not be prejudiced. It is plain that this Government and the Nationalist party are placing the responsibility for the reduction in soldier We are doing pensions upon the returned soldiers themselves. The high command of tlie Returned Soldiers Association is accepting ful l responsibility for it, and it is because they are doing so that this We are faced, also, with the reduction of wages, the destruction of the arbitraThe pensioner who tion law so far as it applies to the public servants, the reduction of old-age and invalid pensions, and the reduction of soldier pensions. Years ago, before the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) formed the Nationalist party, he made this statement, "" I give this guarantee, that while I am in contrdl of this party, not one stone of the temple of Labour will be torn down"". What do we as a party say now?"" Of course, we say the same thing. But what are the facts? By supporting these proposals for reductions in wages, pensions, and social services, those of the party who now stand behind the Government are pulling down, in the name of national preservation, not only the walls, but also the roof of the temple of Labour.. They are doing that as ruthlessly as a gang of evictors in an Irish village dispossess a helpless tenant. Honourable members on this side who are supporting the Government's proposals are demolishing the temple of Labour stone by stone. This is not the end, but it is the beginning of the end of the Labour movement as it stood when we were elected to this Parliament. If I thought that this legislation was necessary to secure national stability, and to save the country from bankruptcy, I should have reason for supporting it. But what justification is there for this legislation, in view of the many policies accepted by this Government during the last two years, all of whiojh have miserably failed? This is the annihilation of everything that the Labour party has produced during two long generations. The condition of a civilization is not to be improved by the reduction of its standard of living. Government is now pursuing means the reduction of the community's powers of consumption. It matters not whether what is proposed aims at the restoration of stability in this country, and the bringing again of the purchasing power of two, ten, or 100 years ago, the fact is plain that this legislation will reduce the purchasing power, not only of the working man and the great body of public servants, but also of the old-age and invajjd pensioners and soldier pensioners. It will thus decrease the consumption of the products of the man on the land. will be no market for those products, and, as a result, tens of thousands of men who have been forced off the land will help to swell the many thousands of unemployed who are already walking the streets of the cities. This is not the first time that I have made that statement. Eighteen months ago I stated what would happen if the Government continued the policy that it was then pursuing. I am opposed to this bill, and shall vote against every clause in it. oppose the bill have been asked to suggest an alternative to it. We have been told that we have no constructive policy. Is there any constructive policy in this bill? There is nothing constructive in it. It provides for nothing but destruction, the pulling' down of everything that stands for Labour and its ideals. We who oppose it are asked to submit an alternative. I say to the Government that it is too late to ask for that. When Mr Bruce was Prime Minister he attended the May conference Of his party, and there outlined the position of this country. He refused to impose additional taxation, for the reason that that would drain the life blood from industry, increase the cost of production and the cost of living, and thus 1 compel the workman to ask for higher wages. H« told the Nationalist party that he could not reduce soldiers"" pensions, because that was unthinkable. He could not reduce old-age and invalid pensions, because that would place a burden upon the poorer section of the community and those least able to 'bear it. He said that there was only one alternative, and that was the reduction of production costs, including wages. If there is any distinction between the Nationalist party The policy which the and the Labour party it must be, not merely in name, but in principle. Mr Bruce at that time advocated the reduction of wages which, he said, would ultimately benefit the workers. He told the May conference that he would ask Parliament to sweep away the federal arbitration law, so that the standard of living and the wages, not only of the great body of Commonwealth employees, 'but also of the great mass of the people, might be reduced. The Labour party thereupon swept him out of office at the There next election, and he disappeared. We came into power. If , at thattime, we were not prepared to increase the burden of taxation or to reduce pensions and wages-and we were elected on that declaration-surel y we should not do so now. That is the answer that I give to this Government, and to the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) who now asks us for an alternative to this bill. This Government has, since it took oflice, pursued a policy of drift. It has suffered ignominy upon ignominy. It has ""We who refused to take any other road. It said that there was an obstacle in the way of giving effect to its policy, that obstacle being the Senate, and that it governed only in name. In such circumstances, it was its duty to become a real government, and to put its fortunes to the testI t should have appealed to the country on the issue. Unfortunately, it refused to do so. It put up policy after policy, some of which had previously been condemned by the party. This went on for months, and then a minority of ""the party submitted an alternative. There is no need for me to describe it, because the details are well known to honourable members. It was described by honourable members opposite as repudiation, inflation and default. Every ignominy was cast upon us. That continued until last September, when a sub-committee of the Cabinet evolved a policy whicli included a reduction of pensions. Leader of the Opposition, who was then Acting Treasurer, submitted that policy to the Prime Minister, who refused to accept it. becoming desperate. Gibson, on behalf of the Commonwealth Rank, and the associated banking corporations, said to the Government, as he had said from the beginning-""Reduc e pensions, wages and all governmental expenditure, otherwise we shall stop credits "". to accept the dictation of that gentleman. In October the Labour party was returned triumphant in the New South Wales election. triumph there came a measure of strength to the wobblers of the Federal Labour Party. Their sinews were stiffened, and their backbone strengthened, so that they again took a straight course. The hondore) stepped in again, and assisted in the formation of a monetary policy which the honourable member for Calare( Mr Gibbons) was selected to champion. My object in referring to these matters is to give an answer to those who ask of us, "" What is your alternative to the present proposals of the Government?"" The honourable member for Dalley at this time became a convert to the very things that he had formerly denounced, namely, inflation, the release of credits, the purreplied, "" No; what is your plan ?"" The chasing of bonds, the borrowing of money for public works, and so on. A. majority of the caucus accepted that policy. to 19. native of Labour to the reduction of wages. the members of the caucus got shaky at t i l 6 knGGS point, at the moment, is that the alternative to wage reduction, which was the alternative of the minority of the party for nine months, at last became the policy of the majority; and this policy was supported by the present Treasurer. repudiation. The called that; I would not have been surprised to hear honourable members opposite call it a policy of bigamy, so reckless are they in the use of terms of opprobrium. But it was an alternative, and I supported it. I ask honourable members of this party who, parrot-like, keep calling Then Sir Robert to us for an alternative to the present proposals, to remember this fact: I still stand for that policy. Some time afterwards the Prime Minister returned from Great Britain, and the honourable member for Dalley again became a member of the Government. The Prime Minister refused But what became of the policy? It was abandoned, and we were again like a shipwrecked crew who had no compass; we were without a policy. With Mr Lang's The policy had been.thrown overboard. There was no one to speak for it. The Labour party went into the Parkes by-election absolutely without any policy. The only thing that members of"" the party could say during that election was that Labour had no policy to submit to the electors other than the policy of antiNationalism. In the following February a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers was held, which the Prime Minister opened with a speech. At the conclusion of his remarks he said to Mr Lang, the Premier of New South Wales, "" Have you anything to say?"" According .to the report of the conference, Mr Lang Prime Minister said, "" We have no plan; we have come here to formulate a plan "". At that conference another plan was devised, or I should say that the old plan was resurrected, and an addition made to it. It was the old plan under a new name. But in June that plan was dropped. The history of this party might be expressed in this way: First, the party drifted, then a plan was devised. Then there was no plan; then there was a plan; then there was no plan, then there was another plan, then there was no plan, and now there is another plan. How, in the name of creation, can a party which drifts in that way get anyanywhere? Now the banks are saying to us, "" Gentlemen, put your hands up"". They are not saying this for the first time.

The reply of the Commonwealth Bank Board was received on the 16th December, and the reply of the associated banks on the 18th December. Sir Robert Gibson said to us, "" We have no funds "". Then he went on to say, "" If we had funds, we would not advance them to governments which had no means of repayment "". When he was charged with having curtailed credits, he said, "" We have curtailed credit to private individuals in order to pay the bills of impecunious governments "". The crisis was in front of us six months ago. Of whait use is it to tell us that we are now facing a crisis? The issue was before us, and should have been faced long months ago, but we had not the courage to face it. We are being asked to-day what we intend to do. My reply is, "" We intend to stick to the facts"". When the Prime Minister was asked during the Parkes by-election what he intended to do, he said, "" We will take one step after another, but every step will be a sound step"". but forward. We have gone forward until we have come to the edge of a precipice. We cannot take another step without falling into the abyss. The Prime Minister is like a general who, having led to the verge of destruction the men who, in the name of party, loyally supported him, says to them, "" Well, gentlemen, we are now faced with disaster. But the enemy is not asking us to surrender. It merely asks us to retain our rank and emoluments and use our swords in their defence, and to turn them upon those whom we are pledged to fight for. We are asked to carry the weapons of the enemy, in return for which they will give us position and pay."" When protests are made against the acceptance of such terms, those who protest are asked, "" What is your alternative ?"" There is only one alternative; that is to refuse to do this work. We should say, ""Let whosoever will, do this dirty work, but we will not do it . "" In reply we are told that it is better for us to do this work than for others to do it. It is said that if others do the work, it will be done worse than if we do it. But are we justified in spitting upon the altar of Labour simply because others may'desecrate it worse than we may ? Are we justified in abandoning all our principles simply to retain place and pay? That is not the way to advance. We cannot serve or save our country in that way. That is not the path of salvation. A. few months ago, His Holiness the Pope, in speaking to the faithful about the relations between the Mussolini Government and the Vatican, said that there could be no Hosannas, for the crucifixion was coming. The crucifixion is coming to the mass of men and women in this country, as it came to Christ himself. We could understand it coming from our enemies; but I know of no blow which is harder to bear than the blow of a friend, and of no stab which goes so deep as the stab from the hands of one's own companions. What would Christ have thought as He hung on the cross if the nails that pierced His hands and feet had been hammered in by His friends; if the sword that pierced His side had been driven by His friends; if the sponge of vinegar had been held to His lips by His friends? These things were done to Him not by His friends, but by His bitterest enemies. But to-day this Government is crucifying the very people who raised its members from obscurity and placed them in power. I am appalled that they should even contemplate doing this contemptible thing. that the minds of honourable members are made up, and that no amount of argument is likely to alter a single vote on this bill. But I wish to refer briefly to the circumstances which have brought us to our present position. The main factors have been our crushing war debt, the great drop in the prices of our exportable products, and the closing of the overseas money market against us. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) in the course of his speech referred to what he called the disastrous policy of this Government; but he made no reference to the even more disastrous policy of the Government with which he was associated for a number of yearsa policy which has been aptly described as ""borrow, boom and burst.""

136,Mr Jones (Indi) [8.55],"I realizeabsolute orgy of overseas borrowing and extravagant expenditure. It borrowed, it boomed, and the country is now reaching the bursting point. The difficulties of Australia cannot justly be attributed to i V present Government. I shall support the general principles of this bill though I shall endeavour to secure an amendment to some of its provisions. I realize that this is a time for compromise. In the formulation of this plan for our financial rehabilitation, both parties have made some sacrifices. This is no time for honourable members to be bound hard and fast to party. One of the main causes of our present difficulties is the drop of £200,000,000 in our national income, which has receded from £450,000,000 this year. This decrease has been caused by the drop in the price of our exportable products. Another major cause of our difficulties is the huge deficits that the various Commonwealth and State Governments have accumulated. The combined deficits of the various Australian Governments at the end of the last financial year was £30,000,000, and it has been estimated that at the present rate of expenditure the combined deficits at the end of the current year will be £40,000,000, making the accumulated deficit £70,000,000. the Oommonwealth the 30th June last was £14,000,000, and it is estimated that at the present rate of expenditure the deficit at the end of the next financial year will be £20,000,000, making an accumulated deficit of £34,000,000. Additional difficulties are caused by the fact that short-term debts to the extent of £38,000,000 overseas, and £25,000,000 in Australia, making £63,000,000 in all, must be met. Last year the adverse exchange rate cost the Commonwealth £10,000,000, and unemployment relief £9,000,000. These facts must be kept in mind in considering the present proposal. The Commonwealth deficit at the end of June, 1929, was £5,000,000. There was a further deficit of £1,500,000 in June, 1930, and in June, 1931, a shortage of £14,000,000, £20,500,000. It is estimated that there will be a further drop in the coming financial year of £20,000,000, and, unless provision for a reduction of the wage."" Ur. Jones. an improvement is brought about, the Commonwealth will then have a deficit of £40,500,000. The Prime Minister told us, in his second-reading speech on the Debt Conversion Bill, that there had been a huge fall in Commonwealth revenue from three main sources, namely, customs, excise, and income taxation'. The estimated drop for the year 1931-32, compared with the revenue for 1929-30, is £18,500,000 on those items alone. The estimated revenue for the coming year is £60,000,000, and the estimated expenditure £80,000,000, leaving a balance on the wrong side of £20,000,000. A prudent housewife regulates her household expenditure according to her income. If she sees that the expenditure is growing, or £650,000,000 in 1928-29 to that her income is falling, she will endeavour to curtail her expenditure. If she imprudently spends all her income, and, also borrows from every possiblp source, a day of reckoning will come. Similarly a nation that has been spending unwisely over a long period eventually reaches the stage at which a reduction of its disbursements is unavoidable. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) boasted that the governments with which he had had the honour to be associated had balanced their budgets; but it would be interesting The deficit of to know whether they lived within their Government at, means. So far as I can learn they did not meet their expenditure wholly from revenue, but were responsible, to a large extent, for the excessive overseas borrowing which is now causing great concern to the present Government, which would be relieved of its difficulties if it were able to borrow on the same scale as past administrations. [Quorum formed.] Some government had to cry a halt, and this unpleasant task has fallen to the lot of the Labour Ministry. I have said that the expenditure for this year is estimated at £80,000,000, comprising the following items£ Overseas interest, sinking fund and exchange . . . . 25.000,000 Interest due in Australia . . 14,000,000 Pensions aud wages . . 32,000,000 making a total of Other expenses .. 9,000,000 The bill under consideration makes and salaries of public servants, interest duo in Australia on Government loans, the maternity allowance, invalid and old age pensions, war pensions, and bounties; but of the comparatively large sum of £25,000,000 due overseas for interest, contributions to the sinking fund, and exchange, no reduction is contemplated under the Government's proposals. We are informed that a great deal of money is available in the Old Country for investment, and would be readily lent to Australia if overseas investors had confidence in the Government. Under another bill, bondholders in Australia are asked to convert to a new stock, and sacrifice 2 per cent, of the interest that they have previously received; but no sacrifice is to be made by overseas bondholders. In my opinion,' 4 per cent, would be a profitable return to investors in Grea;t Britain, and they would not be harshly treated if they were required to make a sacrifice similar to that demanded of the Australian investor. There is said to be a plentiful supply of money available in Great Britain at rates as low as even 2 per cent., and, if it were the will of this Parliament to call upon British bondholders to accept a reduced rate of interest, a way could be found. The savings that the Treasurer proposes to effect under this measure are as follow:"" £ r n terest Invalid and old-age pensions War pensions .. Maternity allowance .. Salaries ""and wages Other expenditure .. 1,000,000 Increased taxation Total If all those savings are made, there will Paterson) that the bounty paid to the still be an excess of expenditure over galvanized iron industry in Australia revenue of between £4.000.000 and equals the payment of one ounce of gold £5,000,000.

The figures submitted to us by if it were given a chance. The gold the Prime Minister and the Treasurer bounty was the chance for which the inshow that the Commonwealth is rapidly dustry had long been waiting. Up to the drifting towards financial disaster. The banks sounded a true note when they warned the Government twelve months ago that a wrong course was being pursued. They have issued this warning on more than one occasion, and I consider that the memorandum sent to the Treasurer recently should be seriously heeded by the Government. No member of the House finds it palatable to agree to the reduction of wages, old-age pensions, war pensions and the maternity allowance, but we must face the plain facts. The Government is called upon to do a thing which is extremely unpopular, but in the best interests of the country. The present scheme, which has been arrived at by compromise, is the only proposal offered that will achieve the desired object. Those responsible for it are the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) the State Premiers, the Treasury officials of the Commonwealth and the States and leading economists. The plan is the result of the collective wisdom and concentrated efforts of those who took part in the recent conference in Melbourne over a period of three weeks, and we should give due weight to the outcome of their deliberations. Distasteful as the scheme may seem, we must accept it if we desire to save Australia. 2,475,000 I notice that the gold bounty is to be .. 1,825,000 reduced by half, whereas other bounties 1,291,000 are to be cut down by only 20 per cent. 225,000 If there is one primary industry in Aus1,800,000 tralia which, to my mind, deserves a .. 7,500,000 bounty, it is that of gold-mining, the encouragement of which would increase 10,116,000 employment. I have heard it said by the Deputy Leader of the Country party ( Mr per week to each man engaged in it. That Just as the present £630,000,000 worth of gold. The Victorian production alone has amounted to over £300,000,000, while the total amount of government assistance received by the Victorian gold-mining industry has amounted to only £313,000. Up to the present the gold-mining industry has not been given a chance. Western Australia has produced gold to the value of £160,000,000, while the industry has received from the Western Australian Government only £S00,000. This Parliament agreed to pay a bounty of £1 an ounce on gold won in excess of the average production for the previous three years, which was 480,000 oz. unless that amount is exceeded, the Government will not be called upon to pay one penny by way of bounty. The gold yield would have to be doubled before the Government would be called upon to pay a bounty of 10s. an ounce, because the bounty is to be distributed over the whole amount produced. There are vast areas of auriferous country in Australia which have never been explored, much less exhausted. What man is bold enough to say that there is not another golden mile to be found in Australia? From the East Coolgardie field in Western Australia, B which included the famous Golden Mile, £87,000,000 worth of gold was mined. During the regime of the present Government in one year no less than £27,000,000 in gold has been exported from Australia. If we had not, had that gold to meet our liabilities overseas,. Australia would have been in queer street long before now. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition declared that he would always meet with uncompromising hostility any proposal for a fiduciary currency; yet he voted for the bill authorizing the export of one-third of our gold reserve. With the export of that gold our present note issue becomes partly fiduciary. To that extent the honourable member has proved himself inconsistent. The Government's proposals are unpalatable. I support them, but I do so witb no pleasure. I compliment the soldiers' organizations on the way in which they have dealt with pensions, and upon the satisfactory compromise reached. Mr Jones. Australia has produced They have shown how the Government can save practically the full amount for which it planned without attacking any of the vital principles for which returned soldiers have always stood. The Government has agreed to accept the returned soldiers' proposals, and I am pleased that this satisfactory way out of the difficulty has been arrived at. I have never been able to see why those in receipt of large incomes should have by way of assistance the same right to claim the maternity allowance as have poorer people. Some persons, including the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney), have said that, if any distinction were made, it would place the stigma of pauperism Therefore, upon those who are permitted to draw the allowance. We should remember, however, that no one is allowed to draw the old-age pension who is not comparatively poor. If a man'or woman possesses property over a certain value, he or she is not qualified to draw a pension. If the stigma of pauperism is to apply in the case of maternity allowances, it must apply also in the case of old-age pensions. in the case of old-age pensions. the Premiers Conference is designed to bring about the financial and economic stability of Australia. I support it as an emergency measure, and trust that it will do what its framers hope for it-that it will save Australia from default, and lead to a return of national prosperity. refrained from speaking on the otlier bills introduced to give effect to the Government's plan because I wished them to be passed as quickly as possible so that the conversion of our indebtedness may be proceeded with. I have some comments to make upon this measure, however, particularly in regard to soldiers' pensions. I listened to the brilliantly delivered speech of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), which reminded me of many such speeches which we have heard from him, particularly when we were in Melbourne. Listening to him I could not but be reminded of the British submarine service during the war.

It is a wonderful publication, and gives intimate and interesting sidelights upon the submarine service. The policy of this Government reminds me of the method of navigation employed by the British submarine service-it is mostly by guess not by God. godly about these proposals. the help of God in times like these, and I say so with all reverence. -listening to the speech of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey), I could not help letting my mind go back over the last few months during which this Government has been in office, and reflecting upon the appalling spectacle now presented by the once mighty Federal Labour Party. A few months ago one would not have thought it possible ever to listen to such a speech as that delivered before Australia gets out of its present to-night by the honourable member for Bourke. He showed how dissension had come into the party and split it into various sections. Who is to blame for that? I have never been one to gibe at the other side of the House, but at this time one must face facts. We must go back to the time of the Niemeyer agreement, signed by the Prime Minister, on behalf of the people. Good or bad, he signed it for what it was worth, and then left this country and went overseas. Arrived at the other side, he made speeches in support of the signing of the agreement, speeches which were recorded here and there. He came back, and made another speech at Fremantle, and I wrote to him congratulating him upon it. From that moment, however, the party began to break up. The present Treasurer was reinstated; but I am not at liberty to discuss that now. There followed the dropping of the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Lyons), and the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton). The Government then began to slide. Conference after conference was held, as we have been told by the honourable member for Bourke. The trouble was brought about mainly by the Prime Minister, who failed to stand up to the Niemeyer agreement. The proposals embodied in that agreement did not go so far as tliose for which these bills provide. They did not include the reduction of interest, which we all wish to see brought about; many other proposals were put forward, and had they been adopted eighteen months ago our present difficulties might have been avoided. The present Government came into office at a time of very great difficulty, but instead of facing the situation resolutely at the beginning, it aggravated the trouble by pursuing a policy of drift. I do not think for one moment that the present bill is going to solve all our problems. Like the right While honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), I do not see how it is going to provide work for the unemployed. The bill may, no doubt, prove a stepping-stone to better things. out of the bill? but I believe it will be a good many years difficulties. The governments of Australia are practically bankrupt, and, like the right honourable member for North Sydney, I ask, what is the alternative to the Government's proposals? No alternative scheme has been advanced except that Australia should become bankrupt, and pay 9s. in the £1 of its obligations. We must do something to remedy the position. We must all endeavour to make a success of the conversion loan, and reduce interest rates. I hope that the banks will reduce overdraft rates, both for my own sake and for that of every one else. I trust, also, that the State Parliaments will pass legislation to reduce the interest rate on mortgages, so as to protect trustees. Otherwise they will be placed in a very awkward position. I made it quite clear to my party, when we were discussing the present bill, where I stood in regard to soldiers' pensions. I said that I reserved to myself the right to vote against a cut in soldiers' pensions. I think that we are all very glad that the soldiers' representatives have come to an arrangement which the Prime Minister, on behalf of the Government, has been able to accept.",53,Setup

Adelaide( Mr Yates) and I are in entire agreement that no money can compensate the digger for what he went through during the war; that his pension should be absolutely sacrosanct. This agreement preserves the position. There is to be no reduction in the pensions paid to the disabled digger himself, or to the orphan children of diggers, or to ""war widow's, returned nurses, widowed mothers of unmarried killed and died from war causes."" Certainly there is to be a cut in the pensions paid to other dependants, which is pretty rough. However, we must remember that this is a time practically of national bankruptcy. Civil servants and invalid and old-age pensioners have approached me saying, What about our pensions?"" My reply was, and still is, "" It is pretty rough that your pensions are to be touched, but you cannot place them on the same piano as those of the diggers."" There might have been no Civil Service or invalid and old age pensions but for the Australian I m perial Force. Those who have travelled France as I have know that the French people believe that but for Monash and the Australian Imperial Eorce, particularly at Amiens, Paris must have been taken. Inevitably, the channel ports would have followed. That opinion prevails even in ' the remote corners of France. When I was in that country on a motor tour about eighteen months ago, I arrived with my party at a country town and applied at a hotel for accommodation, which was refused, on the assumption that I was British. Unfortunately, the French hatred of the British is most 'pronounced. A French ambassador, with whom I was travelling, happened to mention that I came fr< m Australia. Directly the people i heard the word "" A u s t r a l i a t h e place was ours. Not one of us' wishes to see n cut made in old-age. or invalid pensions, or in the salaries and wages paid to civil servants. knows perfectly well that, if it is not done, the Government will be able to pay only 9s. in the f l , and that that will be a last payment. There is no alternative except a fiduciary note issue. honourable member say it. There are too many printers out of work. back at work. Our 400,000 unemployed would not be able to supply enough labour to keep the good old printing presses working fast enough. But that is not the way out. If it were the only alternative, it, would be ""God help Australia."" It is enough to recall the experience of France and Germany in that respect. These bills have come rather late in the day. I have always contended that it would be much better for governments, when they found themselves in the wrong, to admit it. Such is the position of the Prime Minister to-day. How often 1 have heard the right honourable gentleman say, to the cheers of members of his party, "" A cut in. pensions and wages! No. It is the last thing that I will do."" That has all gone by the board. Thf right honourable gentleman has at leas' been man enough, even though it is at this late stage, to retract. He knows that if be refuses to face the position the alternative is bankruptcy. One of the reasons why I support the Government in connection with these bills is that they represent a start to rehabilitate our country. I hope that the action has not. come too late. I consider that the proposal of the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) that these measures should be temporary, and should operate for not longer than three years, merits consideration. The position could then be reviewed. Let us hope that in three years' time the sun will again be shining, and that Australia will be on the road to prosperity. I am delighted with the wonderful spirit that has been manifested by the returned soldiers in this matter. Originally they stood rigidly to the claim that their pensions should be regarded",54,Setup

Unfortunately, there are many returned diggers among our unemployed who are not receiving pensions. It is a mental tonic to me to know that the spirit that existed in the Australian Imperial Force during the war persists to this day, and that our returned men are again the first, voluntarily, to assist Australia in her hour of need. In the circumstances I shall give this measure my support. [Quorum formed.] uot my intention to dilate upon the apostasy of the present coalition. To do so would be futile. The challenge has been repeatedly made that no alternative to this legislation can be advanced. I intend to submit one that is fool-proof, and to submit evidence.

Edwards, speaking on the Commonwealth Note Issue Bill when it The little island of Guernsey has a legislaand one can trace the operations in such a community with far less mental effort than all the paraphernalia tliat we have for the affairs of this Commonwealth, felt the need of a new market.

The market was built, the paper currency was retired, and the people had the satisfaction of securing the market buildings, and of obtaining from them a revenue for a ll time. I ask the critics of the paper currency to point to a flaw in that operation. I repeat that challenge in this House. Certain Americans, given to the consideration of this question, and applying to it keen minds and close scrutiny, have said tliat it would have been, possible for the Government of the United States of America, by the adoption of the same system, to have built the transcontinental railway, so that it would not have cost the American people one cent. A comparable enterprise in Australia is the east-west railway. A statement supplied by the Treasury to Mr Gahan, Commonwealth Commissioner of Bailways, explanatory of the interest charged upon the capital cost of constructing the east-west railway, the rolling-stock thereon, and all improvements, subsequent to the completion of construction, is as follows:Interest. Expenditure from Revenue£ £ Nil Expenditure from Loan1,205,651 (a) Covered by Treasury-bills and Inscribed Stock which was subsequently redeemed 14th December, 1920, from profits of the Australian Notes Account 3,428,519 NU .

152,Mr Yates (Adelaide) [9.40],"It isAs the treasury-bills aud inscribed stock, which covered the expenditure of £3,428,519, were redeemed from tlie profits of the Australian note issue in 1920, this expenditure, for such schemes, but only to inquire how suffiinterest purposes, was deemed to have been made from revenue, and therefore no interest has been charged thereon. Interest on tbe amount of £808,020 expended since 1918, has been allocated from year to year on a proportionate basis in accordance with the actual interest paid each year on the loans concerned. The amount of £128,000, representing the total amount, is au approximate estimate of the debit for the current financial year. These facts cannot be controverted, as they are stated by the Commonwealth Treasury. charged interest, as is done in every business undertaking, at 3£ per cent, per annum from 1917, the year in which the line was completed, on the total sum made available from revenue and the notes account, namely, £6,969,542, the whole of the amount advanced would have been recovered in the form of interest by therefore, like the Guernsey markets, would have been bought and paid for by the nation, out of its owu resources. It was not necessary to borrow or load the people with an interminable debt. This fact, based on the evidence of the Commonwealth Treasury, completely confounds all the talk that such a policy would be inflation, and unwise financing. The process could be repeated at the present time for the absorption of our unemployed in industry, without printing a single new note, as soon as we have the men with the necessary courage to do the job. There is no need to sacrifice the old-age pensioners or disgrace the name of Australia by the repudiation of our obligations to the returned soldiers. Too long have Ave been dominated by the financial oligarchy which thrives and fattens on the thrift and industry of the nation, regardless of the misery and degradation which the present monetary system produces. The application of the principle I have enunciated to all Government plans is the clear and only way out of the present morass. That is my alternative, and my slogan is ""Do it now."" That this alternative is possible is recognized by the experts who recommended the present crippling proposals, for they say in paragraph 20 of their reportIt may be possible to devise and carry out positive constructive plans for the relief of Mr Yates. unemployment, though all such schemes would require heavy capital expenditure. It is not the business of this committee to cousider cient funds can be obtained to meet the accepted obligation of governments to provide sustenance. This clearly reveals the fact that the experts were co-opted, not to devise and carry out positive, constructive plans for the relief of unemployment, but to use all their ingenuity and ability to safeguard the monetary oligarchy which at present governs Australia. Had the Commonwealth to vote against this bill, and I shall briefly explain my reasons for so doing. EarlierI indicated that whilst I would support the bill providing for the conversion of the £556,000,000 of internal public debt, I would oppose that part of the rehabilitation scheme which involves the reduction of pensions, wages and salaries. This measure is entitled "" A bill for an act 1945. The east-west railway, to make the necessary provision for carrying out a plan agreed on by the Commonwealth and the States for meeting the grave financial emergency existing in Australia, re-establishing financial stability, and restoring industrial and general prosperity."" I agree with those honourable members who have said that the bill will not achieve the purposes stated in the title; it is more likely to do the reverse of what the authors of it evidently expect. It contains provision for the reduction of old-age, invalid and war pensions, Public Service salaries and wages, and the maternity bonus. The measure is divided into nine parts, namely, PartI . , preliminary; Part II . , salaries and wages; Part III . , pensions to officers; Part IV., maternity allowances; Part V., invalid and old-age pensions; Part VI . , war pensions; Part VII . , judiciary; Part VIII . , bounties; and Part IX . , miscellaneous. With some provisions of the bill one can agree, but I maintain that rehabilitation could have been brought about by other means without resort to the drastic expedient of cutting pensions. It is significant that in this debate members of the Opposition, who, in season and out of season, have opposed the Labour party and resisted its every proposal, have almost fallen over themselves in their anxiety to support the Government and its present financial policy.",56,Setup
153,Mr Lacey (Grey) [9.55],"I intenddestroy the Labour party. honourable member for Brisbane( Mr D. Cameron), one of the most highly esteemed members of the House, ""who never speaks with his tongue in his cheek, stated yesterday that any party putting forward this plan would incur popular disfavour, and would be lucky to survive a general election. That, perhaps, explains the reason why so many members who are usually opposed to the Labour party are to-day supporting the Government. fact that a Labour Government has been induced to do what its opponents have always believed should be done, but what they had not the courage to do, because of the political consequences. The attitude of the press also has changed from violent opposition to warm support of the Government, and the Opposition may well congratulate itself upon the success which has attended its efforts and the propaganda of the newspapers supporting JI during the last eight or nine months. Admittedly in times of depression governments must take action that would not be justified in ordinary circumstances, but how often have we boasted that Australia, because of its productivity and recuperative powers would escape the depression which in older countries was the aftermath of the war? I believe that our present troubles are largely due to maladministration by past governments, particularly the Bruce Page Ministry. It held office during bountiful years, and handled larger incomes than were available to any previous governments. It also borrowed more than any of its predecessors. In addition, millions of pounds of manufactured goods were imported from abroad, and although this created unemployment, the Government at the same time encouraged immigration. The members of the Opposition, remnants of the Bruce Page following, who are now allied with the Government in the advocacy of this financial rehabilitation scheme, have never stood for the welfare of the masses. They regarded the industrial and economic standards of Australia as too high, and some of the Nationalist leaders have been bold enough to say that they should be reduced. The present Agent-General for South Australia, Sir Henry Barwell, declared some years ago that the standards of the Australian people were too high, and that if the workers would not voluntarily submit to a reduction of wages and working conditions, he would do everything possible'to impose'ittupon them. Undoubtedly the conservative minds among the Opposition are of that opinion to-day. Few of them would be prepared to reduce wages and pensions, for fear of the political consequences; but this Government, unfortunately for itself, has come to their aid. Honourable members Well may they gloat over the opposite may well gloat over the fact that, through the agency of the press, and the propaganda that it has broadcast throughout the country, they have been able to force the Government to take an action which they desired, but had not themselves, when in office, the courage to take. [Quorum formed-] It is true, as stated by Mr Bruce in a speech delivered in Melbourne only last week, that the Bruce-Page Government was responsible for increasing the old age and invalid pensions twice during its regime; but those increases were in proportion with the increase in the cost of living at that time. That Government increased, not only pensions, but also bounties paid to various industries, in an effort to retain possession of the treasury bench. To-day we are suffering the consequences of the reckless and extravagant policy pursued by the Bruce-Page Government. The Labour party stands, not for a reduction, but for an increase in old-age and invalid pensions. The platform of the Labour party contains a plank to that effect, and at the last election we were returned with an overwhelming majority. ; ants are evidently in the planks of that platform. that the rats have deserted the ship of state, but that craft will weather this storm as it has weathered others.

I shall vigorously resist the proposal for a reduction from 5s. 6d. to 4s. 6d. per week in the pension payable to the inmates of benevolent institutions. This money is used by these old people for the purchase of comforts not provided by the institutions in which they live. Many of these people are pioneers, who spent their working lives in trying to improve conditions in this country, and it is deplorable that the Government should seek to reduce their income by Is. a week. A number of honourable members have referred to the injustice of reducing war pensions. In my opinion there is even greater justification for a protest against the reduction of the particular pension to which I have referred. I am glad that steps were taken to mitigate the hardship which these proposals, in their original form, would have placed upon returned soldiers; but consideration should also be given to the plight of our old-age and invalid pensioners. Before even considering the reduction of pensions) the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers should have made heavy reductions in some of the high salaries that are being paid in Australia. People in receipt of these high salaries could suffer a reduction of 50 per cent, with less inconvenience than our pensioners could suffer a reduction of 6d. But even then the budget of The conference should also have devised ways and means of eliminating duplication in the Public Service. The office of State Agent-General should be abolished, and the High Commissioner for the Commonwealth made responsible for the discharge of the duties which the Agents-General are at present performing. Sufficient money could be saved by the elimination of duplication of parliarender unnecessary the reduction of old-age, invalid and war pensions. 1 believe that there would have been no necessity to consider the possibility of default while investigations of this kind were being made. In replying this afternoon to an honourable member who referred to the extravagant expenditure on Parliaments in Australia, the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) quoted the cost of the Oommonwealth Parliament, but neglected to mention how much it cost to maintain the Parliaments of the six States. Doubtless the conference deliberately overlooked this point, because practically all the members of it were confirmed "" State righters"". Last year it was elicited in reply to a question in this House that it cost the Commonwealth Government £37,806 to maintain the office of Governor General. An expenditure of this nature is incurred in all the States for the maintenance of the office of Governor. There are possibilities of great economies in this direction which should have been explored before the reduction of pensions was even suggested. The fact of the matter is that the bankers have been able to dictate the terms under which they will assist the Government of this country.

Surely no one will contend that the banks should have the right to dictate the policy of the various governments of Australia. It is well known that for many months the banks have sought to bring about a reduction of old-age, invalid, and war pensions, and also a reduction in the expenditure on various social services, and now they have succeeded in achieving their objective. It appears to me that this Government has surrendered to the banks.

Honourable members should give some consideration to the position in which the Labour movement, the caucus, and the Government have been put. Some time ago the Government introduced a bill for the issue of fiduciary notes to the extent of £18,000,000. from that proposal. ber for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) ran away from it by deserting his party. [Quorum formed.] The Fiduciary Notes Bill was defeated in another place. job, too. proposed to use £6,000,000 worth of the fiduciary notes to assist the farmers, and the remaining £12,000,000 to assist the unemployed. But it was prevented from doing so. It recognized, of course, that fiduciary notes could not be issued to an unlimited extent, but honourable members opposite argued that even the issue of a controlled fiduciary currency would .ruin the country. unanimous support, even from our economists. Professor Giblin, for instance, published a number of articles in the Melbourne Herald some time ago in which he pointed out that the release of credits by means of a controlled fiduciary note issue would afford quick relief to the country. But the Government was not permitted to give effect to this policy. We then had to face the possibility of default. The Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) and the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) both assured us that unless steps were taken speedily to rectify our financial position, default was inevitable. I accepted the judgment of these honourable gentleman, because they were in a better position than any one else in the community to form one. A conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers was then held. I remind honourable members that a Labour Prime Minister and two Labour Premiers were included in the personnel of the conference. There is a vast difference between the proposals of the present Opposition and those of the Government. Even when the Cabinet met the conference, and the scheme for financial rehabilitation was submitted by the economists, no provision was made for the reduction of the interest of bondholders. When the members of the Ministry, as Labour men, suggested that such a reduction was just as necessary as the proposed reduction of wages, we were met by the argument that once real wages were reduced 10 per cent., the interest rate would automatically fall. We felt that we could not accept that assurance, and the big work that the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) and the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore) accomplished at the conference was in inducing it to agree to a reduction of the interest on the internal debt of £556,000,000. Those on the Government side who are honestly, I believe, opposed to the present proposals have utterly failed to submit an alternative scheme. To-morrow, if this plan had not been brought forward, Australia would have had to default, and a large number of employees would have suffered immediately.

170,Mr A. Green,"I do not propose to the transcontinental railway as an example of what could be done from the profits of the note issue. must know, however, that when that railway was built the Commonwealth Bank had just come into existence, and was replacing with its notes the currency of the private banks. Even at that time, those Commonwealth notes were described as "" Fisher's flimsies"" by the tories, of whom the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Parkhill) is a direct descendant. They pretended to believe that blue ruin would be brought to this country if authority to issue banknotes were handed over to the Commonwealth Bank. The tories at that time were seeking to protect the interests of the private banks, which had a great deal of political pull then as now. It must be clear, however, that if the finances of the countrj are in the hands of private banks when another depression strikes the country, we shall find ourselves in the same difficulty as Ave are now. None of us likes having to support the proposal for a reduction of old-age pensions."" It needs some courage for a Labour man to go into his electorate, and tell oldcan at least watch over the interests of age pensioners that he voted to reduce their pensions. Probably every honourable member in this House has assisted hundreds of old people to obtain their pensions, and.the task we have now before us is a very distasteful one. matter, however, of performing the task, or of ietting Australia down, and I am prepared to take my courage in my hands, and tell the people the truth. We have only to study the cost of living figures to realize that 17s. 6d. is the present equivalent of £1 a few years ago. Dethridge said when he reduced the basic wage. may have said that; but no one can dispute the figures I have quoted. bonorable member for Grey( Mr Lacey) said that if we had lopped the tall poppies it might not have been necessary to demand these sacrifices of other sections of the community. I remind honourable members that all these schemes have been trotted out beforo. present proposal was before the party, and was carried by 26 votes to 13, there was a long discussion, and every He man had an opportunity to speak. The arguments which have been advanced in this chamber against the scheme were advanced then, and were demolished by the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore), who showed that if public servants now in receipt of £1,000 a year and more were paid nothing at all, the amount saved would add only jj-d. to every old-age pension. in the Public Service who receives more than £500 a year it would save only £800,000 a year. not believe for a moment that the Government's plan will provide work for a great many men, but it has prevented Australia from becoming bankrupt. I believe that it is better for this Governto carry out the plan-and it is more distasteful to this Government than it would be to another-tha n to hand over the task to the party opposite, which would make a welter of it. This Government the workers to some extent. do it ! It is a ber for Warringah is just as hungry for office as is the next-man. Prosperity will not be restored to Australia until there is an improvement in the price of our primary products. Times will continue to be bad until the price of wool and wheat goes up. I am old enough to remember the great slump of 1892 and 1893, which had many features in common with the present depression. If any honourable members feel that they are called upon to vote against a reduction of old-age pensions, they are, I suppose, entitled to do so; but if for that reason The they vote against the Government's plan, they should remember that they are voting against a reduction in interest which will mean a saving of £2,500,000 to the primary producers. Private debt in the Commonwealth is probably £150;000,000; the reduction of 4s. 6d. in the £1 in the When the interest on private mortgages will amount to about £2,500,000 or more a year, and",62,Pabkhill W H A T Market Proposition Was A Sound One And

Moreover, we propose to reduce to 4 per cent, the interest on our internal indebtedness, amounting to £556,000,000, and thereby save £6,500,000 a year. Honourable members should remember this when they declare themselves to bo advanced Labourites, who will not agree to the reduction of old-age pensions or salaries. Some honourable members say that they will agree to the reduction of old-age pensions and widows' pensions, but will not agree to the reduction of soldiers' pensions. At this time, however, there is need for sacrifice all round. Under no circumstances should Australia be allowed to default. diately involve the throwing out of work of another 100,000 persons.
