Ter And Attorney","General) [2.31] -(B y leave) I desire to make a statement on a matter of urgent public importance. I intimated yesterday, in reply to a question put to me, I think, by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), and later in the evening, by way of in terjection, when the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) was speaking, that I proposed to-day to make a statement in regard to the Washington Disarmament Conference. intend to do. A t the conclusion of my remarks I shall submit a motion for the printing of a paper in order that honorahle members may have an opportunity to offer what observations they see f it on the suggestions I shall make. I think I should inform the House that when the Imperial Conference had reached the stage in its deliberations when it was quite obvious that the Government of the United States of America did not favour the suggestion of a preliminary Pacific Conference, ancl when, therefore, it appeared clear that all such questions would, have to be postponed until the Washington Disarmament Conference was held, it was agreed that the British Government should represent the whole of the Empire at that Conference. That was the position when I returned mained the position u n t i l late on Tuesday last, when I received certain cablegrams, the substance of which I propose to read. These cablegrams have changed the position entirely. which I gave to the press, I stated that I was not favorable to a representation of Australia in a. capacity which would exclude, its representatives from the Conference. I cannot do better now than read forthwith the cables I have received from the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. I will omit such portions of these cables as it appears to me 6 October, 1921. it would be improper, in the in terests of the State, to publish. I have had an opportunity of discussing the matter w i th the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and with the Leader of the Country party ( D r . Earle Page), and have shown those gentlemen the whole of the correspondence. They agree with me that the parts which I propose to omit are not material to the matter I am bringing under the notice of the House, and that, in the interests of the Empire, and also of the Washington Disarmament Conference, they ought not to be read. The first cablegram is from Mr Lloyd George, and is in the following terms: I am very anxious that the stand-jjo'iic of Australia and New Zealand should be well represented on the British Empire delegation at the Washington Conference. Your personal presence is, ia my opinion, highly desirable, and I urge you to go if by any ""means possible. Failing this, a single delegate may serve as representative of both Australia and New ZeaThisI now land, as your stand-points are identical. I should greatly prefer you going yourself; but if you cannot, please consult Massey, and tell me what you propose. We will, of course, also welcome any officer whom you may wish to send to serve on the secretariat. cable ? ber, and reached here on 4th October, which was the day before yesterday. There are two cablegrams which I have this moment received. They are unopened in my pocket. I have not yet had an opportunity to read thein. When, or before, I sit down, I shall read them.. I do not know whether they bear on this matter or not. If I find that they do I shall ask my honourable friends, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Counto Australia, and it retry party, to discuss them w i th me, and if necessary I have no doubt that the House w ill permit me to supplement my remarks in order that I may place honourable members in possession of the facts. In an interview I propose to read the whole of the cablegrams first, and then to offer some"" observations as to the policy of the Government, and the reasons which have, actuated us in adopting that policy. The second cablegram came on the same day as the one which I have read, but two",19,Setup

4,Mr Hughes,"It is dated 3rd Octoor three hours later. This is a copy of a cable from the Foreign Secretary of Great Britain to the British Ambassador at WashingtonWhat general procedure do the United States Government contemplate tor the Conference or Conferences? Is Disarmament Conference to follow Pacific Conference or vice versa? Or are they to be held simultaneously by detachments of National Delegations sent to Washington? Do United States Government propose to discuss air as well as naval and military armaments ? I omit certain portions of the telegram which the Leaders of the Opposition and the Country party agree w i th me are not material to this discussion, and in the interests of State ought not to be disclosed. The cable proceedsWe leave to the sole discretion of the United States Government what Powers are to be invited. The Prime Minister deeply regrets his inability to attend any Conference at Washington this year, as there are so many questions of urgent importance requiring his presence in England. We may wish to send up to six representatives, and will let the United States Government have the names as soon as possible, but must first communicate with Dominions and India.

While not prepared to represent the Dominions His Majesty's Government would prefer British Delegation to include men with special knowledge of Canadian, Australasian, and Indian points of view. As regards representation of Great Britain, I greatly regret that it will be impossible for agreeable that Australia and New Zeame to attend in person as Conference is certain to be prolonged. So many questions of urgent importance require my presence in England that I have been obliged to forego any serious absence this winter. On account of unsettled .Irish situation and unemployment problem inevitably entailing widespread privation and for other reasons, I feel very strongly that my presence in this country will be necesreply to suggestion contained in your telesary without any considerable interval such, as would be required for effective participation in discussions at Washington.

I had received and asking h i m his intentions and whether as a fact he would be land should be represented by the one individual. I informed h i m that it was the intention of Australia to be represented. He replied on the 5th OctoberYour telegram 4th October, have received similar telegram and Cabinet giving'the matter full consideration before I can give definite gram. Would be glad to be informed as soon as possible as to the name proposed Commonwealth representative. It is possible New Zealand may send representative, although it is quite impossible for me to go personally. Referring to my telegram of 3rd October, Washington Conference, His Majesty's GovernI tative and staff. In consequence of pressure of accommodation in Washington, His Majesty's Ambassador has been instructed provisionally to reserve accommodation likely to be required in same hotel as British Delegation. The House is now in possession of all the material information that has reached the Government, and honourable members will quite appreciate that the British Government have acted in this, as they have acted, I think I may fairly say, in all matters for many years past, with every regard for the welfare and interest of the Dominions. I stated in my opening remarks that when it became on the face of it impossible for the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand to attend a Pacific Conference, through the opposition of the American Government to a separate Conference on that subject, it was agreed that the British Government, which was as the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) correctly surmised, thoroughly seized of our ideas in regard to all matters affecting the Pacific, might represent us at Washington if the Parliament decided not to send a representative. cablegrams which I have rea'd show that Upon mature consideration the British Government think that the Empire delegation would be greatly strengthened if it iucluded direct representatives of the Dominions, or of some of them. Honourable members will notice that it is suggested that Australasia should have a representative. Mr Lloyd George, in his telegram, says that the interests of Australia and -New Zealand in this matter are identical. Por all practical purposes we may accept that view as a fair presentation of the position. In any case, the point is not material, because it is the intention of the Commonwealth Government to suggest to the House thafc Australia shall send a representative. In the face of the cablegrams I have read x there -is clearly but one thing that this Parliament can do, and thafc is to accept the invitation to send a delegate: the Government have resolved to do. Let me now say a few words on the question of representation. I think that the representative of Australia should be one who is responsible to the people; he should go from this Parliament instructed-for that is the proper term,-as to whab the people of this country conceive to be that policy which will best conserve their interests, and at the conclusion of his mission he should come back and report to this Parliament of which, he is a responsible member, and then it will be for this Parliament and the people of Australia to express approval or disapproval of what he has done. It has been suggested that we should take advantage of representation of quite a different kind, and the names of some gentlemen, who are not members of this Parliament, and who are not even citizens of Australia, have been mentioned. The discussion of such a matter is very odious, because, when not one of the gentlemen named has sought the position, it would be certainly most distasteful to canvass his fitness to represent this country. I do not propose to do so, but as certain names have been mentioned it t is only right that I should say that, so far as the personal qualifications of these gentlemen are concerned, I know of no men, outside this Parliament and Australia, better fitted to re1 present this country. Buti n my opinion But the an Australian and a member of this Parliament ought to represent this country at Washington. If the House agrees with me it will support the Government decision. Those charged with the duty of governing this country consider that a Minister should go to Washington. But before I mention the name of the gentleman chosen by the Government, let me say one or two words in regard to the Washington Conference, and some of the circumstances surrounding it. The world to-day is distracted and neurotic. Bleeding from a hundred wounds, it turns hither and thither seeking comfort and consolation, and asking piteously, ""Is this butchery, this barbarism, to go on for ever, is there no hope for civilization, are we always to have recourse to the arbitrament of the sword? Is there to be imposed on mankind for all time the everThat increasing and awful burden of armaments? Is the very flower of mankind always to be culled for this dreadful purpose ? May we not hope we have learned a little from the fearful experience gained in the late war, and that the wisdom of the great men of the world will devise some means by which quarrels and international disputes may be adjusted other than by force of arms?"" I think that that is the desire of the great mass of the people of the world. I do not know whether honourable members realize it or not, but it is a fact that tbe burden of armaments to-day is from two to four times as great as it was before the war. Mr .CoNsrorNE -And that is why you ought to cut down your expenditure on militarism. twenty-four times what it was before the war. I do not know whether the honourable member has ever read Dickens; when satiated with the perusal of those bloody litanies upon which he battens he might find some consolation and recreation in the pages of that author. He might learn something about Mr Dick who could never get King Charles' head out of his mind or thoughts. Nothing is said in this House but in some way the honourable member for Barrier manages to translate it into the terms of Soviet Russia. I believe that the overwhelming bulk of mankind support the view which I have set out, but it is no rose-strewn path; there is no easy way. The Prime Minister of Great Britain conceives, as I do, that it is idle to talk about peace or disarmament, or limitation of armaments, until the causes of armaments are removed ; and these causes, so far as we are concerned, and, indeed, the future of the world is concerned, lie in the Pacific problems. ' The settlement of these problems will be no easy matter. Mr the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) Lloyd George is quite right in "" believing that the deliberations of the Washington Conference will over very many months. Lord Northcliffe told me on the day he left Melbourne that he had taken a house in Washington for twelve months for his staff. It is clear that this business will take a long time. It is work to which the best of men can with advantage devote themselves in the interests of their fellow men; but it is not a task that can be assumed by any one as something incidental to the performance of his ordinary duties. represents Australia will have to devote his. whole time to this great business, and he may be absent from us for many months. The Deputy Leaden of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), and the Leader of the Country party (Dr. Earle Page), have seen the contents of these cablegrams which I have not mentioned. They know that they indicate some of the difficulties, which I do not say axe insuperable, but which make it abundantly clear that the nations of the world will be setting themselves no easy task at this Conference. Australia has more to lose than any other country. It has more at stake, A continent with a population of 5,500,000 is naturally -more interested than, any other country in a problem which has for its origin the position of Japan, with 70,000,000 people occupying a narrow strip of land which does not exceed in total area the islands handed to us under the Mandate from the League of Nations. We have ideals which the world does not understand, and with which it may not sympathize. It is essential, therefore, that our views should be set out clearly at this Conference. The Government have considered the matter very carefully, and recommend to this House that the Commonwealth should send a representative, and that Senator Pearce should be that representative. It has been suggested that I myself should go; but that has been found to be absolutely impossible; and other members of the Ministry, who would have made admirable representatives of Australia at Washington, are, for various reasons, disinclined, or unable, to go. The Government, therefore, announce their acceptance of the invitation, and, subject to the approval of this House, submit the name of as their representative. In order to give honourable members an opportunity to disextend cuss the whole subject-matter, I move That the cablegram (from the Secretary of State for the Colonies, dated 3rd October, 1921, conveying the invitation of the Prime Minister of Great Britain to Australia to be represented on the British Empire Delegation at the Washington Conference) he printed. of order. The Prime Minister has delivered, three speeches upon international The man .who affairs. I wish .to know whether, if this motion is proceeded with, honourable members will be confined entirely to the discussion of the last speech of the three, and so be precluded from dealing with any of the subject-matters within the scope of the other two. son) -The only matter before the House at present is a motion to the effect that",19,Washing Ton Disarmamen T Conference Australia N Repbesentation

7,Mr Speaker (Hon. Sir Elliot John,"the cablegram which has been read by the Prime Minister should be printed. It will be only iu respect of the matters to which this cablegram relates that discussion will be in order. There is already a discussion proceeding upon another motion, which, however, is entirely separate from that now before the House. desire to state at the outset that, with the Leader of the Country party, the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), I perused the cablegrams which have been read by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), and, in fairness to the right honourable gentleman, I must add that the few points which have been omitted in the course of reading the cables are not of any material importance in relation to the subject under review. MT. WATT -Did the honourable member see any cablegrams dated prior to the 3rd October? that point i i i the course of my remarks. I emphasize, in justice to the Prime Minister, that the honourable member for Cowper and myself agreed that anything which has been omitted from the reading of the cablegrams was not material to the matters under discussion; and, further, that it was necessary that the points which have been left out should not be published. The Washington Conference will be a very important one-reall y much more important than honourable members and the country generally had been led to believe, right up to the moment of the speecli which has just been delivered by the Prime Minister. Prior to this day, no one possessed any specific knowledge concerning the work proposed to be undertaken at the Conference. Now, however, the actual details of the agenda paper have been made known. I find that among the subjects which will arise for consideration is the question of the limitation of armaments. No more vitally important question could come up for discussion at any international gathering. Upon the agenda-paper, also, there is the matter of Naval defence. This, also, is vital to ourselves and to the Empire, seeing that it involves the future naval strengths of the Fleets of the nations. I need scarcely stress the all-important nature of this subject, particularly to Australia, in relation to Pacific affairs. One other item has to do with the limitation of land armaments. In this regard the question is as to what sums of money should be expended by each of the various nations in connection with their land defences. Still another crucial feature of the agenda, paper relates to the mandated islands. I need not stress the fact of Australia being deeply involved in this subject. In view of the nature of the agenda paper-o r of so much of it, at any rate, as I have just indicated-it becomes absolutely essential that Australia should be fully and amply represented at the Washington Conference. It is passing strange that the question of representation should have been before the delegates to the Conference recently held in Great Britain, and that Australia's representative should have had so little to say concerning the question of our representation at Washington. Honourable members have now been informed that, at the Imperial Conference, this factor of Dominion representation at Washington was considered, and thafc a decision was reached that the direct representatives"" of Great Britain be regarded as sufficient and adequate to look after the interests of all parts of the Empire. In other words, the Imperial Conference, from the inception of President Harding's proposal, decided that there was no need for the Dominions to be directly represented, but that the delegates appointed hy Great Britain would be capable of safeguarding Dominion interests. I can only say that Australia's representative at the Imperial Conference must have acquiesced in that decision. able member knows that the very opposite is true. member ought to know. Prime Minister that up to this very moment I am in the dark concerning, whether such is the case or not.. As a matter of fact, it is very difficult for honourable members to form any accurate opinion, for the reason that they have only been furnished with a report dealing with one side of the business transacted.",22,Washing Ton Disarmamen T Conference Australia N Repbesentation

The whole Conference was strongly of opinion that Australia and New Zealand ought to be represented at Washington; and, literally for months, we strove to secure representation. It was not until the TJnited States of America slammed the door in our faces that we relinquished the effort. thing new. Honourable members and the country have not previously been provided with this specific information. The disclosure just made iby the Prime Minister affords justification for my remarks, Empire authorities into pressing forcibly and those of other honourable members, concerning the inadequacy and one-sided nature of fihe reports which have been furnished by the Commonwealth representative at the Imperial Conference. I feel, at any rate, that my criticismwhether it may have been unconsciously unfair to the Prime Minister or nothas been amply vindicated, in that it has succeeded in drawing from the right honourable gentleman the additional information just furnished. The Prime Minister now states that only after strenuous efforts was it reluctantly reanobody can say that the Government lized that the Dominions could not secure direct representation, and that, indeed, the door was slammed in our faces. nate expression just at this stage, no matcussed. ter who may use it. a time when every possible effort should have been concentrated upon securing representation, it was when the invitation was first issued and when the representaas we find it now.

If portant matter of this kind, would be the attitude adopted by the Prime Minisprepared to sink all party considerations ter at the Imperial Conference at this in the interests of, not only the welfare vital moment amounted to anything less of Australia, but of the future peace of than that of a man making a supreme the world.

Empire and Dominion representation. Where are we to-day ? A t this late moment, when weeks have elapsed, and when the Commonwealth representative has returned to Australia, and not until this moment, is something definite done. Not until the Prime Minister has returned and has discovered that there is a great public outcry because Australia is not to be directly represented at the Conference-dejspit e the vital nature of its agenda paperhave efforts been made to galvanize the for Dominion representation. I ask honourable members to note the dates upon these cablegrams. That upon the first of them is the 3rd October, and the others are dated the 4th and 5th October. Thus is indicated the significant fact that it was only during the past week-end, and after it had been found that the feeling throughout Australia was so intense against the inaction of the Government, that every effort was made to have Australia represented., Looking at the.facta as I think I have fairly presented them, have not been recreant to the interests of this country in connection with the Washington Conference, where matters of no cable; I am dealing with the position had desired such representation ?

What the agenda of the Conference was, bat now that the Prime Minister has informed us, we see the importance of it. What are we going to do? I said yesterday"" that I believed all parties should be> represented at this Conference, and I adhere to that view. I go further, and say that all parties, not only here, but in all the nations that are concerned in' the Conference, should be there represented. If we are to bring about disarmament and the peace of the world, all parties in the world should be taken into confidence. Those now in power should not have all the controlling influence; this is a non-party business, and all peoples should be represented in its consideration. In countries which send their Prime Ministers to represent them tbere may be minorities which, in the absence of any representation, will not be prepared to accept the conclusions of the Conference. What are we here going to do? I have not a word to say against Senator Pearce personally, but I venture to say that the Government could not have picked a more unsuitable man for the job. Why do I say that? are in Opposition? the honourable member should know that it is a bad thing to jump to conclusions too quickly. so three years ago. with the. position as it is presented now. I say that Senator Pearce is a most unsuitable man for the position, because, as the Prime Minister How many cables, I stated, it is necessary that the person sent should represent this Parliament; and I ask whatfcheSenate has to do with money matters and these other questions of great importance that have to be discussed at the Conference. This Chamber represents the people, and yet it is proposed to send a senator. Will Senator Pearce be able to explain to us in this Chamber on his return whafc has been done afc the Conference ? Honourable members know that he will not, and, so far as we here are concerned, we might just as well have had Mr Justice Isaacs, or some other' person as the representative of this country. This Chamber should be repreWe did not even know sented at the Conference, and by more than one representative, for this is the .Chamber which controls the matters whioh are to be discussed. I believe that every honourable member here, in common with fche people of Australia as a whole, is in favour of disarmament and peace. It is desired that the wasteful expenditure caused by war and danger of war shall be reduced, and yet we are sending to Washington the Minister who is pestering us to give him as much money to spend on armaments and defence as he spent last year. I have no doubt thafc Senator Pearce, as Minister for Defence, asked for much larger votes than appear on fche Estimates, and that the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) cut down the honourable gentleman's figures. This is the only member of this Parliament,, apparently, whom the Government, can find to represent this country at Washington, although the Imperial Conference that has just been held pales into insignificance compared with the Conference to be held afc Washington.

If I had not charged the Government with having transmitted cables during the last day or so it* would have been thought not only by honourable, members on this side, but by honourable members generally, that some one -had been communicating with the British Government. What other conclusion could have been arrived at ? The Prime Minister now says that no cables have recently been transmitted to .the British Government on this matter, and I am prepared to accept his word. Isi t to be assumed then that there have been no communications with the British authorities to induce them to send the cables mentioned? doubt the Prime Minister's statement; but it seems' strange that the British Government should have acted so spontaneously in a matter which, affects us so vitally. I think it would appear to the average man that the British Prime Minister( Mr Lloyd George) would not have sent such an intimation without some request. An honourable member suggests, by interjection, that probably Lord Northcliffe has been responsible for placing certain views before the British Government. do that. able member for Melbourne Ports( Mr thing transpires at that Conference which Mathews) is out of order. tion I take in regard to this matter. I do not know what views other honourable members hold. The Minister for Defence [467] (Senator Pearce) who has been appointed to represent Australia at the Washington Conference is the most unsuitable person that could have been selected, because, in the first place, he is not a member of this House, and therefore cannot report to this branch of the Legislature on his return. On the other hand, the Minister for Defence does not give one the impression of being in favour of disarmament, because he is endeavouring to commit this country to unnecessary expenditure in tb.9 matter of military defence, notwithstanding that such a policy is contrary to the views of the majority of the people Of the Commonwealth. In the circumstances, the Government could not have It appears that only by made a.more unwise selection. Our desire is to place on record our views in regard to this matter. We are in favour of everything possible being done to bring about the peace of the world, either through the League of Nations or through the medium of the Washington Conference or any other similar gathering. We cannot see the possibility of the Disarmament Conference being a success unless it comprises representatives of the different political parties throughout the world. I , therefore, move as an amendmentThat the motion he amended by omitting all the words after ""That"", with a view to inserting in lieu thereof the following words :"" in the opinion of this House the Disarmament Conference to be held at Washington is of vital importance, and that Australia should be represented thereat by a representative of the Government and each of the other parties, and that the decisions of such Conference should be subject to ratification by this Parliament."" I have moved that amendment because it embodies all I have been contending for, and it is not now too late to deal with the matter in the way I have suggested. Every one in this Chamber is desirous of the Disarmament Conference being a success, and, that being so, questions relating to America, Japan, and Australia, and the Pacific policy generally, should be no right to considered by the representatives of all parties in order that the interests of the people may be fully protected. If anyis inimical to the best interests of Australia, and it is permitted to pass owing to inadequate representation, this Parliament, and this Parliament only, will be responsible.",26,Washing Ton Disarmamen T Conference Australia N Repbesentation

53,Mr Charlton,"That is the posisecond the amendment moved by tbe Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr later. The world has just passed through Charlton). mediately commend itself to the members of this Chamber. The decisions of the Disarmament Conference to be held at Washington will have a far-reaching effect upon the whole of the civilized world, and Australia in particular. We bave to remember in connection with the Conference that one particular party only is not involved in the questions to be disliminary Conference to deal with Pacific cussed, and the decisions arrived at, because all parties and all sections are vitference was doomed to failure.

The Deputy Leader of the, Opposition has rightly referred to the attitude of the Prime Minister( Mr portance. We now have him saying that Hughes) as one. of indifference. Honourable members will remember the speech the right honourable gentleman delivered when he returned from London last week, in whicli he threw cold water upon the Washington Conference. casion he informed us that the gathering was of no consequence, and that it could not do anything in the direction of solving the great problems until the position i;i the Pacific had been settled. He said the Conference would be of no use. It would appear, from the demeanour of some honourable members at this juncture, that they are not particularly concerned about the workers being represented, and thus having an opportunity of expressing their opinions. If that is the attitude to be adopted, the workers will know how to deal with the matter themselves. Their representations cannot be ignored at any gathering dealing with the vital question of disarmament, and when we submit a plea in the interests of those who have to fight wars, we should be treated with respect. other sections of the community that they are playing with fire if they treat our suggestions lightly. of that before. able member will probably hear more It is one that should ima tremendous conflict, and the workers have been called upon to make great sacrifices. ' Very serious consideration must be given to the position of the workers in relation to future wars. With a full realization of the position before us we must take the stand that war shall be for ever banned as far as civilization is concerned. The Prime Minister stated some .time ago that, unless a preproblems were held, the Washington Conhe said, could otherwise come out of it . That was the right honourable gentleman's opinion at the close of' the I m to Australia and found that the Determined to take all steps possible to bring about peace in the world, he reversed his opinion, and now regards the Washington Conference as of some imhere, at last, is an opportunity for mankind for ever to rid itself of the hideous nightmare of war. I agree with the ton) that this is not a party question, and I trust that all lionorable members will On that ocindorse that view. It may be argued, of course, that we cannot send representatives of the three parties in this House to Washington as uninvited guests, but I feel sure that if the opinion of the House were placed before the Prime Minister of Great Britain, he would take immediate steps to see that our position were placed clearly and forcibly before the President of the United States"" of America, probably inducing him to extend an invitation to the three parties in this Parliament. But, even if that were not done; even if it were nofc possible to obtain invitations for representatives of the three parties, we would still have an opportunity to send delegates to advise our official representative ai the Conference. They would be at his right hand, and, although they might be prevented from sitting at the Conference I warn the representatives of table, would be able to give him the benefit of their advice and experience, thus immensely strengthening his hands.

57,Deputy Leader Of My Party ( Mr Charl,"Washington about peace in the world; to see that we do nothing in tbe way of slamming the door in the face of the Angel of Peace. It was, I think, unfortunate that the Prime Minister should have allowed himself iu the heat of the moment to say that America had slammed the door. America did nothing of the sort. The American people and President Harding 'are to be congratulated upon having taken the initiative in this important matter What President Harding has done will redound for ever to his credit as the head of a great nation, especially if, as a result of formation could have been given to us in his invitation, the world reaches a condition of peace and harmony. The party I represent is prepared to join cordially with every other section of the community in any action that will banish the hideous monster of war from our midst. I second the amendment. When the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) was speaking to the amendment ho deprecated the introduction of party feeling. I endorse what he said in that respect, and perhaps I may be permitted to suggest that the introduction of class feeling would be still more unfortunate. I repudiate the suggestion that I , at any rate, represent only one section of the community. I and all my colleagues represent every section in our respective constituencies. The suggestion that whatever representative is sent from this House will represent only one' class in the community is most unfortunate. though. Dr. grams read by the Prime Minister, and his statement this afternoon, indicate more than ever the necessity for a very much more definite statement -concerning the whole of the preliminary negotiations in connection with the Conference than we have yet received. Surely it is beneath the dignity of this Parliament to have three days' discussion on this matter, and still be only half Way, apparently, towards the light that exists in tlie Prime Minister's mind. Why shouldwe have to indulge in endless debate and seek by interjection with reference to these negotiations information which should have been spontaneously given to the Parliament and the people of this country immediately upon the [467]2 [6 OCTOBER, 1921.] Disarmament Conference. 11721 Prime Minister's return ? I would like to say with regard to the agenda paper ister should have given us the agenda paper a week before it was prepared, I suppose. opportunity of seeing the telegrams-ap parently the honourable member has not dealing with this matter. The agenda paper bears the date 12th September, and that,. I suggest, would have given us plenty of time to do something. This in the Prime Minister's first speech. about 14th September, I think: what I have said disposes of the honourable member's interjection. By implication, not by actual words, and by the continued silence of the Prime Minister and the secrecy of his actions, we have been led to believe, that there was no necessity whatever for Australia's representation at the. Washington Conference. Nothing has been said to the contrary from any official source. In an interview with the press only a few days ago, the Prime Minister said that to go to Washington would be like going to Heaven without a ticket. If that was the Prime Minister's view after numerous telegrams had been sent, and if that was the considered view of the Imperial Conference, and of the Government of the United States of America, it seems to me that they were speaking with two voices. Now, on the eve of the Conference, we find that after mature the Prime MinisterMr Lloyd George has decided to depart from what was determined at the Imperial Conference. It seems most extraordinary that this should happen on the eve of the last sailing date that would enable anybody to get from Australia to Washington in time for the Conference which is to be held there. I see no additional reason, in the agenda paper given us to-day, why the decision of the Imperial Conference should be departed from. The matters to be dealt with must all have been threshed out very fully during its discussions. China's position, its opendoor question, and trade relations concern British more than Australian merchants.

The control of the mandated Territories, and other Pacific problems, must surely be covered by the Treaty decisions arrived at while; the PrimeM in ister was in Paris eighteen months or two years ago. As I stated last night, there should be some Australian representative in the Imperial delegation. It is impossible to ask for separate representation, in view of the attitude of America to the League of Nations; but it is still not too late for the Prime Ministert o give us the tenor of the discussion which took place in the Imperial Conference as to what Australia's position in the Imperial delegation should be, and what decision was arrived at about it . We have never had that information. suggested that Australia should play an important part, why have we not been told? The fact that we have not been informed on that point seems to indicate that the inference drawn by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) is fairly near the truth . It is a scandal that we are asked to-day to hurriedly choose a delegate to represent the Australian people. This responsibility should be, not on Parliament at all, but on the Executive Government of the Commonwealth. presentative should come from this House? Dr._ EARLEPAGE debate. The method by which this question has been dealt w it h indicates the need in this Parliament for a Committee on Imperial or External affairs, which would be representative of all parties, and through which a choice which would meet with acceptance the House and in the country, could be made. Until we alitor our method of external representation we are not likely to bring about an improvement in dealing with such important affairs. The suggestion that all panties should be represented can be attributed only to a lack of appreciation of the relative importance of Australia at ithe forthcoming Conference. If one delegation is sufficient for France, surely we cannot expect a great entourage of Dominion representatives in the trail of the delegates of Great Britain. Kingdom itself will have only three representatives. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Disarmament Conference. fore, the Australian representation should be limited to one. Although our desire for disarmament is great, and our need for it is, perhaps, greater than that of any other part of the world, our importance in this Conference will be relatively small and insignificant. On that .account we 1 shall really not be able to carry very much weight, no matter how we are repre-. sented. I am pleased, however, that the Government has come to some decision, and has moved in a definite manner. [3.46] I desire ito express my complete satisfaction that the Government has seen fit to determine that Australia shall be represented at the Conference. A t the If it was same time, I am disappointed with the Government's nomination. I do not say that in any way personally detrimental to Senator Pearce; his personality is quite a subordinate matter at the present juncture. The question is solely how can Australia, at this vital and all-important Conference, be adequately represented ? In my judgment, we have in this House three men who are specially qualified, by their long parliamentary and responsible experience, to represent Australia, and we have, therefore, the opportunity to select a. man acceptable to the people of the Commonwealth. These three are the PrimeM in ister himself, an ex-Prime Minister, and T h at is open to an Acting Prime Minister. been an Acting Prime Minister, too.

It has been their duty to_give attention to those matters. But the one man above all others who sliould represent Australia, by reason of his special experience aittl his great personal qualifications, and on whom the imperative duty lies, is the PrimeM in ister himself. I think he is called upon to make sacrifices at the present juncture -sacrifice s even amounting to the risk which, I hope, would be remote, of the less of office, for the purpose of responding to the present call of Australia.

It w ill be of vital interest to Australia. As the Prime Minister himself has said, there is no portion, of the Empire that is more deeply interested in the subjects to be discussed than is Australia. No other nation is more vitally ' interested. To my surprise, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) has moved an amendment to the Prime Minister's motion after declaring that this is a matter that should not be treated in a party spirit. I agree that it should not be dealt with in a party spirit, and I think that this House is humiliating itself by attempting to deal with it in that way. The amendment moved by Mr Charlton itself indicates a party -Bpirit. intend to propose that Australia's representative shall be the Prime Minister. T h a t will be a proposal in a party spirit. Sir ROBERTBEST -clearly understood that the is one of the greatest magnitude. It is too colossal fco be dealt with i u a. party spirit. It is a matter in whioh the whole of Australia is concerned. The welfare of the Commonwealth is involved in this question, and from that stand-point the selection should, as f a r as possible, be the unanimous selection of Parliament. When Parliament has had an opportunity, as I think it should have, of making the selection, ifc should be distinctly understood that the person appointed is nofc the representative of the Government, but It of Parliament and the people as a whole. . I urge that the representative selected should continue to act even if there be a change of Government. Personally, I would be very glad to see the honourable gentlemen in the comer, or others, agree to give immunity to the Government during the absence of the Prime Minister, but thafc might be an unreasonable thing to ask, and I cannot press it . W h a t I Then he do press is that we should subordinate all party feeling w it h a view to being effectively represented afc Washington. This any chance my Government is is one of fche biggest movements that has my abever taken place in the history of our time. I do not think that Lord Norfchcliffe has'in any way over-emphasized the importance of this Conference. It is a Conference of world-wide importance, and we fervently hope that its decisions will make it possible to secure at least a very substantial advance in. the direction of insuring the f u t u r e peace of the world. The most significant and valuable feature of it is fchafc ifc has been initiated by America. I have the greatest admiration for the League of Nations, which, however, has been maimed By the defection of America. Its objects are practically the same as those of the Washington' Conference, or, to put it the other way about, the Conference is seeking practically the same objects as the League of Nations is ° seeking. It is seeking the peaceful settlement of international disputes, guarantees of territorial occupation, and mutual reduction and limitation of armaments. Convention.

I say that he should go to the Conference, b u t if he w ill not go, then the next best thing is t h a t ' a representative should be selected by this House.' If this House would agree to his unanimous selection, and if a motion for his appointment were moved by my friends on the other side of the House, I am quite certain that the Prime Minister would have to reconsider his decision.

It is not the Government which should make the selection, but Parliament. a bad constitutional practice. the gibe of my honourable friend that it would be a bad constitutional practice, I suggest it .

I understand that while 0 I was absent from the chamber the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) made a statement which, I am afraid, may mislead the House, In referring to a cablegram that I read, he spoke of it as having been received on the 12th Septtem'ber.

That means that on the 12th day of September the Foreign Secretary sent from his office a letter addressed to me in Australia. It takes, on an average, thirty days for a letter to get fro m London to Melbourne, and that letter has not I appeal to the Prime yet arrived. It is, therefore, clear that it was not a cablegram but a letter whicli was sent on 12th September; the cablegram was sent on 3rd October. Two of these cablegrams are, in part, I suppose, a summary of it . They give the present position as I have it . I am one of those who deprecate the i m portation of party feeling into a debate of this national and, indeed, international character, and I join issue w it h the Leader of the Country party ( D r .

The Minister for Defence is charged With the administration of the greatest spending Department of the Commonwealth, and we know that even honourable members on the Ministerial side have advo-cated that the Ministeri n charge of that Department should be a member of the House of Bepresentatives, and not of the House which is denied control of the purse. The members of the National party have not, in the past, been very -clever or adroit, or they would, before now, have brought about that happy state of affairs. Senator Pearce as Minister for Defence? the honourable member to ask that question. I am one who, when he finds reason -to change views which he has previously expressed in regard to individuals or proposals, has the manliness and courage to do so. I do not unhesitatingly and doglike continue to support an individual who and denounced the principles and aspirations which he previously professed. Senator"" Pearce is to-day the greatest militarist in Australia, and is on that account absolutely the worse man who could be selected to represent this count r y at the Conference. We have not so far heard the last word that is to be said aboutthe Australian delegation. The views of the people of Australia will be published through the Press and fro m public platforms, and will be conveyed to America, and the very mention of his name and the character he bears w ill stamp Senator Pearce as the most unfortunate selection that could have been made for suoh a position. ""If the Government had set themselves out deliberately to throw cold water on Peace proposals, so far as they may be affected by the Washington Disarmament Conference, they could not have selected a, better man for that purpose. Honourable members opposite know this, and the statement made by the honourable membei"" for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) is an indication of the feeling of many honourable members on the Ministerial side. They realize I am satisfied bhat the wrong man has been selected by the Government, and. why should honourable members on either side sit quietly by without making any attempt to correct the blunder which the Government have made? We are asked to-day to in dorse or reject the Government's selection, and if a majority support .the Government proposal, on their shoulders will rest the responsibility for sending Senator Pearce to Washington. One reason why I am disposed to have greater confidence in what may issue from, fche Washington Disarmament Conference than in the deliberations of the .League of Nations is that the great American Republic, with 120,000,000 of people, has unfortunately, up to the present remained outside the League of Nations. . Russia with 200,000,000 of people"" is outside the League, and our late enemy Germany, with 75,000,000 of people, is also outside of it . There are in these counI t is all very well for tries a total of nearly 400,000,000 of white people who are nofc represented in the League of Nations. I believe that the movement initiated by the United States of America through its President will bring many of these great nations into the fold. On the subject of Germany entering the League of Nations, has changed his political coat I quote the following reference from the press: Interviewed by the special correspondent of the Deutsche Allegemeine Zeitung in Geneva, Lord Robert Cecil, who is representing South Africa at the League of Nations Assembly, is said to have expressed the opinion that it would be to the interest of Germany and the whole world if Germany petitioned for admission to the League of Nations, for this would prove that Germany is ready to co-operate with the world for the maintenance of peace.",32,Earle Page Th E Cable Deliberation T O Use The Words Of

We have a picture of horror behind us, and we do not want to have war in prospect as well as in retrospect. If we look behind us we see death, devastation and trouble, and are we, when the world is still almost paralyzed from the effects of the last awful war, to look through the mists of coming years and predict that it will again be plunged in blood ? No matter what our opinions on other subjects may be, I believe we should readily respond to any invitation to further a movement to insure the peace of the world. Something has been said regarding the agenda paper to be presented to the Washington Disarmament Conference. Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has corrected what he considered, an erroneous impression in the mind of the honourable member for Cowper, when he referred to the date of the 12th September as the date upon which the cable referring to the agenda paper of the Conference was sent. It is somewhat remarkable that the wording of the message read by the Prime Minister should be almost repeated on page 354 of Stead's Review, published on the 1st of this month. Referring to the . agenda paper of the Conference, I quote the following from Stead's Eeview:It was issued in Washington on 22nd September. It is issued in two parts; PartI . , dealing with the limitation of armaments; and Part II . , covering Pacific and Par-Eastern questions. The disarmament questions arc well conceived. They are: (1) Naval armaments, including a basis of limitation and extent of fulfilment; (2) rules for the control of new agencies of warfare; (3) limitation of land armaments. The Par-Eastern problems relate chiefly to China and Siberia, and under each of these headings will he considered territorial integrity, administrative integrity, the open door policy, equality of commercial and industrial opportunity, concessions, monopolies, and preferential privileges, development of railways, preferential railroad rates, and status of existing commitments. The inclusion of Siberia shows that these are directed against Japan. Japan will have something to say in reply. But apart from this the proposal seems to 'have been drawn up with great skill. The other point is the mandated islands. Here Australian policy in New Guinea will certainly be brought under review. ilr. Fenton. That information was, no doubt, gathered from cablegrams or other sources of information previously published. The words used in the article I have quoted are almost identical with those read by the Prime Minister from the. cable received from the British Prime Minister. No doubt, a report of this discussion will go forth to America, and it will be made plain that it is the opinion of all parties in the House of Representatives that the selection made by the Government is a very undesirable one indeed. when the Prime Minister was selected to attend the Imperial Conference. choice between the two, I would not select the Minister for Defence. I do not know whether ""President Harding has conceded what was requested, but I know that organized'labour unions in America The made a request to be represented at the Conference. I do not know what the President's final words on the matter may have been, but his initial reply waa of a rather favorable character. As a statesman, he realizes the fact that unless a movement of the kind which he has initiated is backed up by the masses of the people in the various countries it must result in utter failure It is, therefore, essential that the voice of the people should be heard at the Conference. I have no doubt, that if representatives of the working classes of America are not actually present at the Conference, there will be a committee representative of the workers in constant consultation with the TJnited States delegation. Although the British Government have suggested that there should be only one representative for Australasia, do not forget that provision has been made for a secretary to the Australasian delegation, and I assume that that second .person, whether he be a secretary or an associate, will have admission almost to the Conference; at any rate, he will be close to the ears of' the delegates. If the British Government are prepared to go so far as to reserve ae-. commodation for two persons, I believe that if representation were made that all parties in Australia and the other Dominions should be represented; on the delegation, if not at the Conference table, at any rate outside the Conference hall, the suggestion -would be accepted.

Australian Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) d i d not occupy a primary position at the Peace Conference; b u t he was content to occupy a secondary position, and who will say that he did not influence, to some -extent, the views of the British delegation and the Conference itself ? Have not honourable members on occasions attended great political and industrial gatherings, not as official delegates 'but as onlookers, .and have they not, by reason of their attendance and consultation with the delegates, actually influenced the opinions of the gathering ? The same thing might be expected to happen at Washington. If this Parliament will not sanction the sending of a delegation representative of all parties, I believe that Australia, Great Britain, and America will make arrangements whereby the great masses of the people may have their opinions voiced, -if not in the Conference room, at any rate in the precincts. I do not know whether it would be a breach of Conference etiquette, bub I see nothing to prevent the delegation from Australia calling a meeting of members of the Conference for an unofficial discussion of matters affecting the Commonwealth. Why should not that be done? I s it not important to every man, woman, and child in the civilized world that the present rivalry in armaments should be discontinued as soon as possible ? During the sitting of the Peace -Conference, the British Government sent a financial delegation to Germany to report upon the capacity of that country to :pay a war 'indemnity, and I believe that the Chairman of that delegation was the Chairman of Lloyd's Bank, London. When he returned to England, he expressed the belief that Germany, if relieved of the burden of military and naval expenditure, would be in a position to He pointed out that the terms of the enormous expenditure on naval and military armaments, and, in addition, m i l lions of able-bodied men who, under the old conscription system, would have been drafted annually into the army and navy to be employed in work that was useless and unproductive except, as an. insurance, would be employed in peaceful industries. The Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) in his Budget speech last week conservatively estimated bhat that relief would mean to Germany between .£300,000,000 and £400,000,000 per annum. I say that he understated the amount. The relief from naval and military expenditure and the greater application to industrial development will mean to Germany, if she continues a. non-militaristic country, and her former rivals continue to expend huge amounts on armaments, a benefit of £1,000,000,000 per annum. We have conclusive testimony fro m the mouth of one of the. financial experts appointed by the British Government that disarmament, from the point of view of workers, manufacturers, commercial m m , bankers, and the public generally is one of the grandest reforms that any country can adopt. A t the forthcoming Washington Conference we shall have an opportunity of participating, perhaps in only a humble way, in a movement for the reo duction of armaments, and however small may be the privileges accorded our delegates, Australia should be represented and play her part as best she oan. Three men should be appointed fro m this Parliament. I object to only one party being represented, and I would prefer any other man to be sent from the Government side rather than the Minister w h o has been selected. If three men were appointed Australia would speak w i th a united voice. If this Parliament fails to send a composite delegation, I shall advocate that the Labour movement shall in dependently send a delegate to Washington to represent the views of the Australian workers.

That is my personal view, however strongly uttered, aud I leave the matter at this stage, because it is only so much crying over spilt milk to proceed any further. We are past the stage when what I urge could be done. At any rate, there is scarcely time to do it in the way in which I think it could have been done earlier. delegation must leave Australia next week, but I do not object to the spare hours of one week being utilized for this and another purpose to which I propose to refer, that is, to make the delegation multiple and not unitary-provide d the House makes up its mind on high national grounds, and not on party lines. If the thinkers of this House, or those who tives of the people, to adopt this course,. it is probably not too late to discuss the matter. In any case we might try it. For myself, I leave the matter with the right honourable gentleman. I regret the procedure adopted, because sooner or later it will be discovered that Australia's interest will suffer by ifc. The gratifying feature of all this is, first of all, that Australia is to be represented afc Washington.

I have not seen him in his Department, but the more one associated with him the more one felt that he was a thoughtful student of the big problems of Australia. aside altogether his experience, and different honourable members' likes or dislikes, I do not think it is a fortunate choice. I am sure the friends of Senator Pearce will absolve me from any desire to* comment upon his personal qualifications. They are high, but the man who is to go to Washington should have a higher responsibility than has the Minister for Defence. The choice should have fallen upon the head of the Government. As to the domestic circumstances which may detain him, or discourage his attendance at this Conference, the right honourable gentleman and his colleagues are the best judges; but,, speaking as an outsider, and as a private member of Parliament, I do not think that the Leader of the Government -can divest himself of tbe responsibility resting upon him. clear that it was in his mind the idea of this Conference first originated. Many thinkers about the same time, in the same way, and iu different countries, were expressing a desire for a disarmament Conference. Prime Ministei has always been since the war ended that either through the League of Nations, or through some special Conference, the various nations of the world should get together, and endeavour to understand one another's objectives, and agree either to fche abolition of armaments, or fco a limitation or. definite reduction of them. Even to-day he has pointed to the horrors of war. At any rate, as head of the Commonwealth Government, he ia the ablest man in the Cabinet-I can say it without derogating from the high qualifications of some of his colleagues-and he ought to 'go to Washington. Whether the circumstances are such as to lead him to believe fchafc ifc is not proper for him to leave Australia at the present time, I do not know. T do not think they are; but I am nofc qualified to speak for any one bufc my self in this House. The Labour party will speak for itself; the Country party will speak for itself. I speak merely as a detached member what I believe to be Mr Watt. the view of the nation-and I claim that the Prime Minister should face the risks, Senator Pearoe was an able if they do exist, whatever they are, and go to Washington, at least during the earlier stages of the Conference. It may be that the deliberations will be indefinitely protracted.

If he fell in this case he would fall in the greatest cause he has ever espoused. I do not think he would fall. I think there is a tempered justice about the people of Australia that transcends the feelings of party, and that there would be a general consensus of opinion in the community and in this House that unless some colossal blunder or crime were committed by the Government during his absence honourable members should get on with the ordinary business of the House and leave the Government where they are. peace, it would prove that he should have stuck to his own game of making war. agree with the honourable member.

Prinie Minister or the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook), or the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) be chosen, I think it is vital that our representative or representatives should be a member or members of this Parliament, and responsible in a more or less intimate degree to it. It would be clearly better for our delegate to be drawn from this House. There has been a strong feeling for years that the Defence portfolio should be held by a member sitting in this House. I pause lightly to point out thafc the British Government have selected the Pirsfc Lord of the Admiralty as one of the British delegates. First Lord of the Admiralty? honours thick upon him. He is our Lord of the Navy, and it is towards our first line of defence that Australia's attention . will be more and more directly confined. There are a number of other honorablo members here who might go in place of Senator Pearce, and maintain an intimate connection between the House of Representatives and the delegation. The Prime Minister has suggested that our delegate, whoever he may be, should leave Australia with instructions. From whom? In face of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr out a policy which may be deemed suitCharlton) and the suggested amendment by"" the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) it is clear that if our delegate is to represent all Australia the Government should not be the only instructing authority. There ought to be some line of policy recommended by the Government and confirmed by this House, either before the delegate leaves, or during his passage across the Pacific,, to guide him at Washington. to send two other representatives. others, even if they do not go into the Conference. I do not believe we could put them into the Conference unless they were invited, but I would send them if they were willing to go. Failing that, this House should deliberate upon the recommendation of the Ministry with respectfcothe policy to be pursued by Australia's delegation afc the Conference. If However, whether the that course is not adopted I know what will happen as surely as the sun will rise to-morrow. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) will be instructed by -the Prime Minister, by way of cablegrams; and Australia's delegate will do what he is told by the Prime Minister to do. ber has had personal experience.

Eventually, this House would have to take the responsibihty, and my view is that honourable members should shield themselves from the necessity of having to shoulder such a responsibility. operated and combined in the proposed Australian delegation, there would be a joint responsibility which this Parliament as a whole would feel and should be prepared, I think, to shoulder. Disarmament, whether success may or may 1 not attend the initial endeavour to bring it about, can only come by the unanimous desire of the peoples of -the nations concerned. It cannot be gained by the one party which may be carrying compelling power in the 1 Parliament of any land, but I repeat and emphasizeby the general assent >ti the great bulk of the inhabitants of that country.' The Prime Minister would be well advised if he secured the' widest possible approbation of his methods and of the personnel of the delegation.

So long as v there exists a system of responsible government, in association with ' which the people are supposed to speak through the party that holds, for the time being the Treasury bench, > and in this popular Chamber, the Government must take responsibility.

Whatever may happen as the resultof this debate, I trust that 1 when the delegation shall have left these shores, it will be with the unanimous desire of the people of Australia for success. The difficulties surrounding the Conference will, he, perhaps, insurmountable; certainly they will prove to be gigantic. When .one surveys the condition of Europe to-day, and thinks upon only one phase of the great question of disarmament-that is to say, upon the military side-on e is oppressed with the feeling that not even the genius of the greatest statesman the world has known could triumph in securing any substantial measure of general military disarmament.

I invite honourable members to consider the view-point, the aspirations, and national tendencies of the people of Poland. With eyes upon a rich portion of Silesia, plebiscite or no plebiscite, Poland tells herself that by divine rightBritish, I am sure. But when the whole she should take that territory to herself. The Poles are a warlike people. They have fought in great causes for centuries; and, with their national, heroism and their warlike spirit undiminished and unbroken, the Poles do not look lightly upon disarmament. Nor do the Italians, nor the Jugo-Slavs, the peoples of each of which nationality to-day are casting jealous looks upon the coastline and As Frenchmen, waters of the Adriatic. Russia keeps today, I suppose, the biggest standing army in the world, active or potential. The Russian Government consider it essential to national safety and the expansion of their ideals that a huge military machine should be maintained. AU these facts and considerations will stare No! France the delegates to the Washington Conference directly in the face. I hope and look for very little as an outcome of the first sittings of the Conference with respect to i France knows how bad a military disarmament. But Australia focuses most of her interest and influence upon the subject of naval armaments. In this respect, instead of having to 'consult the wishes and ambitions of from thirty to forty military Powers, there are practically but three prime Powers concerned. I refer to Great Britain, the United States of America., and Japan. It is to be. hoped that, if the representatives of those nations gather around the Conference table-whateve r may happen respecting disarmament upon land and in the aira definite working agreement may be arrived at with respect to reduction of naval armaments. able member aware that both the British Prime Minister and the TJnited States Secretary for the Navy'have stated that, whatever the result of the Washington Conference may be, the naval programmes of each country must be gone on with? ments, together with the announcement of the Japanese that it is their purpose still to build ships according to programme. I do not take much notice of those assertions, however. They mark the strategy of the pre-Conference period. Obviously, it would be very unwise for the statesmen of Great Britain and the diplomats of the United States to throw their cards upon the table before the Conference has begun. The Japanese authorities would not do so; neither would the subject-matter shall have been talked over at Washington, and the provocative nature of the international situation fully seized of, I hope that the statesmen of the nations will have been moved and inspired to reach an agreement.

I eannot conceive of a greater international jest, if I may so call it, than the proposijust as clearly responsible for the Washtion that the Prime Minister should attend' any Conference for the purpose of bringing about world disarmament. Por years the right honourable gentleman has preached the theory that our lives, our homes, our safety, our morals, our all depend upon the force, and majesty of tfie British Navy. And in almost every gesture which he makes and has made, and in every sentence which he has uttered through all the time that I have known him, he has conveyed the impression that everything we have we hoH:' by force; that by force, and by physical effort alone, rather than upon any principle of morality, we are what we are ih the world to-day. That has been the right honourable gentleman's policy; thosehave been his political ethics. It was the Prime Minister's attitude at the Peace Conference; it was his view-point at the Imperial Conference; and it has been his public attitude, and those have been his public declarations, wherever and whenever he has spoken. Now, the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr ""Watt) seeks to thrust this last and greatest honour upon the right I employ these honourable gentleman. The honourable member .seeks so strongly to do so that one is compelled to doubt his motives. The Prime Minister has passed .scatheless through so many political perils that the honourable member for Balaclava invites him to brave this one more risk. Apparently, the honourable member thinks that this is the psychological moment at which the Prime Minister should take just one more, and the last, risk in the interests of this country. One last peril is all that he asks the right honourable gentleman to face. only one, and the Prime Minister, regretfully, we presume, declines to take that risk.* Well may he so decline, having regard to motions on the notice-paper, to the attitude of our friends in the comer, and the attitude of our merciless friends on this side. And now a word on the question of our representation at Washington. I need scarcely express my surprise that the Prime Minister should have conveyed to this House and the world that he was ington Conference as was our laite lamen-' ted friend, "" Bill Adams,"" for winning the battle of Waterloo.

The Prime Minister would have us believe that he was re^ sponsible for this invitation extended' to Britain to attend the Conference. can well imagine that his '' guns were ""spiked"" by the invitation. is. perfectly clear that the invitation, comingfrom the representative of the United States of America, was very embarrassing to a gentleman who had gone from this country with a "" cut-and-dried "" ' Australian policy for the Pacific. Australia did not receive an invitation to attend the Conference; and, to me, it * seems the most natural thing in the world that Australia, as a Commonwealth, and as an integral, part of the British Empire, should not receive such -an invitation. We cannot have it both ways; we cannot, on the one hand, be constantly boasting of the eternal glory of .our association as a part, and a subordinate part, of the Great British Empire, and, on the other hand, expect complete recognition as an independent nation. I invite this. Government and its Leader, if they wish with some appearance of logical soundness ro claim a position for Australia as an independent nation, to boldly assert our independent status in the world. But the right honourable gentle3nan and those whom he represents, speaking with two voices, say at one moment, A that our lives and everything we have depend on our association with Britain and on the might of the British Navy-that without Britain we are as nothing-and in the next moment, with their other voice, when it suits the Government, they boast that Australia, for the first time, takes her place in the councils of the world as an independent nation on -equal terms with all other nations. truth is that, whatever may be the unwritten constitution of the British. Empire], there can be no question that Australia, so far as international law is con' oerned, has not the status of a nation at all, and that it is quite idle to claim that she has. She is not recognised as a nation in her relationship with the other nations of the world; ^and, consequently, when the representative of the United States of America was inviting the world Powers to discuss disarmament it would have been clearly a breach of all recognised principles, of international communication to haverequested Australia, which is a part, .and only one-of many parts, of. the Briti ish Empire, to send representatives to that Conference. The position from that point of view, therefore, is perfectly clear. TheI Leader of this Government, with that inordinate egotism which has marked his 'It career in this House, felt, apparently, that because he had always been a somewhat noisy and aggressive spokesman wherever he might be, he was marked out in some special ,way for individual recognition by the United States. But whatever he may have felt in this matter does not alter his position, does not in the least alter Australia's position. The fact that Australia cannot feel justly disgruntled because she did not receive an invitation does not, however, lessen the importance of this Conference from the point of view of Australia; it does not make it less important that the point of view of Australia should be stated at the Conference. And there is one clear way in which the point of view of Australia can be stated. It can be stated, as is now Suggested, in association with the British delegation, and by arrangement with that delegation; for, while Australia has no claim to a separate status she has a clearcut claim to association with Great Britain in being heard at the Conference. It is in these circumstances that my honourable leader ( Mr Charlton) and others directed very timely criticism at the Government for its, to say the least, dilatory method of dealing with this question of first importance. Although the Prime Minister has been in Australia some two or three weeks, and, although we'have to consider also the time that he was on the water after leaving England, it is amazing to gather, as I did, from the cablegrams The read this afternoon, that the first official message relating to our representation at the Conference, from the British Government to himself, is dated the 3rd of the present month. The Prime Minister has disowned or denied the sending by himself or his Government of any message to the British Government by way of an inspiration of the cablegrams that have been read. On this question of fact we must accept the right, honourable gentleman's word; but those of us who have been studying this question have formed a clear opinion, that the Prime Minister and his Government have been watching the trend of events with eager self interest and waiting to see which way the wind was blowing-tbe y have been waiting on a may .decide, and so far as they tell him public opinion that they should have led it is to be made public, he faithfully and made for an indication of, not what makes it public, and faithfully gives effect was best, but what was safe for them to do. to it . When the Government heard the criticism of the Leader of the Country party know all this?

Then he announced that it is proposed to likely that Senator Pearce is not qualified send Senator Pearce to Washington to refor the membership of the club, and present Australia.

It has been said that ifc will inevitably consider the question of a White Australia, andfchafcfchedeliberations will have a considerable bearGovernment is a promoter of White Ausing upon that policy. No doubt they will. It is quite possible, having regard to an awakening China, because she is awakening, an awakened Japan, because she is awake, and the teeming millions of misgoverned India and other parts of the world, thafc our right to hold a continent so sparsely popuand who were foreigners at the lated, if nofc challenged, is likely to be carefully considered. If the Washington Conference should pass resolutions,' or should come to conclusions which seem to be inconsistent with the policy of a White Australia, the question will present itself world making this continent their home, to this House and to this country, what are we going to do about it? The Prime Minister has said that we are nothing without the British Navy, and, on the other hand, he has stated that our White Australia policy will be maintained, if not by peaceful methods, by the foroe of arms. In other words, we find this great loyal Imperialist, when loyalty to Empire brings him in conflict with this policy, a most assertive and egotistical individualist. I can only express the view that., whatever may be determined, sooner \ or later Australia will have to assert her. self, and by her strength of will-it may be some other kind of strength-giv e evidence of her power to sustain her policy in -tihe Pacific. We should begin to make up our minds as to what we mean when we say that the policy of a White Australia must stand. What does our insistence mean in the light of the power of other nations? Doesi t mean thafc an independent Australia, independent of its Imperial connection and responsibility, will put fight into forcing its White Australia policy upon the world? Doesi t mean that we shall fight for it against the world? Or what does it mean? I ask this question because we get no assistance or information from the right honourable gentleman who leads this House, and who claims to be a loyal Imperialist, and, on the other hand, declares that, come what may, Imperial Conferences, Im perial decisions, Disarmament Conferences, or meetings of the League of Nations, we intend to adhere hard and fast to our White Australia policy. Needless to say, I believe in such a policy. It is an ideal; bufc I think a practicable ideal. It is one fchafc can logically be sustained without any reflection upon the so-called coloured races who are our neighbours. I do nofc believe this tralia. This Government is not only preventing our late enemies-som e of the best colonists in the world-fro m coming into Australia, but it is likewise at' present prohibiting Bussian colonists from entering the Commonwealth. In connection with those who werehere, outbreak of war, and not enemies, Ministers adopted a policy fit to damn immigration. That is their history and their policy, aiid, because fchey are preventingfchewhite races of the and because fchey made it , to say the least of it , very unpleasant for those foreigners already here, they should not preach the doctrine of a White Australia as something by which they will stand, whatever it may cost. I do not often agree with the opinions expressed by that distinguished gentleman who paid a flying visit ito Australia, and whohas now departed-Lord Northcliffe-and I hope I shall never be accused, whatever else may be said of me, of seeing eye to eye with the noble lord on local or international politics. Lord Northcliffe, at all events, uttered some words of wise warning, as well as words of unwisdom, in connection with this matter which is closely associated with immigration. The same words of warning and wisdom have been uttered before by others, but they were not so widely advertised. A t all events, he is on safe ground when he says that, in order to establish a moral or a legal right to hold this country, it has to be peopled. There is no law in the uncertain realm oif international politics, and there is no legal right, not to mention moral right, which gives us permanent hold on an unoccupied continent. The Prime Minister has spoken of the teeming hordes in Japan, and has said fchafc the area of the islands which the Japanese occupy is no greater than that in the Mandated Territories. It is well that we should be quite candid and justify to ourselves, if we can, our claim fco hold a continent; unoccupied and unused, while teeming masses of mankind are jostling for room in other parts of the world. Habitable and productive territory is strictly limited in extent, and those principles which lie at the basis of Labour's opposition to monopoly in trade and land He also at the basis of the monopose would be served by endeavouring poly of a continent. Notwithstanding this, it is highly desirable to sustain the policy of a White Australia, which means Australia for the white races of the world. Therefore I look forward to the time when the insane policy this Government has established, this racial hatred which it does so much to maintain, these jealousies and vendettas which haye moved it in the direction of preventing some of the best colonists in the world living here, will come to an end. Australia will then, subject to the just claims of her own people and her own workers, be open to a reasonable system of immigration designed to put into productivity the unused lands of Australia. Government may be prevailed upon to do the right thing to the delegation to Washington. are in a position to greatly influence the deliberations of that Conference. We are not in the position to require America to ask us to go there. enjoy the status of a nation because, in spite* of all the talk, there haa been no change in our status. It is all moonshine for the Prime Minister and others to speak of our enlarged and improved status, because the position is precisely what it was ten or fifteen years ago. It has not been altered by one hair's breadth. The fact that the Prime Minister was invited, as a concession to bis egotism, to sign the Treaty of Versailles does not alter our status. It was not altered at the Imperial Conference, although the Prime Minister has told this House that for the first time the delegates met as a Cabinet and on the footing of absolute equality. met at the Imperial Conference in precisely the same way, and with precisely the same powers, as they possessed at other Imperial Conferences. not deceive, ourselves by imagining that we have acquired new or enlarged status. We are independent in the sense that, in all matters affecting the government of Australia, we do what we will; but, so far as our relationships with other countries are concerned, we speak through Mr Bretman. the centre of the Empire. As most honourable members know, I am not a great Imperialist. Generally, I despise thespirit of Imperialism, and I think it a baleful one. I believe that a useful purto dispel the notion that we enjoy powers which we did not previously possess. Therefore I trust we shall use the legitimate means at our disposal to attach to the delegation to Washington representatives from Australia who will truly express the Australian view-point. I am supporting the amendment. It must be recognised that the mover speaks for at least one-half of the people in the Commonwealth, who are united in the view that Senator Pearce does not represent them, but that, on the contrary, he wholly misrepresents them. This section of the people are entitled to an expression of their views at the coming Conference, I trust that, even now, the and I hope they will get some representation. I hope that the true view of Auswith regard tralian Democracy will. find expression We there, and that nothing so nauseating will be perpetrated as that Senator Pearce, the official representative of the military caste, from whom this country has suffered We do not so much and so long, will be sent across to the United States of America to represent us there, or, for that matter, anywhere else. to he regretted that we have had three separate speeches on international questions from the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), because all the subjects dealt with in his remarks are so inter-related that it is very difficult indeed to separate them.

The Japanese Government will not allow a single Chinese coolie or labourer to enter ment of the compliment of racial equality Japan, It is absurd, therefore, to suggest that our White Australia policy is menaced by Japan, because we are merely doing what Japan is doing herself. When we talk about a menace to a White Australia we should be prepared to indicate where it lies. Dp to the present it cannot be done. The danf er, to my mind, is largely fictitious, apan made certain claims for racial equality, and we were given to understand that these affected Australia, but We may we know now, having possession of all the facts, that Japan had in mind the treatment of Japanese immigrants in the United States, and that the claim for racial equality had nothing to do with Up to the present, at all the White Australia policy. Japan had a perfect right to complain of the treatment of the Japanese in the United States of America. A t first they were welcomed there as workers, but gradually they acquired money and land,' and became competitors in many respects with the white people of the Pacific States, Then the'trouble commenced. Although they were welcome settlers when merely hewers of wood and drawers of water, drastic measures against them were proposed aa soon as they acquired a property in land, and started to produce in competition with their previous employers. Japan objected to its emigrants not receiving the same treatment as those from other countries, and that was the basis of its claim for racial equality.

Japanese statesmen recognise that Australia has a perfect right to say what people shall be allowed to come within its borders.

His military associations mark him as one not to be trusted in this regard. The objection of the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir .Robert Best) to the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr may have a vote upon the amendment;; Charlton) was very amusing. The amendment proposed that we should have representatives of all parties at the Washington Conference. The honourable member objected to that because he thought it was going to introduce a class spirit or a class feeling. He said that we were proposing to introduce the party spirit, which should be kept out, and that the Prime Minister was the"" one who, in his opinion, would fill the bill. Ifc is a ; strange thing, if he wanted to keep the party spirit out, that he, did not pick on some one else. The party man is acceptable fco fche honourable member for Kooyong so. long as he belongs to the Nationalist party. If you speak about appointing a member of some other party, then you are "" introducing the party spirit."" The party spirit is all right if it been said against the appointment of comes from fche right side. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) invited the Prime Minister to take a risk. Naturally the Prime Minister does nofc want to take a risk, particularly as the honourable member for Balaclava described himself as a ""detached member."" I suppose that means that he does not now belong to the Nationalist party. Naturally, the Prime Minister is nofc taking any risks, Or accepting any invitations from a ""detached"" member. The position of the German people to-day who have been freed from the upkeep of an army and navy makes ours absurd. We went to war with Germany, we were told, to kill fche miltary spirit, and it was claimed to have been killed infchafccountry. which is the very thing we are going to wrangle about at. the Washington Conference. She has secured disarmament as a result of the war. We might well ask, remembering the present position of Germany, which has been freed from the burden of defence, while our own defence expenditure is ever mounting higher and higher, "" Who won the war?"" disease of militarism. We propose to send to Washington a delegate who is the very embodiment of militarism in this country. The amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has freed members of this party from responsibility for Senator Pearce's appointment. I hope that we bufc, failing that, a definite vote on the proposal to appoint Senator Pearce, so that those responsible for his appointment must accept; responsibility for it when the proper time comes. It is because I object to the appointment that I ain registering this protest against it . [6.12] -This is such an important matter that we should have a quorum present. [Quorum formed.'} There aTe two or three phases of this question to which I desire to address myself. They are: Who should be appointed; how the cablegrams that have been read, by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) managed to arrive in the nick of time; and what effect the Conference will have upon the disarmament of the nations. Much has Senator Pearce to represent Australia on the Disarmament Conference. Senator PeaTce and I are not very good friends; we have no use for one another. But I say, candidly, that I think Senator Pearce would be just as good a representative as anybody else. I say that because those at the Conference will not be able to do anything, and do not intend to do anything. Therefore, we might as well have Senator Pearce as a representative as have any one else. When shall we get away from being hypocritical, and trying to fool the people? We are telling them that this will be a Conference to consider disarmaments. We know that the nations of the world do not intend to disarm. They are grasping for land and Germany has got disarmament, for commerce to-day as much as ever they were. Do you think any of the great nations-the United States of America, for instance-wil l disarm and relinquish opportunities for extending its commerce in the future? Not much!

Representatives of the different countries will meet at Washington, and will fool the people as they have been fooled in the past. I will not say that they will enter the Conference deliberately with that^desire in their hearts, but they will not be really representatives of the views of the people. « We know the people who were behind the Nationalist political organizations at the last Federal elections, and worked to put members of the Ministerial party into the position which they occupy to-day. We know, too, that they will expect the party opposite to defend the interests of those who put them where they are. I can recall newspapers that were advocates of representatives of commercial interests, and they also will expect honourable members opposite to protect the interests of those to whom they owe their present position. The purpose is to secure for the commercial section of the community 'all the power they canhonestly if possible, but in any case to secure it. We talk about disarmament! What will take place? Every one in the world to-day knows that the United States of America and Japan are waiting to spring at each other. As a matter of fact, it has been said, and we can give some credence to-the statement, that one of the principal reasons why. the United States of America went into the last war was in order that Americans might arm and prepare for a conflict with Japan.

I feel strongly that I should not stand sponsor for anything that might be done at the Washington Disarmament Conference, because 1 know that what is done there will not be done iu the interests of the great mass of the people, but in the interest of the commercial section, since they only will be represented. The wisdom of sending to the Conference representatives of the different parties in this House is debatable. I am prepared to vote for the amendment submitted by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), but I am not enamoured of the proposal, because I cannot conceive that the representative of the Government at the Conference will be disposed to accept any advice from the representative of the party on this side. I do not know that I should be prepared to blame him on that account, because I tell honourable members candidlv that if the party on this side controlled this Parliament, I should want to rule the country, and should not permit representatives of other parties to rule it . I have little doubt that honourable members opposite hold the same views, though they may not be honest enough fo confess them.

But Japan is not the only nation to be appeased. It is possible that conditions might be accepted which would throw our markets open to the products of other countries, produced under conditions which would not be tolerated by the workers of Australia. I should not be prepared to accept disarmament under such conditions. The position would be very different if the world belonged to the workers. My objection to the inroad of coloured labour into Australia is not a racial one, but is based upon economic considerations. I recognise that the Japanese, the Indians, and the Chinese are, from their stand-point, as civilized as we are. BufcI can remember the conditions under which the people worked in India when I was there as a young man, and if these people were brought into this .country in hordes they would be prepared to work under similar conditions here. member agree to their admission to Australia if they lived under equal conditions with our own people? my objection to the coloured races is economic and not racial. The argument based on the question, "" Would you care . fco have one of these people as a son-inlaw?"" .has nothing whatever to do with me. I should just as strongly object to be closely associated with some people of European nations who, from the economic stand-point, I consider as .undesirable as prevent people who work under the conditions whicli are accepted in those countries from competing unfairly with the workers of Australia.

What he could have thought of us I do not know, but I think there was something in the statement whioh appeared in fche press concerning him.

We have been told to-night that Lord Northcliffe is going to Washington with his suite to watch the Disarmament Conference, and w ill 'be there foir .'twelve months.

There are men who still hope to make fortunes out of war. I , in common with the great",53,Earle Page Th E Cable Deliberation T O Use The Words Of
198,Mr Mathews,"I was dealing withmass of the people, am desirous ofdis-' .armament being brought about, but I -do not join with other honourable members of my party in expecting such a result from the forthcoming Conference. I know that the men who will attend there as delegates are representatives of the present capitalistic system, whose whole -desire is the making of money. Prior to the great war commercialism had no country; it was international. The great capitalists in all countries were interdependent, and those who controlled the manufacture of armaments in Great Britain, Germany, and France, and, indeed, throughout the world, were more or less in association. What they were in the past they will continue to be in the future. The first and cardinal principle for the Washington Conference to decide is that no private individual or corporation shall manufacture armaments of any description. Until that policy is agreed upon there cannot be the slightest hope of peace, because the financiers who invest their money in armament factories will see that there is war, so that they may get trade and fortunes out of it. We are told that the unemployment in Great Britain to-day and the discharge of great numbers of men from different industries is due to the fact that during the war capitalists were induced by the British Government to invest their profits in large establishments for the manufacture ©f munitions, and at the present time there is not sufficient demand for those commodities to keep the establishments occupied. The hope of the world is that all this machinery and capital may be employed in the manufacture of peacetime commodities. But the investors desire that the wheels of their establishments shall go round and they will see that that happens, even if they have to continue to manufacture armaments. Therefore, unless the Conference decides against the private manufacture of armaments, any proposal for disarmament will be futile. We know enough of the great commercial nations to feel sure that they will not attempt any limitation of that kind. This pretence of a desire on their.part to bring about disarmament is too thin, and I do not believe that the people of the United States of America or Great Britain are deceived by it. Therefore, from my point of view, Senator Pearce will be just as effective a representative as would his majesty the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). But I hope that Parliament will not make itself responsible for the action of the Australian delegate. Let Senator Pearce's selection be a party appointment by the Government, and let them accept the whole responsibility for it. It may be true, as an honourable member interjects, that the Country party has been whipped up, and will vote for the Government's motion. I do not desire to enter into a discussion at this moment as to the relations between the two parties opposite. WhilstI am an implacable party man and will support my colleagues, I hope they will not expect too much from the forthcoming Conference, no matter what they may desire in their hearts, and that they will not be mixed up in any way with the Australian representation. If they are, they will be held partly responsible for what is done at Washington. We know that, so far as'the workers whom we represent are concerned, the results of the Conference will be nil. I may be told that I am taking a pessimistic view. I would like to hold a better view of the so-called statesmen of the world, but past history teaches us that commercialism has no conscience. The men who represent capitalism will be at the Conference, and commercial greed will rise superior to every desire for peace and disarmament. AgainI express the hope that my party will not accept any representation at the Conference, even if the Government should offer it . Let the Government appoint their ""nominee, and let it be a party selection, because the mission is bound to be a failure. give notice that I intend to move a further amendment when the opportunity offers. I do not agree with either the proposition brought forward by the Government or with the amendment submitted by the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). I am one who is here to put forward the views of the working class as I understand them, and, to my mind, disarmament conferences, peace conferences, the Hague Tribunal, and such-like gatherings have been the favourite method of the ruling classes in the various countries of presenting one another with a Judas kiss prior to again",54,Earle Page Th E Cable Deliberation T O Use The Words Of

The open door in China! The open door in Siberia! The. Mandated Territories in the Pacific! Why are all these questions of such vital importance at the present moment? It is because the European market, owing to the existing crisis, has failed both Great Britain and the United States of America, and British and Japanese economic interests, which r u n hand in hand, are opposed to those of America. The Country party in this Parliament entered in to a truce to allow the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) to go to the Imperial Conference in order to save Australia's in terests in the Pacific, and this House solemnly debated whether it would agree to the renewal of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty or not. Bepresentatives of the Dominions were summoned to meet in London, and they also solemnly discussed whether or not they would renew the Alliance; but when it was found that Canadian opinion and that of SouthA f r i c a were against its renewal, it was themselves? The Imperial capitalists of suddenly discovered that the LordH i g h Chancellorof Great Britain was the only person in the Empire who knew the exact date upon which it would expire.

But who have been responsible for developing this menace to Australia, if menace it be; who have brought the Japanese people lip to their present state of efficiency which makes them such a menace ? Who, but the British capitalists? During the last three years we have had a great deal of talk about making the world safe for democracy and about fighting a war to protect the small nations.

Why? We may be sure it is not to play skittles. of our talking about the coloured menace to Australia, when we are in alliance with the greatest coloured Power in the world ? We have the Prime Minister putting forward reasons for the continuance of that alliance, and yet that very although it does not pledge Great Britain tp fight against America, compels it to come to the assistance of Japan in that very locality where American and British interests may clash, namely Asia. war breaks out between Japan and the United States of America does any one believe that Great Britain will not take full advantage of it?

207,Mr Considine,"Does the honorstages of the war he was returned .to office as the man who had kept America out of the war; but he was not back in office six months before he had led the United States of America into the war. The Disarmament Conference is merely the prelude to a clash with Great Britain. In 1924 the American Navy w i ll have become superior to the British Navyi n fleet units, weight of armament, and speed. The American mercantile marine is now but one-third less in numbers of vessels than the British; prior to the great war it was a negligible quantity. Great Britain is in debt to the United States of America to the extent of something like £1,000,000,000. One reads oi continual complaints in the British press concerning the economic weapon which is thus provided for the hands of American capitalists to wield, and one reads of the refusal of the United States of America authorities to discuss the question of releasing Great Britain from the debt. Honourable members, I know, are impatient of listening to my views, but they will slavishly support the Government in sending their chosen delegate to the Conference. So far as I ami conoerned, Senator Pearoe. may as well attend a,t Washington as anybody else, fer all the good or harm he or any other man will do there. I do not think any good will accrue froin it to the working people of this country, or of Great Britain, or of the United States of America, or of Japan. The Conference merely amounts to an effort to fool the workers again. What is the use to them of all the talk about l i m i isting order is international in its scope tation -of armaments? prevent war? If there is to be a limitation of v-ar-ship building, will not the relative positions of the nations remain the same? W ill Great Britain agree to any scheme or process of limitation which will permit the United States of America to oust the British Navy from the position of superiority which it now enjoys, and has for so long held ? The attempt to exploit the working class and to force upon it the idea of disarmament is in tended solely for the purpose of continuing to hold the working class enslaved. It is only when the working class of Russia has demonstrated that it can be no longer misled concerning where its real interests lie that one hears men like the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr. Watt) complain that Russia to-day possesses the greatest actual and potential [468 ] army in the world. When speaking upon another question some nights ago, I stated, that it would not be long before vested interests in this country would be doing their best to wipe out compulsory military training. These people are beginning to see that their welfare does not lie in training the working class in the arts of warfare. They believe now in trying to get the nations to enter into some form of organization which will permit a limitation of armaments, while at the same time, however, preserving an international army that can be manipulated to strike at revolt, no matter where it may be aroused, or to hurl its forces upon any country which may disagree with the capitalistic League of Nations. In speaking thus, I have set for t h the idea behind the League. of Nations. In opposition to this project the revolutionary workers of Europe have organized themselves into a league of free peoples, in the Third Internationalej and it is from that source, or nucleus, that the working classes of the world are making their protests against war. The only way in which the working people can prevent war is by refusing to fight. War will cease only when, the workers of the world refuse to carry out the orders given them by their various Governments, who fain would hurl them at each other's throats.

Australia, unfortunately, is the only country in the world which reviles its delegates before they are sent abroad, and deserts them when they have lef t its shores. That has been the experience of every statesman who has been asked to represent this country in the councils of the nations across the seas; and this evening's performance is but a f a in t replica of what occurred when the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) firsb went to Great Britaini n connection with war matters. vituperation that has been poured out on tbe delegate whom it is proposed to send on the present occasion, is feeble in comparison with whatwas said on the previous occasion to which I refer. In the case way for securing effective work than this of SenatorE . D . Millen, who was the next' representative, the press of this country showed him the same lack of support in his mission, and displayed the same failure to appreciate his work, as in the case of the Prime Minister. Now, when Australia again needs a representative to place our views before the representatives of other nations of the world, instead of uniting as one people in suppoi-ting the hands of a man who has a difficult task to perform, members of the National Parliament are spending time in finding fault, and venting personal spleen, for past acts and political shortcomings. That is not the way to insure that Australia's case shall be properly represented at the Washington Conference. member think that the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) can fittingly represent Australia? entirely from the views of the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best), and those of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). watched the operations of constitutional government in this country, and have read of what has been done elsewhere under the British system of government.

Holding this view, I say unhesitatingly that the responsiN o ; he bility of sending a delegate to the Washpeople. ington Conference rests with the Government of the day. It is their duty to select the best man at their disposal, and it is our duty to support that choice u n t i l the mission has been completed.

B y what wonderful process could the divergent opinions of sueh persons be co-ordinated so that the Government delegate would be able to present them to the Conference as the views of Australia ? The suggestion of the honourable member for Kooyong is that Parliament should select the man. If Parliament selected a representative, he would represent very probably, not the wellconsidered judgment of honourable members, but more likely opinions to which the majority of them were opposed. To select a representative of Australia to go to the Washington Conference by an appeal to party prejudices and divisions would be the worse method that could be devised. I stand strongly for the principle of responsible government, that the representative who attends such a conference should be a Cabinet Minister responsible to this Parliament. He should be appointed by the Government of the day, which is responsible to this Parliament. Such a delegate would be under the control of the Government in every action he took at the Conference the British Government over Mr Bonar has been suggested that Mr Lloyd George Law? tish.

I would like now to refer to the had arrived at a decision. There! was not atmosphere in which the debate on the slightest attempt to produce any this important topic commenced. At the opening of this discussion arguments were based upon the assumption that the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) was deceiving the Housej and that there had been some collusion between the Prime Minister of Australia and the Prime Minister of GreatB r it a in ( Mr Lloyd George). The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the I listened Country party (Dr. Earle Page) said that the House was being misled, that documents were being withheld in order that we should nob be able to get f u l l information, and that the whole scheme was the result of influencing the British GoI f conscription were to be disvernment to send a cablegram to the Prime Minister at an opportune time to enable action to be taken. the facts that have since been disclosed, I am surprised that honourable members opposite should say ""hear, hear."" I know some honourable members live in such an atmosphere of suspicion and espionage that they see in everything done some evil intent and purpose. W h at is the suggestion made? It is that the Prime Minister has been misleading the public by the alleged concealment of facts, by telling lies and distorting matters, and that he is a person so powerful that he can create a like atmosphere in Great Britain. Isi t to be thought that the Prime Minister can make the British Prime Minister an implement in his hand for deceiving the people of Australia?

249,Mr Hector Lamond,"Thos e who ( Mr Brennan) spoke for a while .abouta ""White Australia is involved, and Australia can rest assured that Pearce is thoroughly conversant w i th a l l the aspects of that important question. He is one of those who fought for a ""White Australia when it was an unpopular policy, and he has had opportunities of administering a great Department during the crucial years of the war. He knows the Australian mind upon this question as well as any other man in this country with the exception, perhaps, of the Prime Minister himself. We should be thankf u l that the advocacy of the principle does not rest in the hands of the honourable member for Batman or the honourable member for Barrier. It was interesting to listen to the honourable member for Batman. t i l he came to the point at whicli he had to declare that Australia could only i m pose the policy of a White Australia by force of arms, and then he left us with the impression that, so f a r as he was concerned, no force of arms would be behind any principle. for Barrier is in exactly the same position. orable member said he would not fight for the principle of a White Australia or anything; else. sort. I said I would not fight for the capitalist interests, but for my own. concerned about the language in which the honourable member thoughts. The fact is that no nation in the world can say that it believes i u any principle as a matter of national honour, and hope to maintain it under existing conditions, unless, in the last resort, its people are prepared to fight for it . No matter how much the sentimental side of this question may appeal to> each and every one of us: no matter how great may be the desire, of every honourable member in this Parliament for the coming of the time when peace shall reign throughout the world, we have to face matters as we find them to-day. We shall not help the cause of peace by allowing this country to become the property of some other nation. We shall not advance the cause of peace b v . allowing Asiatic hordes to come here in unlimited numbers, as undoubtedly they would come if some one were not prepared to bar the way. NotSenator withstanding all the eloquence displayed by th© honourable member for Batman this afternoon, in his satirical references to the British Navy, it still is a fact that neither he nor the honourable member for Barrier would be free to expound his views in this Parliament if it were not for the strength and power of that Navy. So far from reviling this protection as they have done,they should go on their knees and thank whatever gods they recognise that the strength of the British Navy is such as 'to enable them, in these free in stitutions of ours, to express their individual opinions as they have done to-night.

I believe tliat, whether we are able to secure any reduction of naval expenditure or not, nothing but pood can come froin the concentration of the world's thought upon the problems that will be presented for consideration at the Conference, and for thafc reason, if for no other.

The honourable inember for Balaclava was then Leader of the Hbuse; but we were never able to complete the debate on the case. When the honourable member for Balaclava was asked the question in Launceston, he did not even then dare to say that there was anything dishonourable in the charge against Mr. Jensen; in fact, no charge was made. The honourable member for Illawarra has praised him. Then let that honourable The Kaiser member explain the robbery of the people's'money for the phantom regiment in New South Wales.

Even the Prime Minister would be far greater and wiser. He has more courage and more cunning. He has greater knowledge of the affairs of the Empire than ten men like Senator Pearce. If the Prime Minister were accompanied by a member of the Country party and a member of the Opposition, notwithstanding the unkind remarks from the honourable member for Hlawarra, I feel sure that it would be a useful delegation, because the Americans, especially on the Western side, have to face difficulties much like ours. the three of us?

We cannot do better than follow the example of Japan which, under the wisdom of its He great statesmen, honoured our race and our language by appealing to our greatest philospher, Herbert Spencer, for enlightenment as to how their country could avoid giving offence to European nations.

Japan was advised to allow no ownership or leasehold of land by foreigners, and to permit Europeans to remain in the country only as tenants.

The letter to which I have referred is to be found on page 321 of Duncan's Life and Letters of Herbert Spencer.

We have had here lately a great lord of journalism. What did the newspaper now owned by him, the London Times, in its brutality, say when the fine spirit of Herbert Spencer had passed away? Shortly after Herbert Spencer's death his letter was sent from Tokio for publicatiou in the Times of the 18th. January, 1904. The Times wrote of it as givingAdvice as narrow, as much imbued with nntipathy to real progress, as ever came from a self-sufficient, short-sighted mandarin, bred in contempt and hatred of barbarism.

Why cannot we say to them that if any Australian is allowed to own land in their country, we will allow them to own thirteen times as much in and for every Australian who has settled in their country, we will allow Japanese to settle here ?

The history of China is one of the most wonderful histories of the world. I have gone to those more learned than myself for information. China did not increase her wonderful frontiers by wars. She did it by holding feast, days, and by inviting clever and leading men to participate in the feast and holy days. The guests, finding that the settled government of China was better than their own, asked to be allowed to come into tire community of the Chinese race. Thafc is the way bhe nation extended its borders. No nation can be braver than the Japanese race.

In The Future, We Should Some Day Reach","were so undecided about this matter that they had to wait for the Prime Minister, and he had to feel the pulse of the people outside and obtain some idea of what they desired, before he had the courage to make any proposal in connection with the representation of Australia at the Washington Disarmament Conference. Is that an evidence of responsible government? Why the delay in dealing with this matter when it has been agitating the minds of the people of every country from the day President Harding issued his invitation to the nations of the world ? The proposal to hold a Conference gave a gleam of hope to suffering humanity staggering under the effects of the great war an* the preparations for further wars, but the Government seemed to treat it almost with contempt until questions were asked on the subject and press reports appeared. It would seem that we are d r if t in g from responsible governmeut and are being governed by the daily press, who wrongly claim to interpret the desires of the people of this country. There is another aspect of this matter on which I should like to touch. We cannot disguise the fact that in the hurly-burly of political campaigns certain suspicions are aroused in the minds of those opposed to each other in politics. Amongst the supporters of different parties, rightly or wrongly, there arise suspicions of their political opponents. If the Australian delegation in Washington is to be free from that political suspicion, it w ill be necessary to satisfy opposing political forces outside that their views w ill be expressed by a direct representative of themselves. We know that suspicion extends beyond political parties, and that different nations suspect each other, and it is this suspicion that leads .to thc wars we are trying to prevent. The statement appeared in the press in Great Britain and was cabled here that, only a few months ago, I think in the House of Commons, the Prime Minister of GreatB r it a in made a speech in which he said that no nation was responsible for the war through which we have just passed. We know what was said to the effect that it was the desire of a particular nation to dominate the world's affairs ( Mr Hector Lamond) said that no doubt that led to the war, and now Mr Lloyd the White Australia policy will be disGeorge tells the world that no particular Mr Lazzarini. nation made the war, and that Europe simply blundered into the war. I hope that we shall do nothing to begin that blundering again because of the character of the delegation we send to Washington Conference. I have one word to say concerning the representation of Australia proposed by the Government. I cannot say anything of a personal nature about the gentleman whom the Government have selected. I have never addressed a word to h i m in my life. I have never formally met h i m , and I know h i m as Senator Pearce only by sight. But I should like to say that if the Washington Disarmament Conference is going to be a Conference of WarM in isters-of men who have been saturated with the spirit of war since 1914I have little hope of good results from it. It is an absurdity that the very man who is to go to Washington to advocate disarmament as a representative of Ausrralia should be the man who is to-day flying in the face of the views expressed by President Harding 'that military expenditure should be curtailed or, at least, should not be increased until the Conference takes place. He is asking for in creased expenditure on naval, military, and air services, showing clearly that he cannot r i d his mind of the idea of further preparations for war by heaping up the expenditure on armaments. For that reason, I should like to see some other delegate selected. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) said, in answer to the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) , that the broad lines of the action to be taken by the Australian delegate would bo submitted to this Parliament. That has always been done in connection with past conferences, but discussion at the Conference may altogether change the outlook and make it necessary tliat further instructions should be given. I am honestly of the opinion that, once Senator Pearce leaves Australian shores for Washington, he will be in daily, communication, by wireless and cable, with the Prime Minister, and although Senator Pearce will speak at the Conference, he will be merely the mouthpiece of the Prime Minister. The honourable member for Illawarra cussed at the Conference, and that nobody could speak on that subject with better authority than Senator Pearce, because of his long advocacy of the principle. I wish I could hold the same opinion, but I am fearfu l of the fate of the White Australia policy in the hands of the proposed delegate because, on other occasions, men who had championed that policy in Australia were only lukewarm supporters of it at conferences abroad. For the last six years the attitude of Senator Pearce has been similar to the attitude of other members on the Ministerial side who at one time championed that policy, but to-day in serving the interests they now represent, show themselves at least lukewarm upon that great national question. policy before the honourable member was heard of. I hope that I shall not be found deserting my principles as quickly as they deserted theirs. In regard to the controversy about the cablegrams, it is an unfortunate characteristic of the Prime Minister that whenever an issue of grave importance is before the House, he tries to enshroud it in a cloud of mystery. I must confess that when listening to the reading of the cable messages, I , like other honourable members, concluded that they were in answer to earlier cables. WhilstI do not question the Prime Minister's denial on that point, I am convinced that the cables fro m England have been inspired by messages sent from Australia by somebody. I again urge the House to support the amendment moved by the Acting Leader of the Opposition, because! I feel sure that if we appoint three delegates representing the different parties in this House, who speak for three different schools of thought, we shall not only increase the strength of the delegationo and enable better work to be done at' Washington, but we shall, create amongst the people greater confidence: than they can feel if the only delegate is one appointed by the Government. President Harding did not invite Australia to send a representative to the Conference at Washington is not surprising to me. Representatives of the British Empire were invited, and it would be unreasonable to suppose that had the British Government convened that Conference they would have invited representatives of the Dependencies of the United States of America. I think President Harding has properly regarded the British Empire as one entity. But I agree with those who feel that the family attachment or expression should have representation at the Conference in the manner proposed. Although we are confident that the Government of the Mother Country would represent our in terests satisfactorily to the f u l l extent of their knowledge, there are some matters out here with which they cannot be expected to be f u l l y acquainted. It is, therefore, necessary that there should be this attachment to the British delegation in order to acquaint it with Australia's aspirations. There are some items in the agenda paper of the Conference which T h a t may be, but make it all the more necessary that Australia should be represented at Washington. The debates will not be confined to questions affecting disarmament, or the reduction of armaments. For example there is the matter of the "" open, door."" Doubtless the Washington Conference will be a concentrated League of Nations Conference. The United States of America did not consider it in their in terest to come into that League, and, possibly, in the invitation issued by President Harding, we may find a way out of the difficulty. A t any rate, many subjects likely to arise in the discussions of the members of the League of Nations, not only disarmament, b u t also questions relating to the removal of the causes of war, may be debated at Washington, as indeed the agenda'paper indicates. The administration of Mandated Territories may be discussed. We in Australia who hold a large territory with such a small population, and stand for a. White Australia, yet seem anxious to exercise a Mandate over a black Polynesia, may suffer a disadvantage by not being represented at this Conference. Agencies may be at work in the absence of an Australian delegation to raise the question of our suitability to govern a dark Polynesia, or exercise a Mandate over the greater portion of the Pacific Islands. We have not shown that we have the greatest friendliness or fatherly care towards the people of those islands in our fiscal policy. Since we came into control of them, we have thought of ourselves first. The",69,Opposition Members Hear Hear

I cannot imagine that the good sense of Australia would wilfully take up the stand that we ought to exploit them, but certainly if we are to exercise a Mandate over these islands for their benefit, progress, and general development, we must give the matter consideration in this House. I would have preferred the debate to>-day to continue on those lines, so that when our delegate is sent by the Government, whose respon-. sibility and prerogative to make the choice I do not contest for one moment, he will be able to represent the considered opinion of this House upon the main principles we stand by, particularly those which have come under our responsibility by our acceptance of a Mandate over these Territories. Unquestionably, apart from the subject of disarmament, which we all claim we wish to see brought about, matters affecting the removal of the causes of war, and the need for disarmament will be discussed. are no quarrels among the nations, tbere .will be no need for armaments. quarrel about, there will beno need for arms. ber is opposed to any one bearing arms or shedding blood, except himself.

It is . rather regrettable that he should occupy so much time in trying to discredit the intentions of the great nations which, I believe, are earnest in their desire to devise some means of bringing about, a permanent peace, and removing the need for armaments. An honourable member who cries for peace and good will among men, and yet when one commences to talk about the removal of the causes of war, and arms that k ill people, questions their sincerity, is nothing b u t a cynic, and clearly has no f a it h in anything but himself. He ought to be in Russia, and not in a free and great country like this, where every adult has the franchise, nor in a House such as this, putting forward theories about taking the control out of the hands of those who are chosen to guide and govern the people, and creating a proletariat that alone will be armed in order to force their crank will upon other sections of the community. The honourable member must indeed feel blessed that he is permitted to live in a community that permits him to sit in a House, and compels others to sit and listen to talk on such lines for the length of time he has occupied to-night.

If there is one question more than an-' other that should be discussed at the present juncture, it is. that of the disarmament of the nations, in order to prevent possible further bloodshed. Such vital"" questions should be referred to the true representatives of the people, and not to those who express the views of only one thing to say against the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), but I do not. think .that he is capable of expressing the opinions held by a majority of the people on the question, of disarmament. The amendment moved by the honorable member for South Sydney( Mr Riley) has much to commend it, because it provides that the delegate shall be selected by the representatives of the whole of the people. Thelegislative enactments of this Parliament since the advent of Labour in 1902 show that the representatives of the masses have done much to improve the conditions of the people.

I w ill bring up every speaker I can on this side of the House. In his absence I never got such treatment from the right honourable member for Parramatta ( Sir Joseph Cook). If the honourable member will move the adjournment we will have a division on the motion. It is about time the Prime Minister was taught his place. prepared to speak on this question tonight-it is a big question, requiring much considerationI do not propose to let the matter go in silence. H a d the amendment been to l i m it the choice to this House, and to take the responsibility for the choice out of the hands of the Government, we could easily have come to a decision. I am convinced that the majority of the members of this House are against any interference w i th the responsibility of the Administration to deal with questions of this sort. As to whether a representative should be chosen from this House or the other, I think there w ill be a wide division of opinion, but, as it is in this House that the Administration lives or dies, and as this House has control of the Government of the country, it is from it that a man should go to represent us on such broad and far-reaching problems as will be dealt with at this Conference. . That is my view, and I think it is the view of the majority. We *have not had time to go into this question f u l l y. It is so wide in its ramifications that one needs some hours to look into it . On the broad issue of our representation at Washington, this at least can be said, that, seeing we have to meet the best brains of the world, in the country which, above all others, prides itself on its way of doing business, and as there w ill be present the hardest-headed representatives of the countries so deeply interested in tihe Pacific, it is essential that Australia should send the most capable man it can. This House is, I believe, in a position to fumi9h a man who w ill be able to meet the situation. Without saying anything derogatory of the delegate already suggested, it seems to me that he is not the r i g h t person to send, because whatever may be said for or against h i m , no one w i ll accuse him of being overloaded w i th driving power. No one w ill contend for one moment that he is a man of strong force of character, able to i m press his views on those who hold contrary opinions. The man we send to America must be capable of expressing his views in the strongest possible form. There is no mincing of words over there. To send a representative to America is quite a different matter from sending one to the Old Country. In Europe a man may win through by smoothness of A l t h o u g h I was not manner and suavity of address, but in America he has to do it by force. We should have a delegate w i th sufficient force of character to impress upon those gathered at the great Conference the opinions, wishes, and aspirations of this young country of ours. I am not one of those who think that such tremendous consequences depend on this Conference. I believe that the greatest questions confronting the world have already been settled. I think this Conference will not have so much power and force as the League of Nations, but it would be a very bad policy on our part to send to it a man who had not sufficient strength of character and suavity of address to make himself felt. There is"" no country in the world where a man requires more force, and where there is more contempt for what may be considered weakness, than ' in America.
