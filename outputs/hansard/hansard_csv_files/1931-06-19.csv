Members of Parliament have occupied certain of the residences while on vacation, and have paid the same rentals as those paid by the general public. 3. (a) Yes. Certain surplus stores were transferred from Canberra to the college residences to make such residences revenue producing. (6) Yes. Two boats were purchased for use of tenants. Fishing being an attraction, it was necessary to have boats, which are hired by the tenants for the above purpose. 4. Yes. It is essential that the Commonwealth property at the college site should be safeguarded. When the college was vacated certain workmen with their families were left, and those were taken over to maintain and look after the property, clay and night. They work only part time, their employment being rationed and of a temporary nature. 5. Yes. Since the removal of the college the residences have been l it by kerosene lamps. This practice involves a grave fire risk, and, as the buildings are equipped with electrical fittings for lighting, it is considered essential that a small plant should be installed for this purpose. 0. It is necessary in the interests of the Commonwealth that, if possible, revenue should be obtained from this property, and the only way to achieve this purpose is to let the residences and other buildings to the general pnblic. upon notice1.

B ill brought up and read a first time. for Home Affairs) [10,56]-by leave I move That the bill be now read a second time. Altnough the bill is a small one, it is nevertheless important, providing as it does for a jurisdiction for the residents of Jervis Bay, a portion of the Federal Territory. The Judiciary Act of 1927 provided for the repeal of section 11 of the Weat of Government Administration Act of 1910, the section which provided for the continuance in the territory of the Seat of Government of the jurisdiction of the several inferior courts of New South Wales. Under that section the in ferior courts of New South Wales dealt with all cases arising either at Jervis Bay and at the Seat of Government. The Court of Petty Sessions Ordinance of 1930 provided for the establishment of a Court of Petty Sessions at Canberra to deal w i th matters which previously had been subject to New South Wales jurisdiction, but, although a court was established at Canberra, obviously one could not be established at Jervis Bay, because of the expense; and a magistrate could not be sent from Canberra to Jervis Bay, nor could litigants be brought from Jervis Bay to Canberra. A t present, therefore, there is no court to which l it i gants at Jervis Bay may have access. The procedure prior to the establishment of a Court of Petty Sessions at Canberra, was to have cases arising at Jervis Bay dealt w i th under the New South Wales jurisdiction at Nowra. This small, amending bill w ill permit, of that procedure being reverted to. much litigation at Jervis Bay? Mr' BLAKELEY ^ No t much. We are hoping that this procedure w ill not be availed of to any great extent, but nevertheless there must be some inferior court to which the residents of Jervis Bay may have access. For that reason I commend the bill to honourable members. The object of the bill is very desirable, and has been f u l l y explained by the M i nister. But there is one thing which I do not quite understand, and that is why this amendment is inserted in the Seat of Government Administration Act, because these matters have been dealt with in the Judiciary Act. It is proposed to insert the new provision after section 10 of the Seat of Government Administration Act, which provides for the government of the Territory generally. Unfortunately, I am unable at the moment to ascertain the latest form of that act, as the statutes of last year are not immediately available. However, I have no objection to raise to the bill.

This measure will apply only to Jervis Bay. In reply to the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), who asked, by interjection, whether any change would be necessary in the New South Wales law, I h-ave to say that litigants at Jervis Bay may, if the measure is passed, approach the courts of New South Wales. Prior to the inauguration of inferior courts at Canberra, New South Wales jurisdiction prevailed throughout the Federal Capital. By this bill we shall revert to the former procedure so far as Jervis Ba,y is concerned. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: The bill. I desire to know whether this amending measure will put the residents of Jervis Bay into the position that they would have been, in, so far as their legal rights are concerned, had Jervis Bay not, been separated from the State of New South Wales? AlthoughI was a member of the New South Wales Parliament at the time that Jervis Bay was ceded to the Commonwealth, I am not aware whether that territory was taken over by the Commonwealth on the same terms as those which applied in the case of Canberra. I think the terms were the same. Canberra is now subject to the law of the Commonwealth, and, in some respects, also to the law of the States; but where there is a conflict between the two jurisdictions the federal law prevails. If this measure is agreed to, I should like to know whether the position at Jervis Bay will be the same as it is now in Canberra. I believe that the bill is necessary, and I raise no objection to its passing, but I should like to be informed on the points I have mentioned. for Home Affairs) [11.4] -The position at Jervis Bay will, after the passing of Home Affairs) [11.1] -With this measure, be practically the same as that which obtained at Canberra prior Sessions in this city.

The people whom honourable members are supposed to represent will be influenced, not so much by the speeches as by the manner in which their representatives record their votes.

57,Mr Beasley,"I admit that theIn introducing the bill, the Prime Minister referred to the circumstances which have existed in Australia during the last eighteen months. He mentioned particularly the increasing governmental expenditure. The figures quoted by the right honourable gentleman are not available to honourable members at the moment, because on this occasion the ordinary course of having the debate adjourned immediately was not followed. Not having had an opportunity the figures quoted by the Prime Minister, we must accept them as correct. No one will deny that there has been an increase in governmental expenditure during the last eighteen months, but the reasons for that increase are easily ascertainable. In a period of serious economic depression, when unemployment is rife, it is obvious that governmental expenditure in certain directions will be heavier than in normal times. That is so particularly in the case of invalid and old-age pensions. It has been the proud boast of the sons and daughters of Australian citizens that they regard as a solemn obligation the care of their aged ov invalid parents when they are no longer able to provide for themselves. stances of many of those sons and daughters are such that they cannot render the assistance that they would otherwise gladly give. They are among, the 400,000 of our workers who are unemployed. It is clear, therefore, that a greater demand must be made on governments for both invalid and old-age pensions. Tho same arguments apply with almost equal force in the case of soldiers who have been granted pensions during the last eighteen months. Because of unemployment, numbers of soldiers have applied for pensions for which they would not have applied, had regular employment been found for them, as they had a right to expect would be the case. Eor the reasons which I have given-many -it ment expenditure in certain directions has necessarily increased during recent months, but also that that expenditure cannot be avoided in the future if the Government is to honour its obligations to proMr Beasley. vide at least the necessaries of life-so far as they are provided by these pensions -to those in need. Previous budgets contained proposals for economy on the one hand, and for increases of revenue on the other hand, which were repugnant to the people whom the Government is supposed to represent. The tax on tea comes particularly within this category. The primage duty and the sales tax have failed to provide the revenue anticipated. In to check the financial statement which he presented to us as . Acting-Treasurer some months ago, the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Lyons) made an estimate of the result of the proposals then introduced with the object of raising additional revenue. No doubt the honourable gentleman believed that his anticipations would be realized. The fact remains, however, that neither he nor the officers whom he then controlled were able to foresee what would occur. The times through which we have passed since then have been so abnormal that any calculation can scarcely be said to have been more than guess work. Knowing the difficulty of preparing reliable estimates in such circumstances, I am not now offering any criticism of the honourable But to-day the circumgentleman's statements. No doubt he thought that as a result of his policy, conditions would have righted themselves to some extent; but we now know that they have gone from bad to worse. The position is now vastly different from what it was at the time to which I have just referred, because with more men out of work, it is, if I may use the term, more impossible than ever to obtain revenue from the taxation from which it was hoped to obtain it several months ago and which is again proposed by the Treasurer. It is suggested that, in addition to cuts in pensions and other adjustable government expenditure, there should be an increase of the sales tax from 2Â£ per cent, to 5 per cent., with a view to obtaining an additional Â£4,000,000 of revenue. Those who presented the figures to the more could be advanced House know best the basis on which they is clear, not only that governwere arrived at; but how can any real basis be arrived at in the present situation ? It would appear that the estimate of Â£4,-000,000 has been based on similar calculations to those that were adopted in connection with previous budgets, but were subsequently proved to be erroneous. It must be obvious that, with substantial reductions in tbe salaries of public servants and other government employees, as well as in pensions, and with continued unemployment there must be restricted purchasing power and a consequent falling off in the revenue obtainable from a sales tax. I fail to see that the Government can obtain increased revenue to the extent of .Â£4,000,000 by means of a policy which must result in reducing the purchasing power of the people. It is thought that the additional revenue from the primage duty will be Â£2,400,000. As members of the Country party have indicated their opposition to the proposed increase, I take it that they consider that the circumstances of the primary producers are such that they are unable to bear any further burden in that respect, and I am in entire agreement with them. ThoughI represent an industrial constituency,I have relatives associated with primary production, and I am familiar with conditions on the land. If the Government considers that tbe budget can be balanced in this way, Ministers are shutting their eyes to the existing cona reduction. It was said by the Prime ditions. primary producers can carry that burden better than can the people in the industrial portions of the metropolitan areas. policy of the Government was intended to protect the workers in the industrial centres against a flood of imports from cheap-labour countries, and thus provide extra employment for our own people, but, the result has been the opposite. The circumstances of the industrial workers' of Australia are such that unemployment has now reached alarming proportions. The hopes entertained regarding the protectionist policy have not been realized. The worse feature, to my mind, is that although we intended it to protect the workers, and to maintain wages and conditions that were acceptable to the trade union movement, the Government has not faithfully adhered to that policy, but has allowed a section of the manufacturers to receive protection, and obtain high profits, while tile workers in those industries have been forced to submit to a reduction of wages and a lowering of other conditions of employment. That is, the reason why the group with which I am associated opposed the textile duties. The revenue that the Government expects to collect under this measure cannot be obtained if we may be guided by the information that has been made available in the last eighteen months. Nobody knows this better than the Treasurer himself. It cannot be said that he is not abreast of what is happening in Australia. According to his OAVII figures, in spite of the new policy of reductions and additional taxes, the budget will be at least Â£4,500,000 down, and it is safe to predict that there will be a deficit of about Â£10,000,000 at the end of the financial year. I now turn to the consideration of the other proj>osals that have been outlined by the Government, the details of which are not yet fully known. During the last few months, a big controversy has occurred on the subject of a reduction of interest rates, payable by Australia. The result is pleasing to those who have all along stressed the necessity for such Minister that the first occasion on Avhich tion was at the recent conference held in Melbourne; but that statement is not quite correct, and the Prime Minister knows it. At the Premiers Conference in February, Mr Lang, Premier of New Soutii ""Wales, directed public attention to the heavy interest burdens of the country, and I think that it may be claimed that the East Sydnej by-election brought the r real facts to light, and caused the average Australian to think seriously of the enormous interest burden which this country is called upon to bear. A comparison was made at that time which caused comment in quarters where the matter would not otherwise have been discussed: I refer to the comparison between the interest payments of Australia and those of foreign countries with respect to debts owing to Great Britain.

Another member of the board, Mr Beading, is Chairman of the BritishAustralasian Tobacco Company, which is one of the strongest financial institutions in Australia at the present time. I believe that its profits last year totalled over Â£1,000,000. Doubtless Mr Reading is also interested in a number of other financial institutions from which the Government has desired to obtain relief. It is only natural that his decisions would be favorable to his political associates, and to his own interests. It is futile for any honourable member of this House to try to make it appear that these institutions are free from party political bias. govern all their actions. To those who talk about political control I would say that the only control which they favour is that which may be exercised by the Nationalist association. I can safely say that in the list of those who are controlling the private banking institutions of Australia to-day, there will not be found the name of one gentleman who is associated with the Labour movement. The average person needs no guidance from me to enable him to determine, the nature of the control that is exercised over the finances of this country. If that were not so, the arguments of my honourable friends opposite would be more widely accepted in this country.

72,Mr Beasley,"It can be said of thewas said that that would be repudiation, but now, of course, the policy having been accepted by our opponents, it is quite respectable. honourable members opposite wrung their hands and wiped their brows, and said that any man who suggested such a thing should not be permitted to mix in decent society. But to-day, owing to the pressure of circumstances, a new formula is provided. No longer must the term "" repudiation "" be applied to the act of reducing interest. Such action is quite respectable to-day-so respectable as to give satisfaction, not only to the Government, but also to the hardest headed Tories. For once in this Parliament all sections are showing a united front, and are expounding the view that we can safely follow along these lines without any fear of our action being regarded as repudiation. honourable member mean to say that this is the Lang plan? that the action suggested by Mr Lang was characterized as, repudiation, .but that what is now suggested by the Nationalist party and the Government is claimed to be entirely different. Whatever arguments honourable members may adduce, and whatever criticism they may offer, the one outstanding fact is that the people are beginning to realize the true position. The meetings that we have addressed, and the contacts that we have made during the last three months, have shown us that our point of view in this controversy is being so widely accepted as to cause consternation in the ranks of not only the party opposite, but also the party that supports this Government. It is suggested that, as a general averment loans. I advise them also to convene age, the interest rates on internal loans shall be reduced to 4 per cent. There has been so' much talk of equality of sacrifice that it is pertinent to inquire whether bondholders are actually being called upon to make any sacrifice. The fact is accepted by the Treasurer and the Government that the purchasing power of the pound to-day is greater than it was two years ago. Logically, therefore, the purchasing power of the amount invested in loans when money was plentiful must also be greater to-day than at the time when those investments were made. During the period that the deflationary process has been operating, investments that The friends of nominally returned an interest rate of 5 per cent, have been worth at least 8 per cent. Therefore, while the real wages of all workers throughout the 'Commonwealth have been slashed, the bondholders have been permitted to extract from the public purse much more than they were justly entitled to receive. That has been their lot during the last two years. Consequently the present proposals will merely place them upon the level that tbey should have occupied in accordance with the increase in purchasing power brought about by the process of deflation. But they have a still further advantage in that an investment of Â£500 is worth at least Â£600 to-day, compared with the time when it was made. A careful analysis of the position discloses that under this the so-called economic plan the bondholders, whose interest rates are to be reduced to 4 per cent., will not be called on to make any real sacrifice at all. The sacrifices to be made by those in receipt of war, invalid, and old-age pensions will be infinitely greater than the sacrifice which will be made by those who are in receipt of interest from bonds. An attempt is also being made by the Government to interfere with the present wage system by the arbitrary cutting down of public servants' salaries, but I advise those who are likely to be affected by the proposals of the Government in this respect to take pains to have clearly demonstrated the inequality of the sacrifice that is being, proposed, and to focus public attention upon the smallness of the artificial sacrifice which is being asked of those in receipt of interest on Governmass meetings and other gatherings of that nature in order to direct the attention of the people to what is taking place, and to make it evident that the Government is absolutely surrendering its rights and powers to the banking institutions of this country; that it is deserting the working class and disregarding their interests for the purpose of introducing a system which is in the interest of the employers and the lifelong enemies of our people.",20,Parkhixl The A Proposal Had Been Made In That Direc

74,Mr Beasley,"It is remarkableWith respect to the point which the right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr it will be provided under such conditions Scullin) endeavoured to make, that the policy which the Government has now adopted will be the means of providing work for a number of those who are unemployed, I may say that, even if additional employment is provided, which I very much doubt, it will be employment only under conditions which are not acceptable to the trade union movement in this country. It will be said by the employers, when they are approached by those wanting work, that, as a Labour Government has paved the way for an arbitrary attack upon the existing wage system, they need not observe any award and may impose their own conditions. Two years ago the members of the present Government, who were then in Opposition, went to the country, making the retention of the arbitration system the principal issue at the election. They ridiculed the Bruce-Page Government because it favoured the abolition of the Federal Arbitration Court. Let me quote what the present Prime Minister said in his policy speech prior to the last general election. These are his wordsThe proposal yon uro being asked to vote for by the present reactionary Government is nothing less than the abolition in one fell swoop of our federal arbitration system, the system which has grown out of the misery and oppression of the workers: the system which our fathers won for us, and that humanitarian statesmen have given us, building it u p / act able, work will be available only under upon act. In view of that definite pronouncement, it is remarkable to find the Labour Prime Minister and those supporting him now adopting this policy, which is so detrimental to the workers generally and to the public servants of this country. The present Prime Minister and those who then supported him defeated the previous Government by maintaining that the principle of arbitration, which has been the means of relieving the workers from the sweated conditions and the misery which used to be their lot, must be upheld. Yet, although the Prime Minister made such a striking announcement only two years ago, he now, at one fell swoop, is about to arbitrarily cut wages and to destroy those conditions for which Labour has so strenuously fought and has so hardly gained during a long period of years. If effect is given to this policy, the employers will no doubt provide work, but as they will impose. I am sure that there are members on this side of the chamber who never dreamed that during tlieir political life they could be called upon to sit behind a government which would arbitrarily cut the wages of the workers, and reduce their standard of living. We have said that these standards should be based upon certain formulas, and it has never been agreed that the demands and requirements of the workers have been met, nor has not yet been approved that our standard is unnecessarily high, or one Which the country cannot maintain. When I was a member of the Government, representations were made to me on many occasions with respect to a change in regard to the basis upon which the cost of living was fixed. The Government promised the Australian Workers Union and other organizations that an inquiry would be made, the scope would be widened, and a greater measure of justice extended to the workers; but nothing has been done. [Leave to continue given.] It has been said that, the adoption of these proposals will provide employment, but if additional work is made available it will be very small indeed. As I have said, this Government is paving the way for a general reduction in wages, and, if work is made availconditions such as those which the Bruce Page Government attempted to introduce, and which the Labour members then in Opposition strenuously fought against. No true Labour representative can support the policy which the Prime Minister has enunciated, which involves the reduction of wages and pensions, and the lowering of conditions generally. Imagine Mr Justice Dethridge presiding in the Arbitration Court when the next application is made, say, by the workers whom the present Minister for-Defence( Mr Chifley) represents. The honourable member is a member of the Cabinet which has agreed to a general reduction in wages, and is now .trying to force it through Parliament. Those who remain in the Cabinet must be condemned for accepting these proposals, and can no longer claim to represent the Labour movement. Let the real leaders of the trade union movement in this country Government representatives of New speak. They have already been tested in South Wales electorates, who are responVictoria upon the subject we are now dissible for the wage slash. That is the cussing, and have declared .that they are advice which I give to the postal uncompromisingly against this policy. workers organization of New South We also know where the leaders in New Wales.

It is the business of a ment which I quoted yesterday, has shown member of Parliament to preserve and where it stands with respect to the posiprotect the interests of the particular tion of the shearers, bush-workers, and electorate which he represents; but it is station hands. That indictment clearly the special responsibility of the officials of discloses what that organization expects Labour organizations to safeguard the of its representatives, whether they be in interests of the members of those organithis House or leaders of trade union zations who contribute weekly to the organizations. If they fail they should funds from which their salaries are paid. be put in their proper place, and :that I hope that the postal workers and linesis outside the political industrial organizamen throughout New South Wales make tion of Labour. We have the sorry spectacle of movement. I ask them to read in any the representatives of the postal workers Hansard the speeches made from this organization of New South Wales, corner of the chamber, and to use what who have been within the precincts means are at their disposal to rid their of this building within the last few organization of any men' who are likely days, pleading with the Government to to sell them, lock, stock, and barrel. ease up in the demand that it is making upon that section of workers, supporting the Government against those who are really putting up a fight in the interests invalid and old-age pensions. of the members of their organization. The Treasurer stated yesterday that 9,000 pensioners will not be in a worse position postal officials are receiving Â£4 16s. a when their pensions have been reduced week-the average is less than that. from 20s. to 17s. 6d. a week, and that if These men have to pay taxes to the Gothese proposals are not accepted the vernments in the States in which they Government might not be able to pay reside, and in addition they are to have more -than 12s. 6d. in the Â£1.

A similar position exists allow the old and infirm to suffer with respect to postal workers and public privation because of insufficient proservants generally in other States. That a Labour Government should proof the Prime Minister? pose the reductions embodied in this is to be the policy of this Government measure is almost unthinkable. No doubt towards those who have done the pioneerthese proposals will cause considerable ing work of this country, and who, owing commotion among the rank and file of the to circumstances over which they have no Postal Workers Union. first make sure where their officials stand to society the benefit of their efforts, it is in this matter.

Morethe. same time supporting members of'the over, the payment of the present pension Mr Beasley. sure that their officials are standing loyally by the principles of the Labour The Prime Minister made a statement regarding the necessity of reducing He said that, in view of the reduced cost of living, vision by the Commonwealth to meet their requirements. Is that the attitude If that They should control, are unable to continue to give is hedged around with numerous conditions, so that the pensioners must ibe virtually paupers before they are able to obtain any relief at all. According to the Treasurer's statement, the present small pension is to be reduced by '2s. 6d. a week, and, in addition, the conditions under which pensions are to be paid will be such that it will be exceedingly difficult for those in need to obtain even the reduced pension. It would appear that at least 30 per cent, of those now in receipt of invalid and old-age pensions will, if this measure is passed, be deprived of any pension whatever. The real effect of these proposals will not be known until their operation is felt by those who are now receiving benefit from this source. I prophesy that honourable members, who now have to concern' themselves with numerous applications in regard to pensions, will find themselves inundated with inquiries, because the new conditions to be imposed will reduce the number of pensioners by at least 30 per cent. The honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) recently referred to' the conduct of the department towards invalid pensioners. It is a positive fact that, a large number of invalid pensioners have already been deprived of their pension. Only last week I was interviewed by a girl suffering from infantile paralysis who had been in receipt of an invalid pension for twenty years. She was recently deprived of this, because the department maintained that she was not totally incapacitated.. I wish some honourable members couldhaveseen that girl trying to get along the street after' she had visited my home seeking my assistance to have her pension restored. The Deputy Commissioner says that hehas received no instructions from the Government regarding the cutting downof pensions. It may be policy for him to say that, but whether or not he has received instructions, the fact is that pension payments are being stopped in cases where there should be no interference even under present conditions. I leave it to honourable members to imagine what it will be like if the present proposals are adopted. In regard to war pensions honourable situation of many of these maimed member opposite talk a great deal about soldiers whose pensions are to be reduced. the attitude of members of the LabourI do not need to dwell on that nuy party during the'war. Our'attitude during' 1 the war is well known, and requires no explanation now. The opinions expressed by Labour members at that time have been justified beyond any shadow of doubt. Nevertheless, I believe in makingthe nation, honour its obligations to those who went to the war. The great bulk of them were trade unionists, or men from theworkers' ranks, and they went away believing in the promises which were made to them. They were told that if they did not return, those whom they left behind would be fully provided for. It was further stated that, as the result of their efforts, Australia would be made a land fit for heroes to live in. The war, they were told, was a struggle to save the world for democracy. It is all over now. Twelve years have gone by since the war ended, and now there is to be an attack upon war pensions. It must be very pleasing, I have no doubt, to honourable members opposite who have been relieved of the task by a so-called Labour Government. I can visualize the jubilation that must be felt in the inner circle of the political organization' of the party opposite over the victory which has been scored. Honourable members opposite will, no doubt, for many years, reap the political benefit of that victory. Their tactics have been so very successful. They have been able to compel-and I emphasize the worda Labour Government to do something which I do no> think they themselveswould have done. If it is true that the war was fought to make the world safe for democracy, and that Australia was to be made a land fit for heroes to live in, then I , for one, believe that we should stand by our undertaking to the soldiers whatever comes or goes. That is our attitude toward war pensions. Last night the honourable member for Cook( Mr C. Riley) said that the best way to bring homp to the minds of the people the horrors of war and the need for preventing future wars would be to make them pay what is just to the soldiers who returned injured from ihe last war. I agree with that. No doubt other honourable members have received literature, as I have, showing the unfortunate further; it has already been fully discussed by others. Reference . has been made by honourable members opposite to a proposal for the further consideration of the whole subjeet of soldiers' pensions. I do not oppose the further consideration of war pensions, but I make this point: if soldiers' pensions are to be reviewed, so also should the pensions of the old and infirm. It must be remembered, moreover, that the soldiers have their organizations to guard their interests, and at no time more than the present has the value of organization been more fully demonstrated. The old and infirm have no organization, but are dependent for justice upon the representations of honourable members in this House. Therefore, I again urge that, if soldiers' pensions are to be brought under review, with the idea of doing justice to the soldiers, so also should the pensions of the old and infirm. Various honourable members opposite have said that the introduction of these proposals by a Labour Government may be regarded as a political victory for the Opposition. I suppose it may be so regarded, and justifiably; yet I look on this victory with very little satisfaction from the national point of view. I have said for months past that the Government was drifting to default because of its hesitation, vacillation, inaction, and ing the resources of the country, but absence of policy, and it is with no great satisfaction that I now see my predictions come true. The Government and the people have been warned, and 1 am frankly sorry that the warnings have proved to be so abundantly justified. I hope that the political events and economic history of the last two years will teach us a much-needed lesson. In the political sense, we should learn that it is useless to tell the people that they can get anything they want by voting for it. It is useless for us to believe that we can bring about any result we desire by passing an act of Parliament. I could not help thinking of this very profound conviction of mine when this morning the Treasurer introduced a bill to provide for the conversion of the existing internalindebtedness of Australia. The title of the bill sets out the objects of the measure in these terms. . . to make necessary provision for carrying out a plan agreed on by the Commonwealth and the States for meeting the grave financial emergency existing in Australia, re-establishing financial stability, and restoring industrial and general prosperity. I only wish that any bill which any Parliament could pass could achieve those objects. There is no Parliament in the world which would not willingly accept such legislation if it could do as much. I believe that the bill is a step in the direction of restoring prosperity, but it is misleading the people to put into the title of the bill so resounding a statement. It is a political placard which tends to defeat its own object. Many other things besides the passing of this bill, or any other bill, must be done in Australia before we are again on the high road to prosperity. ber thinks that it is dangerous to have a good object in view? tend that Parliament can do everything. The success and prosperity of our people depend on their own capacity, on their own work, and the use they make of the resources of the country, and upon nothing else. To some extent we may help them to develop their capacity, and utilize their powers of work in developunless we are very careful we can easily do more harm than good in our attempts to promote the objects in view. It behoves us all to take heed of the lesson which may be learnt from the experience of the last two or three years. We, as leaders of the people-becaus e of the positions in which the people have placed us-mus t cease approaching the people by way of asking what they would like, and then offering to give it to them. There is no easy path to national prosperity. I do not wish to dwell unnecessarily on the past, but I cannot help letting my mind go back to the last election, when it was obvious that the Labour party asked itself, "" What would the people like to have?"" and then proceeded to promise it to them. Labour candidates promised lower government expenditure, and higher government expenditure,",21,Parkhixl The A Proposal Had Been Made In That Direc

The time for that kind of politics in Australia has definitely gone by. One result of those promises is that the life of the Labour party has pretty well come to an end.

79,Mr Latham,"Thos e promises wereIt is all very well from some points of view to lump together in one mass pensioners, civil servants, wage-earners, bondholders, and the like, and. to say that they must be put on the same footing, and 3uffer a reduction at the same rate and by the same methods; but we must recognize the essential differences between these various classes in the community. The money borrowed from the people by the Government is covered by a recorded contract, which fixes the term of the loan, the rates of interest, and the time of repayment. This practice is always followed in Australia. The contract made is regarded as a real security from a business point of view. It must be obvious that, in this way, money can be borrowed much more cheaply than otherwise. These contracts have always been regarded as inviolable. I also consider that a wage contract, whether it covers an hour, a day, a week, a month, a year, or any other period, is just as inviolable and sacred as a loan contract. There are obvious reasons why, in the interests of the community as a whole, the greatest possible security should be given to those who lend their money to the Government. Unless there were such security, governments would not be able to borrow any money at all, and would have to resort to confiscation, which is a mark of national degradation and failure. Such a policy would inevitably lead to widespread economicand financial dislocations' and disorders.. It is, therefore, particularly having regard to the future of our country, that we should be careful to impair this sense of security of contract to only the minimum, degree. We should maintain this security for our own good. For these and other reasons, the Opposition leaders urged the conference to give bondholders in Australia an opportunity to indicate their willingness to accept, a lower rate of interest. From the information disclosed at the conference, and from other information that is available, it is clear that we cannot, with our reduced national income, go on paying 6 per cent, interest. That rate of interest is too high. The Government has informed us. that our national income has been reduced from Â£650,000,000 in 1927-28 to an estir mate of Â£450,000,000 in 1931-32-a reSir, Latham. duction of 30 per cent. I do not like to say it, but I doubt whether this scheme goes far' enough. someextent, on the hope of recovery. hope, for instance, that there will be a recovery in world prices. It is probably wise to be content with this degree of readjustment for the moment. I do not know to what extent the figures upon which the estimate of national income has been based are accurate. There must, of course, be some speculative element in them. But they show a reduction of national income of 30 per cent. That is a hard fact that it is impossible to ignore. It has been calculated that the interest burden of Australia is Â£70,000,000 per annum. I do not know whether thai includes dividends on preference shares, and the like, which I regard as entirely distinct from interest. It is plain that, although we might endure a fixed interest charge of Â£70,000,000 on a national income of Â£650,000,000, it is a very difficult thing to pay it on an income of Â£450,000,000. There must be, in the circumstances, a real revision and reduction of these obligations. I hope that the appeal to the people, to convert their securities to other securities at a lower rate of interest will be a success. If we make it a success, we shall demonstrate a belief in. Australia which, has never .before been shown and which, in itself, important, will go far to restore confidence in the country, both at home and abroad. I sincerely hope that whatever differences of opinion we may have politically, we shall all join to make the best appeal possible to our people, to show the world that we believe in ourselves and in our country. I shall not say much at the moment about wages and salaries, and the maternity allowance,, except that there is room for savings in regard to them. W<> are not able to maintain our pensions, wages, salaries and other allowances al the high ratesfixed in prosperous times, though no one likes cutting down these payments.

81,Mr Latham,"That is so. We allto be made in these directions; but no one really believes that that is so. We are engaged in an -unpleasant task, which we are performing with great reluctance. Our war pensions, old-age and invalid pensions and maternity allowance, like our wages and salaries, were fixed when times were good. We have now fallen on hard times, and we would be regarded as irresponsibles if we refused to recognize the fact. It should be remembered that the cost of living has fallen. member for Bendigo does not admit it, his opinion should be published as an appendix to the official report of the Commonwealth Statistician. only deal with these subjects according to the best knowledge that we have. Everybody knows that the cost of living has fallen. of the Commonwealth Statistician is wrong. ber has been saying that for a long time. At present an officer is temporarily performing the duties of the Commonwealth Statistician. I suggest to the Government that it should consider the claims of the honourable member for Bendigo for appointment to the permanent office, for he would be able to bring to bear upon the duties a certain amount of imagination in addition to the mathematical ability which the office requires. The honourable member apparently has an inner light which illumines his statistical knowledge ; most of us have to go along in the ordinary way and accept the judgment of the statistician, who says that there has been a real reduction in the cost of living. This being so, our war pensioners and old-age and invalid pensioners, who live on their pensions, and spend at most the whole of their income on the items which are included among those upon which the statistician's calculations are based, will not suffer a real reduction if the amounttaken from them corresponds only to the reduction in the cost of living. In a time like this, I think that we should all make some sacrifice. We should not merely limit our reductions to the amount of the reductions in the cost of living. We should go further than that. As some other speakers have said, the cost of production must be reduced. The measures which we are now considering are only the -beginning of a difficult course which we must take. So long as wheat remains at its 'present price, it will be impossible for the 'farmers even to 'pay their way; and we shall have to consider measures, including the tariff, in the light of this fact, which I regard as of overwhelming importance. gentleman justify a reduction of pensions to maimed soldiers? on that subject. It is proposed 'by the Government that there shall be a saving We can of about Â£1,291,000 in war pensions. I have already stated the reasons why I believe that .there should be a reduction in the extent of those pensions. I have also said that, with the decrease in the cost of living, the reduction cannot be regarded as a real one. Taking that into account the proposed reduction, in gross, does not appear unreasonable. > However, I .ask the Government to call the organizations of returned soldiers into formal consultation, and request them to advise upon the most equitable means of making the necessary saving. now taking place. but I ask that something more should be done.

As these matters have already been under examination for a considerable period, there is no reason for much further delay. The Government might go so far as to accept any recommendation which the soldiers' organization may make.

Condition r 11 readsWhere overseas trade money has been temporarily invested in short-term securities, because of exchange difficulties, the holders to be given the right to convert into a short-term now security, subject to other conditions similar to the main conversion. (Details to information is available.) Condition 13 deals with tax-free securities which are "" interminable "", "" redeemable at option of Government, &c."" "" E t cetera"" is one of the most comprehensive terms of which I have knowledge. Condition 15 readsThe rate of interest on treasury-bills taken up by the banks in Australia to be reduced to 4 per cent., and all other questions in relation to the bills to be settled by the Loan Council in consultation with the banks. Then condition 16 statesThe terms herein set out to be regarded as recommendations by the conference to the Loan Council, which it is to be understood is at liberty to modify any details of the plan, and to settle all details not included above.

In order to make the position clear, it is intended to ask all the parliaments of Australia' to approve this agreement, as a variation or addition to the existing financial agreement, so that there shall be no doubt as to the authority of Parliament to enact the loan conversion bill, of Avhich AAe have r not yet seen the precise terms.

There should be, in the document now under consideration, a formal record by which the Commonwealth and the States are to be bound, notwithstanding any legislation which any of the parliaments may pass. I doubt that a document in this form, which remits to the Loan Council the settlement of terms of the agreement, is an agreement within the meaning of section 105A of the Constitution. If it is possible in this way to make an agreement effective under the section mentioned, it appears to me that it would be equally possible to make an agreement in blank form stating ""the Commonwealtli and the States hereby agree to whatever So-and-so-in this case the Loan Council-ma y decide "". Any other body might be mentioned as the body really to determine the terms of the agreement.

The conversion of Â£556,000,000, representing the internal indebtedness of the Commonwealth, is an operation of such magnitude that it is essential that The House is entitled there should be nothing doubtful about the terms of the agreement. Since tremendous interests are concerned we may rest assured that if there is any weakness in the agreement, it will be . discovered, and the position will be tested. It would be most unfortunate if , after the Commonwealth and State Parliaments had legislated upon a matter of such importance, at any time in the future-and I remind the House that this agreement covers a period of 30 yearsit were discovered that the agreement was ineffective. Accordingly I put it to the Government that the blanks in the agreement ought to be filled in, and there should be delay' of at least a few days so that we may be quite sure of the position. [Leave to continue given.] Although avoidable delay will be regrettable this proposal is so important that the Government would be well advised to reconsider the form of the bill. I am quite sure that the States would offer no objection, because, through the Loan Council, they have probably already agreed to the terms of the. agreement.

110,Mr Latham,"The discussion upon this provision will be more fully developed in the debate on the Conversion Bill, which Ave have been told will be introduced next week. On page 150 and following pages of the report of the recent conference in Melbourne there appears a preliminary draft of the Conversion Bill. It is a draft only, so I am not criticizing it as if it Avere a considered that a provision is suggested to meet that proposal, but I wish to offer one or two suggestions which might be regarded as worthy of consideration by the Government when drafting the neAv legislation. It is important that the conversion scheme shall be free of all ambiguities, otherAvise it will lead to confusion. I recall a well known attempt at loan conversion in England under circumstances much more faA'orable th,an those obtaining in the Commonwealth to-day. Mr Gladstone, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, appealed for a conversion, but the terms were so complicated and involved that the appeal was a failure. afterwards Mir. Goschen went on the market Avith a conversion loan that was remarkable for its relative simplicity, and Avas completely successful. It is desirable that there should be nothing ambiguous in the appeal which is about to be made to the people of Australia. I suggest, therefore, that the bill should contain not only a provision that those Avho do not dissent shall have their securities converted, but also a positive invitation to holders to assent. In its present form it enacts that those Avho do not dissent within a given period shall have their securities converted. The invitation to convert does not appear formally in the bill, although it is implied in the general scheme. It Avould, I believe, be helpful if a provision were embodied in the schedule to the effect that the Government invited holders of existing securities to convert their stock, because it is highly important that there should be as large a volume of assent as possible. tion to security holders would be somesions at such closely-related periods, the thing neAv in legislation. suggest a form. It could be done by the task of any Commonwealth Treasurer enacting something to this effect: "" Upon who might be called upon to convert receipt of a request the Treasurer Avill such large amounts at. intervals of two convert."" That is all that is required. porated in the bill,, failure on the part of a bondholder to make a request would be deemed to be a requestthe honourable member will turn to page 151 of the report of the conference, he will see, in clause 9 of the proposed bill, difficulty. The bill enacts that, unless bondholders, within fourteen days, give notice of dissent, they Avill be deemed to have assented to the proposal to convert. That time is altogether too short. Many1 holders of securities in certain parts of Australia will not have heard of these proposals even yet. have to be content with mail services once a week. point, I assume, will be further discussed Not long at the committee stage of the bill. Paragraph 3 of the conditions sets out the proposed ten maturity dates of ,t,he new securities, and provides that the GoA ernment, after tAventy years, will have T the right to pay off the bondholders. It is difficult to discuss in detail a matter, such as this, Avhich has already been settled by agreement, and I am aAvare that this aspect of the problem has been considered by a number of financial authorities. But it appears to me that, if an arrangement had been made giving the Government the right to pay off portion of the securities after the expiration of ten years, it Avould have been better than postponing that right until 1950. However, this is a relatively small point. But I do invite attention to the fixed maturity dates of 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 24, 26, 28, and 30 years. If we assume that the average debt at each maturity date is Â£50,000,000, there A\dll have to be, after seven years, a conversion operation every three years for a period of fifteen years, and thereafter a conversion operation of Â£50,000,000 every two years.

In that connection I draw attention to clauses 11 and 13 2 c in the existing d r a f t which refer to the 30 years period but not to the option between the 3 per cent, and 4 per cent.

The more or less indefinite details of the preamble are merely an indication of what the subsequent legislation is to contain. that it would not be an agreement coming within the terms of section 105A of the Constitution, because the terms and conditions of the agreement would not appear in it, but would be settled by an external body, the Australian Loan Council. If such an agreement were valid, an agreement Commonwealth should make arrangements for a conversion on terms approved by, say, the Chief Justice of Western Australia, would be equally valid. I submit that under section 105A of the Constitution, which gives .any agreement made in pursuance of its terms an effect which overcomes even a statute of this Parliament, or of any State Parliament, it is most unlikely that any court would hold that the provisions of the section were complied with if the determination of all the terms and conditions were left to some other authority than the Commonwealth or the States. If that could be done the determination might be placed in the hands of one man without any parliamentary control or possibility of parliamentary control.' In other words, if the original agreement were that conversion might be effected in accordance with terms and conditions from time to time determined by a certain individual or body, Parliament would be giving a blank cheque, and my contention, as a lawyer, is that section 105A does not permit of the giving of a blank cheque to any one. The cheque must be filled in. The agreement must be actually made by the Commonwealth and the States and validated by Parliament, and it is that agreement which must be the authority for any subsequent legislation giving effect to it. Condition 7 reads as follows:Existing securities (Â£45,000,000), now bearing interest at 5 per cent., to be converted at option of holder, into 3$ per cent, at par for the maturing iu sixteen years, or 4 per cent, stock (at a discount). No mention is made of the date when the the same applies to condition 8. I have no doubt an agreement has been arrived at upon .the point, but this omission should be rectified. The date of maturity of the 4 per cent, stock mentioned in condition 7, and of stock bearing interest at less than 5 per cent, mentioned in condition 8, ought to be stated explicitly and definitely as is done in the case of the 3Â£ per cent, stock and the 3 per cent, stock in their respective paragraphs. Under condition 10, various questions arise which need to be made clear. It is a very important condition and is in these termsproviding that the The interest on the new securities to be free from the present Commonwealth super tax of 7i per cent, and from any further taxation which may be imposed by the Commonwealth or by any State, but to be subject to ""ther existing Commonwealtli and State taxes. What is the meaning of the words "" other existing Commonwealth and State taxes ""? rates of those taxes ? bill the words "" at the rates existing at the commencement of this act"" are used. The first point I make is that there are State securities which bear certain State taxation. For example, the income from certain State securities bears an unemployment tax. The provision before us, as now drafted, indicates that these securities are still to be subject to that State taxation. But once the new stock is issued, the stock which is subject to this tax can never be identified. It will be all one big issue, with different maturing dates and different rates of interest, and it will lead to great confusion if some bonds are liable to unemployment tax in Victoria and other bonds of the same issue held, say, in Queensland, are not subject to such a tax. It will be impossible to identify and follow the separate bonds into the new issue. If it means that all the new securities are to be subject to all Commonwealth and State taxation",33,Whereas By Section 105a Of The Constitu

132,Mr Latham,"In the draft of the"" at the rates existing at the commencement of this act"", is there not a risk that a new liability may be imposed by the States taxing bonds which are at present free from State taxation ? Large numbers of State bonds are at present free of State taxation, and if this legislation is passed in its present form, definitely and affirmatively providing that they shall be subject to State taxation at the rates existing at the time of the passing of this measure, a new liability will be imposed upon them which I believe is not intended. The object of this measure is not to secure that they shall continue to be taxed at existing rates, but rather to ensure that they shall not be taxed at greater rates. The existing taxation rates should be described as the maximum ; whereas they are actually described -as a permanent imposition. We are endeavouring to bring into force a plan which involves a reduction in interest, wages, salaries and various classes of social benefits. We hope that it will be possible to restore partially at least wages, salaries and social benefits, and we should not legislate in respect of interest in such a way as to impose a permanent reduction upon the bondholder without the possibility of relief. We have heard much of equality of sacrifice. There should be also some prospect of equality of restitution. I am sure that that is the intention, although the words employed do not express it -will have only an investment of Â£10,400 I turn now to the position of trustees under this legislation. I am aware that only the States can legislate on this matter, but it is important that the Commonwealth authorities should take an active interest in the legislation to be introduced into the State Parliaments. have a definite life? be reduced until 1950, but the other reductions do not necessarily extend beyond the next financial year. It is impossible to devise a scheme whereby interest rates shall vary according to the variations of pensions and salaries paid by the Commonwealth and the six States. Having regard to the special nature of this plan that would be a fair provision if it were practicable, but when proposals are brought forward to restore to one class at least a portion of what is being taken from them, I hope that the other classes who are now sharing the sacrifice will not be forgotten. In regard to trustees it is necessary that the States should do more than legislate to give to trustees authority to convert and indemnity if they do. That much is proposed, but it is insufficient. I have had extensive experience of trust estates both as a practitioner at the bar, and in administration. [Further leave to continue granted.} In addition to giving authority to convert and indemnify, it is necessary to bear in mind that many trustees have set aside capital sums to provide annuities, and that such sums have been invested in Government stocks, because they were considered certain to return a fixed amount of interest. Such cases must be dealt with, otherwise difficulties will arise between the two classes of beneficiaries-annuitant s and remainder men. Consider another case in which an estate of Â£10,000 has been invested in government 6 per cent, stock. That will be converted into 4 per cent, stock. Instead of a bond for Â£10,000, there will be a bond for Â£10,400, and a cash payment of approximately Â£60, part of which will represent interest. Is that Â£400 to go to the remainder man as an accretion to his corpus or is it to go to the tenant for life? If to the latter, he will receive an unexpected gift of Â£400 in one year, and the party next interested at 4 per cent. Honourable members will realize that difficulties may arise and litigation ensue and the matter is sufficiently important for the Commonwealth legal authorities to take it up directly with the States. The Commonwealth would be well advised to employ one of the best men at the equity bar to see that all classes of cases are covered by this legislation. That is a special branch of legal work; there are men in Sydney who do practically nothing else. in my department. specialized branch of law, and even the officers of the Commonwealth Law Department, of whose abilities I have the highest opinion, are not daily dealing with matters affecting trusts and trustees.

It it perfectly true that in a certain way, although a very imperfect and piecemeal I suggest that the way, the members of the Opposition have from time to time, and, we trust, quite I was prepared to do honestly, attempted, by party political methods, to achieve such a great and uniform result as the Government hopes to secure through the medium of this measure. The fatal defect, however, in tlieir policy, which foredoomed it to failure, was that it rested upon class legislation and an utterly inequitable distribution of the burden of sacrifice, which rendered it repugnant to this Government and impossible of acceptance. Because of that, certain honourable members who were associated with, and hitherto loyal to, the Labour movement, which they had been returned to Parlia[2.56) -The Government ment to serve, left the Labour ranks and joined with those whose policy was unacceptable, and, indeed, repugnant to the representative exponents of Labour policy.

We said that they involved sacrifices which weighed most heavily on those least able to bear them. We declared at the very beginning that, in order to meet the drift which had set in, the nation would have to realize that its safety lay along the road of equality of sacrifice, and only along that road. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer went into the Premiers Conference recently at Melbourne standing firmly to those principles, and holding the views which I have so imperfectly expressed. They made it clear that capitalists and others with assured incomes would have to realize that the whole foundation and superstructure of their own well-being was imperilled by that drift; that they would have to make up their minds that a uniform and far-reaching sacrifice would have to be made or the country would be brought to default and disaster, with the result that those who consider themselves secure and immune would eventually suffer. Fortunately, their view prevailed, and was ultimately accepted by the conference. I give the conference every credit for having, even at the last moment, accepted that view. Hr. Brennan. The great plan which has been adopted for the rehabilitation of Australia follows the lines of an equal, though severe, Honourable sacrifice. The plan which is now submitted to the people of Australia in broad outline is rough and general in form, but it carries out the decisions of the conference. The Premiers met, not as lawyers, but as statesmen facing a great problem. It is true that they took counsel with both lawyers and economists, as well as with other experts of various kinds; but the decisions of the conference were not drafted in such form as could History had not propossibly be accepted as satisfying and complete to the legal mind. They were framed in broad outline; they represent the result of great labours and intimate and detailed investigations. Those decisions have finally to be crystallized by lawyers and draftsmen into legal be less than three years. enactments, only the preliminary one of which is at present before us. The basis of this bill is an agreement which cannot be altered. I have said that, from a lawyer's point of view, the agreement is rough in form. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) has drawn attention to the use of the phrase "" etcetera"", and other trifling matters, which indicate that the agreement, which forms the schedule to the bill, cannot be taken as an exact expression of the views and intentions of the conference, such as lawyers would desire to give. cheque ? the circumstances in which the agreement was made; remembering that it represents basic decisions on the part of statesmen to be worked out in detail by legal minds, and also that from its very nature, it cannot be altered, we have to regard it only as a basis for what shall be done in the future.

He said that it rises superior to any statute, and that it can be altered only by an agreement between the States or by an amendment of the Constitution. That is perfectly true.

I congratulate the Prime Minister on the spirit in which he meets the suggestions that are being made to the Government. good faith, and, apparently, they are being accepted in a similar spirit.

Anomalies are sure to occur in the application of the economy plan, and recommendations made on behalf of the trade unions should be helpful to the Government.

I remind the Prime Minister that a suggestion along these lines was made by me about sixteen days ago. I have no desire to make political capital out of this matter; a similar suggestion was made by the Opposition yesterday. It may be possible to effect economies parties in this House of the necessity to resort to the drastic remedies suggested by the Government. I hope that the returned soldiers organizations will be able to prove to the Government that it can save money without resorting to this undesirable method. E again urge that a committee be appointed to comb the Commonwealth Public Service, to see whether there are not economies, the making of which would obviate the Government's doing what is not being done to any other section of organized workers. It is proposed that this section of the community shall be subjected to a higher reduction than has been ordered by the Federal Arbitration Court in the case of any industry, and that is causing considerable concern to the 31,000 Commonwealth employees. This is an appropriate moment for me, as a representative of the primary producers, to request, and for the Prime Minister to grant, an opportunity for the representatives of wheat-growing organizations to submit their claims for consideration. The scheme evolved at the Premiers Conference in Melbourne profoundly affects them, in common with other sections of the community, and includes proposals for their relief. The Country party, to which I belong, was not invited to participate in that conference. their representatives in Parliament are good enough for them! orable member's colleague, the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) does not consider that parliamentary representation is sumcient in a matter of this kind. do not concern me. member, with great facility, dissociates himself from the honourable member for Balaclava when he thinks that it is desirable to do .so. I speak with great seriousness on this matter. The Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), with evident sincerity, considers, and has announced, that this is a complete scheme; yet it does not contain any proposal dealing with the one which would relieve all factor in our economic life which is pressing heavily upon primary producers, and which is exercising a very important influence in keeping up production costs to such a height that it is no longer profitable to continue that production upon which the whole prosperity of this country depends. Workers' wages, pensions of all descriptions, prices of raw materials, interest-al l are to come down. down. These proposals, the objective of which is to bring everybody below the existing level, were introduced at a time when this House was in the middle of a discussion upon a tariff schedule providing for increased customs duties, designed to protect the manufacturers of this country from the operation of falling world prices; in short, to give them a charter to keep prices up. I contend that throughout the deliberations in Melbourne, and in the preparation of these measures to give effect to the plan there evolved, the wishes and interests of the primary producers of this country were not given the consideration to which they were entitled. If the organizations representative of other sections of the community, such as the trade unionists and returned soldiers, are to be consulted in a matter that vitally affects them, the primary producers' organizations also should be consulted. honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart)-as I frequently find myself doing-in which he has made a bona fide proposition that there should be a reduction of customs doities and other costs.

There is a further fact that I wish to impress upon the Prime Minister. Certain bounties that have been granted by former Governments are 20 per cent, more valuable to-day than when they were given. Take, for example, the subsidy that is paid to Westralian Airways Limited. It is not at present proposed that railway fares and freights shall be reduced; but eventually they w ill be forced down. The subsidy of something over Â£40,000 a year that is being paid to Westralian Airways Limited w ill appreciate to the extent of Â£10,000 a year as a result of the rise that will take place in the purchasing power of money on account of these alterations. Other bounties will be similarly affected. If there is to be equality of sacrifice, this and all other similar payments should be reviewed. objection to the representatives of returned soldiers or trade unionists consulting with the Prime Minister, or he with them; but I support the request that has been made by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) that the wheat-growers' representatives also should be accorded that privilege, particularly in regard to the incidence of the tariff upon them as primary producers. I do that, recognizing that the representatives of the primary producers in this House have repeatedly urged on the Government the advisability of lightening the tremendous burden that is imposed upon them-re presentations which, I am sorry to say, appear to have been of no avail. This Government seems to be so impregnated with the idea of prohibitive protection that it is absolutely impossible to achieve anything in that direction, yet the two representatives in the Cabinet of the sugar industry-the Treasurer and the Ministerf or Trade and Customs-can obtain concessions for that primary industry. The Government has shown itself adamant in its refusal to accept the suggestion of honourable members who sit on this side, to impose a sales tax on flour with the object of benefiting the wheat growers. If it w ill not listen to the parliamentary representatives of those primary producers, perhaps it w ill take some notice of their representative organizations. I direct the attention of honourable members to the conditions existing in some of the wheat-growing districts in South Australia, where it has been found necessary to supply many struggling farmers, and particularly those in the more recently opened up wheat-growing districts, with food and clothing. Owing to the appalling conditions which now prevail in some districts, depots have been established through which farmers and their wives distribute clothing to those requiring it . The wife of one of these distributors has written to the Adelaide Advertiser of the 4th June, in this wayMy liusband says that he and my daughter will act while I am away. He says people are in a terrible state of want in that district. It is a new district opened up in the last three years and the poor souls are living in awful places.

Surely settlers of this type require Bpecial consideration. As the Prime Minister has promised to hear the representations of other sections, I trust that he will pay due regard to the conditions under which these struggling settlers are endeavouring to carry on. Many of the wheat-growers in the new wheat areas are living in galvanized iron or bag homes. In view of the fact that duties on galvanized iron, fencing wire and other commodities used by primary producers have been heavily increased, it is the responsibility of the Prime Minister, who will not listen to tives of these people, to meet the direct representatives of the growers, and to agree to remove some of the burdens under which they are now labouring. under the impression that the plan submitted by the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) had been fully considered by the representatives of the Commonwealth and State Governments, and Australia's leading economists, and that as the result of a most exhaustive examination the scheme submitted would be acceptable to all the interests concerned. I am prepared to support the proposals, as I realize the necessity of adopting unusual measures in order to ensure a return to financial stability. I was, however, under the impression that, at least for a time, prominence would not be given to the claims of different sections, and that honourable members generally would make a determined attempt to do the right thing in 'ihe interest of the whole community. I now understand that the Government has decided to listen fb the representations of the returned soldiers' organizations, which represent only one section of the oommunity. [98] The writer of the letter prohas misinterpreted my statement. have special consideration. already made representations. all sections will have the privilege of submitting requests for the consideration of the Government with respect to those phases of the scheme which more directly affect them. In those circumstances, I contend that those engaged in the wheat growing industry are entitled to special treatment in view of the assistance which has been rendered, directly and indirectly, to other industries under the protectionist policy of the country. primage duties will place an additional burden upon the wheat-growers. growers have already given up practically everything; they have nothing more to surrender. They are absolutely unprothe parliamentary representatected. If the burden which they are now compelled to carry is reduced a revival of industry, which is so much desired, will be stimulated. I trust that the Prime Minister will give the representatives of the primary producers an opportunity to place their views before him. ringah) [3.44] I was glad to hear the announcement made by the right honourable the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), because I think the returned soliders have a special claim to consideration. I would not object if their representatives were the only ones upon whom this privilege was to be conferred. It is, however, open for every section of the community to make representations to the Government through their organizations, and I presume that they have done so. able member represent? I represent the whole of the people of Australia and not any particular section. If there are any whom I specially represent it is the consumers of this country.

I appreciate what the Government has done in regard to war pensions, and I hope that the committee will be able to bring in a report showing bow the incidence of this pension cut may be lightened. 1 am sure that .every honourable member in this House will be pleased if the deliberations of the committee have that result. was responsible for this suggestion in the first place, the Government is to be congratulated upon its action in taking part in the conference, and on its decision to appoint a committee to inquire into the subject of pensions. The men who went to the war left in the heyday of their health, youth and vigour. Many of them came back mental and physical wrecks. There is no body of men in the community to whom we owe a deeper debt of gratitude; it is one which we can never repay. Our obligation to them is much greater than to the bondholders, yet the bondholders are being asked to make a voluntary sacrifice, while the cut in the soldiers' pensions is obligatory. Some of these men spent years at the war, and returned perhaps with both eyes blind, or with two legs missing. They are entitled to fair treatment from the community, and soldiers' pensions should be the last to be touched. I hope that the committee can devise some scheme which will be to the mutual satisfaction of all concerned. I am particularly concerned about the terms of reference to this committee which is to inquire into soldiers' pensions. Returned soldiers' organizations have always professed certain principles in regard to pensions, and those principles should be respected as far as possible. The personnel of the committee which is to be appointed comprises several returned soldiers, three of them presidents of recognized soldier organizations, and I believe they will defend to the best of their ability the principles for which they have always stood. The speech of the honourable member for Calare( Mr Gibbons) on this subject was typical of the man, and only what might have been expected of him. He did not go to the war, and knows nothing about this subI ject. I do not know what other honourable members thought of his remarks, but I Avas absolutely disgusted. That, however, is merely en passant. The Prime Minister told me privately that the terms of reference for the committee had not been definitely decided upon. I suggest that the committee be directed to inquire chiefly into means of effecting economies by the correction qf anomalies, and the more -efficient administration of the -Whoeve r .Repatriation Act. Inquiries of this kind are often unduly circumscribed by the terms of reference, and I do not desire that .the usefulness of this committee should be restricted in that way. The Government proposes to saAe Â£1,250,000 r by a reduction of pensions; but Avhile endeavouring to save this amount it should not violate the principle that pensions are compensation for disabilities. The amount of a pension should bear no relation to rank or social position. If a straight out percentage cut is made in pensions, the result will be that those who suffered most at the Avar, Avill suffer the biggest reduction in their pensions. That is opposed to all principles of justice. I am glad that the Government is considering soldiers' pensions separately from the other proposed economies, and that it has retreated from the arbitrary position it took up yesterday. arbitrary about our attitude. We were favourably considering this proposal yesterday, and for some days past. are in a class by themselves. Many persons, both in this House and outside, believe that soldiers' pensions should be sacrosanct. A definite promise was made to the men Avho Avent to tbe Avar, and I should not like this Parliament to repudiate that promise.

In my speech I said nothing that was detrimental to returned soldiers or their organizations. I did not mention them. The interpretation placed upon my remarks by the honourable member for Eichmond( Mr B. Green) is inaccurate. ter) [8.67] I see no reason why a number of honourable members should clamour for the appointment of consultative committees merely because the Government has agreed to appoint one, at the request of returned soldiers' organizations. Tbe Government will welcome from any section of the community suggestions with a view to enable it to inflict as little hardship as possible within the specific field of those concerned. The honourable member for Fremantle (Mi-. Curtin) asked me whether similar treatment would be extended to the trade unions concerned. I answered "" Yes, if thoy wished it "" . The question was then raised whether I was willing to confer and consult with them. I have been doing so for many hours, and the unions concerned have expressed their satisfaction at the time that I have allotted to them. If they now desire to set up a committee to go through the departments of Commonwealth expenditure to determine where the necessary economies can best be made .in their specific spheres,their representations will be treated with the some respect as were those that were advanced by the returned soldiers' organizations. and I congratulate it Let us not have a misunderstanding now, and endeavour to avoid one ill future. It is not proposed to set up a committee of returned soldiers to see whether economies can be effected in departments with -which they are not concerned in order to relieve them of any burden. The proposals of the Govern1 merit Contemplate a saving in war pensions amounting to Â£1,250,000. The returned soldiers' organizations have suggested that, probably, they can put forward proposals to .the Government that will enable the reduction to apply with less hardship than Will be the case under the plan outlined by this Government. If that can be done, the Government will be very glad of th6 opportunity to carry out their suggestions. The honourable member for ""Wimmera( Mr Stewart) asked ""Why not a committee of wheat-farmers""? I do not know of any provision ia this plan that . proposes a out on our wheat-farmers: Certainly there is a good deal in it that will benefit farmers generally. There isj for instance, a reduction in interest not only on government, .but on private mortgages, that the Treasurer and I insisted upon when the Melbourne conference ..was formulating the scheme. That will be effected by State legislation; I point out, too, that one of the factors that is making it necessary to enforce these cuts in our expenditure is that Aus-: tralian Governments have to find Â£10,000,000 annually to cover exchange. Practically the whole of that amount goes to OUT exporter's, and the bulk of our exports is primary products. vent the. secondary industries from exporting? dustries' pay a high exchange rate tff import whatever material they may need from overseas. However, I do not intend to enter into an argument with the honourable member on that subject. I admit that, next to the unemployed, the primary producers are the bafdest-hit section in the community. intend to reduce the tariff, as part of the general scheme?",43,Parkhill Surel Y Sociate Myself With The Remarks Of The

The Government desires to build up industry in this country. I believe that, when we turn the corner, there will be a wonderful field for industry in Australia, and that we shall build up the best market for primary producers locally. shall be able to maintain a high standard of prices for our primary producers within Australia, by building up wider and bigger markets with better prices, so making us independent of world's parity, a factor which has been largely instrumental in bringing primary producers to their present position. I might point out that suggestions with regard to reconsideration of war pensions have been made by members in different sections of tbe House. I think the matter was first mentioned to me by the honourable member for Corangamite ( Mr Crouch). It was also montioned by the Leader of tbe Opposition ( Mr Lyons), the honourable members for Henty( Mr Gullett), Bendigo( Mr Keane), Reid( Mr Coleman), Parkes( Mr Marr), Indi( Mr Jones), and others, including representatives of the returned soldiers outside Parliament. The matter has been receiving the careful attention of the Government. gentleman had a pretty decent scrap over it in the party room, and it is not yet finished. what the honourable member refers. Some days ago I made an appointment to meet representatives of the returned soldiors in conference. That conference was held to-day, and I have announced the result. It does not matter whence the original representations came. I have also had three conferences with representatives of the Public Service associations, and I conferred with the combined unions for the greater part of an afternoon. I do not grudge giving those people that time, because they are vitally interested. They did not make a request similar to that which came from the returned soldiers, that they should go through departmental expenditure and suggest how the economics should be effected. They merely advised how they thought the blow could be softened here and there, and careful consideration is being given to their suggestions. I assure the honourable member for Calare( Mr Gibbons) that the Government is not departing from its plan one iota. Unfortunately, the sacrifices have to be made; but if tbe burden can be I hope that we lightened by spreading it and removing anomalies, the Goverument will be only too willing to meet those concerned.
