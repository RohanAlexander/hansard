This latter figure should on his actions as a member of this House. have been £30,000 at 6 per cent. wish to raise a question of privilege. On -The honourable member for Dalley( Mr the notice-paper is a motion in the name Mahony) has submitted this motion as a of the honourable member for East Sydney matter of privilege. In the first place, ( Mr ""West), and I observe that it has I think I ought to infrom him, and been placed at the bottom .of the list of others interested in the motion, that the private members' business. of motion isThat the vote given hy the honourable member quite clearfor Riverina( Mr Eillen) in the House, on the question of the second reading of the Land Tax Asessment Bill 1923, be disallowed. This matter very seriously affects the honour of a member of this House. In the British House of Commons such cases as these are taken very seriously, and immediate action is resorted to in order to settle them. May, at page 353, saysI n the Commonsi t is a rule that no member who has a direct pecuniary interest in a question shall be allowed to vote upon it ; but in order to operate as a disqualification, this interest must be immediate and personal, and not merely of a general or remote character. In the House of Commons, in such circumstances, the member concerned is heard in his place; then he retires, and leaves the House to discuss and decide the question. In this particular instance there is no doubt about the direct and personal pecuniary interest of the honourable member, because, on tbe floor of the House, he has admitted that interest; he has admitted that the measure then under discussion would, if passed, be of monetary advantage to him. I do not desire to cast any personal reflections on the honourable member^ but Parliament should take steps to protect itself when its honour is involved. I take the stand that the motion of which notice has been given seriously affects the honour of a member of the House, and, by reflex action, seriously affects the honour of the House collectively; and, therefore, it should be considered and settled forthwith. If immediate action is not taken, and this notice remains on the business-paper, the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) Avill remain under a shadow. The honourable member himself must realize the position in which ( I move That the notice standing in the name of Mr. West, No. 6 General Business, be taken forthwith. The notice arrangement of the business of the House is entirely a matter for the Government. May, 10th edition, page 256, makes that Excepti n the case of motions amounting to a distinct vote of want of confidence in the Government, proposed or sanctioned by the Leader of the Opposition, the question whether the Government should concede priority to a notice of motion, or to an Order of the Day in the charge of an unofficial member, is left entirely to their discretion. As the honourable member for Dalley will see, that leaves the Chair quite powerless to regulate a matter such as that to which he refers. supposed to have some honour? present time concerned with the attitude of the Government, except as it affects the law and practice of Parliament in this matter. It is for the head of the Government, who is the Leader of the House, to declare the attitude of the Government at what he considers the proper time. I am not prepared at this stage to regard this matter as a question of privilege. In some phases it may be regarded as a question of privilege, and to some minds it will probably appear to be . on or near the border-line. But this is not a matter on which the Chair should be asked to rule at this stage; it is rather for the head of the Government, who is acquainted with the circumstances and terms of the motion,, to lead the House in regard to it. I put the matter, therefore, in charge of the head of the Government. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [11.10] -This matter has been raised as one of privilege, because, I presume, it could not be raised in any other way at this particular time.",15,Setup

5,Mr Bruce (Flinders,"Prime Ministhat this is not a question of privilege, I suggest to the honorahle member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) that the House be permitted to dispose of questions on notice, after which, in Committee of Ways and Means, I shall have an opportunity to indicate the attitude of the Government. privilege concerning myself I should like to say a few words ber for Riverina( Mr Killen) is aware that an honourable member who raises a question of privilege must conclude with a motion. Dalley has proposed such a motion, and it has been duly seconded. I have said that at this stage I am not prepared to i regard this as a matter of privilege, and I have, therefore, placed it in the hands of the head of the Government, who is charged with the arrangement of the business-sneet of the House. If the honourable member for Riverina desires to speak, he may do so by leave, or by way of personal explanation. ter and Minister for External Affairs) [11.12],-May I interpose a suggestion. As the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) desires to make an explanation, perhaps it would facilitate matters if I now indicated what is the attitude of the Government. perhaps, will prove a more convenient time than after questions have been disposed of. I can state the position of the Government, and then the honourable member may make what personal statement he desires. only too willing that the honourable member for Riverina shall have every opportunity to speak. If the notice of motion be left on the business-paper, it remains there as a reflection on him, and, of course, the sooner it is disposed of the better for the honourable member and all concerned. The Government placed the notice of motion where it is on the business-paper because we did not take the view that there was any possibility of the honourable member's honour being involved. The standing order under which this matter has been raised providesNo member shall be entitled to vote in any division upon a question in which he has a direct pecuniary interest, not held in common with the ""rest of the subjects of the Crown, and the vote of any member so interested shall be disallowed, but this shall not apply to motions or public Bills which involve ' questions of public policy. I should say that there are very few Bills or questions of public policy in which some member would not have a pecuniary interest. Buti f the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) takes a serious view of the motion which has been placed upon the notice-paper by the honourable member for East Sydney, the Government will afford The honourable member for every opportunity for it to be discussed. Prime Minister order. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce) spoke by leave of the House. The honourable member for Riverina has not asked for leave to make a statement, nor has he stated that he wishes to make a personal explanation. I would not object, to either course, except that honourable members on this side of the House cannot consent to"" be gagged by allowI should like to say ing this matter to be dealt with in such a way that it will be optional for the House to give or refuse leave for each member to speak. If that course is persisted in it will lead to a protracted debate. This matter must be thrashed out in a proper way, and the better course would be to adopt the suggestion made This, by the Prime Minister, namely, that the matter should be discussed on the motion to go into Committee of Ways and Means. I permitted the honourable member for The Government is Riverina to commence his remarks, because he has the right, as has every honourable member, to claim the indulgence of the House while he makes a personal explanation. planation will not settle the matter. most decisive way of dealing with this question is that suggested by the Prime Minister, and as the right honourable gentleman has promised to provide opportunity for the discussion of the motion",15,Privilege

96,Mr West (East Sydney) [11.44],"orable members are as anxious as they that no member of this House shall consider his pecuniary interests when casting a vote on any particular measure. This is the motive that has actuated me in moving the motion. The honourable memb e r for Darling( Mr Blakeley), when speaking on the second reading of the Land Tax Assessment B ill , said of the honourable member for Biverina, "" He is a large owner. I wonder how f a r this applies to h i m personally."" The honourable member for Biverina( MrK ill e n ) reis pecuniarily interested. The House of plied, "" In a very slight degree."" That does not reduce the enormity of the offence; the fact remains t h a t , he had a pecuniary interest in the B ill . TheB r i tish Parliament, as fa r back as the year 1790, took steps to guard against this practice. According to May, this prohibition applies not only to the House of Parlia-ment, but also to Committees. In New South Wales, a Committee was appointed to report upon the establishment of a bank. Under the Banks Act of that State, before any bank can be established a Committee has to report to Parliament. That Committee comprised in its personnel three members of the House who had a pecuniary interest in the bank, and, consequently, its report was not adopted by the State Parliament. I am putting these facts on record as a future guide for the younger members of this House. This appears on page 357 of the tenth edition of M a y : An objection to a vote, on the ground of personal interest, cannot be raised or mooted except upon a substantive motion, that the vote given in a division be disallowed, on the principle affirmed upon page 264, and cannot he brought forward as a point of order. The member whose vote is under consideration, on the ground of personal interest, having been heard in his place, should withdraw immediately, .and before the question founded thereon has been proposed. When any honourable member has a pecuniary interest in a B ill before the House, he should absent himself from the chamber when a vote on it is being taken. The Commonwealth Parliament is the highest tribunal in Australia, just as the British Parliament is in Great Britain, and we should, as f a r as possible, remove any taint of suspicion from the actions of honourable members. those ideals, I should be wrong if I did not endeavour to preserve the morals of Parliament.' I have no personal animus against the honourable member for Riverina, and I know nothing of his p r i vate life. He has had little parliamentary experience, and I trust that, as a result of this censure motion, he will not again infringe the privileges of Parliament. second the motion. We should jealously guard the rights of Parliament, and prevent, as f a r as possible, any member from recording a vote on measures in which he Commons has frequently taken definite action on this very matter. I quote the following from the tenth edition of May, page 355:In 1800 the votes of three members were disallowed as having a direct interest in a Bill for incorporating a company for the manufacture of flour, wheat, and bread. Bill. private B ill or a Government measure the principle is the same. vote on a B ill to raise our salaries ? obvious replies which dispose of that interjection. In the first place, the Constitution gives this Parliament the power to deal with that matter. In the second place, it is a matter of public policy that members of Parliament should be paid adequate salaries. I quote again from MayOn the 20th May, 1825, notice was taken that a member who had voted with the Ayes on the report of the Leith Docks Bill had a direct pecuniary interest in passing the Bill. He was heard in his place, and stated that on that account he had not voted in Committee on the Bill, and that he had voted, in this instance, through inadvertence. His vote was ordered to be disallowed. Eveni n that case, where the vote questioned was due to a mistake on the part of the honourable member who recorded it , the House of Commons took such a serious view of the matter that it disallowed the vote. Numerous other in stances of the same kind might be quoted, but I need not weary honourable members with them. I will, however, quote fche following from page 356 of the tenth edition of May, As the Speaker stated, 12th May, 1885, there Holding is no rule of the House on the subject. He recommended that each member should be guided by his own feelings in the matter, and should vote or abstain from' voting as"" he thought fit, though the Speaker added to his",24,Privilege

101,Mr Mahony,"There are two verystatement a reminder that members should be aware that they ran the risk of having their votes disallowed by the subsequent action of the House. The Speaker of fche House of Commons afc fchafc fcime was a very eminent man. He admitted thab no actual rule was laid down, and said that fche action of members in such cases should be dictated by their sense of honour. member for Riverina( Mr Killen) may have inadvertently fallen into error in voting as he did, but there can be no doubfc whatever thafc he had a pecuniary interest in fche B ill upon which he voted. He admits fchat fche measure will relieve him of a certain amount of taxationfor which he is already liable. There have been assessments of his leaseholds upon which taxation has accrued and is owing. these remarks to the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson), but, through Mr Speaker, to the honourable member for Riverina. Asi t is clear that the honourable member, by recording his vote, could relieve himself of a debt due to the Commonwealth Taxation Department, there can be no doubt about his practical pecuniary interest in the matter, and his vote should be disallowed. Without further trespassing upon the patience of honourable members, I trust ! that the honourable member for Riverina will give a satisfactory explanation of his vote, or that the House will take steps to vindicate itself by disallowing his vote. for the fact thafc fche motion is delaying business at a time when we can ill afford to delay, I should be very pleased thafc the honourable member for East Sydney has submitted it , because ifc gives me an opportunity of explaining my position. I contend thafc every member of this House is continually voting on matters in which he is directly interested. must be so in dealing with income tax measures, measures generally imposing taxation, those connected with the Tariff, and other matters. Nearly every member of the House will have a direct pecuniary interest in such questions. I admitted, and I still admit, that I have a direct pecuniary interest in the taxation of leaseholds, although ifc is infinitesimal as compared with my other interests. have a motion on the business-paper to reduce the salaries of honourable members. In that motion the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) is directly interested, and I should like to know whether the honourable' member or any other member of this House will refrain from voting on that motion. They are all pecuniarily interested in the matter with which ifc deals. orable member's debt to the Taxation Department, and of how much of ifc will,his vote relieve him ? vote to avoid the payment of what I owe. I voted only that the tax should nofc be levied in future. I did nofc vote to avoid paying anything I owe, and the insinuation of the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) is mosfc unfair. Only last night the Leader of fche OpposiI am not addressing tion ( Mr Charlton), in speaking on the Income Tax Collection B ill , said it was very unfair that he should be. compelled to pay £ 5 0 a year for repairs to his house and not be allowed to deduct that amount from his assessable income. Was nofc fche honourable member in fchat case voting on a matter in which he had a direct pecuniary interest? The motion is most uncalled for, but it gives me the opportunity to explain my position. I gave my vote, as I did, believing that it was necessary in the public interest that I should do so. H a d the interests of no one else been involved, I would probably not have voted, but I recognised that there are hundreds of struggling lease-holders affected by the legislation w it h which we were dealing, and it was in their interests fchat I voted. They have been mosfc unjustly treated, and the injustice would be continued if the tax were retained. I considered it necessary in the public in terests to vote as I did. -This matter has been submitted by honThat orable members, primarily , as a question of privilege, and in the second instance, as a question affecting honourable members generally, irrespective of party, as to their rights or limitations as members of this House. In the circumstances, I do not hesitate in any way to participate in the debate.

107,Mr Speaker (Rt. Hon. W . A. WA T T ) .,"or parliamentary procedure in the British House of, Peers or the House of Commons, and it has been decided variously according to the view of either the House of Peers or the House of Commons. A prominent feature of the matter, which appears to have been overlooked by honourable members who have dealt w i th the motion so far, is the v it a l distinction made by the authorities on constitutional law and practice between public and private Bills. The honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony), for example, quoted certain obviously arose in connection with p r i vate Bills, as set out in May, on the pages from which he quoted. I ask honourable members to view this matter as one affecting the integrity and probity of Parliament, as well as the honour of the individual member whose vote is challenged, and to read and consider, carefully the distinction drawn by the authorities. The first case of the kind which came under notice in these British Dominions arose in the State of Victoria. I find, on referring to the Victorian Hansard, and the Votes and Proceedings of the Victorian Parliament, that as early as 1857 one of the most eminent speakers who ever presided over the deliberations of the Victorian Legislative Assembly was called upon, in conjunction w i th that House, to consider a question such as that with which we are dealing. A f t e r a lengthy debate, in which a number of eminent men, whose names' have become historic, took part, Sir Francis Murphy made use of words which have been reported as follows:Before -submitting the question to the House he would express his opinion in accordance with the request of the House. The rule that a member .pecuniarily interested in a question should not vote upon, it was correctly laid down as a regulation of the House of Comties, and powers of this Parliament, and mons. But it. had also been laid down on more bhan one occasion, that the rulesmust not be interpreted in their literal sense, but in the way in which it -was the practice and usage gf the House to deal with them. The usual practice 'had been stated correctly-that the rules referred to did not apply to questions of public policy, or to public questions at all. That had been distinctly stated on several occasions and was laid down in May and Hansard. From these authorities the honourable gentleman proceeded to quote to the effect that, generally speaking, the rule applied only in the case of private Bills and questions of a similar nature, and not to questions of public policy, or questions of interest arising out of public measures. The report goes on to sayIt, therefore, appeared to him conclusive on the point as to all public questions. He might further quote the statement of the rule as given by the Speaker of the House of Commons in 1884, who said bhat the rule did not apply to public matters. That being the rule laid down by the Speaker and the authorities he had quoted, it would be well to see how it had been applied with respect to any great questions discussed by the House of Commons. He had looked at several cases where great cases which questions were discussed, and when it was well ' known that members had a large pecuniary -interest in them. He had referred,, for instance, to the discussions on the Sugar Duties, the Corn Laws, tlie Navigation Laws, Abolition of Slavery, the Land Tax and the Income Tax, Bank and East Company Charters, Factory Bill, &c, and he had found, though it was known that members had large pecuniary interests involved, no exception was taken to' their votes. Taking that then, as the interpretation of the rule given by the House of Commons, he had no hesitation in saying that this measure-^-the Crown Lands Bill-wa s not one to which the rule applied. That was the decision after elaborate debate and careful analysis by a gentleman who is universally recognised to have been one of the most eminent interpreters of constitutional law and the practice of Parliament in the parliamentary history of this State. Coming now to May, who has been quoted by the mover and seconder of the motion, let me.say that, whilst they quoted correctly, their citations were not sufficiently extensive to put all the facts before honourable members. I suggest, not that I should read them in f u l l at this stage, but that honourable members should read from the middle of page 353 to the middle of page 357, of the tenth edition of May, wherein, at the time our Constitution issued from the British Parliament, the rights, immuniof individual members, were laid down. I shall read from those pages only so far a3 may be necessary to help members to determine this matter, because it is a matter in the control of the House, and not of the Chair. On page 353 May saysIn the Commons it is a rule that no member who has a direct pecuniary interest in a question shall be allowed to vote upon it ; but, in order to operate as a disqualification, this interest must be immediate and personal, and not merely of a general or remote character. On the 17th July, 1811, the rule was thus explained iby Mr Speaker Abbot: ""This interest must be a direct pecuniary interest and separately belong to the persons whose votes were questioned and not in"" common with the rest of His Majesty's subjects or on a matter of State policy!"" it is, in this instance. TheB ill relieves the honourable member of the payment of taxation. matter of courtesy, if nofc of order, I honourable members the views which, during the last twenty-four hours, I have been able to elicit on the historic side of this question. May continuesThis opinion was given upon a motion for disallowing the votes of the bank directors upon the Gold Coin Bill, which was afterwards negatived without a division. And on occasions when the objection of personal interest in a vote, has been raised, which came obviously within the exemption from the application of the rule, defined by Mr Speaker Abbott, the Speaker or the Chairman has over-ruled the objection, or has decided that a motion to disallow the vote would be out of order. May then makes mentNo instance is to be found in the journals in whicli the vote of a member has been disallowed, upon questions of public policy. A which and, in many instances, disallowed, on questions connected with private Bills. served in the whole of the interpretations on this matter. the attention of honourable members-for they have to decide, this question-to a little book which probably they, in their busy lives, have had little time to read. It is an Australian work by E . G. Blackmore, the first Clerk of the Senate' of Australia. teresting and apposite cases in which votes have been challenged in the House of Assembly of South Australia. page 24 he statesStanding order 200 provides that no member sliall be entitled to vote on a division upon a question in which he has a direct pecuniary interest; and the vote of any member so interested shall be disallowed. But .it is obvious that if this rule was absolute and unqualified, the proceedings of the House would, in certain oases, be unduly fettered and embarrassed to the detriment of State policy. He quotes the remarks of Mr Speaker Abbot, as recorded in the paragraph I have just read from May. Then he saysOn 11th October, 1864, on the ""Assessment T h a t is what we' claim on Stock Bill,"" a member's vote was challenged on the grounds that he had a direct personal interest in the passing of the Bill. The question was adjourned to the next day, when the House decided by a majority of sixI trust that as a teen to ten that the vote be .allowed-the ground being taken that it was a question of public interest and State policy; and this was may be permitted to put before the view which Mr Speaker (Hawker) had expressed on the point being raised. A similar question came up again on 21st December, 1865. In Committee, on resolutions as the Waste Lands Leases, Mr Strangways challenged the rights of certain members to vote and the House resumed to hear Mr Speaker. Mr Speaker (Kingston) ruled that votes, on resolution, might be struck off on the ground that as it was contemplated to give pecuniary advantage to some of the pastoral lessees, those members who had an interest in any of the nastoral leases included, had such a pecuniary interest as disentitled them to vote. The votes of two members were struck off the division-list on one of the resolutions. When the Bill giving effect to the resolutions this important statein Committee was before the House, Mr Strangways, on 30th January, 1866, again appealed to Mr Speaker as to the right of members interested in leases named in the schedule of the Bill to vote on any stages thereof. Mr Speaker took the same view as on the former occasion, whereupon a motion number of cases are given in was made, "" That this House does not agree votes have been challenged, with the ruling of Mr Speaker on the question of the personal interest of members."" The matter was fully debated, and on 6th February, 1866, the House, by twenty to twelve, reversed That vital distinction is obthe Speaker's ruling, on the ground that it was a public measure dealing with a public I shall now direct policy. Meanwhile, on 2nd February, 1866, in Committee on the question of free distillation, Mr Speaker was appealed to as to the votes of members who would be benefited by free distillation, and the motion was made to strike off certain names, but it was carried, on division, by the Speaker's casting vote, "" That this question, being one relating to taxation, all He gives a number of in members may vote npon it . "" On 9th October, '1867, Mr Townsend called Mr Speaker's attention to a vote of the House relative to free passes to members, and asked On if they were competent to vote on that question, having a direct' pecuniary interest therein. Mr Speaker ruled that in this case no matter of State policy was involved, nor had the rest of Her Majesty's subjects an interest in common with members, and the Votes might be disallowed. The question that certain votes be disallowed was debated on 11th and 16th October, and was negatived by twenty-two to four. On 23rd November, 1870, a motion was before the House for making provision in future mail contracts to provide free passes",26,Privilege

109,Mr Speaker,"to members, available during sitting of Parliament, and on the most direct road to and from the member's residence and the city of Adelaide. The votes of five members were challenged on the grounds of direct personal and pecuniary interest. The vote of the fust member named was disallowed on division, and the votes of two other members allowed on division. In two of these divisions the members interested voted against tlie question, and his name was struck off by Mr Speaker; but the result was not affected thereby. On another division the Speaker gave a casting vote in favour of disallowing the membei's vote. The numbers 'of the original division on the resolution, which had been ten to eight, were now, by the disallowance of two votes, rendered equal, and Mr Speaker gave a casting vote against the resolution. There is no instance in the journals of the House of Commons of a vote having been disallowed on a public Bill-(Cf. Peel's Decisions, 1884-86, p. 58.) In the matter of a private Bill there can be no question or doubt. Thus, ou Uth October, 1871, the votes of three members were struck off the division list without motion on a clause in Committee on the Adelaide, Glenelg, and Subuiban Bailway Bill, they having stated that they were shareholders in the company. I give honourable members these facts more with the object of furnishing them with the information which my research has revealed than to decide the question. Whether an honourable member's vote shall be allowed or not has, in all B r it is h and Dominions Parliaments, been dealt with as a matter entirely in the control of the House. The various distinctions to which I have referred are matters for the consideration of honourable members-particularl y the distinction between public and private Bills. I inform the Biverina( Mr Killen) that the custom, according to May's Parliamentary Practice, is that the member whose vote is under consideration on the ground of personal interest, having been heard in his place, shall withdraw immediately, and before the question founded thereon has been proposed. The honourable member for ( Mr Killen) the that we shall depart from a practice which was laid down 100 years ago. we have made some progress in the interval. I think it is decidedly u n f a i r that the honourable member has to leave the chamber. I am not so sure that it is the wish of the House that he should do so. < I sincerely hope that the House will alter the practice. We should not be guided by what happened in 1857, or even in 1907. We are living in the year 1923. It seems foolish that when a charge is levelled against an honourable member other honourable members should be compelled to speak of it in his absence. The matter should be dealt w i th face to face, and man to man. I believe that it is the wish of the House that the honourable member for Riverina should remain in his place. option.

165,Mr Makin (Hindmarsh) [2.52],"redress the wrongs that have been done to the unfortunate people concerned. The first case which I desire to submit is that of Edward Patrick who was a member of the 43rd Infantry Battalion. of the rigours of winter in Great Britain, he contracted a serious illness and was returned to Australia. his illness assumed a form which was quite unlooked for in its earlier stages, and for the past two years he has been an inmate of ' a mental hospital in South Australia. children of tender years dependent upon her, is now in a very serious position. Prior to enlistment this man's health was quite satisfactory. He was passed by the Medical Board for service abroad, and a short time before his enlistment had been accepted by a medical officer for admission to membership of a local friendly society. fied is at present abroad, so we are unable at the moment to. secure his endorsement of the certificate, but we have obtained from the local chemist, who was closely associated with the doctor in his work, a statement to the effect was a man of robust As the unfortunate experience of this man whilst on active service abroad was the main ability, this Government should accept the responsibility of caring for his wife and four children. South Australian Soldiers' Fund is at present paying Mrs. McAvaney an allowance, and if this were discontinued at any time she would not be able to provide for herself and her children. The fact that those administrating the South Australian Soldiers' Fund recognise the claims of this woman is surely sufficient evidence of the facts, and ample justification for this Government to pay her a permanent pension. case before the Repatriation Commission, but they refused to grant a pension to Mrs. McAvaney. with the Treasurer, and he confirmed the attitude of the Commission. that the disability to which Mr to the Government for their sympathetic McAvaney is to-day subject cannot be attributed to his war service, or any illness contracted whilst abroad. Such a contention is, certainly, not in keeping with the favorable attitude of the AUPMr Makin. tralian Soldiers' Fund. This is the concluding, paragraph of the Treasurer's replyMcAvaney, As you are aware, tbe Repatriation Commission is alone charged with the responsibility Unfortunately, as the result of determining war pension cases, and, in the circumstances, I regret that it is out of my power to take any further action. After his return This man was fit for war service and suffered from serious illness while 'abroad, and yet the Government are not now prepared to accept the responsibility of caring for his wife and children. If the His wife, with four present pension regulations do not permit of assistance being given to such cases, this House should insist on an early amendment of them to secure this woman from the possibility of destitution. She relies solely on the contributions of the South Australian Soldiers' Fund. Another case is that of an ex-soldier, Peter Malloy, of the 10th Battalion, now deThe local doctor who so certiceased, who left a widow and child. Whilst on active service, Private Malloy was badly wounded by shrapnel. In consequence, one arm was paralyzed, and one leg amputated. Lateri t was found necessary to amputate the other leg. and Dr. Poulton, of Adelaide, ordered him to the hospital to undergo the operaconstitution. tion. Mrs. Malloy was not aware that the Repatriation insisted upon pensioners being treated at the Military cause of his present disHospital, and, in ignorance, she arranged for her husband to be sent to the Adelaide Hospital. The operation was performed Thp and Malloy left the hospital. Later gangrene and other complications set in, and he ultimately died. Mrs. Malloy is now in receipt of a pension of 18s. per week for herself, and 10s. a week for her daughter, who is eight years of age. This pension is totally inadequate.

There are scores of these cases, and unless something",33,Discussio N Of Grievance S Soldiers Dependants Repatriatio N Commission Public Sebvice Pro Motion Mb J Mohtby S Case Equal Pay Fob Equal Work Tas Manian Caebide Industby Direc T Steamer Communicatio Nwithho
166,"That, Prior To The War, Mr Mcavaney","is done to ameliorate their .sufferings, the Government will merit the contempt of the citizens of Australia. The case of Corporal L. J. Matthews, of the 5th Pioneers, now deceased is somewhat similar. I am not aware that this claim has been considered by the Commission, but the State Deputy Commissioner has advised that the claim for a pension has been disallowed. I shall, therefore, set forth the circumstances, and let honourable members decide as to the merits of the case. Whilst on active service he was seriously gassed. Fie returned to Australia, and, although his health was seriously impaired he followed his former trade of painter. After some time the effects of the gas made it impossible for this man to continue in his employment. His condition was complicated by toxemia and plumbism, and he died. His widow and her child, nine months old, are without assistance. It is not possible for the woman, having such a young child, to look for employment, and she finds it very difficult to live on the very small amount left by her deceased husband. She is not in receipt of any pension from the Commonwealth. There is no doubt that the gas from which this man suffered was a contributing factor to his death, and timely assistance should be given to his widow. Her claim that his gassing contributed to his death is confirmed, I understand, by Dr. West, an eminent medical practitioner, of Adelaide. The widow states in her letter to me that she would be satisfied if she were paid only £ 1 per week to help herself and her child in their hour of extreme difficulty. The Treasurer has said that he has not the power to intervene in these matters, which are determined by the Repatriation Commission; but I know that he can give assistance in such cases. I ask only that equity and justice shall determine the decision of the authorities in these cases. Dr. member might let me have the papers. able gentleman the whole of the papers, and I hope he will see that full justice is done. I wish now to refer to a serious anomaly as it affects a Commonwealth servant. The statement of the grievance which I place on record has not been received .from the officer concerned, aud I therefore trust that it will not be held that he has acted in any way contrary to the Public Service regulations. When I hear of an injustice, I am prepared to ventilate it . I accept full responsibility for exposing this anomaly in the hope'that in future similar injustices may not be perpetrated. The officer to whose case I refer is Mr Jack Mortby, of the Federal Taxation Department, in Adelaide. He is a teller of the 5th class in the Cashiers' Branch of the Department. In 1921 applications were called to fill vacancies in some 4th class positions, and a man named McLean was appointed to one of these positions. Mr Mortby, as a matter of fact, performed the duties of the position for some twelve months during its occupancy by McLean, who subsequently resigned to go to America. The position was again advertised in November, 1922, and Mr Mortby was the person ultimately selected to fill it. He had all along performed the duties of the position. In November, 1923, he received a communication, of which I have a copy, from the Acting Deputy Commissioner of Taxation in Adelaide, intimating that he had recommended him' for promotion. The Treasury and Audit Office were notified of the recommendation. The officer has received the salary applicable to the position, together with retrospective pay from October, 1922. Such payments would not, of course, be sanctioned without an authorizing order from the Treasury and the Audit Department. His salary would be automatically increased to £245, and presumably the salary at the increased rate is included in the Estimates which we considered last week, and will be paid during the current financial year. On the 17th August of this year Mr Mortby was notified that he has not yet been given the Acting Public Service Commissioner's recommendation for his promotion. It would appear that the action of the authorities in failing to ratify the recommendation for his promothat have been under consideration. It I shall give the honoris difficult to know why the ratification of the recommendation for this man's promotion has been withheld by the Acting Public Service Commissioner in view of the fact that the Treasury' and Audit Office officials have agreed to the payment of the salary at the higher rate. The order that confirmed the promotion appears to have been completed,",34,Discussio N Of Grievance S Soldiers Dependants Repatriatio N Commission Public Sebvice Pro Motion Mb J Mohtby S Case Equal Pay Fob Equal Work Tas Manian Caebide Industby Direc T Steamer Communicatio Nwithho
167,Mr Makin,"bufc has nofc been gazetted. The officer is concerned as to his rights should he be deemed to be an excess officer under section 20 of the Public Service Act. It would appear that his promotion has been purposely delayed for a circumstance that will directly affect his rights in the future. There are, no doubt, other cases of the same kind in the Federal Taxation Department in which officers at present feel insecure in their positions. I wish the Treasurer to acknowledge and act upon the recommendation of the Acting Deputy Commissioner in Adelaide, and confirm the promotion of this officer from the 5th to the 4th class, in order that his rights may be protected, and he may receive what is his due. I should like now to supplement the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) and the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Yates) last evening in connection w i th a request for equal pay for equal work in the Commonwealth Public Service, whether performed by male or female officers. Many women are under great disabilities in this regard, especially in the Postmaster-General's Department. I hope that honourable gentleman w i ll use his see that female officers required to perform the same duties as male officers shall receive the same remuneration. In many cases more justice would be afforded to the public servants if some form of direct approach to the Minister existed. abolition of the Arbitratio n Courts?' fchat there is nothing that precludes the Minister from giving the female employees of the service the same consideration and pay as the male employees receive. by the Public Service awards. find some way of overcoming the anomaly if it wished so to do. Many female Government servants have responsibilities as heavy as those carried by the men folk, and they are at a serious disadvantage, because their salary is so much smaller. I trust that the Government will heed the appeal made last evening by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton), which is supported by every honourable member on fchis side of the House. be no differentiation in payment for the same class of work. If the Government removed the dissatisfaction caused by the existing distinctions between male and female employees who do exactly the same class of work, it would eliminate a very real grievance, which at the present moment exists in the Commonwealth Public Service, especially in the Postmaster-General's Department. L e t the Government affirm the principle of equal pay for equal work. Mr O'KEEFE (Denison) [3.34] I compliment the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) on his remarks respecting equal pay for equal work. I have always supported that principle. We should make no distinction between men and women who do exactly similar work. They should receive the same rates of pay. It is not sex that should count, but service rendered to the State. I direct the attention of the Government to the precarious condition of the carbide industry in Tasmania. Honourable members will recollect that this industry has been discussed a number of times in this Chamber. Some months ago the carbide company which operates a' few miles south of Hobart had to close its works, because it had £18,000 worth of manufactured influence with the Cabinet to carbide on its hands, for which no sale could be found in Australia. Imported carbide was being dumped here at a price which made it impossible for the Australian company to compete. A number of deputations have placed the position before the Government, and when the Prime Minister was in Tasmania a deputation waited upon him. The replies given to these various deputations have 1 would nofc. I believe been to the effect that the Government would give what relief it could fco the company. Ultimately it decided that it could not recommend the re-imposition of the embargo on the importation of carbide, which was lifted just prior to the closing of the last Parliament, alT h e Government could though it was shown that an embargo was the only thing that could materially benefit the industry. No doubt the Governmenfc was actuated by what it believed tio be the best reasons in reaching its decision.

This is a comparatively new industry, and if it is to be maintained under Australian conditions it must be given every possible encouragement. The Government is pledged to protect Australian industries. It has been found that the duty is of practically no assistance. The only thing that will meet the situation is an embargo. The company endeavoured to open its works again a few weeks ago. It was able to make some temporary financial arrangement, but unless an embargo is quickly placed upon the importation of carbide, it will have to close down and probably go into liquidation. The imported article'is sold at a price which is about 10s. per ton below that charged for the Australian product. No matter how heavy the duty is, it appears that it will always be sold at less than the local article. The reason is easy to explain. Many overseas companies manufactured large quantities of carbide during the war, and they now have heavy surplus stocks of which they are determined to get rid at any price. Consequently, they are prepared to undersell the Australians every time. If adequate assistance is given the Tasmanian manufacturers are willing to guarantee to supply all the requirements of Australia, and they will also enter into a price arrangement with the Government to insure that no advantage will be taken of the'public because they have a monopoly. The price can be fixed by the Minister. Imported carbide is being dumped into Australia in large quantities. ing duty on it as well as the Tariff. Mr O'KEEFE: I have already explained why duties will not meet the case. The large surplus stocks of oversea manufacturers enable them to undersell the Australian article every time. I ask the Government to see whether it cannot reverse its decision and re-impose the embargo. Theni t will give this essentially Australian company a reasonable prospect of building up a valuable industry. The Government is pledged to Protection, and I submit that it could give this industry all the protection necesago to secure the appointment of a Select sary, and yet insure that carbide consumers will not be required to pay more than a fair price for carbide. Australia better to provide a pension for all the employees in this industry in Tasmania, than that the Government should do as the honourable member asks. Mr O'KEEFE -There we have once more the cry of the Free Trader, who is prepared to wipe out all Australian industries and bow the knee to the goddess of cheapness. I have never adopted that attitude. Frequently, I have voted for duties which were not approved by the people I represented, but I took the broad Australian view. The honourable member for Forrest does not; he is a consistent Free Trader of the old school, and I was very pleased to hear last night that he was not a candidate for the position of fourth member of the Tariff Board. . If the honourable member would only give assistance to the Australian carbide industry he Would be doing something to cheapen and stabilize the price to the consumers. They would not be subject to those variations in price which invariably happen when they are dependent upon supplies from overseas. If free importations were allowed, the Australian public might get the carbide cheaper for a time until the Australian industry was killed, and then up would go the price. It is indisputable that the best guarantee of reasonable prices to the consumer is the fostering of local industries which can be controlled by this Parliament, so that no monopoly detrimental to the general community is established. I believe Ministers will reconsider this question, because I am satisfied that the Nationalists do desire to foster Australian industries. I have doubts about the members of the Country party, who lean too much towards Free Trade. I hope that the Nationalist majority in the Ministry will take steps to prevent this essentially Australian industry from being squelched. Owing to the methods adopted by the Government to close the session this week-da y and night sittings, and the limitation of speechesthis is the last opportunity I shall have this session of bringing forward the grievances affecting the people of Tasmania.

174,Mr Prowse,"It would pay WesternCommittee to inquire into the necessity for the establishment by the Commonwealth of a direct up-to-date shipping service between the mainland and Hobart. Such a Committee could within a few days, and at very little expense, have collected such information as would have afforded the Government and the House an opportunity of deciding whether the request for the establishment of this service was fair. Minister did not support me, and when I asked that a vote should be taken he moved the adjournment of the debate. Of course, he is an experienced parliamentary tactician, and his actions indicated that he had not the slightest intention of allowing the motion to be further discussed during the session. A fortnight ago, and on another subsequent occasion, I asked the Prime Minister if he would allow a vote to be taken, without further discussion upon my motion and others standing on the notice-paper in the names of honourable members. I received the usual Ministerial reply that an opportunity to take votes upon private members' business would be afforded if the state of the business would permit. Of course, the Prime Minister did not intend that the state of business should permit, but I am satisfied that if the motion had been carried to a division the Committee would have been appointed. I would have obtained the solid support of honourable members on this side' of the House, because of the broad general principle involved, and as it is not a party question, a number of honourable members on the Ministerial side would have voted with me. My proposal, that the effects of the absence of a direct shipping service trol of a shipping combine, which,' I to southern Tasmania should be investigated, was most reasonable. Select Committee inquiring into the operations of the Navigation Act deal with that question T Mr O'KEEFE -Not in the way I desire, because the matter is one of urgency. realize how the deplorable absence of shipping affects the southern part of Tasmania, particularly Hobart, which has 50,000 inhabitants, and the adjacent districts, which have a population of another 30,000. I believe a Commonwealth shipping service could be operated at a profit. I quoted statistics obtained from Government sources in Tasmania showing the inward and outward trade of the port of Hobart, and I made a reasonable estimate of the cost of a direct weekly service by an up-todate boat between that port and Melbourne. from Sydney? Unfortunately, the Mr O'KEEFE A boat runs from Sydney about every ten days, or once a week in the busy part of the year. member is now discussing the merits of a question that is on the notice-paper. Mr O'KEEFE I may be contravening the Standing Orders to some extent, but I cannot be said to be anticipating the discussion upon my motion, because I am satisfied that it will not be further dealt with during this session. Parliament has already passed a measure handing over to a Board the management and control of the Commonwealth Shipping Line. The Board may sell some of the ships belonging to the Line, but it will still retain a large number, and it should be urged by the Government to consider my suggestion immediately. If the Board has not under its control an up-todate passenger and cargo vessel suitable for the service, it will have power to purchase one. I am satisfied that f u l l investigation would disclose that the service would pay. If I am asked why the private companies do not establish the service, I can only express the belief that the Shipping Ring is responsible. The whole of the Australian trade is in conunderstand, allots separate and distinct spheres of action for each section. not the Whether or not that be the reason, the fact remains that there is no direct shipping service between the southern part of Tasmania and the mainland. This is not fair.

177,Mr Speaker,"The honorablebable that a direct shipping service, such as I suggest, w ill show a-profit. It is urgently required, not only for passenger traffic, but also for the marketing of Tasmania's productions. P r i m a r y producers in my State are heavily handicapped in this respect. I should like an assurance that the Government w ill take early action to remove the serious disadvantages from which the southern portion of Tasmania is suffering. I appreciate the opportunity which the Government have made available to honourable members to ventilate grievances at this late hour in the session. It enables me to bring before honourable members a matter which I regard as of the utmost importance, since it concerns an industry of great potential value to Australia: I refer to the tobacco-growing industry. Tobacco has been extensively grown for a period of from t h i r t y to for t y years in the ducers of one-half of the total proNew England portion of New South Wales. As a result of the encouragement offered some years ago by the British Australasian Tobacco Company, the industry made very rapid strides, and today the New England district produces about one-half of the total tobacco leaf grown in Australia. Unfortunately, the tobacco-growers, not only in northern New South Wales, but in other portions of the Commonwealth also, are practically at the mercy of only one buyer. There is not the slightest doubt that the B ritish Australasian Tobacco Company is a combine-whethe r in restraint of trade I am not going to say-but , after I have produced evidence of what has happened, I sball leave honourable members to decide whether the action of the company brings it within the provisions of the Industries Preservation Act. For the information of honourable members, I shall quote extracts of a report that appeared in the Northern Daily Leader published in Tamworth last week. This report statesA meeting of extraordinary interest to tobacco growers throughout 'the north, and others interested in the industry, called by the Tamworth District Tobacco Growers' Association, took place yesterday afternoon at the Oddfellow's Hall, Tamworth, before a large gathering, more than 100 persons 'being present. Mr C. M. Chaffey, honorary secretary of the association, occupied the chair. I ask honourable members to bear in mind market were other than favorable. Mr. the fact that more than 100 persons Gilmour now coolly tells themfchafcf o r the interested in the growing of tobacco were present at that meeting. The chairman, in opening tlie meeting, said they should ibe gratified that such a large number of interested persons were present to learn the prospects of the tobacco-growing inmour, of the British Australasian Tobacco Company, to whom they extended a hearty welcome. He would have pleasure in advising the growers generally, from bis firm's stand-point. These unfortunate men had attended the meeting under a misapprehension. They thought they were going to hear something nice and agreeable from MrG i l mour, the representative of the B r it i sh Australasian Tobacco Company. This was what he saidIn consequence of the position that has arisen, the present meeting was found to be necessary in the interests of the growers. The meeting, I remind honourable members, was representative of the production of tobacco leaf in Australia. Last year the total value of the leaf produced in that district was £250,000. That may not seem very much, but £250,000 is a considerable sum of money to go to one district, and we should remember that only about 10 per cent, of the Australian leaf is used in themanufacture of tobacco in Australia. Mr Gilmour went on to sayHe was present at the invitation of tlie Tamworth Tobacco Growing Association, to promote the interests of the company to which he belonged. I direct special attention to that statement. He was not antagonistic in any way; he was in sympathy with the men on the land, and any one who was acquainted with hian and his work would understand that he would do the fair thing. A very nice and benevolent attitude for this gentleman, as the representative of the only buyer in this industry in Australia, to adopt. Mr Gilmour went on to sayHe thought it was better to come along and explain to the tobacco growers the true situation rather than allow them to continue growing and raising crops without knowing whether fchey would be able to dispose of them. These growers had been raising and disposing of crops for very many years without any hint that the prospects of the",38,Eahle Page Th E Honourable Tion Is Due To The Taxation Agreements

As a result of the fluecuring methods the Upper Murray tobacco growers have produced a leaf considered to be the equal of anything produced by the American growers. I understand that there are a large number of tobacco growers in the north of Victoria, in Western Australia, and in southern Queensland. asian Tobacco Company has abolished the air-drying methods, and virtually struck a death-blow at the Australian industry. Mr Gilmore stated at the meeting of tobacco-growers that the air-dried tobacco was inferior, .and did not produce the aroma required to suit the palates of Australian smokers. smokers were a very peculiar class of donsumer; that the company had found' it necessary to provide only the highest grades of tobacco for them, and that the American grades of tobacco were the only qualities that suited the tastes of the Australian consumers. He also said that the Australian growers should make an endeavour to improve the quality of their leaf, so that the necessary burning aroma could be imparted to the manufactured article, which would certainly be a good thing for the industry. After practically telling the growers that the cause of complaint on the part of the company was that too much inferior leaf was produced, and that the company desired a superior quality of leaf altogether, he went on to say that during his experience he had known cases where tobacco had been overproduced, and that the price went dcwn to 3d. in Victoria forty years ago, and in New South Wales thirty-five years ago. He warned the men against raising crops that subsequently could not be disposed of, and said that if any man prepared 40 or 50 acres for tobacco growing he would be doing so at his own risk. In one breath, he said that the company desired only the highest quality of leaf, and in the next breath he warned the growers against over-production. I ask honourable members if it is reasonable to assume that there can be over-production of tobacco leaf in Australia, when about 10 per cent, of the leaf produced in this country is used in the manufacture of Australian tobacco. The thing is absurd, and apparently the true motive of the company is to deal a death blow to the tobacco [industry here. Their action seems to me to be a deliberate attempt to throttle the potentialities of this great Australian industry. Mr O'KEEFE -That is part of their settled policy. reasonable enough to suggest that when Now the British-Australthere is only one buyer in Australia, the British-Australian Tobacco Company, it should take any kind of tobacco produced. That would be absurd. But as the company is in such a responsible position, and has the Australian industry absolutely at its mercy, it should show that it appreciates that responsibility, and is not prepared, He said that Australian in the interests of some foreign-grown product, to wipe our own industry out of existence. If honourable members wish to see the 'Australian tobacco-growing; industry develop into a valuable asset,, they should take steps to retard any action of the British-Australian Tobacco Company having a detrimental effect, on the industry. We do not know what this company is. Some people say that it is largely an Australian company, and. others that it is an Australian company with British capital in it ; but many contend that it is really a branch of tha great American Tobacco Trust. denied. self denies the latter imputation. We should protect the tobacco growers. Under present legislation, it cannot be ascertained whether this tobacco company is really a branch of the American Tobacco Trust, acting detrimentally to the interests of the Australian consumers. We know what happened during the war. The British-Australian Tobacco Company suddenly discovered that its operations were being seriously hampered by the effects of the war, and that the law of supply and demand necessitated an increase in the retail price of tobacco by 50 per cent. Smokers were certainly amazed when the price of tobacco rose from Is. per 2-oz. tin to Is. 6d., and cigarettes in like proportion. Later, the price was increased by I d .

If this company is a branch of the American Tobacco Trust, we have a perfect right to investigate its operations. The Industries Preservation Act, although in existence, is virtually a dead letter. night, I was surprised to find the broad compass of the legislative machinery which was instituted nearly twenty years ago to cope with the very situation that exists to-day. Yet the Act has been more or less inoperative, and nothing has been done to effectively protect the interests of the Australian tobacco industry against the operations of local or foreign combines. sinister motives to the British-Australian Tobacco Company, or suggest that it desires to do anything more than improve the quality of Australian leaf. But when a company which uses only a small proportion of Australian leaf talks of overproduction, and suddenly wipes out an important section of the tobacco-growing industry, it is.time that legislative machinery was put into operation to discover its object. The company may have been justified in sending its representative to deal a death blow to the tobacco industry in northern New South Wales in such a dramatically sudden way; but, if it was, it is under a responsibility to the tobacco-growers concerned to say why it did this thing. We have proof that by scientific methods we can produce a tobacco leaf in Australia equal to the American standard. If ,the Company were acting in the interests of Australian producers, it would do everything possible to limit its importations of American leaf, and to encourage the production of a high standard of leaf in Australia. It has been roved by actual tests that we can prouce as good leaf as the American leaf, Sand if this improvement goes on, the local article must suit the taste of Australian smokers of tobacco. But this company practically says, ""We have had enough of the industry. We will take no more of your leaf, and, if you grow it, it will remain on your farms as so much rubbish."" I ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to look into this matter, which is one of great urgency. I have said that the industry was responsible Mr Thompson. last year for the introduction of about £200,000 to the northern district of New South Wales; but it cannot be expected that growers will put seed into the ground, or that men will go to the expense of setting up flues for the production of a good quality of tobacco Oh examining that Act last when the only buyer of Australian leaf tells them that, if they do so, it will be at their own risk, because the company may not even send its buyer to the district to look at the tobacco. The local producers may inform the company that they have a fine crop and would like it to send its representative to look at it, and the company may reply that it has not a buyer available to visit the district. honourable member suggest that we should do? by the company towards tobacco-growers in the area to which I refer will re-act against tobacco-growers in other areas; practically and, if immediate action is not taken to discover the intention of the company with regard to the future of the industry, we can say good-bye to tobacco growing in Australia in probably the next two years. The Minister asks what I suggest should be done. We have the Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act, but it has, so far, been inoperative. I think we have a more effective instrument for the investigation of matters of this kind in the Tariff Board. I suggest to the Minister that he should immediately place upon that Board the obligation to investigate the position, and find out the relation of the British-Australian Tobacco Company to the American Tobacco Trust, its relation to American tobacco-growers, and what really is its motive in taking such very drastic and unjust action towards the Australian producers of tobacco leaf. It is possible that, should the Tariff Board find out all these things, this Parliament will be unable to do anything, because we know how very difficult it is to deal with the operations of trusts. Buti f a flood of light is turned upon the operations of a combine such as this, it may decide to alter its policy. to is like all other importers, to whom the honourable member's Leader has handed himself over.",41,Discussio Nofgrievances Cattle Removal Of Navalwork Shops Wester N Australi An Ship

189,Mr Fenton,"The company referredbers of the party occupying this corner believe in the preservation of Australian industries, and will give their assistance, where it is possible, to preserve them, without inflicting great hardship and injustice upon the rest of the people of Australia. If the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) was consistent, he would show a little more sympathy at this juncture with an industry which might be made one of the most important in this country. It is a primary industry, and if it is protected in of a Combine or Trust in or out of Aussome way against the operations of a Combine that is at present able to promote or depress it at will, I have no doubt that, in a comparatively short time, those engaged in it will be growing enough tobacco, and tobacco of the very highest quality, to meet Australia's requirements. says that our tobacco is inferior and it can only use American leaf, but we have the statement of experts, who examined samples of flue-dried leaf produced in the Upper Murray Valley, that it is possible there to grow a leaf which is even superior to the American leaf. That shows what we can do in Australia. If a gentleman can be sent up from Sydney or Melbourne to a district in which tobacco is grown to tell the growers that they need not produce any more leaf, and, if they do so, it will be at their own risk because the company may not buy it, it is clear that tobacco-growers will not waste their time, their labour and their money any further on this industry. T thank honourable members for their attention, and I hope that the Minister will place the matter before the Tariff Board, with instructions to make a thorough investigation into the relations of the BritishAustralian Tobacco Company with the American Tobacco Trust, and its attitude towards the Australian tobacco growing industry. should be appointed to inquire into the matter. do not know whether that is necessary, in view of the fact that the Tariff Board, which it has just been decided to strengthen, can make the necessary investigations, and, in doing so, may render valuable service to the primary producers of Australia. If it carries out this work successfully, it will justify its continued existence. I should like honourable members generally to keep their eyes on the British-Australian Tobacco Company. Of late years, very little attention has been directed to the operations of Combines and Trusts in this country. Although we have legislative machinery to control them to some extent, it is not in operation, and it is very rarely that action is taken even to inquire into the operations tralia. A proper inquiry into this question might inaugurate a new era of activity in regard to the operation of the Industries Preservation Act of 1906. I trust that, as a result of an inquiry by the Tariff Board into this question, it will be discovered by honourable members The company or. both sides'that it is high time we took a little more notice than we have been doing of the actions of Trusts within our midst. intend, in the brief time at my disposal, to bring before honourable members a question of very great importance to the Queensland cattle industry, and one affecting the honour and integrity of the Government. During the Federal election campaign, whilst speaking at Maryborough, the then Leader of the Nationalist party, the right honourable W. M . Hughes, made a very definite promise to the cattle-growers of Queensland, because he recognised that the improvement of their herds was a matter of vital importance. When the right honourable gentleman was in Maryborough assisting the candidature of the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Corser) he made the following statement, which was published in every newspaper in Queensland: There is only one way by which we can definitely improve our herds, and that is by breeding from high-priced animals. Unfortunately, we have to consider the cost of transport and quarantine. The Nationalist Government will introduce legislation designed to assist the producers by defraying the cost of transportation and quarantine of stud stock. That statement was promptly starred in the Brisbane press, including the Daily Mail and the Brisbane Courier, and no doubt induced a large number of cattle owners in Queensland to cast their votes",42,Discussio Nofgrievances Cattle Removal Of Navalwork Shops Wester N Australi An Ship

The Brisbane Courier realized that this assurance was of great value, politically, because is would decide a large number of votes throughout Queensland. Therefore, the day after the promise was made, that newspaper printed it under the following large black headings: Will Pay Transport and Quarantine Costs.

Afr. Forde. in this House know that when they make a definite promise in private life they feel in duty bound to honour it. The Government should feel a similar sense of duty. Since the elections a composite Government has been formed. I ask the Nationalist members of the Government whether the influence of the Country party members in the Ministry will not allow the Nationalist Prime Minister to honour the promise made by the previous leader of his party? If that is the truth, let it be The reason is because known. It cannot be said that the Nationalist party of to-day is different from the Nationalist party at the time of the elections, because the leader of to-day was the Treasurer in the Hughes Administration.

Surelyi t is only reasonable to expect that the man who was his colleague will honour it. If not, let us know who is preventing him from doing so. After the promise was made, Mr T.

Personally I consider the Government are under the circumstances morally bound to recoup our client for this excess expenditure. The amount involved is a mere bagatelle compared with the repudiation of a promise made by the leader of the National party during the election campaign, apparently only^for the purpose of securing votes. I am positively disgusted, and do not know how our client will feel when he receives my letter. During the Federal campaign, the Queensland Government was accused of repudiation by National candidates in connection with the 1920 amendment to the Land Act. It must be admitted that, in view of the National Government's action in this imatter, that .these references were rather unfortunate. Personally, I have always been sceptical about electioneering promises, and not without reason, as this incident emphasizes. In passing, I may mention that I believe you are in full sympathy with your late leader's promise, but, unfortunately, there do not appear' to be too many country members in the Cabinet. This Government, which pretends that it is in sympathy with the cattle raisers and primary producers generally, has repudiated the definite promise made by the Leader of the Nationalist party during the election campaign. the Queensland Primary Producers Cooperative Agency brought this matter before the Queensland Minister for Agriculture. land Premier, who made urgent representations to the Commonwealth that it should honour the promises made by Mr Hughes.

Since then the Commonwealth Government has had the matter again under consideration. In pursuance of a request sent to me by the cattle-own'ers in Central Queensland, and the Primary Producers Co-operative Agency Limited, I made personal representations to the Prime Minister, and on the 9th July received the following letter:Dear Sir, In reply to your letter of 2nd July, relative to representations made to you by Mr William Beak, honorary secretary of the Australian Polled Hereford Association, in connection with the question of the Commonwealth defraying the freight and quarantine charges on stud stock imported to Australia, I am directed to inform you that the Government have fully considered this matter, and regret that they are unable to see their way to take any action in the direction desired.

196,Mr Forde,"The Queensland P r itration to get the undertaking given by their former leader carried out. There are in this House eight Queensland supporters of the party which Mr Hughes led at the last election, and two of them are members of the present Cabinet. Could mot they exert their influence to induce the present composite NationalistCountry party Government to fulfil the pledge given to the people on the eve of the elections? Country party are opposed to this concession to the various farmers, graziers, and others throughout Australia, let us know the truth; let honourable members opposite tell the House where they stand in this matter. No doubt, if a question were addressed to the honourable member for North Sydney( Mr W. M . Hughes) he would say that he is no longer Prime Minister. But the party he led is in office, and there are members in that . party who owe their presence in this Parliament to the promises he made. have a sufficiently high sense of the honour and integrity expected of parliamentarians to make the present Government honour an undertaking definitely given. To the man outside who has been accustomed to believe that members of the Country party are more in sympathy with the primary producers than are the Nationalists, this act of treachery will be a revelation. But the proof of the pudding is in the eating, and although we find that the former Nationalist Leader made that promise in order to secure votes, the present composite Government cannot see its way clear to give effect to it . The cattle -being imported from America are Polled Herefords. It is realized in Queensland, where cattle have to be railed hundreds of miles to the meat works, that it would be of great assistance to the meat industry if all cattle were dehorned. Polled Herefords have no horns, and cannot injure each other in the trucks. In America the breeders raise a special strain of Polled Herefords and other breeds of cattle without horns. The Queensland cattle-raisers realize that they are behind the times in this respect, and are earnestly striving to improve their herds. To that end they are going in for the breeding of Polled Herefords. If Australian breeders are to compete successfully with Argentina in the meat markets of the Old World, they must improve their methods. Argentina is breeding a special strain of early-maturing cattle and Polled Herefords in order to be able to put the meat on the market in the best condition. Our breeders should benefit by their own mistakes and those of others. Australian meat has temporarily lost its place in Great Britain owing largely to Argentina being able to If the members of the put on the Smithfield market a better class of meat than Australia is able to export. Queensland produces about half the cattle raised in Australia, and its pastoralists are endeavouring to improve their stock so that they may have a better chance of competing successfully with Argentina. Realizing that, the former Prime Minister decided to curry favour with Queensland cattle-raisers, and made that promise which the present Administration is refusing to honour. Now, from my place in the HouseI bring the matter before Ministers in the hope that they Surely they will reconsider their previous decision, which means a great deal to the cattle industry in Queensland and other States. I would also suggest that they import fifty of the best bulls procurable for free use by dairy farmers and cattle-raisers. I would not ask for this concession if the Queensland cattle-raisers were prosperous, but they are in a bad way. Many of them 'cannot get even £ 1 or 30s. per head for cattle that ordinarily are worth £10 or £12. Owing to the failure of the export market, the beasts are practically worthless-the breeders cannot give them away. The banks have refused to advance more money to these men, and have asked them to reduce their overdrafts. This they find it impossible to do, and many of them have asked the banks to take over their properties for what they are worth, but the banks refuse to do so, because they recognise that the leases would not realize enough to liquidate the overdraft. The circumstances in Victoria are vastly different from those in Queensland. In Victoria there is no difficulty in getting a good price for fat cattle, but that is not so in Queensland, where there are 8,000,000 cattle. member voted for the retention of the land tax upon Crown leaseholds. were not affected by that tax.

It involves the honour and integrity of Parment monopoly were also defeated. It liament, and the Country party should insist on the definite promise made during the last elections by the then Prime Minister being honoured. I understood that the members of that party had at heart the interest of the small dairymen and graziers. Unfortunately, in travelling .through Queensland, one sees too many inferior cattle. We should encourage the dairymen and graziers to improve their herds, so that Australia may have a chance of successfully competing with the Argentine and other meat-producing countries. The importation of pure Polled Hereford bulls would do much to improve the breed of cattle, and the production of a hornless strain would eliminate some of the losses now sustained in the transtion? Our producers should not be left port of cattle to the meat works. I trust that the Treasurer, 'the Postmaster-General, and the Minister for Works and Railways, as the alleged representatives of the Country party in the Ministry, will give this matter their symthat, in any action which he may take to pathetic consideration, and bear in mind that, by influencing the Cabinet to accede to the request made, they will be honourbers on this side of the House. Unforing a definite election pledge given to the tunately, he can expect none from his people of Queensland-that the Government would do something for the improvement of Australian herds by paying quarantine and transport charges on stud stock imported for that purpose. express every sympathy with the tobacco growers of the New England district, whose unfortunate plight was mentioned by the honourable member for New England( Mr Thompson) this afternoon. I am afraid, however, that the honourable member is associated with the wrong party, and that his efforts to obtain justice for the tobacco-growers in his constituency will not be successful. The political company which the honourable member keeps has never had any sympathy with Australian industries. This' was demonstrated when we were dealing with the Tariff. I also remind the honourable member that, when, by means of a referendum, we sought an increase of the industrial powers of the Commonwealth, to enable the Government to deal with trusts and combines, the vote in the New England district was against us. Our efforts in the early days of Federation to make tobacco a Governis worth noting, however, that the Labour party is not alone in its advocacy of this policy. Tobacco is a State monopoly in Japan and France, and in both countries it is a very fruitfu l source of revenue. I can well understand the indignation of the tobacco-growers in the New England district at the complaint of the representative of the British-Australasian Tobacco Company as to the quality of the leaf, and intimating that the Trust would probably buy no more of it. If Australian industries are to be treated in this way, what good purpose can be served by inducing people to come to this country and engage in producat the mercy of any powerful combine, such as the British-Australasian Tobacco Company. The honourable member for New England has raised a very important question, and I can assure him secure justice for his constituents, he will get every assistance from honourable memown political friends. I am glad the matter has been mentioned, because I have had some correspondence on the subject from growers in the New England district, but, following my invariable practice not to interfere with the business of any other honourable member, I advised them to communicate with the honourable member for New England. I question if any manufacturing industry is more profitable than that of the Tobacco Combine.

I hope that some definite action w ill be taken by the Government. Another matter to which I desire to direct attention is the proposal bf the Government to remove the Naval Workshops from Garden Island to Cockatoo Island. Garden Island has been for many years a naval repairing station. Cockatoo Island, on the other hand, has always been engaged in constructional work, and has not machinery for naval repair Naturally, the Cockatoo Island people desire to get as much work as possible, but the island has not the foreshore facilities necessary to enable ships to lie alongside the repair works. When SenatorE . D . Millen was Ministerf o r Defence, at about the time when war broke out, strong influence was brought to bear on him to remove the workshops to Cockatoo Island, but I was able to prove to h i m that, both from the point of view of u t i l it y and economy, it would be a mistake. When Sir Joseph Cook became Ministerf o r Defence, the same pressure was exerted upon him, but, fortunately, after I had explained the position, he decided that the workshops should remain on Garden Island. The present Minister for Defence( Mr Bowden) has reversed the decision of his predecessors in office. I am satisfied that what is proposed w ill not be in the best interests of the Navy and of the Commonwealth. I hope the Minister w ill reconsider his decision. The equipment of Garden Island is probably equal to that of any other naval workshop in the world. selected by Admiralty experts, have been obtained. of the most intricate and technical character, that cannot be done there.

In the interests of the Navyi t is necessary that the utmost secrecy should be observed in connection w it h certain work. I maintain, however, that, as in the past, all naval repair work should also be done at Garden Island. I deem it my duty to bring before honourable members a matter of very great importance to my constituency. I wish to deal with the shipping facilities on the north-west coast of Western Australia as far as Kimberley, which is in my electorate. It is regrettable that this Government recently gave permission to allow a new boat,^ manned by black labour, to trade on the Western Australian coast. In 1921 a continuing permit the necessary under tbe Navigation Act was given to work. the three black-labour boats, the Gorgon, the Charon, and the Minderoo, at present engaged on that coast. It is strange that Western Australia should be singled out for black-labour boats for Intra-State trade. W it h the exception of two Government boats manned by white labour, all the trade along the north-west Australian coast is carried, w i th the permission of this Government, by blacklabour boats. There is a conspiracy in. certain commercial circles to render inoperative the provisions of the Navigation Act as applied to Australian conditions. Section 286 of the Navigation Act reads(1) Where it ean be shown to the satisfaction of the Minister in regard to the coasting trade with any port, or between any ports in the Commonwealth, or in the Territories under the authority of the Commonwealth(a) that no licensed ship is available for the service; or (b) that the service as carried out by a licensed ship or ships is adequate to ' the needs of such port or ports and the Minister is satisfied that it is desirable in the public interest that unlicensed ships be allowed to engage in that trade, he may grant permits to unlicensed British ships to do so, either conditionally or subject to such conSpecial tools, ditions as he thinks fit to impose. I know of no work, even I protest against the Western Australian coast being singled out for black-labour vessels. If the Lascar or Malay manned boats could ..not be replaced by boats manned w it h whites, I would not complain; but I have it on the best It is not proposed to authority that if the black-labour boats were withdrawn the steam-ship owners would be prepared to trade on the north-west coast w i th boats manned under Australian conditions. This lends colour to the idea that in Australia there is an organized effort to employ cheap foreign labour on Australian-trading boats. Before permits were given, on the 1st July, 1921, to the Gorgon, the Charon, and the Minderoo, the Minister,",48,Improvement Of Stock Assisting Primary Producers Nationalist Government S Offer

204,Mr A. Green (Kalgoorlie) [5.29],"under the Act, should have ascertained whether licensed ships were not available for that service. I have searched the file of correspondence dealing with the issue of a permit to the new black-labour boat, the Gascoyne, and I cannot see any evidence of an inquiry being made by the Minister to ascertain whether whitemanned boats were available. In those circumstances the Government were remiss in their duty. The White Australia policy must be upheld, and that should be the first sentiment instilled into every the Comptroller-General here. Australian mind. To-day certain people in Australia believe that black labour should be introduced for menial work. many of them. from ordinary conversation that the opinion is freely expressed that we should allow Chinese or Hindoos to do the menial work. Broome is the most important town in Western Australia north of the tropic of Capricorn, and although under the Act every lugger has to be registered by a white man, in a large number of cases the Japanese own them. That is one town in Australia where the black men have been given a free hand, and, in conthree vessels that had already been offered sequence, the pearling industry is largely in their clutches. I have a great deal of sympathy for the master-pearlers in this difficulty, and I believe the Minter has correspondence in his possession giving their point of view of the problem. accident that black-labour boats are allowed to compete with the State steamships that ply on the Western Australian coast. It is an attempt to drive the Sfc,ate-pwned vessels off the coast. These are some of the statistics concernboat to carry cargo. It is far more proing the boats to which this Government has given permits to trade. The Charon employs eighty-eight coloured men, their pay averaging £2 l is . per month., not quite 2s. per day. The Bambra, a State owned steamer, employs sixty-three white men, who are paid £15 12s. .per month each, or over 10s. per day. The Gorgon employs eighty-five coloured men and the Minderoo eighty-seven. These coloured men are working in the Australian trade between Australian ports, competing with State boats employing white labour under Australian conditions. The Premier of Western Australia, who is hostile to State-owned ships,, tried to displace the Bambra by another coloured boat, and this Government was a party to it. It will be within the memory of the Minister( Mr Austin Chapman) that Dalgety and Company wished to place the Gascoyne on the Western Australian coast as a cargo vessel. At that time she was the Quilque. They communicated with the navigation authorities in Western Australia, and their letter was forwarded to The Minister considered the matter and said that if the Western Australian Government were prepared to allow another coloured boat to trade on the Western Australian coast, this Government would not object. The Western Australian Government, although hostile to State owned ships, would not agree to the boat being run purely for cargo carrying. The Federal Government then consulted the Australian Steamship .Owners' Federation, which would not agree to a cargo boat manned by black labour trading on the Western Australian coast when there were plenty of Australian boats manned by white crews available. They named for the Western Australian trade, the shipping company being prepared to carry cargo at a very small profit. Dalgety and Company, who are the agents for the black-manned boats, then took up a new stand, and said that if the GoI t seems more than an vernment would grant a permit for a black-labour boat to be used on the Western Australian trade, they would be prepared to carry passengers as well. The ship-owners sent out a ©able to say that they were only prepared to send a fitable for a boat not to carry passengers, because they take up space which otherwise could be used for cargo. They did eventually agree to provide passenger space as well as cargo space. It was put to the Western Australian Government, and I say that it is to the eternal shame of the Acting Premier at the time, Mr Colebatch, that a black-labour boat was put on in competition with the whitemanned Government boats the Government were supposed to run at a profit. Without further inquiry, the Federal Government took the say-so of the Western Australian Government, and",49,Improvement Of Stock Assisting Primary Producers Nationalist Government S Offer
205,Mr Austin Chapman,There are not,50,Improvement Of Stock Assisting Primary Producers Nationalist Government S Offer
206,Mr A. Green,"The Minister knowspermitted another black-labour boat to go into this trade. I enter my protest against that. which have been hung up in eastern ports for months that could be put into the trade. There are scores of white Australian seamen now out of work prepared to man them. It is an Australian coast, and we have the trade, the ships, and Australians to man them, and yet the Federal Government, acting in conspiracy tralian Government, haye established another black-labour boat on the coast of Western Australia. Now, what does the employment of these boats mean? The cost of living on the black-labour boats is Is. 3d. per man per day. Jimmy Wun Lung can live remarkably well on Is. 3d. per day. On the Australian-manned boats, the cost is 3s. 8d. per day; and it will be agreed that that is a moderate tariff for a white man. The bill for victualling the Minderoo, one of the black-labour boats, amounts to £247 10s. per month; whilst the bill for the Bambra, the white-labour boat, for the same period, is £460. The Government are responsible for this unfair competition of blacklabour boats with boats manned by white Australians. This policy means a great deal to Western Australia. Let me inform honourable members how Western Australia benefits, because the Bambra is manned with a white crew-and this will indicate the money that is being lost to Western Australia, because, by the gracious consent of the Minister for Trade and .Customs, trade on the coast of that State is being carried on by niggers. The Bambra purchases coal to the extent of 1,400 tons per month. This coal is mined in Western Australia by Western Australian miners. Western Australian lumpers. On the other hand, the black-labour boats take in coal at Singapore, which is mined by black labour in the Dutch Islands, and is loaded by black labour. The black-labour boats, and the niggers employed upon them, get all their stores, and everything else they require, at Singapore, and do not spend £1 in Fremantle. In the case of the Bambra and Kangaroo, £18,000 a year is spent in Fremantle by her white Australian seamen, because they have their homes in that town. The niggers' homes, if they have any, are in Singapore. Repairs of There are at least three boats the State boats are effected in Fremantle, and that means an expenditure of about £8,000 per annum. All the coal and Stores for the white boats are purchased in Fremantle. The Bambra spends £100,000 per annum in Australia for coal and stores whilst the black-labour boats spend practically nothing. From the figures of expenditure in Weswith the Western Austern Australia for the Bambra, honourable members can imagine that, if the other four boats in the trade were worked under similar conditions, an additional £400,000 per annum or more would be spent in Fremantle. We were told that the black-labour boats would be prepared to give the Western Australian people in the' north-western ports a fair deal in the carriage of cargo; but I will show that they were prepared to do nothing of the kind. A Labour Government was in power in Western Australia in 1911. Previous to that time the ports of Wyndham and Derby used to ship cattle to Fremantle. Those ports were served by two boats that were controlled by two big pastoralists who purchased their space over a long period. Small pastoralists were unable to ship cattle on those boats unless they went to the big men who held the shipping space. Honourable members will find it difficult to believe me when I say that some of the .small pastoralists did not sell a hoof for six years, because they were not prepared to sell their cattle to the big pastoralists for £2 per head. Those who were prepared to sell to the pastoralists who had secured the shipping space had to drive their cattle in a favorable season 400 or 500 miles, in some cases, to It is loaded by either Wyndham or Derby, and when they got them there the big pastoralists would say, "" How many cattle have you ? "" The reply might be, ""Four hundred fats."" The big pastoralist would say, ""We have 400 fats of our own, and they are on the boat. We want only another 100, and will take them from you at a certain price."" The small men then had to sell 100 fats out of 400, at a low price, and take the rest back, and when they landed at the home station they were aa poor as wood, and did not become fat again until the next season. That is the position which small men the big squatters at Wyndham sent a circular to the small squatters to this effect: "" We want you to pledge yourselves to sell all your store cattle to us at £1 per head delivered at Wyndham."" the small squatters, who in many cases were mortgaged to them. Manila men there to purchase the cattle, and as they bought the stores from the small squatter they gave them £ 1 per head, and took £2 per head from the Manila men, and put it into their pockets saying, ""There are your cattle, take them on board."" Labour Government is the personification of everything that'is good. the Labour party are like other men, but their policy is different, and the Labour Government of Western Australia said, "" This must cease. State steam-ships,"" and they did so. The West Australian and the Kwinana were purchased and put into the trade, and the Government announced its policy. said, "" In future whatever space ia available is for the small men, and if there is any above what they require the big men can have their ' cut.' "" . That was just the reverse of the policy previously adopted. The consequence was that the price of cattle in the Perth market went down considerably. effort, State steam-ships were established in the Western Australian trade. are on the coast the them from charging the too much. This is in spite of the fact that they are in competition with black-labour boats r u n under the special conditions granted to them through the action of the Federal Government. able member must not blame the Pederal white Australian conditions.

Sitting suspended from 6.15 to 9.15 p.m. surer) [9.17] I move That tlie' Bill be now read a second time. The Bill provides for interest on all governmental loans raised in Australia, being made subject to Commonwealth tax, and interest on Commonwealth loans raised in Australia being made subject to State taxes, under certain conditions. Throughout a very long period the loans issued by the States have been free of income tax, and practically all the loans now being issued by the States are free of tax. The total amount of tax-exempt State loans outstanding in Australia is now about £230,000,000. When the first war loans were raised it was thought necessary to make the interest free of both Federal and State income taxes. Altogether six tax-free war loans were issued, aggregating £138,000,000 and bearing interest at 4^ per cent. A certain proportion ol these has been redeemed and converted, and the amount of Commonwealth tax-free loans outstanding at the. present time is £122,000,000. The last Federal tax-free loan was floated in April, 1918. All Commonwealth loans issued after that date in Australia are subject to Federal income tax, but are free from State income taxes. debts of the Commonwealth and the States amount to about £350,000,000, and the annual interest on these debts is approximately £16,000,000. The income tax which would be paid on the £16,000,000 of interest, if it were not exempt, cannot be accurately stated, but may be estimated at about £2,000,000 per annum. There is a set-off to this loss of revenue, because the Commonwealth and the States are paying less interest than they would have had to pay if all the loans had been made taxable. Possibly this saving in interest amounts to £700,000' per annum. It is clear, therefore, that the loss of revenue must be greater than the amount of interest paid. If that were not so, investors would not have shown such a preference for tax-free loans. Freedom from income vestor, but confers a great boon on the individual with a large income. The amount of benefit to be derived is dependent entirely on the rate of income tax paid by each bondholder, and in my Budget speech, and on other occasions, I have stated the effect that these tax-free loans have because of the system of graduated taxation. In the opinion of the Government there is no justification for a system which gives to one lender benefits greater than those received by other lenders. The advantages of tax freedom are so great that many investors whose funds, in other circumstances, would flow into productive enterprises are impelled by the pressure of income tax to purchase tax-exempt securities. The result is that the Commonwealth and the States lose revenue, industry loses capital, and undue advantages are obtained by some investors. The disadvantage to the Commonwealth caused by the present system is very great because, although all loans issued by the Commonwealth since 1918 are subject to Federal income tax, the States are still issuing tax-free loans. As a result the States are securing a monopoly of the money available for investment by persons who have large incomes. Thus the flotation of Commonwealth loans is undertaken at a disadvantage. The Commonwealth tax-free loans mature in 1925, when £72,000,000 will fall due, and in 1927, and it was felt that the difficulties in regard to tax freedom might then become acute. Indeed we have experienced that to some extent in connection with the conversion operations this year, because while the ComAltogether the tax-free monwealth conversion loan which was subject to Commonwealth taxation was",54,Honourable Members Hear Hear

221,Dr. Earle Page (Cowper,"Treaon the market, it was impossible to keep it clear of State flotations, which were free of both Commonwealth and State income taxation. On the maturity of these huge loans in 1925 and 1927 the Commonwealth must pay large sums in cash to persons who will be desirous of continuing tax-free investments. If the States were to continue issuing tax-free loans they would, on the maturity of the Commonwealth loans, be able to borrow great sums at moderate rates of interest while the Commonwealth would have difficulty, even if it offered high rates of interest, in securth< Conference the States expressed their ing money for paying off its loans. The anomalies of the present position led the Commonwealth Government to bring the question of tax-free loans before the State Ministers at the recent Conference. It has become the custom to say that that Conference was barren of results, but I predict that in years to come the Conference of 1923 will be accepted as having been the most fruitful that has been held. One of the fruits was the Income Tax Assessment Bill, which will render 98 per cent, of the taxpayers liable for only one return, whereas previously they had to prepare two. The only way in which taxation can be reduced is by a reduction of governmental expenditure, and the way to reduce that expenditure is to prevent for any length of time two men doing work which one could easily do. At the Conference each State Government agreed to discontinue the issue of tax-free loans as from the 1st January, 1924. Legislation is necessary by each Parliament, and it is for that reason that we have introduced this Bill in the present session. The loans issued by the Commonwealth and the States in the past, and those to be issued UD to 31st December next, will not be affected by this Bill. Those loans will, of course, remain subject to the conditions under which they were issued. In cases where the loans were issued free of tax, they will remain so until the dates of maturity. The proposed alterations will apply to all loans issued after the 31st December next, including conversion loans and those raised for the redemption or repayment of existing loans. The provisions of the Bill are to apply to all governmental loans raised in Australia aftei 31st December next. These loans include the issues of the Commonwealth and State Governments and of all authorities constituted by the Commonwealth or State Dr. Earle Farje. Governments. Loans raised in Australia by other countries or Dominions, or by authorities constituted by other countries or Dominions, will also become subject to taxation. The Bill gives the States the right to tax interest on Commonwealth loans after a date to be fixed by proclamation. No specific date is mentioned, because it is necessary for the States to pass legislation before the interest on new Commonwealth and State loans becomes taxable. The intention is that State income taxes should be levied on all loans issued after 31st December next, and at intention to pass the necessary legislation in the interval. Until the States pass laws taxing the interest on their own as well as on Commonwealth loans, the Commonwealth Government intends to withhold the proclamation of the portion of this Bill which makes Commonwealth loans subject to State taxation. The Commonwealth Government feels that other Dominions and countries borrowing money on the Australian market should not be in a position to borrow on more advantageous terms than are available to the Commonwealth and the States. Therefore, if other Governments' come on the Australian market, the interest on their loans will be subject to Commonwealth and State taxes. These loans of other Dominions and countries will, however, be subject to tax only when the interest is received by a person resident in Australia or by a person who is an absentee taxpayer under the Commonwealth laws. Nearly all the interest payable by Great Britain on its loans is subject to income tax, the only exception being in respect of a comparatively small amount of securities issued during the course of the war. In the United States, the first war loan was exempt from both Federal and State taxes. When the succeeding issues were made the taxation exemption was restricted both in amount and in duration The Government of the United States has now found that freedom from tax embarrassing, and efforts are being made to stop the issue in that country of taxexempt bonds. The practice in connection with Canadian war loans was to grant freedom from income tax, but in November, 1919, that principle was abandoned and the interest on the loan then issued was made taxable. The Bill does not apply to loans raised by the Commonwealth or the States in London, or in any other places outside fche Commonwealth. State loans raised in London are subject to British income tax, but neither Commonwealth nor State income tax is levied upon interest payable in London. TheB ill is one for the Committee. It provides for the taxation of loans, which has become pretty universally held to be necessary in Australia. I trust that honourable members will give the measure a speedy passage, and discuss the details of the B ill in Committee. Honourable members on this side of the House are in accord wifch fche principle of the B ill . when reasonable legislation is placed before the House there is no obstruction on the part of honourable members on this side. principle which we have advocated for a long time. favour of the flotation of loans free of in well have been settled at the Conference come tax, it is apparent now that perhaps it would have been wiser if the money raised in the past had been secured on other terms This exemption from taxation has involved the State and Federal Governments in an annual loss of taxation on £2,000,000 paid in interest. Apart from that, as the Treasurer has admitted, it is the wealthy people who have benefited chiefly from these tax-free loans. munity, generally speaking, are not taxpayers. Their investments in these loans are comparatively wealthier investors have benefited to a considerable extent by their exemption from taxation. I am not so easy in mind as apparently the Treasurer is, as to the future. to discuss the results of the Conference with the State Premiers, because that might lead to protracted debate. It was unfortunate that the Treasurer made reference to the other taxation measure, which emanated from fche Conference, with which we shall deal to-morrow. quite easy in my mind about conversions of loans falling due. read fche B ill , I am afraid that some difficulty will be experienced in giving effect to its provisions, bufc it is quite right that trie Commonwealth should set an example to the States, and pass this legislation as a guarantee of good f a it h in the matter of abolishing tax-free loans. Whether the States will respond and do The Federal and likewise remains to be seen. If they f a i l fco do so, I am afraid that, with so much loan money falling due in the near future, the Commonwealth position will become very difficult: If two or three of t h t States, to meet their own financial needs, continue to issue loans free of Statei n come taxation, serious difiiculties may be created for us. I believe that there should be only one borrower, and that that borrower should be the Commonwealth Government. All loan transactions could be carried out by the Commonwealth Government on. behalf of the States; and with only one I have always contended that borrower on the market there would not be so much competition as there is to-day. As a result, money should be obtainable more cheaply. If it is posThis measure contains a sible to make a saving in fchis way, I submit that it should be done.

If we are experiencing difficulty at the present time, what is likely to happen in connection with the conversion of the £72,000,000 maturing in 1925. me a good deal. ing me, and I am not the Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I am wondering how the Treasurer is going to get the money. If he is not successful, we shall be in a very awkward situation. If we may take the negotiations in regard to the loan that is just maturing as a guide, it is fair fo assume that there will Be difficulty in securing applications in connection with the £72,000,000 maturing two or three years hence. If only about £25,000,000 of that amount is obtained, we shall have to approach the outside money market for the balance. surer's statement at the Conference with State Ministers, the amount of tax-free loans raised by the Pederal and State Governments was £345,000,000, but the Treasurer stated to-night that it was £352,000,000. It would appear, therefore, that since the Conference referred to, an additional £7,000,000 of tax-free loans had been raised. borrowing. continue borrowing at that rate, what hope will there be of securing an adequate amount in conversions for loans maturing in 1925 ? The position is a very serious one, and deserves the earnest consideration of this Government. We shall have to find the money somewhere, and as the world is in a very disturbed condition, we must expect thab that will react on our position. If the Commonwealth and the State Governments agree to make all future loans taxable, what will be the effect upon the conversions? It is obvious that in order to induce investors to convert, the Government will have to offer a higher rate of interest. trouble ? pating trouble at all. It is here. ber is only making it worse these problems in an endeavour to solve them, so that the difficulties confronting us may be met. Evidently the honourable member does not want to hear anything about these difficulties. them. the future. My point is that if the Government have to pay a higher rate of interest than at present for all conversions, because the loans will be subject to taxation, it is possible that, while the Treasurer may receive increased revenue from income taxation upon loan investments, the increased rate of interest may represent a heavier burden upon the community. Up to the present we have not heard one word upon this aspect of the subject. This is not so much a party matter as it is a national matter. We want to prevent the people from having to pay an exorbitant rate of interest on these loans. We have a £9,000,000 or According to the Trea£10,000,000 surplus, and instead of throwing it away, as the Government are doing, to a large extent they should utilize it to reduce the national debt. It is all very well to provide a sinking fund but, at the same time, State and Pederal Governments are borrowing more money, and are fast approaching the breaking point. The responsibility for this is upon the Government, and not upon the Labour party. We on this side have, for many years past, advocated the principle of taxing loans. We are glad, indeed, it is now to be put into effect. Whether it will succeed or not depends largely upon the States. Commonwealth Ministers are to be commended for keeping their part of the compact by endeavouring to pass the necessary legislation. If the States do not follow their example, trouble is ahead. The question of having only one borrower should be considered at the next Premiers' Conference, and if agreed upon, future loans would be cheaper although subject to income taxation. One method of testing the efficacy of the Bill is to consider the possibility of sucWhy anticipate cessful evasion of it , and I suggest that in < approaching this Bill we should consider that possibility.

235,Mr Latham (Kooyong) [9.47],"legislation requiring that interest from Commonwealth loans should be included in income returns for the purpose of determining the rate of graduated income tax, although interest from those loans was not to be included in the taxable income. That attempt became a failure because of a decision of the High Court. State might adopt differential rates of income tax in relation to its own loans, and, to evade the application of this Bill, might enact that the rate of State income tax on loan A should be so much, on loan B so much, and on loan C so much. In such a case, what would be the effect of the provision that the taxation proposed by a State on a Commonwealth loan shall be at a rate not exceeding that applicable, under the law of that State, to the interest on loans raised by it? there would be in that case, of income tax upon State loans, a question might arise as to the maximum rate at which interest on a Commonwealth loan could be taxed by a State under this Bill.

248,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [10.5],"parries who made agreements are following in the footsteps of the company which has taken the matter to the Courts. Itappears from the statement of the Attorney-General( Mr Groom), in moving the second reading of the B ill , that they have threatened to take further action to deny to the Commonwealth Government its share of the profits made under the agreements to which they were parties It is astonishing that men high up in the commercial and business world should set an example of this kind. I venture to say that if a number of working men attached their signatures to an agreement, they would honour it . It has become necessary to ask this Parliament to pass legislation to protect the people of Australia-wh o are carrying the cost of the war, in the heavy taxation they are called upon to bear to meet our national debt-agains t these persons who should have contributed large sums to assist the Commonwealth Government in meeting the expenditure caused by the war. They are endeavouring now to put all the profits gained from their operations into their own pockets, and are ignoring the claims of the Commonwealth Government under the agreements which bear their signatures. We have been legislating recently to give concessions to some of these people. Many of the persons interested in pastoral leases, to whom the Government proposed to make a present of £1,300,000 taxation for which they had become liable, are interested in some of these companies. It is a question of wool right through. Yet, at a time when it is desired to close Parliament to enable the Prime Minister to attend the Imperial Conference, the limited time at the disposal of the House is taken up in passing legislation to prevent a. number of these people robbing the Commonwealth. I 'use that expression advisedly, because I say that it is downright robbery when men who have entered into these agreements t r y to repudiate them. The preamble of the B ill makes quite clear what is intended. It readsWhereas certain agreements in writing, or documents purporting to be agreements, relating to tbe manufacture of wool-tops or the purchase or sale of wool for the manufacture of wool-tops, were made or executed by or on behalf of the Commonwealth during the late war : And whereas such agreements or documents were acted upon by the parties thereto as being valid and binding agreements : And whereas doubts have arisen as to the validity of such agreements or documents iu the absence of express legislative authority : We have reached a fine state of affairs when men, whose word might have been expected to be their bond, rely upon a technical objection that the agreements to which they were parties were made without legislative authority to prevent the Commonwealth Government receiving the share of the profits from their operations which they agreed that it should receive. We have binding agreements with these wealthy persons, who now refuse to honour the agreements to which they have attached their signatures. wings. and I am supporting it for that purpose, but I say that I am justified in exposing these people to the miblic. It is about time that the people of Australia knew -the sort of men who were playing a leading part in this country . during the war. It is time that the search-light of publio opinion was directed upon them. They were always demanding that the war should be carried to a conclusion in order that the lives, property, and interests of the people of Australia should be protected. A t the same time they were trying to fleece the people who have to bear the burden of our war loans. to do that kind of thing under the present Government. in reply to the honourable member's interjection is that the present Government has, during the last two or three weeks, been legislating for these people and for no one else. We have been sitting here from early morning u n t i l late, at night for the purpose of passing legislation to benefit one class only, and many of the members of that class are interested in wool. When this business is boiled down there is nothing but wool in it . that the, honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell) will agree with me that men who draw up and attach their signatures to an agreement should carry it out. have not done it .",60,Second Reading

It may be millions of pounds. The agreements provided that we should get two-thirds of the money earned by these companies during the war period, when they obtained very high prices for their products. ""We passed the War Profits Act in the hope that the Commonwealth Government might derive some benefit from tbe high prices. that the money so derived would assist Australia to pay for her share of the war expenditure. We have increased our national debt to £400,000,000, and these people who have got the "" loot"" that we have heard so much about, are not prepared to pay the Commonwealth Government the two-thirds to which it is entitled. I think I shall have to rule the word "" loot "" out of order, as tedious repetition. say, Mr Speaker, that this is the first time. I have used the word, so that, at least, I cannot be charged with tediously repeating it . In any case, I think its use is justifiable in this instance. There can be no question that these men have made large sums of money. The public should know how much it is entitled to. These companies are endeavouring to take advantage of the law to retain that money. 7£ this Bill will prevent them from doing that, I say, ""Good luck to the Minister for bringing it in .

This, and the Bill which immediately preceded it, are the only two measures that we have had before us in the last ten or eleven weeks which have been for the benefit of the public.

This side of the House welcomes this measure. honourable member is not carrying out the functions of the Opposition! always willing to assist the Government We really when it has a good case.

It is very hard, sir, that we of the Opposition should be called upon to discuss this intricate Bil l in the painful circumstances in which we speak this evening as compared with honourable members opposite. I should like to hear a few wellchosen remarks on this measure from the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Gardner).

I venture to suggest that it would not be improper to have a search made in the Queen's Hall to see if the honourable member is still there. I am very pleased, however, that the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse) has, at length, been able to come into the chamber. This is a very important Bill. It expresses a pious indignation on the part domain of spoliation in which it has been enjoying itself for so long. The Bill is designed to ratify certain agreements entered into by the Commonwealth.

281,But As Soon Mr Brennan,"As fche honorableable member to read the B ill . He will find fchat doubts have arisen in regard fco the meaning of these agreements, and in consequence of those doubts actual claims are being made with the direct object of defeating them. strengthening the position of the Commonwealth by means of legislation. Two points are clear: (1) That ifc is a reflection upon the draftsmanship of the Commonwealth did nofc draw up agreements upon which ifc is prepared to stand without further ratification by this Parliament; and (2) that it is grossly unfair to the Opposition and the Parliament that we should be called upou to pass a law in respect of long, detailed agreements, the terms of which we have not. had the opportunity of perusing. -We all join wifch fche Leader of the Opposition in the scathing condemnation which he has passed upon the signatories to these contracts, who now wish to upset them. The Leader of the Opposition was wrong in saying that fche parties claimed that fchey entered into these contracts upon patriotic grounds. So far as I know, fcbere was no patriotism in the transactions; they were business agreements, and their intention was made perfectly plain, as was explained last night by the Attorney-General. This Bill does nothing to interfere with the interpretation of the agreements. It simply endeavours to make clear that the agreements as drawn up are valid, and should be carried out. Ifc is not intended thafc the Commonwealth shall evade any of its responsibilities, bufc we do desire that the other side shall get uo unfair advantage. If the Attorney-General had asked us fco alter fche agreements, be would have had to explain them, but ho could not ask us to vary contracts, and, if he did, the House would nofc agree to do so. These agreements were drawn up in good faith . A contract was made for the sale of a commodity from the Wool Pool to the manufacturers at the then market value, which was almost 20 per cent, above the appraised price. There is not fche slightest doubt fchat the people who put wool into the Pool would say that if it had not been sold at fchafc fcime ifc would have been worth more later, but that argument should not enter into consideration. The fact is that when these contracts were enI invite the honortered into the wool was taken oufc of the Pool at a fair market price. The Attorney-General last night explained fche contracts f u l l y. It has been said that the amount involved has been kept secret, but the Attorney-General last night read We are the letter of demand for £324,000 in connection with the Whiddon contract. other companies 'claimed, the amount would be £600,000. is fchat, owing fco a decision of the High Courti n a somewhat similar case, there appears to be a possibility that that t r i bunal, if asked to consider these contracts, would rule that they are invalid-no t because of anything contained in them, but because, in the opinion of the High Court, the Commonwealth representatives had not power to sign them. These firms are deliberately trying to escape the consequences of an agreement they signed, and fchey cannofc be condemned too strongly. I regret thafc the Leader of the Opposition cannofc nail these men .down for their offence without trying to make political capital out of the matter. I do nofc exonerate them in any way. The Government is passing the strongest condemnation upon their actions by bringing this B ill before the House, land I support the measure. The Leader of .the Oppositionconcluded that the men concerned are supporters of the Government. Even he may have supporters of whom he does not approve, and I think it is a pit y that fchis House could not have risen above party polities and placed on record i ts condemnation of actions such as are proposed to be taken by these companies. I am glad that this legislation is being introduced in time to nip the contemplated action in the bud. They signed an agreement, and there has been no attempt on the part of the Government to evade its responsibility. The other signatories see that there is a chance of recovering £600,000 to which they have no moral claim, and if they have any legal right, it is merely because of a technical blunder on the part of the Commonwealth advisers.

Honourable members are entitled to know more about this matter.

I am satisfied that we shall have to stand by the agreements; but Parliament should have more information upon these matters. to any one, but it would be interesting to know if any honourable members know more about these agreements than the majority of members know. should not have risen to speak upon this B ill but for the irritation that appeared to be exhibited by certain honourable members when the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr West) rose to express his opinion upon the Bill. The Attorney General( Mr Groom) has asked us to r a t i fy certain agreements. In his speech last night he explained what they were, and how certain people were endeavouring to dodge their obligations. I understand that because of a certain decision in the H i gh CourtI speak subject to correction it is now considered advisable to validate agreements six years after they were drawn up. the honourable member for East Sydney remarked, were. entered in to during the stress of the Great War by certain people who pretended they were doing something for the Empire. No one will deny that. While I have a chance of voicing my protest against the way in which the big interests of Australia sold Australia. I shall do so. They sold our soldiers, and if they can evade their obligations under these agreements, we may be sure that they will do so. When honourable members on this side took up a certain attitude in regard to the war, they would have been deported if the Government I had dared to take that course. Now, when the chickens have come home to If any one is roost, and we are pointing to their colour, some honourable members have the audaThe Government should city to sneer because another honourable member gets up to make, his position As my clear. The blood money of the war cannot be touched even now. The 4£ and 5 per cent, loans floated for the defence of this country are still tax-free. We have been told that we are getting back to I presume that sanity and back to pre-war times. What is this B ill but an attempt to make certain people observe their obligations. We were told during, the war that the sacrifices must be equal. What sacrifices have these people made? We are now rushing measures through at hurricane speed in order that the Prime Minister may leave Australia, and go to London and talk about Empire, Imperialism, and defence. Yet when an honourable member I do not want to attach suspicion gets up to speak he is met with protests, because honourable members may be kept sitting here five or ten minutes longer. He has a right to get what information he wants from the Minister. I am satisfied that when the story is told with regard to this business, it w ill hot be to the credit of the Government. They tried to get away with £1,300,000 the other night. Now they are asking honourable members to r a t if y these agreements. No one has spoken a word about dummy bolts. It was lef t to the ex-Postmaster General to say, iu regard to one of these contracts, that some one ought to be gaoled. Tom Barker was deported. Other men on our side were put in gaol. Have Kidman and Mayoh yet paid what they owe the Government?

I may point out that when amendment or debate. the contracts were entered into lawyers on both sidesbelieved that they were validly prepared and executed. was no question at that time of the necessity to come to Parliament for ratification. There was a dispute as regards several of them. The Commonwealth Government issued a writ, and sued upon one of the agreements.

These employees have the opportunity to approach the Arbitrator for . a revision of their sward. I have consulted the law author it y , and there does not appear to be any way to meet the case, although the position is not so serious as it appeared to be at first sight. I was under the impresrestricted to the Davies deal. sion that it an appeal were made to the Court, and a variation followed, tbe award gave the date and quantities of specific oould not be operative unti l laid on the transactions which took place through table for t h i r t y days.

That relieves the position to some extent, although I admit that difficulties still remain. power to make the award retrospective to the date of the award applying to others in the Department? and legal opinion, I understand that payments will date from the alteration of the award. This morning 1 was asked a question about the Royal Commission which had been appointed to inquire into certain sugar transactions, I then stated that during tbe course of the day 1 hoped to be able to ' give the House the actual terms of the commission. The Government very much regret the delay that has occurred, b u t honourable members know that the Government was unable to obtain tihe services of a H i g h Court Judge, and experienced difficulty in securing a suitable Commissioner. This gentleman appointed w ill probably commence his inquiry next week. Leaving out the formalities, thiB is the actual commission to be issued to b i m .
