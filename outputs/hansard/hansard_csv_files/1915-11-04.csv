The director I think the House can has done, and is doing, excellent work, and no reasons are apparent why his agreement of service should he terminated. asked the Minister for the Navy, upon notice1. In view of the statement of the Minister for Defence that "" It was estimated by the military medical authorities that in 20 per cent, of cases amongst soldiers there was no trace of contact; on the contrary, contacts who were isolated had rarely contracted the disease,"" will he inform the House who are the medical authorities, so that the public may know? 2. In view of the terrible, death-rate resulting from meningitis, can he give such reports or information to the House? honourable member's questions are as follow : 1. The question does not present the original statement in its proper light. The original statement of the Minister for Defence was to the effect that of the military cases, more than 20 per cent, have occurred amongst men, who, apparently, have not eome in contact with the disease at all, not "" there was no trace of contact."" l t is recognised that no case of cerebrospinal meningitis can occur without infection I am sorry to say by the germ, and this is almost invariably by contact either with an actual case of cerebrospinal meningitis or with a "" carrier."" In the latter case there is apparently no contact with the disease, for the "" carrier "" who conveys the infection is not suffering from the disease. "" Carriers"" are found to he not uncommon. It The is here that the difficulty of coping with the disease arises, and it is from this source of infection that the 20 per cent, quoted receive their infection. 2.

It appears to me a peculiar thing to ask others to do what If a i l to do myself. For your consideration I beg to state that for fourteen years I was in charge of one of the largest stores in Australia, that of the Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works at Werribee. Therein could be found a needle to an anchor. This sewerage farm also carried up to 75,000 sheep, 2,000 head of cattle, and several hundred horses. The accountancy and supervisory work fell to my lot. I also leased from the Board 32 acres of orchard, 44 acres lucerne and prairie grass, 80 acres of grass land, keeping 40 cows in f u l l milk. I simply quote this to show I have some experience of control, both public and private. In 1908 the Board's stocktaker specially complimented my Department on its excellent work. As you know, I gave up this position to enter Parliament. In 1895 I matriculated at the Melbourne University. I was a sergeant in the Harbor Trust Garrison Artillery, being complimented by Colonel Hanby, O.C, for high percentages won in battery examinations. [261] My health is improving, and I feel strong enough to assist where my services might be of value. Yours sincerely, A . T. OZANNE. "" 2.

Navigation Referendum War census .. .. 50,000 Public Works staff Railways working expenses (transcontinental railway, Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie) I may mention that the item of £500,000 given as the estimated cost of war pensions is very largely a guess, because of the impossibility of our being able to decide with any certainty what the"" war pensions are likely to amount to. It is believed, however, that they will not be far short of half-a-million. The estimated military expenditure in connection with the Expeditionary Forces for the year 1915-16 is £38,460,000. Of this sum, approximately £5,000,000 only has been expended during the period July to September, 1915. The principal reasons why the expenditure for the first quarter is not proportionate to the amount provided for the whole year are:1. The whole of the expenditure in connection with the troops at Alexandria, at Gallipoli, and at hospitals in the Mediterranean is at present being borne by the Imperial Government. The War Office intend to claim on the Commonwealth Government in connection with this expenditure on an estimated basis, but no such claim has yet been rendered. 2. In preparing the above Estimate, provision had to be made for the total pay of members of the Australian Imperial Force, in case it became necessary to pay -the men off before the close of this financial year. Up to date, however, practically no payments have been made on account of ""deferred"" pay, which aver.. . . 2,883,000 ages about one-sixth of the total pay, and .. . . 28,073,000 which has been accumulating since the departure of the 1st Australian Division.

Honourable members will notice a footnote in the statement which I have read that no provision is made for ordinary loan expenditure. The estimated loan expenditure for works during the twelve months ending 30th June, 1916, is: Redemption of Northern Territory loans ... £581,625 Redemption of . Port Augusta Railway loans... 12,915 Plant for Cockatoo Island 232,670 Post Office conduits ... 373,520 Land, Federal Territory ... 100,000 Railway-Pin e Creek to Katherine River ... 180,000 Land for Post Office purposes ... ... 50,000 Railway-Kalgoorli e to Port Augusta ... ... 1,500,000 Railway-Katherin e River to Bitter Springs ... 50,000 Railway-Kalgoorli e to Fremantle ... ... 100,000 London Offices ... ... 120,000 £3,300,730 With regard to some of the above items, ParUament has not yet been asked to appropriate loan moneys. No expenditure under such heads will be made until an .appropriation has been passed. In the case of other items there is a sufficient balance of appropriation to enable payments to be made until Parliament meets in tlie new year. Australian Note Fund. The total note circulation on the 25th October was £39,317,000, the amount of gold held being £14,071,000, or 35.79 per cent, of the circulation. The circulation will be increased in the present financial year by the balance yet to be paid to the various States on account of the loan of £18,000,000, by exchanging notes for gold with the banks in connection with the arrangement with the banks to take up £10,000,000 in Australian notes for gold, also by advances made in connection with various publio works financed by investing the Notes Account in loan funds, such as the Port Augusta-Kalgoorlie grounding telephone lines, &c. It is expected that the total circulation will find their way into the banks. This on the 30th June,. 1916, will be as folis shown in connection with our present lows:Circulation 25th October, 1915 Further payment to States (balance of £18,000,000) 1,400,000 £4,822,774 was held by the public, and Further payment to banka in exchange for gold (balance of £10,000,000) ... 2,766,000 circulation since, and the relative amounts Investment in Commonwealth Stock for loan purposes in connection with Kalgoorlie Railway, &o. 2,300,000 Estimated 30th June, 1916 £45,783,000 The gold reserve on 25th October, 1915, was ... £14,071,000 Add amounts to be lodged by the banks under agreement Estimated gold reserve on 30th June, 1916 £16,837,000 It is therefore probable that on the 30th June, 1916, the total note circulation will be £45,783,000, against which we Mr Higgs. shall hold gold amounting to £16,837,000, or 36.78 per cent. The legal minimum percentage of gold to notes is, as honourable members are aware, 25 per cent. In view of the fact that some prominence has been given to the idea of an inconvertible issue, it may be the public require from me a statement as to my views respecting the use of paper money. I desire to say that, as long a9 I hold the office of Treasurer, I will comply with the law by keeping the gold reserve at 25 per cent., and during the term of the war will endeavour to keep a working margin above that amount. I think the Commonwealth Note Issue has proved of the very greatest possible value to the community during this great crisis. It has freed Government and private finance from a great strain; but the experience of nations has shown that its sphere of usefulness is limited. I am not in favour of an unrestricted issue of paper money. The general public can railway, underonly absorb .a certain amount, and the notes the public do not require in the way of pocket money, till money, & c, note issue.

South Australia Western Australia Tasmania The total amount agreed to be loaned to the State Treasurers coincided with the amount bf the first loan made to the Commonwealth for war purposes by the Imperial Government, namely, £18,000,000.

The last instalment of £1,375,000 will be paid to the States on the 15th of the present month. Besides the loan of £18,000,000 made to the States in pursuance of the agreement with the Commonwealth Treasurer, dated 5th November, 1914, the following States received loans prior to that date, depositing one-fourth of a certain amount in gold and receiving notes for such amount. The loans were for twelve months, the rat© of interest being 4 per cent.' The actual loans made were: Victoria Western Australia The State of Victoria hat, repaid the amount of £243,000, with interest. The State of Western Australia has repaid £240,000, amount of loans due to date, with interest thereon, the odd amount of £3,750 not being due t ill 14th November. As I expect the public borrowings of the States of the Commonwealth will be discussed during the debate on this B ill , and as some anxiety has been expressed as to the ever-increasing public debt of the States, I wish to show the aggregate of State loan expenditure to the 30th June, 1914, and to ask honourable members what particular item of State loan expenditure they would have curtailed if they had had the power.

A sum of £13.299.339 has been expended on public buildings, and this item might suggest itself to some minds as a fine field for economv; but it is the duty of Governments to set in normal times a good example to private citizens. I do not, of course, speak of this crisis when economy is a primary duty in private as well as public spheres. If public buildings have no claims to architectural grandeur, private citizens cannot be expected to build beautiful homes, and the nation will be the loser by the erection of the unworthy and commonplace, however economical.

Honourable members will no doubt wonder how Australia is going to pay for the moneys she will undoubtedly have to borrow while the war lasts. Some light may be obtained from the history of the British National Debt. In the year 1816 the national debt of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was at its highest point prior to the present war, viz., £900,000,000, and the population numbered about 20,000,000. The £900,000,000 referred to was made up almost wholly of war loans, as follows :Wars of William and Anne £73,000,000 Conquest of Canada American War. . Campaigns against Napoleon 581,000,000 These loans cost a great deal more to float than loans of the present day. It is stated in Mulhall's Statistics that the war loans negotiated by George II . and George III . amounted to £794,000,000; but produced in reality only £585,000,000, or 73 per cent, of the written value. We in Australia are floating our loans at par. If 20,000,000 of a population could carry a national debt ^ f £900,000,000 in 1816, our Australian population of about 5,000,000 should be able to raise and carry a national war debt of a fourth of that amount. In saying this, I hope it will THE ESTIMATED VALUE OP AUSTRALIAN PRODUCTION IN INDUSTRIES EROM 1906 TO 1913 IS SHOWN IN T]IE FOLLOWING TABLE. Agricultural.

Mr Higgs. not be thought that I regard with unconcern the prospect of such a large war indebtedness in a. young country, or that I do not deplore the agonizing destruction of life and property now taking place in Europe. If the war lasts as long as Lord Kitchener is reported to have said, we must look forward to a huge war debt, and prepare to meet our obligations. By such preparation we shall avoid financial panic and its distressing consequences. Of Australia's ability to pay her way I have no doubt, for we have immense natural resources, and we are an industrious people. There is no large leisured class in Australia.

It would be impossible to maintain a navigable river all the year round unless there were locks and weirs, and places for storages, to enable water to be dammed back and used as required for navigation or irrigation. need of additional storages, with a view to regulating the flow of the river, was apparent from the commencement, such storages are possible only New South Wales and Victoria. Australia, as a State, is incapable of contributing river. tralia lies so low that if the waters were dammed back they would probably up more land than it would be advisable to use. There is to be a series of locks; and I think it would be very advisable to Mr Tudor. have a good map prepared showing what it is intended to do in this regard. I may say that the administration of this Victoria, measure will not come within my DeThat agreement, partment, and if it had been introduced two or three months ago it would, in all Inprobability, have been in charge of the made by ex-Prime Minister.

Further, tentative I think it would be very advisable if honwere made, but no final orable members could have a t r ip down the Murray, so as to obtain first-hand 1914, knowledge of the greatest river in AusI tralia.

In New South Wales, in 1914, there were 50,000 acres under irrigation, 315,000 the acres under irrigation in Victoria, and 25,000 acres in South Australia.

There are, at present, about 300,000 acres of land for which irrigation facilities are provided in Victoria, and slightly more than that area in New South ""Wales. The position of the Commonwealth is defined in the Constitution Act . Section 98 providesThe power of the Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways the property of any State. Section 100 providesThe Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the right of a State, or of the residents therein, to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation. Very many years of discussion led the interested States to the conclusion that the only proper solution of their difficulty was to be found in an agreement embodied in Acts of Parliament, to which the Commonwealth should be a party. That is the stage at which we have arrived to-day. The interest of the Commonwealth in navigation, and also in such control as would be likely to prevent any questions arising of the abridgement of the right of a State to the reasonable use of the waters of the rivers, combined with the immense importance to Australia of having this question determined upon an. equitable basis, seems to amply justify the expenditure of £1,000,000 to which the Commonwealth is committing itself. The difference between the B ill before us and the B ill that was prepared by the ex-Prime Minister is that in the present measure clause 5 limits the liability of the Commonwealth to £1,000,000. I take it that it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to be called upon to pay more unless a fresh B ill was introduced to extend the liability. clause at all,* and I think it would be better left out. opinion, not only of the present Prime Minister, but of his predecessor, is that it would be better to have this clause in serted in order to distinctly l i m it our liability. The present agreement between the Commonwealth and the States of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia has already been ratified by Acts of the Parliament of the States named, and the passage of this B ill through the Commonwealth Parliament will represent the final step in the settlement of this great and complicated question. step. but it renders it , comparatively speaking, easy to build up the rest. The States have already agreed upon this matter, and if the Commonwealth become a party to the agreement, it will be the most i m portant step ever taken in the history of Australia so far as irrigation and the navigation of our rivers are concerned. there has been a practicable agreement among all the parties. ticable agreement among the States has been very difficult to arrive at. TheB ill provides for a Commission of four members. One is to be nominated by the Governor General, and is t b act as President; the other three are to be appointed by the contracting Governments. The members of the Commission are to hold office for five years, and are to be remunerated as the respective Parliaments determine. I .do not know whether it would be proper for us to discuss the wisdom of this arrangement, because difficulty would arise in working the Commission if one Parliament paid its Commissioner more than was paid to the others. such a state of things should occur. President of the Commission representing the Commonwealth will receive a higher salary than the other Commissioners, but I do not think that it is conceivable that there will be any variation in the salaries paid to the others.

I really, Howshould not call them termini, because at present there is a joint Commission concerned sitting for the purpose of considering the extension of these railway lines beyond the State borders into VicThe toria and New South Wales respectively, and the prospect is that the lines will not stop at the river. In that Clause 20 of the case the river craft will bring goods to the nearest railway crossing. Clause 24 of the agreement provides that construction is to be commenced as soon as practicable Murafter the agreement comes into'effect and continued, subject only to unavoidable delay, until the whole of the storage Murrumbidworks, weirs, and locks are completed. The intention is that the Lake Victoria at the discretion of works shall be completed within four years, the Upper Murray storage works within seven years, and all other works equivalent expenditure. within twelve years after the agreement comes into effect.

The flow of the Murray at Albury is to be shared equally by New South Wales and Victoria, subject to deductions from each State's share in proportion to its diversions above Albury.

We have played "" pull baker, pull devil "" between the States and the Commonwealth for so long; we have differed so frequently on points as to whether this power or that The States of New power was our function or the function of the States, that we seem to have missed entirely the real Federal principle of harmonious co-operation, supplementing the various powers of the States andaggregating the totality of that power for all beneficial purposes. Here is the most complete manifestation we have had in Provision is made in clause our Federal history of that principle. As honourable members know, this is a very old project.

And I should not be doing my duty if I failed to make mention of the Herculean labours in connection with this subject of the honourable member for Angas, who devoted many long and wearying months to the perfection of this scheme, whilst the debate would be lacking in completeness if the honourable member for Wimmera did not contribute a speech. During the whole of his time in this Parliament he has r>ersistently pegged away at this great territorial question. And here it is, tlie greatest proposal for Australian development that has ever yet come to light in Australia. Our part in it is a very modest one-so modest that I marvel that the Government preceding my own did not get hold of the proposition and cut the Gordian knot long ago. We are nroposing to pay £1,000,000 to a scheme that, when f u l l y developed, is estimated to support at least 700,000 people. Honourable members may consider just one aspect of this proposal. I know that the Treasurer -particularl y so conservative a Treasurer as the honourable member has already proved himself to be-wil l be interested. A population of 700,000 people, whose expenditure may be estimated at £ 3 per head, will give an annual income of over £2.000,000 sterling from Customs alone.

If thriving upon the primary industries that ever it was desirable to devote the mind are the source of all the country's wonof the nation to proposals of this kind, it derful prosperity, a happy and contented is desirable in days like these, because, population, influencing all our secondary after a l l. the Bill deals with the staying industries, and making Australia what we power of the nation-the people settled all hope to see it , a great, happy, and comfortably upon the soil. That staying prosperous nation. power is the basis of all the other industria l enterprises that must be reared upon it. It is the basis of the whole national pyramid. It is appropriate, then, in these dark days of war, when finance presses so heavily upon the clouded brow of the Treasurer, that we should look upon a scheme like this with a kindly attitude, as I have no doubt the honourable gentleman does. A wonderful story might be told of Mildura. D i d I know the facts aright I should repeat it , but I leave the history of what has happened at that settlement to those who may follow me. Applying the Mildura figures to this proposition, just one other aspect is disclosed that perhaps I may stress before I sit down. A population of 700,000 at Mildura would represent an agricultural production of the value of £50,000,000 sterling per annum; that is to say, the development of this scheme as Mildura has been developed will result in a larger total return to the State annually than the value of all the present day agricultural products of Australia. ber think that it is possible to have irrigated 700,000 acres of land like that at Mildurai n Australia? dairying district. as Mildura produce pays. both. events, and the triumphs of science that are yet to be, w ill all tend to further increase the production of Australia, reI congratulate ject.

107,Mr Joseph Cook,"The march of the House might congratulate itself upon being in a position to r a t if y an agreement of this sort, and to reconcile, as we can, some of the diverging points of view of the States, owing to the broader outlook which honourable members closely in touch with all parts of Australia possess. We all recognise that the Federal Parliament was established to deal, from the broader and more general aspect, with some of the contentious Inter-State or continental questions during the establishment of parliamentary Governments. It was possible that this proposal might have been put through without discussion. weeks ago the then Prime Minister was almost in the mood to have the B ill submitted to the House, and'to ask leave of the Opposition for its passage without debate, subject to whatever explanations the House might desire to have. I do not in tend, in my observations upon the B ill now before us, to go into all the details that are perhaps necessary for a f u l l understanding of the adjustment come to, but honourable members will perhaps excuse me if I refer to one or two notes that I made in 1914 on matters that I think really influenced the States and the Commonwealth in coming to the agreement we are now asked to r a t if y. For some years past there has been an attempt made in America to settle by agreements similar to this many points of Inter-State and International policy arising out of the Inter-State and International rivers. The United States of America and Canada, for instance, went into this question very elaborately ten years ago. Canada International Waterways Commission was appointed on the 10th May, 1905. and held its first meeting at Washington. I may, perhaps, be excused for giving a quotation from the report of that Commission, which was subsequently ratified by the Governments concerned, inasmuch as it lays down the principles that ought to actuate States or nations in dealing with these river questions. The report of the Canadian section of the Commission says thatThere were three prominent features which constituted the underlying principles upon which thc jurisdiction of'Federal authority was based. First -Tlie Niagara is a navigable river for the greater part of its length. It was recognised that, although the waters in some porI tliink tions are not navigable by reason of falls and rapids, yet the control of such portions is essential to the navigability of other portions of the river, and of Lakes Erie and Ontario. Second -The Niagara River is a boundary stream. It is the duty of the Government of a country to maintain the proper regimen of such a river, so as to insure its integrity and proper volume. The report of the Joint Commission, which was presented on the 3rd May, 1906, declares the limits of diversions not injurious to the Niagara Falls, and that that agitated the States such diversions, exclusive of water required for domestic uses, or the service of locks in navigation channels, be permitted. The recommendations of that Joint International Commission broadly laid down About six the principles upon which the States of the Commonwealth of Australia have now come to a solution of tbe Murray River question. Let me give une quotation from the joint r e p o r t It is not profitable, in the absence of essential data, to speculate as to how power obtained from these stores waters might be distributed throughout low-water periods, nor as to what the resulting minimum power might be. However, if tiie low-water flow without storage should drop, say, for three months, to 50 cubic feet per second, storage might be utilized to increase this several-fold. It should be remembered that, where the storage sites are scattered, several dams will be required. The cost of construction and operation of such may, in some instances, more than offset any advantages to be derived from the use of stored waters. Each case must be decided upon its own merits. A treaty, based upon this joint report, was entered into on the 5th May, 1910, between the United Kingdom and the United States. The preamble recited that The United States and the countries concerned were equally desirous of preventing disputes regarding boundary waters, and of settling all questions that were then pending between the United States and the Dominion of Canadai n relation to frontier matters. The articles regulate jurisdiction and control, and are an expression of a high level of international relations. To quoteI t is agreed that any interference with the diversion from their natural channels of such waters on either side of the boundary resulting in injury on the other side of the boundary shall give rise to the same rights, and entitle the injured parties to the same legal remedies as if such injury took place in the country where such diversion or interference occurs.

Nothing is more difficult, a drafted-a t all events, no Bill was indecision having been given in an ordinary troduced and debated in the Parliaments riparian case as between individuals, than -to carry out the recommendations of to express, in terms of discharge along that Commission.

The expenses also of the case agreement was drawn up, and subsebefore the Court would be exceedingly quently signed, which, speaking broadly, great. On this point, a writer on State provided for a settlement upon this basis: and International water laws in America, Before locking the rivers, the discharges in a paper delivered before the American of the waters of the river were to be apSociety of Civil Engineers, in November, portioned in specific quantities between 1912, saidWe cannot expect the United States Supreme was divided into two parts-on e of high Court to work out and adopt some administraand the other of low discharge-extend tive system adequate to the needs in this reing from July to January inclusive, in spect. This is a problem for the legislative the case of the high discharge, and, in the branch of the Government. Mr Glynn. use did generally apply between States in Kansas and Colorado Inter-State Royal Commission reported the States. For this purpose, the year ease of the low discharge, from February to June. The apportionment between the States was expressed in terms of discharge of cubic feet per minute. When these prescribed quantities, which were set out in clause 33 of the agreement, had been allotted to the States-in other words, when the down-stream State, South Australia, had got its quantity-it was provided that the upper States could then, having had their quantities, also take the whole of the balance of the river discharges that remained. There was a provision that when locking was completed the final discharge to South Australia was to be the annual quantity of 75,000,000,000 cubic feet. There was also a further provision that that volume might be increased to whatever discharge was found by the Comniission to be necessary to maintain the navigability of the locked river. That agreement was not ratified-that is to say, was not pressed to a decision in the three Parliaments. Just as it is said that hope deferred makes the heart grow sick, so it may be said that it sometimes leads to action in other directions; and as waiting was considered by South Australia to be rather painful, the Government of that State decided to construct a work that might ease the situation. Lake Victoria, about 37 miles from the border of South Australia, is about the best reservoir on tbe river system. It is the most economical, and, in proportion to the discharge, it offers about the best means of making effective storage of the highest capacity, and the cost of construction and management is the lowest of the lot. By impounding the waters which reached the inlet of that basin, wben they were not required either for navigation or irrigation, it would not only help by controlling the South Australian down-stream State, but ease by diminishing any difference as regards quantities as between it and the up-stream States. These matters are well known to the engineers, and to those who conferred at the various Conferences. aud loss from seepage be very great ?."" comparatively slight, though evaporation, except in very deep basins, is greater. That, however, is a very minor point. It is the evaporation and seepage in the channels, especially in . Victoria, where it sometimes reaches 50 per cent., that is serious. The seepage and evaporation of the river itself are well known. If , for instance, we were to take the Murchison Weir and t r y to express at Morgan, in South Australia, the quantity discharged from the Murchison, we should have to allow at least 30 per cent, for percolation, evaporation, and so forth . Buti f we took the discharge of certain channels which were not made of concrete, we should find that the actual distribution from the source of offtake-that is, the discharge from the river or reservoir-wa s a more serious matter. I do not wish, however, to be diverted from the main point by a consideration of these comparatively minor questions. In 1910, South Australia thought it might be well to proceed with the Lake Victoria scheme, and I will deal with' the provision On that point in a few minutes. I may say that when the agreement was last amended, the final annual quantities to be discharged to South Australia, for instance, when the locks were built and the flow of the river was regulated by locking and storage, was reduced from 75,000,000,000 cubic feet to 60,000,000,000 cubic feet, and there was also provision that all the States in the drought years should have a pro ratd reduction of the quantities allotted to them. That reduction was to take place at a higher level of the river, so as to provide for every possible contingency that the most extraordinary anxiety of any of the States could present to those who had to deal with the question. Under the first agreement, locking was to commence when diversions affected navigability; under the amended one, at once. I do not intend to deal w i th the old agreements, beyond the references I have made. A Victorian Royal Commission was appointed in May, 1910, to deal with the agreement, and it also presented a report, upon which nothing was done, although each of those reports, on some points, contributed largely to the education of the public, as well as of members of Parliament. In January, 1911, a Conference of the Premiers of the three States interested took place in Melbourne, and, after they had gone thoroughly into this matter, it was decided that South Australia should proceed with the construction of the Lake Victoria locks. That decision did not really touch in any respect the question at issue between the States,",25,Second Reading

In order to settle the other differences between the States, it was suggested-and I threw the suggestion into a report' which formed an appendix dealing with the whole nuestion up to that period, and I think Mr Elwood Mead orally made a similar proposal-that certain 'unascertained data regarding storage should be collected by the engineers. pointed outAt present there seems to be no clear or reliable information as to the possibility of providing by storage for the permanent requirements of both irrigation and navigation. The difficulty is to reconcile the interests of navigation and irrigation. I always held the opinion that they were absolutely reconcilable, and that contention has now been proved. The three engineers have said that not one drop of the water taken to maintain the efficiency of the locks will be at the expense of irrigation; that, to quote their words, "" the construction of movable weirs . . . could be carried out without affecting the volume of water capable of being used for other purposes."" What has militated against the settlement of this question has always been the lack of apprehension of the material facts. gation as much as in irrigation ? arise; but the interests of navigation and irrigation can be reconciled. No doubt, Victoria would prefer irrigation, and to some extent favours navigation. South Wales is interested in both; whilst South Australia is perhaps more materially, though not exclusively, interested in navigation. Australia was particularly keen on the interests of navigation. ways been made, but it is not quite true. As a matter of fact, South Australia, through her transport trade, commands, in a sense, a greater length of the navigable stream, which, taking the whole of the system into account, represents a stretch of 3,200 miles. This agreement is dealing only with 1,400 miles of that extent. getting deliveries from, sav.

In those recommendations to which I have referred, I pointed out that it would be well to have definitely determined by the engineers of the three States the extent to which the interests of navigation and irrigation could be reconciled without in jury to either. A t the Conference of Premiers, resolutions were arrived at for the construction of the Lake Victoria works by South Australia, and the question as to whether such works should be part of the larger scheme was deferred, because it was recognised that the undertaking of the Lake Victoria works would not prejudice the larger scheme into which the States are now entering. The South Australian Parliament passed the ratifyin g Act, but action by the other States was delayed.

116,Mr Glynn,"In recent years, all thewe have many comparative advantages; for instance, "" that the Murray River is not wider is particularly fortunate as regards its improvement by locks and weirs,"" and he added that the absence of ice is a matter of great importance. He gave an account of the fleet barges in the United States of America. Dealing only with South Australian requirements and the river below the Darling, he recommended that nine low weirs should be constructed from Swanreach to Wentworth at an estimated cost of £1,050,000. cost of maintenance and operation with Lake Victoria at £9,500. of fact, the South Australian Parliament passed an Act adopting mainly the principles of Captain Johnston's report for the is capable of producing well under locking of the river in South Australia and water. as far as Wentworth. The estimated cost given by the Minister was £1,070,000. Turning now to the report of the engineers, which is a vital matter, those experts asked the States to help them with estimates of the areas capable of being irrigated from the river system. South Wales gave its total irrigable area at 4,950,000 acres, Victoria 1,450,000 acres, and South Australia 1,000,000 acres, a total of 7.400,000 acres. the country along the Darling River. country capable of being irrigated by the river system. the estimates of 1902, which, in my opinion, were absurd. well expect the man in the moon to irrigate as to expect some of the areas included in the 1902 estimates to be irrigated. for the irrigation of the 7,400,000 acres was estimated to be 20,050,500 acre-feet. One acre-foot per month is equivalent to 43,560 cubic feet per minute. Minister has mentioned that we can irrigate 1,400,000 acres, which, in the opinion of the engineers, is the limit of economic storage. other reservoirs to be dealt with which may or may not be regarded as providing economic storage. economic storage depend on the conservation of the flood discharge to supplement the low discharge of the same year. We cannot impound economically the flood discharge of one year to supplement the low discharges of other years. man taking into consideration the number of acres which the Cumberoona dam will submerge and practically place out of cultivation, and is he deducting that area from the acreage that will be irrigated by this scheme ? gineers went into those figures for that purpose.

The Cumberoona Dam represents only a very small proportion of the good land that take into calculation the practicability of mountain storage prior to the water entering the streams? New storage is possible on the Tumut, but I think the engineers have disregarded that scheme for the present, although it may eventually be of great help to the Burrinjuck scheme. The Burrinjuck Reservoir is one of the finest in existence, having regard to the small loss by evaporation which will take place there. In the Waranga Basin when full you have the same superficial area, but the loss It reduces considerably through evaporation and soakage amounts to about 7 feet a year, because the average You might as depth of the reservoir when full is not more, than 17 feetI think it is lessand the lapping of the water against the sides under a strong sun means a treThe amount of water required mendous loss through evaporation.

A bigWith the Cumberoona Reservoir, a large storage area which is not yet completed because of some difficulty in ascertaining whether the foundation is reliable; with the Mitta, the Kiewa, -and the storage on the Goulburn at Murchison, where further reservoirs were contemplated in some of the reports of Mr Elwood Mead; with the Burrinjuck Reservoir, Lake Victoria, and the flow of the Ovens, the Broken, and the Campaspe Rivers, you will have for a season of eight or nine months of the year over 626,000 acre-feet per month for irrigation. can be served from the existing reservoirs is between 600,000 and 700,000 acres, and the reservoirs to be constructed under this scheme will give a discharge for 800,000 acres more, though additional storage will involve a much higher cost per unit of volume. Ridiculous ideas have been current for many years past as to the capacity of the Murray for irrigation. irrigation, which includes more than the agreement provides for, will cost about £2,517,800, and the cost of distribution, States, will come to about £3,600,000, making £6,117,800 altogether. I have already mentioned to deal with this matter is thought to be conferred by the paragraphs in the Constitution dealing with navigation and trade and commerce. We have not yet exercised that power; but during the last fourteen years, I have at times asked whether the Commonwealth should not pass an Act declaring its relation to the Murray. Similar legislation has been passed in the ITnited States of America. There is an Act of 1899 preventing the making of bridges and dams affecting navito be provided under the agreement. gable rivers without the consent of the authorities at Washington, and the obstruction of such streams is prohibited by legislation. agreement upon which the Bill is founded was come to, about 20,000 acres were being irrigated in New South Wales, about 214,000 acres in Victoria, and from 25,000 to 30,000 acres in South Australia, in all about 259,000 acres. The existing works could supply water for 341,000 acres more, making a total irrigable area of 600,000 acres. But those figures cannot be relied on for all purposes, because in Viotoria the area irrigated under intense cultivation is comparatively small; whereas in South Australia practically the whole effect on the Commonwealth. One of the Mr Glynn. of the irrigated area is under intense cultivation. The navigation works to be constructed are: 9 locks from the Murray mouth to Wentworth, a distance of 520 miles; 17 locks from Wentworth to Echuca, a distance of 550 miles; and 9 locks from the junction of the Murrumbidgee to Hay, a distance of 240 milesthe total length of river dealt with being 1,310 miles. I understand that New South Wales may ask the Commission to sanction the construction of locks in the Darling instead of in the Murrumbidgee The total area that over an equal length to that proposed for the Murrumbidgee, and at an equal expenditure, namely, about £500,000. I do not think that there are any official estimates of the cost of maintenance. According to the Bill, the total cost of the storage works and the locks will be £4,663,000. I believe that the estimates allow a margin of £750,000. The storage for the extension of For the sake of caution a very large addition was made to the estimates of the engineers of at least two of the States, so that it is extremely probable that the which will fall on the total estimate will not. be exceeded. That leads me to mention a provision in the Bill which, I think, had better be struck that our power out, though its inclusion should not prevent the immediate passing of the measure. Some of my colleagues may differ from me on the point. Clause5 says that, subject to the Act, the agreement is hereby ratified and approved, and shall take eflect on the commencement of the Act, but that nothing in the ratification or approval shall be taken to render the Commonwealth liable for the payment of any greater sum than £1,000,000 in respect of the cost of carrying out the works I have here all the estimates, and they show that there is no reasonable danger of the proposed expenditure being exceeded. As At the time that the part of a compromise arrived at at the end of a very elaborate discussion of the whole matter, it was thought that it would be a trifling concession for the Commonwealth to make, if the cost of the particular work ran to a few thousands more than the sum estimated, to share it pro rata with the contributions of the contracting parties, instead of leaving the States to bear the whole of it. At every stage of the consideration of the agreement I paid careful regard to its first drafts provided that the Commonwealth should pay its proportion to the cost of maintenance; but we could not consent to that, because it did not form part of the original resolution, under which we agreed to contribute only to the capital cost. In my marginal notes on the various drafts, I queried, on behalf of the Commonwealth, a number of points, and, in regard to this matter, I submitted a memorandum to the Attorney-General's oflice. I sent a copy of it six weeks ago, and another last week, and the Department was quite aware of the position when the agreement was signed. However, the inclusion of the clause is not of much consequence, so long as the arrangement is regarded as final, because we do not want further delay. I have offered to go through all the data on the point, but my offer has not been accepted. There has been a lack of time to. look at all these matters. I shall not deal now with the details of the Bill, which have been fairly well explained by the Minister of Trade and Customs. We may take it that the cost of maintaining and operating the locks between Swanreach and Wentworth will be about £9,000 a year, an estimate being made by Captain Johnston and the engineers of South Australia. From Wentworth to Echuca, where there will be seventeen weirs and locks, the annual cost will be about £17,000, and from the junction of the Murrumbidgee to Hay, where there will be about nine weirs and locks, the annual cost will be about £9,000, making the total cost £35,000. The cost per mile of improved river will be comparatively low, namely, about £2,300. The members of the Commission number four, the Chairman being the Commissioner appointed by the Commonwealth. The estimates may not be exceeded without the sanction of the Commission, which must decide that any excess sanctioned is necessary for the carrygreatly to the credit of this and previous ing out of the work. Unless this decision is unanimous, the estimates may not be exceeded. Where there is not unanimity on a vital matter, reference to arbitration is provided for. But, as a matter of fact, no excess can be substantial, because the arrangement is one of more or less. However, I shall not go further into the question now. I have only to add that the agreement gives effect to the last effort of many years on the part of the States, and the first in conjunction with the Commonwealth, for the settlement of a vexed question. It is the result of a great deal of consideration on the part of every State affected, of the interests and views presented by the representatives of those States. As the Commonwealth is interested from the point of view of navigation, it is only fair that it should contribute to the expenditure of £4,663,000 which is to be made by the people for the settlement of the most vexed question that has arisen in the course of our Australian history. The measure may be further explained, if necessary, in Committee; but I ask honourable members to approach it in the generous spirit which a Federal Parliament always possesses, but, perhaps, doea not always manifest, and complete the successful efforts of the States to finally settle this important and long-discussed problem. desire to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition, who has made it possible to come to this agreement, and also to congratulate the present Government on their proposal to ratify the contribution to which the Commonwealth is pledged in order that the necessary works may be carried out as early as possible. The honourable member for Angaa has also given us some very valuable information respecting the principles that govern the agreement; and we should also acknowledge the part played in this work by the honourable member for Balaclava when he was Premier of Victoria. The proper utilization of the Murray waters is one of most vital importance, not ouly to the present generation, but to future generations; and for the last forty years there have been efforts made to come to some agreement. It is, therefore, Governments that an agreement has been found possible. Our bitter experiences of the drought during the last two years has made an agreement of the kind more imperative than ever.

The report of the Royal Commission of 1902 is Mr Sampson. a most valuable one, giving more comprehensive information as to the Murray and its possibilities in the way of irrigation and navigation than any previously issued. In that report it is statedPrior to the Corowa Conference in March, 1002, all inquiries into the utilization of the waters of the Murrayand its tributaries were thc work of individual State Commissions, or of State Departments, which looked at the question almost solely from the point of view of the particular State to which they were responsible. A New South Wales Commission and a Victorian Commission had two conferences in 1S86, and adopted certain resolutions inquiries, during a for the guidance of the two States; but no to Mildura and the Murray, action was taken by either State. A similar attitude characterized the policies and work that these newspaper reon the rivers carried out by certain State Gowere, unfortunately, only too vernments. The Corowa Conference, however, The position was a very parlous marked the new departure. It was attended along by representatives-includin g the Premiersfrom Victoria, Now South Wales, and South Australia, and the Federal Prime Minister, and was called together by those interested in the water supply of the Riverina. The Conference was a result of the long succession of drought years, which culminated in the extremely dry year of 1902, when it appeared that all that could save the northern part of I have always regarded Victoria and southern Riverina from decimation was the institution of large irrigation works. The resolutions carried at thc Conferto the National Parliament. ence were principally with this object-that the one tangible result was a determination on the part of the Governments of Victoria, New South Wales, and Soutli Australia to appoint an Inter-State Royal Commission for the inConstitution should be vestigation of the apportionment of waters between the riparian States, and the public works necessary to fully use the water to the under Federal conbest advantage of all concerned. The fact that the States own From 1902 to 1910 several Royal Commisirrigation sions were appointed by the three States with power to grant land concerned, and Bills were introduced into information the various State Parliaments to carry out the recommendations made, but none of these measures were passed. In 1910 the Royal Commission known as the Mackinnon Commission presented a stronglyCommonwealth worded report, in which, probably for the My object in submitting the first time, the question of navigation versus irrigation was practically discussed. The recommendation of that Commission to the Interwas that irrigation should be paramount -that whenever irrigation rights came into conflict w it h navigation rights the and render the former should be paramount-and that of the waters most advana responsible body should be appointed, with sufficient discretionary power, to see The history of this question that policy carried out. The question of riparian rights, which bears very closely and seriously on this agreement, is as old as history itself. In the old Roman Empire, where the lives of the people and their stock so much depended on an artificial supply of water, the doctrine known as the doctrine of prior appropriations was the one generally applied. rests on the reasonable use of the water, and the whole controversy as to riparian rights has centred on the meaning of "" reasonable use."" diffidence on a question of this kind in the presence of the honourable -member for Angas; but I think it will be found that the "" reasonable.use "" of water has been interpreted as meaning the best use to which it can be put. It is easy to understand that the meaning of "" reasonable use ' ' must vary with the climatic conditions. In the southern parts of Europe, where irrigation is necessary for the sustentation of the people and their stock, the "" reasonable use "" of water is the best use to which it can be put in the irrigation of the soil. In the northern part of Eurone, as in Germanv. where we find the Danube and the Rhine, irrigation issubordinated to navigation, and the best use of the water is held to be its use for navigation. In England the common law was interpreted in the same way, because this is a matter, as I say, that is conditioned by climate. When the question of riparian rights was first raised in the United States, the people naturally drew their inspiration from the common law principles of GreatE t it a in ; but they soon found that the climaticconditions were such as to require large variation-that new principles had to be applied to the utilization of their waters. The result is a division of opinion as to the interoretation of the common law in this regard in the United Scates. In the western States, where irrigation is necessary, the "" reasonable use "" of the water is its use for irrigation, and where there is a conflict of interests navigation is subordinated. It is unassailable that the ""reasonable use"" the best use to which that water can be p u t ; and if we find that variations have had to be made in the United States of America and in Europe, according to the climatic conditions, how much more necessary is it in Australia, where we have so great an extent of land with a most limited water supply ? I suppose that, in prooortion to our total area, we have as much land which is particularly suitable for the application of irrigation as any country has. B ut if for the cultivation of that area we had to depend on the rainfall unconserved, it would probably be found that two-thirds of our total extent of land would certainly not be put to its best use. That doctrine The question of the interpretation of the Pederal Constitution is involved in this matter. Prior to the passing of the Constitution Act, in 1900, no definition I speak with some of the law of riparian rights had been made in Australia. A t that time the State of New South Wales claimed f u l l proprietary rights over the RiverM u r r a y ; it claimed the river as its own property. That attitude is probably liable to variation through the passing of the Pederal Constitution Act. found that the river belongs to New South Wales. any H i gh Court decision, no one can speak dogmatically on that question. Section 98 of the Constitution provides that the power of the Commonwealth Parliament to make laws with respect to trade and commerce extends to navigation and shipping, and to railways, the property of any State; and as the Murray River is an Inter-State stream, the Commonwealth can make laws with respect to its navigation. This power of the Commonwealth, however, is limited by section 100 of the Constitution, which providesThe Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade or commerce, abridge the right of a State, or of the residents therein, to the reasonable use of the waters of rivers for conservation or irrigation. Thus the waters in the Murray River belong to the Commonwealth for navigation purposes, subject to the all-important rights of a State, or of the residents therein, to the reasonable use of the water for irrigation. While the river bed may be claimed by New South Wales as of water is its territorial property, the waters contained in the bed of the stream are con : trolled by the Commonwealth for navigation purposes; but they are only Commonwealth property subject to the right of the State to draw upon the waters for the purpose of irrigation. The question of what is reasonable use of the water is one upon which, sooner or later, the H i g h Court may be called upon to pronounce a decision. A t any time it may be claimed that the stream allowed to flow from the storages in the upper reaches is insufficient to permit of navigation.

There, theoretically, irrigation and navigation are placed on terms of equality; but, in my opinion, on a serious conflict between the interests of navigation and irrigation arising, the matter will probably be left for the H i g h Court to give a pronouncement upon. I wish to glance for a few moments at the experience of the United States of Americai n respect to navigation.

However, in order to show how impossible it is for navigation pete with railway transportation, on canals and rivers most favorable for it, I refer honourable members to the report of the National Waterways mission, which was appointed United States of America by Congress in 1909. The duty of that was to report on water transportation and tbe improvement make recommendations. in Europe and the United States, and Mr Sampson. Admira l Sperry, who had command of the American Fleet which Visited Australia some years ago, and others assisted it . The most exhaustive examination was made of the waters of the United States, and the Commission formulated a series of distinct topics, into which it set itself chiefly to inquire. It inquired chiefly into the reasons for the decline in inland it w ill interpret "" reawaterway transportation, and it suggested remedies there for. It also inquired into the the relation between navigation and railway transportation, and such subjects as canals, irrigation, wharfs, docks, waterpower, locks, and dams. The Commission reported, amongst other mattersIn 1880, the Erie Canal carried, between Buffalo and New York, 4,600,000 tons of goods, or 18 per cent, of the total traffic. In 1906, the amount had fallen to 1,400,000 tons, or 3 per cent, of the total traffic, as against 79,000,000 tons carried by the railways. Other decreases may be briefly summarized as follows :Total Traffic. 1889. 1906. tons. tons.

Yet, the railways in Central and Northern Europe, although chiefly designed to carry passengers and mails, have a tonnage of about 800,000,000, as against less than 200,000,000 carried on canals and rivers. The United States Commission reported that the rivers most successful in regard to navigation were those on which coal, timber, and ores of low grade requiring cheap carriage, in order to render mining profitable, were carried. There will be very little similar freight carried on the Murray River. We are at a disadvantage in this respect. The only goods that will compare with the low-grade ores of America will be wheat and wool. Wheat may be grown in the Riverina, and may in certain instances be conveyed along the river for 20 or 30 miles in order to reach a railway; but that is the only possible freight we can have. I quite appreciate the statement made this afternoon by the honourable member for Angas, that the Eiver Murray is suitable for navigation, but at the same time it is very circuitous. endorsement of the greatest engineer in the world on these matters. Murray is one of the most winding streams in the world, and we know that there has been a great decline in the amount of navigation upon it. According to a report issued in 1902, the amount of traffic on the river from 1882 to 1891, when there was no railway competition, was of the value of £544,000. According to the 1910 report, the total trade is of the value of 'about £45,000, representing about 40,000 tons, which may be regarded as the present revenue, though that may be increased by the establishment of locks. The works contemplated in this report will, it is estimated by the engineers, actively irrigate 1,450,000 acres, and this agreement, if it is carried out, will add some millions of pounds per annum to the value of Australian production. As the honourable member for Angas indicated, we have passed 'the point when we can indulge in fanciful pictures of the enormous possibilities of irrigation on the Murray River, but it has remained for the engineers, in their 1913 report, to give accurate data gating a certain proportion of the land available along the valleys of the Murray and its tributaries. For the first time, we have this data before us, and I think it should be brought out in this debate, because it will tend to help engineers in providing for water storage, not only for the present, but for the future. Whilst this agreement will provide water for the active irrigation of 1,400,000 acres, it only deals with one-third of the total volume of the Murray. If all the Murray waters could be utilized, and water stored in the same way that it is proposed to store it under this agreement, it would be possible to irrigate 4,500,000 acres. We know it would be impossible to impound the whole of the flood waters of the Murray, or to use its total volume for the purposes of irrigation, and whilst the engineers provide for the irrigation now of 1,450,000 acres, that area will require the provision of a larger volume of water than it is practicable to use. If it were possible to use all the water available for irrigation purposes from the Murray and its tributaries, it would be possible to irrigate nearly 8,000,000 acres, though, according to the estimates of engineers, that is quite beyond the range of possibility. This agreement guarantees to South Australia 1,254,000 acre-feet of water per annum, which will irrigate 627,000 acres with two waterings each of 1 acre-foot. It is estimated by engineers that that amount is required to. satisfactorily irrigate land. The amounts to the other two States are: Victoria, 2,219,000 acre-feet, or sufficient to irrigate 1,100,000 acres of land, and New South Wales 1,957,000 acre-feet, or sufficient to irrigate 975,000 acres. The irrigation allocations, therefore, areVictoria, 1,100,000 acres; New South Wales, 975,000 acres; South Australia, 627,000 acres; a total of 2,702,000 acres. The flow and storage under this agreement, if it can be utilized, will irrigate 2,702,000 acres, but we can only expect to actively irrigate 1,450,000 acres, making allowance for flood, seepage, and evaporation. The larger figure I have quoted is the potential allocation if all the water were used. It will be realized that under this agreement all three States",34,Second Reading

129,Mr Sampson,"We know that thehaye huge present and prospective possibilities in connection with irrigation, and it is on this point that the real effect of the agreement may be considered. On the basis of area available for irrigation, the distribution of water seems to be a fair one. that the engineers, i u addition to the irrigation areas already in progress or contemplated in the three States, gave figures which were quoted by the Minister of Trade and Customsi n introducing the B ill . The allotments as set down will give South Australia 1,000,000 acres of possible irrigation land; Victoria, 1,500,000 acres, probably 2,000,000; and New South Wales, 2,500,000, possibly with the Darling Valleya very uncertain So that, regardless of contributions, the proportional allocation does not appear to be unfair. But, whilst I do not desire to deal with this agreement in any parochial senses-for the subject is a Federal one, and should be dealt with in a Federal spirit-the probability ,is that on the basis of contribution Victoria has more to lose than any of the other States. We know that the River Murray does not belong to any one particular State. It belongs to the States through which it flows, and the distribution of water for irrigation purposes seems to me to be chiefly the basis upon which any agreement should be made. That aspect, apparently, was taken into consideration by the engineers when they were framing the basis of this agreement. I regret, however, that the agreement does not invest the Board of Control about to be appointed with greater discretionary power. I believe that the powers of the Board should be made so elastic that in times of drought, such as 1902 or 1914, the Board would have more authority than seems to b© provided to vary the agreement in accordance with the interests of the position. I regret that such a clause as that which appeared in the Mackinnon report of 1910 has not been incorporated in this agreement. That clause readsThat in order to maintain transportation facilities for localities which now have them only by river, and which do not hereafter obtain them by railway construction, the Board be empowered to regulate thc How of rivers so that the period of navigation hitherof money is to be expended in order to to customary be preserved for vessels of a reaencourage a trade that amounts to only sonable draught, and so long as this is not inconsistent with irrigation development. by clause 51 of the agreement?

That question is not entered into. engineers say that it is not required ? sent downI am speaking now of the allotments of the different States-and a certain proportion of that water must go into the sea. Moreover, the reduction is a pro rdta one on the allocation, instead of the area irrigated in the respective States. The outstanding advantage of this agreement, however, is that it will provide water supply-4,000,00 0 acres. storages to impound 1,000,000 acre-feet of water that now flows into the sea, and 500,000 acre-feet of water at Lake Victoria. The real test of the value of the agreement will be in a dry year such as was experienced in 1902 and 1914. In such years it would be necessary to utilize the whole of the contributions of the rivers above Albury, the most reliable sources, in order to supply the amount of water that has to be sent past Lake Victoria. To meet the circumstances that might be expected to arise on such an occasion wide discretionary powers ought to be invested in the Commission appointed, in order that the interests of the irrigation settlements along the river, up to and beyond the South Australian border should be preserved. member will find that clause 51 covers the point in his mind. cretionary power. agreement would have been more complete if it had given the Commission f u l l power"" to deal with any situation in accordance with the requirements for the irrigation settlements of the various States, apart from the question of rigid allocation and of navigation altogether.

137,Mr Sampson,"In my view, thelocks are capable of storing 300,000 acrefeet of water, and, in my opinion, it is only a question of waiting u n t i l the locks now constructed for navigation cease altogether to ply on the river, When that time comes we shall have in the locks valuable barrages along the river capable of irrigating a further 150,000 acres. In the sense that the cost of constructing the locks w ill not be anything like proportionate to their storage capacity, they are a costly concession to navigation, but we have to remember that with the diminution of navigation on the river these locks w ill , in themselves, prove very valuable storages, having a capacity greater than that of the Waranga Basin. This agreement, it should be here pointed out, provides tliat the whole of the water north largely required to satisfy the wants of the Commission, and that New South Wales and Victoria will have to construct locks on the rivers below Albury and the Murrumbidgee inlet to provide for their irrigation requirements along the banks of the Murrayi n a very dry year. I have endeavoured to place before the House the true position of this agreement in relation to the States. I Have sought to deal with the subject fro m an Australian stand-point. We have reached the dawn of the possibility of enormously in creased storages, and this will be welcomed by the House and the country. On the ratification of this agreement, these works should not only be started as soon as possible, but one of the first efforts of the Commission should be to ascertain through their engineers where it is possible in the all time on a proper basis the question of upper reaches of the Murray to construct even more extensive storages than those for which provision has been made. Engineers should be set to work at once to find out how far it is possible to store some of the remaining two-thirds of the flow of the Murray that will not be u t i lized under this agreement. The value of irrigation has been touched upon by the Leader of the Opposition, and I have dealt with that phase of the question on many occasions in this House. I have quoted figures to prove that some of the finest results obtained from irrigation in any part of the world have been secured along the Murray valley. No other part of the world probably can show greater results per acre than we have obtained from some of our irrigation settlements. The production of Mildura on the present basis is about £ 5 0 per acre. It is impostion of the efforts of those who have been sible to expect along all parts of the Murray banks the high value of production that has been secured at Mildura and Renmark. We could not hope to establish along the whole river f r o n t irrigation settlements such as would give us the production pe^acre that we have at Mildura. If it were possible to utilize our 1,500,000 acres of irrigable Murray lands provided for by this agreement, so as to produce the same money value per acre as is gained at Mildura itself, we should have, under this present scheme alone, an agricultural production of something like £70,000,000 per annum. But'this expenditure will pay over and over again, even if , as the result of it , we can secure only one-fourth or the production per acre obtained at Renmark and Mildura. Havof Albury will be very ing regard to the production that will result from these storages, and the cheap cost of storage per acre-foot, it seems to me that the time has arrived when we should ascertain, without further delay, whether other storages cannot be made, and that we should set to work as spon as possible to largely extend the storage capacity even beyond that provided for in this agreement. I believe that the last word has not been said in connection with this Murray Waters Agreement. I regard it as being, after all, only a tentative one. The time may come when it will be necessary to make a wider investment of authority. It may be found desirable to vest the control of the Murray water and its tributaries in the Inter-State Commission, giving it an authority which will place for navigation and irrigation. I am convinced that the experience we shall gain in the value of water for irrigation as compared with its use for navigation purposes, will very quickly demonstrate that irrigation should be the first consideration. Meantime, we should accept this agreement. T t is worthy of support, but I think that the final control of the Murray and its tributaries will have to be vested in the Federal power, so that this magnificent possession may be removed beyond the State and internecine jealousies which have existed for forty years, but which we hope have been happily ended by this agreement. to joiD with others who have contributed tn this debate in expressing my apprecia-",36,Second Reading

Instead of having to go cap in hand to the other State in order to obtain recognition of her riparian rights, South Australia would have made her irrigation development so great that neither Victoria nor New South Wales could have withstood her demands.

It shows that even though there be party differences in regard to the best method to adopt for the proper development of the Commonwealth, the governmental system does make it possible for us to come into agreement in doing that which is for the good of the people. The handling of the Murray River waters is a big national question, and the consummation of this scheme will be hailed with"" delight. Although there may be some critics who do not yet f u l l y apprehend the advantages likely to accrue from surely realize that the passage of this B ill is really the first important step towards the consummation of the greatest develop[262] mental work ever undertaken in regard to increasing the production of the soil in the southern portion of Australia. I am delighted that this B ill is being passed during the time. I have the honour to occupy a seat in Parliament, because, to If honmy mind, it marks an historic incident in our development. In the matter of i r r i gation, we in Victoria have been feeling our way slowly for the last twenty-five years. We have at last overcome the initial difficulties, and in whatever expenditure is incurred in future in regard to the locking of the River Murray and the irrigation of the adjacent areas, we shall start from the point of view of knowledge rather than of experiment. If we have derived advantages from irrigation-and we have had great advantages at Mildura, Renmark, and at Ardmona -thos e advantages have come about as many failures. In future, we shall be able to continue that work on a larger scale, with all the advantages derived from past experiments, and we shall accomplish a result that will be a blessing to the whole community, and go f a r to make the occupation of the land more pleasurable than it has been in the past. The last consideration is one of great im portance, because I view with alarm the rate at which the cities are building up compared with the emptiness of the country, and if by the conservation of water and its utilization in irrigation we can make country life more attractive, we shall have taken an appreciable step in the direction of overcoming that evil. I congratulate the Ministry on the introduction of the B ill , and I am indeed pleased that the Federal Government and the three States concerned have entered into a proper deed of partnership, which, I am sure, w ill be a credit to them and an advantage to the Commonwealth. -As one of the representatives of Queensland, which is not particularly affected by this agreement, I have followed the negotiations which have led up to the introduction of this B ill with great interest from the time. I first enteredthis Parliament. When we are dealing with this measure it is only just that we should the scheme, the time will pay a tribute to the honourable member come when all men will for Angasf or his labours in connection with it .

Honourable members need only refer to the many memoranda which he has prepared on this subject, and particularly to the appendix printed in the Victorian Parliamentary Papers in 1911, to discover what a wonderful grasp he has of the whole subject. More than that, he did' a great deal of good in clearing the atmosphere as regards the legal position in relation to the rights of the Commonwealth and the States. And, throughout all his efforts, whilst always having a natural inclination to conserve the rights of his own State, he did try to hold the scales justly between all the States concerned, so that he might help to bring to fruition a truly national scheme. I believe that the solution of this problem was made possible the moment the Commonwealth decided to step forward and to give assistance to the States. wealth should give some aid in a matter of this kind, because the whole of Australia is definitely interested in it. It is not only the States that are concerned in settling and populating Australia and increasing its production. In our scheme of Federation there is a distribution of powers between the Commonwealth and the States, but those powers were intended to be used conjointly for the benefit of Australia as a whole. The agreement which the House is asked to ratify to-day will, in my opinion, prove one of the biggest accomplishments since Federation. It seems strange that a measure of such great importance should be allowed to pass through the House so quietly, when we remember the strenuous debates that take place on minor differences between parties. By this measure we are laying the foundation of a big scheme that is likely to play an important part in increasing the population and material wealth of Australia. I was pleased to hear the Treasurer refer today to the necessity for increasing production. If we desire to retain and increase our present high standards of living, we shall require to do more than devise Mr Groom. schemes for regulating the distribution of wealth. We must do all we can to increase the output of wealth. Nobody desires to see our standards of living reduced. On the contrary, we desire them to be raised; but only by this Parliament devoting itself to great schemes for increasing production, and by the Commonwealth co-operating with the States to that end, shall we be able to do anything to permanently enhance the comfort of the Australian people. In conclusion, I desire to assure the House that, although Queensland will not directly benefit under this Bill, yet, in accordance with the national feeling which prevails throughout Australia, the northern State will most heartily congratulate New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia on the bringing of this project into being. I hope that when the Commissioners are appointed they will be able to devise a scheme that will realize the ideals of those who are promoting this Bill. wish to congratulate the Government on the steps they have taken in harmony with the States to give effect to the agreeIt is right that tlie Commonment which has been arrived at. Of all the enterprises upon which the Commonwealth has embarked, this is certainly one of the greatest. The success of Mildura and other irrigation centres in Australia provides every encouragement to the Governments concerned to proceed vigorously with the project that is before us. Some months ago I had the pleasure of visiting Mildura with the honourable member for Lilley, and we were delighted to find that country, which previously had been utilized as sheep-walks -maintainin g one sheep to ten or thirteen acres-converte d into a veritable oasis. Instead of one sheep to thirteen acres, we found that area carrying one human being to about one and three-quarter acres. It was very gratifying to learn also that, in regard to the amount earned per acre, the carrying capacity of the soil and the production of foodstuffs, the Mildura scheme is in advance of any other in the world. We found that the land has been subdivided into ten-acre blocks, and that each of the land-holders is earning about £400 per annum. In other words, every acre is returning about £40 a year to the occupant. If this result is compared with that for any other",39,Second Reading

ThisB ill is to give effect to amendments which have been found necessary since the passage of the last B ill , three years larvae of the mosquito to breed out in ago. The principal factor which has come into operation is the opening of the Panama Canal and the inauguration of a new trade route from America and other countries passing through an area which is known to be infested by yellow fever. The danger to be considered is not only the introduction of the disease, but also its spread from place to place within Australia. In March, 1914, when the honourable member for Darling Downs was Minister of Trade and Customs, he sanctioned the expenditure necessary to conduct a survey of the coastal towns of Queensland, w i th the object of determining the occurrence and distribution of Stegomyia fasciata, the intermediary host of yellow fever, which is a domestic mosquito. The survey was conducted by Mr PrankH . Taylor, the entomologist attached to the Australian Institute of Tropical Medicine, and the results of his investigation are embraced in a book which has been distributed to honourable members. As to the value of the work, the honourable members for Grampians and Melbourne can speak, and any honourable member who has perused the book can see that the work has been done very well. Maps indicate the number of places where yellow fever has been reported since 1909, including the Panama Canal zone, but the American authorities have done such excellent work in that area that they have practically eradicated the disease, and the nine cases which have occurred there since 1906 have all been imported. TheB ill before us has been introduced for the purpose of enabling our quarantine authorities to take the necessary steps to eradicate it in Australia. On page 17 of the book issued to honourable members will be found a comparison between the two South American towns of Para and Manaos. No steps have been taken in Manaos to eradicate the stegomyia mosquito, with the result that the number of yellow fever cases remains very h i g h; but since action was taken in Para to get rid of the disease the cases have fallen from 358 in 1910 to forty-nine in the folTheB ill will provide for proper isolation lowing year, and three in 1912. The places where yellow fever is now endemic are practically on the direct route to Aus(Yarra-Minister of tralia. During the two years ending 30th September, 1914, vessels arrived at Sydney or Newcastle from Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru, and the duration of the voyage from those places permits the Australia. As a matter of fact, there is no necessity for the mosquito to be imported and bred here, because it is here already. Honourable members will see by a map on page 94 of the book distributed to them that the inquiries instituted by my predecessor showed that the existence of Stegomyia fasciata has been determined at all coastal towns from Newcastle' to Port Darwin, and even at such inland places as Ravenswood, Proserpine, Edisvold, and Cunnamulla. The difficulties of dealing with the yellow fever are twofold-firstly , the insidious nature of the small species of mosquito which is the carrier of the disease, and, secondly, .the fact that many cases of yellow fever are mild in type and difficult to diagnose. Investigation having revealed the presence of this mosquito in every port in Queensland, if a case should occur ashore there is grave danger of its spreading, and it is therefore necessary to extend the power already contained in the Quarantine Act so that steps may be taken to prevent these mosquitoes from breeding, and they may be kept under control not only on vessels from abroad, but also, if necessary, on vessels trading between Australian ports. The amendment to section 13 is necessary to enable the Government to act quickly should the disease menace any portion of Australia, and also to enable vessels to be kept under control on their arrival at other ports, and to permit of adequate measures being taken. This accounts, also, for most of the extension that is sought to the provisions of section 87, giving additional powers of control over mosquito-borne diseases. Difficulties have arisen in connection with the proper isolation of patients or contacts of diphtheria cases on vessels arriving from overseas, and h, has been found necessary to extend the powers given by the A ct in order to give control over contacts and prevent infected persons from leaving steamers, as has happened in the case of some immigrant steamers which have arrived with infectious diseases on board.",43,Second Reading
163,Mr Tud Or,"and disinfection. The recent epidemic of small-pox showed the necessity for providing more satisfactory powers of isolation, and releasing , vaccinated persons under surveillance. Cases occurred in which the provisions of the Act were ignored, and owing to the incompleteness of the Acti t was impossible to punish the offenders. and few deaths occurred, this epidemic offered a warning to us to be amply prepared against, not only small-pox, but also cholera, plague, and yellow fever. There will otherwise be a menace . in regard to our troops who have gone away to fight the battles of the Empire. Our soldiers now in Turkey are in one of the worse countries in the world from the point of view of disease infection, and it is quite possible that they may become infected with some of the diseases referred to in this B ill , so that it may be necessary to take additional precautions on that account. Necessarily, therefore, the Commonwealth should be equipped with very adequate powers not only to deal with incoming vessels, but also to take immediate action should any case get ashore unrecognised, or develop after arrival. Such an instance occurred recently in the case of the Runic-and it may occur again. Very prompt action is essentia] to success, and it is this that accounts for the extension of the powers within any quarantined area referred to in section 87, sub-section c. The principle of the Commonwealth and States acting together in case of an emergency has already been established. I stated to-day in reply to a question, that the Governments of Victoria and Queensland have asked this Government to assist them in preventing the spread of small-pox from other States by insisting upon a more rigid inspection of cases arriving in their States. The additional power provided for in this B ill is particularly in Brisbane, where active needed, not only to quarantine persons, or to have them vaccinated, after we have discovered that they are contacts, but also to practically hold them wherever they may happen to be. There are in Victoria now, for instance, some fifty-six or fiftyseven contacts from the Wodonga, which arrived last week. If one of these contacts were found in the gallery of this House to-night, it would be impossible, under the present law, for us to detain him there until we could arrange for his removal to a quarantine station. do that-the man would probably have gone before it was secured-and this B ill therefore provides for the detention of any suspected person in any particular place until power is secured to 'effect his removal. Another most important provision has reference to the manufacture of Though the cases were mild, serums. In clause 9, we take power to regulate the preparation of serums. When the outbreak .of small-pox in Sydney was at its height, many persons there commenced to manufacture vaccine on their own account, and for their own private benefit. That manufacture was entirely uncontrolled. The Government had no power to deal with it . Governmental supervision over such manufacture is necessary, just as it is necessary that the conditions of manufacture should be proscribed. It is not intended under the B ill to prevent manufacture, but it is intended to take such steps as have been taken in the United States of America, in order' that we may insist upon such preparations being manufactured under proper conditions. I do not intend to labour the question, for experience has shown the necessity for these amendments to the original Act. -The action of the Minister of Trade and Customsi n asking for these amendments to the Quarantine Act has my support. 1 have only had time to go through the B ill hurriedly, but it seems to me that the powers he is proposing to take are necessary for the strengthening of the parent Act . What the honourable member said about the mosquito is thoroughly justified, and it is a matter of serious importance that the State Governments likely to be affected by it should take, active steps to combat the menace. This has already been done in Queensland, steps have been taken to minimize the danger. Areas are being drained, tanks are being protected, and the residents are being taught the use of oil and other substances against the insect. The late Governor of Queensland, Sir William McGregor, who had much tropical experience, preached in season and out of season the absolute necessity of fighting the mosquito with all the power that the State possessed. Wherever he visited he emphasized the importance of this. I am glad to notice that his preaching has had some",44,Quarantine Bill Second Reading

Consequently one of the most important steps to take against the occurrence of yellow fever in Australia is to control this mosquito in the immediate neighbourhood of our coastal cities. this mosquito away from the coastal cities, the cycle to which I have referred as being necessary for the continuation of the organism cannot be .carried out. It does not matter so much if the mosquito is present in places where human beings are not closely aggregated, but if it is allowed to continue to exist around our ports, especially in Queensland and New South Wales, we shall be subject to the danger of yellow fever from the opening of the Panama Canal. Panamai n itself w ill not be the source of danger, but the opening of the Canal brings appreciably nearer to Australia ports on the other side of South America, more particularly, which have not yet eradicated this plague. For that reason, I strongly urge upon the Minister that, instead of pinning our faith to a Quarantine Act, we should eradicate this particular species of mosquito in all our eastern ports. In that way we shall get rid of the risk. able member propose to find out the arrival of the mosquito? arrives. It is obviously impossible to handle such a question with a Quarantine or Immigration Restriction Act. We must eradicate this particular species of mosquito at the places where it is likely to be affected by the larva? arriving. The matter should not be allowed to rest here. We should act where action is required, namely, at the ports I have mentioned, and not attempt the impossible with a mere formal measure of this kind. General) T8.47] I realize the necessity for .taking restrictive measures to curtail the spread of disease, and that the danger of infection must increase the more we become linked up with countries where diseases prevail tliat are not yet known in Australia. We shall be taking a step in the right direction by giving the Commonwealth Government any power that may be necessary to enable it to quarantine more effectively any infected area. To-day, however, we are face to face with a great evil, not in the diseases themselves, but in the proposed antidotes. Impartial authorities all the world over have no two opinions as to the action and uses of vaccine. In some cases, our soldiers have had to submit to eight different inoculations before leaving for the front. They have been inoculated against As long as you keep typhoid, and a number of other diseases. Even those who favour this means of combating disease admit that these inoculations tend to lower the vitality of the individual operated on, and so lessen the power to resist other forms of disease. The authorities are now inoculating against meningitis. Two kinds of vaccine are being used, but neither has been proved, so far, to be of primary value. Despite this, they are practising on the boys who are going to the front . our soldiers against meningitis, are they ? we cannot deal with these matters in the ordinary common-sense way. Cleanliness and sanitation are the two main remedies now adopted by Japan. That country has abandoned the idea of vaccination, and has resorted to sanitation and cleanliness, which are the enemies of disease. Cleanliness and sanitation are fundamentals i u connection with quarantine. the first essential; but unless tlie ComW e shall know after it monwealth Government has power to enforce sanitation and cleanliness, isolation will not prove efficacious. I hope the day is not f a r distant when Australia will set an example to the rest of the world by refusing to allow a set of interested men who are for ever developing antidote after antidote for various forms of disease to practise on humanity, undermining the health of the community and bringing about devastation. views of the Government? thoughts. member cannot have any views other than those of the Cabinet.",46,Quarantine Bill Second Reading

I hope the day is not far distant when a Bill will be brought in to secure the community against those ills with which humanity is afflicted at the present moment. [8.52] -This is the most extraordinary display of Ministerial responsibility that I have ever witnessed in this House. The Postmaster-General, who has lately joined the Cabineta Cabinet which in itself is a corporate entity, and is supposed to be one, on the floor of the House, at all events-ha s berated one of his colleagues plained of the absence of certain provisions from this Bill, saying that he would like to see it amended. believe my own ears when I heard the Postmaster-General fulminating against the principles of vaccination. He said that he was not speaking to the Bill, and, that being so, I should like to know why he spoke at all. May I address some general observations to the House regarding the honourable gentleman's relation to the propaganda against the Quarantine Department, and all that concerned it, which was raised some time ago when he was sitting in Opposition? Let me say that I support this Bill cordially and without reservation. If it needs to be strengthened in the direction of giving the Minister full and complete power to deal with dire and dread infectious diseases, then such amendments should he allowed without question. But just what the Postmaster-General rose to say I do not know. I should advise him, when he wants in future to deliver a dissertation on any of these diseases, either to address print will look as if they were meant. himself personally to Dr. Cumpston, or, better still, to talk to the Cabinet, and settle his troubles there, instead of wasting a part that they imagine every one ing the time of Parliament in giving utterance to dissentient views concerning great principles of public health and pubtion that could occupy the attention of lic control. I should be sorry to think that we are to have many repetitions of I am not this kind of thing. If we are, then responsible government has already gone. The Postmaster-General will have to learn, I am afraid, that he has taken upon himself all the disabilities, as well as the advantages, of being a Cabinet Minister. The Minister of Home Affairs frankly confessed last night that he was hobbled. I enter my protest against the statement made by the Postmaster-General. He must remember that his words, now that he is a member of the Cabinet, are infinitely more weighty than they were when he was a free lance on this side of the chamber. It is necessary that the Minister of Trade and Customs should make quite clear his policy regarding the treatment of infectious diseases. We ought to know from him whether the views just uttered by his colleague the Postmaster-General iare the views of the Cabinet. If they are, then a very serious situation has arisen in Australia. are those expressed in the Bill. ask why the Postmaster-General spoke as he did? next Bill. other Bill in contemplation ? too, becomes a very serious and important matter. There ought to be no tampering with these proposals by the Government. able gentleman will forgive us for having our doubts when we hear a responsible Minister delivering a diatribe such as that just uttered by the Postmaster General-promisin g another Bill, speaking in advance, and preparing the public mind for it. members opposite are so constantly playelse is in the same case.

I may draw the attention of the Committee to the experience of the barque A l cyon, which arrived at Premantle on 24th May, 1915, from Cape Town, and reported that cases of sickness had occurred on board which had been diagnosed by the quarantine office at Cape Town as being cases of yellow fever. This vessel sailed from Frederikstad, Norway, on 21st February, 1914, and called at Pernambuco, Barbados, and Boco Grande. She arrived at Bahia on 23rd December, 1914, and departed on 21st Januaryf o r Cape Town, where she arrived on the 14th March. On 31st January, ten days after leaving Bahia, four of the crew fell ill , and in the days following there were, in a l l , to infectious seventeen cases of illness, three of which were fatal. On arrival at Cape Town, the barque was fumigated w i th Clayton gas, and no further trouble was experienced.

I should like the Minister to give the House some information in regard to his intentions in connection with the power granted by clause 9 to make regulations "" for prescribing conditions under whicli any prophylactic or curative vaccine or sale."" Is the Minister taking power to regulate the manufacture and sale of serum even within the States of Australia, because, if so, the question arises as to whether the Minister can legally take that step. [9.9] I consider this measure very necessary. One of its most valuable provisions is that to which reference has been made by the honourable member for Darling Downs. In regard to the preparation and sale of any prophylactic serum or vaccine, the Commonwealth Government should be supreme. There is a golden rule in our desire of the Constitution that where the law of a State and the law of the Commonwealth are inconsistent, the latter shall prevail, and I hope that, in this regard, the law of the Commonwealth will prevail in order that we may properly protect the health of the public. It is necessary that we should have uniform legislation to deal with the subject of vaccines or serums.

The proposal is to extend tlie line for a distance of 65 miles from Katherine River, making the total distance from Darwin 265 miles. WhilstI am asking the House to refer this project to the Public Works Committee, I am desirous that approval of it should be given by Parliament, subject to the report of the Committee. There are at present engaged on that railway 600 men, many of whom have their families with them. The land at the present terminus is poor, but when the line reaches Bitter Springs, it w ill tap good land, upon which many of the workers will settle. Yesterday tlie Engiheer-inChief urged me to see if it were not possible to arrange for the prosecution of this work subject'to the approval of the Public Works Committee, otherwise, asi t is proposed that the House shall adjourn from to-morrow until some date in March, these men and their families w ill leave for other parts of Australia. the Katherine to be completed ?

We know that the The Public Works Commitwhole trouble has been the existence of discordant elements in South and East Australia. One party wanted the line to cross into Queensland and New South Wales; the other wanted it to be carried, in accordance with the spirit of the agreement w i th South Australia, to the south; and further difficulty has arisen owing to the railway being carried on in the piecemeal fashion it has been. The last M in I understand istry passed an Act sanctioning the railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. There was not much dispute about that B ill , because that line was common to both the southern and eastern routes; but that Government did what State Governments have done lrequently-the y stopped the railway on the north side of the Katherine River in order to lessen expenditure, with the result that this extension is now saddled with the heavy expenditure of from £80,000 to £100,000 for a bridge across the Katherine River that ought to have formed part of the I am glad to earlier line. We know perfectly well that the railway was made in order to give access to the country on I am doing nothing of the other side of the Katherine from Darwin, not to stop on the Darwin side of the river.

The Committee has no power to recommend It may be two or three any other line. They must say either ""Yes"" or "" No "" to this proposal; and when their report comes forward, the' House will have to say "" Yea"" or "" Nay"" to the suggestions in it , and will have no opportunity of substituting any other line. I think it is high time that the Government brought in a proposal to extend the line north as f a r as the Macdonnell Ranges.

I would like Sof a r as the prehonorable members to look at the report the Minister laid upon the table. On the 16th August, 1915, Mr Bell informed the Minister that it was anticipated that the earthworks would be completed "" about November next""-that is this month. He also stated that if construction were stopped at the Katherine They probably thought River, considerable expense would be in curred in breaking up the construction camps, and in laying up plants that would not be earning money, and so on.

298,Mr Groom,"It is a report to theeary detailed information required by the Public Works Act. In June last I pointed out to the Minister that this railup with those of western Queensland, and way line was being constructed to the Katherine Eiver, and that it would be necessary for him at the earliest possible moment to give the House some idea of the Government's railway policy. stead of such a railway policy being developed, the whole thing has drifted on until we are now right up against the necessity of the men who were engaged there being found employment. As the result, this Bill is thrown before us in the way it has been. That is not a fair way of treating Parliament. What is likely to be the value of the Public Works Committee's report? We are told that, to-morrow, a Bill will be introduced authorizing the construction of this line. What is the use of this proposal being sent to the Committee under such circumstances? If an Act of Parliament is passed to-morrow, the reference to the Public Works Committee will be unnecessary, and their report regarding a matter already authorized and commenced will be useless. Parliament, however, is in an awkward position, because it does not want to leave 600 men unemployed in the Northern Territory. It would be a great misfortune to the Territory if we did lose the services of these men, because a similar body could not be got together again easily. But that does not alter the position that when a measure is put before us in this way, the Government ought to supplement it with the necessary information as laid down by the Act. It cannot be that the Minister is not aware of what is required, because the Act has been brought before the notice of his Department on several occasions. We realize that without a railway policy tbe Northern Territory can never be developed. Such a policy is absolutely essential; but at the present time we have nothing but a patchwork system before us. The Minister should take seriously to heart the advisableness of propounding a complete railway policy for the Territory. I should like to see the Government follow the example set by the Queensland Parliament not long since, when it resolved upon a developmental railway policy extending over a period of ten years, and dealing with the whole ques[263]2 tion of interior communications. Under that policy the coastal lines will be linked each line constructed will be part of a definite concrete scheme approved by the Parliament. I repeat that there can be no proper development of the Northern InTerritory until the Ministry evolves and proceeds to carry out a broad, comprehensive policy of railway construction. field) [10.17] A very serious question of responsibility affecting the Ministerial head of a Department, if not two Ministerial heads, and also the responsibility of Parliament, regarding the construction of public works, is involved in the proposition now before us. This piecemeal system of railway construction is most unsatisfactory. The point cannot be too strongly emphasized that it is time that the Parliament realized the necessity for a comprehensive, rather than a patchwork, railway policy. The Bill providing for the last section of this line to be constructed was quite definite in its terms. It provided, not for an overland railway, but for the construction of a line from Pine Creek to the Katherine River. We are now told broadly that unless we agree at once to the construction of a further section of 65 miles, about 600 workmen now in the Territory will be almost immediately thrown out of work. Some of these, I take it, are immigrants of a special class, who were supposed to be specially suitable for the settlement of the Territory. not speak English. immaterial, provided that they are likely to prdve satisfactory settlers. We are placed in a difficult position. I intend to support the resolution for the reference of this question to the Public Works Committee; but I am not going to support, without very convincing evidence, the authorization of this additional 65 miles of railway. We have no definite information as to the character of the work so far carried out on the railway from Pine Creek to Katherine River. We have no more than the bald statement that the earthworks have been completed. In railway construction earthworks are very often but a relatively minor part of a complete line.

If there is, then this seemingly insurmountable difficulty disappears. desire leave to continue my remarks at a later hour. Leave granted. the different parties in the House have agreed that I shall leave the Chairf o r a little while. I shall suspend the sitting of the House, and cause the bells to be rung as soon as it is desired that we should re-assemble.

For my own part, I am determined, so far as I am able to exert any influence in connection with public undertakings, to insist on having the most complete statements placed before the House before we approve of any public expenditure. I think it would be absolutely wrong to vote for the construction of this railway subject to its approval by the Public Works Committee. We cannot disregard our responsibilities to the taxpayers in such a way. It is unreasonable to suppose that the necessary investigations can be carried out by the Committee in a single day. There can be no efficient inquiry without a personal inspection by the Committee. It is not as if the Commonwealth had an efficient staff of engineers possessing an intimate knowledge of tlie conditions obtaining in the Northern Territory. Mr Bell is the officer responsible for construction, and, so far as I know, he has never visited the Territory. Sir has. place the responsibility for railway construction on any man other than Mr Bell. I am anxious that the examination of this project by the Public Works Committee should be thorough, and that the statement submitted to this House should be complete in every particular. It is time that we demanded that, in connection with the construction of railways, the specifications should be so complete that the responsible officer could furnish Parliament with a reliable estimate. tition of our experience in connection with the Kalgoorlie-Port Augusta railway. I understand that not. Parliament approved of the construction of that line at a cost of £4,500,000, and we now know that the cost will be more than £6,000,000-pos sibly £7,000,000. I am astounded that the press of this country does not strike out more effectively in regard to Government undertakings and expenditure. W it h the system of day labour in operation, I desire that we shall be able to pin the responsible officer down to his estimate, and if the cost is in excess of that estimate, Parliament ought to know the reason why. In regard to the position of the 600 men employed at the Katherine Eiver, having regard to the fact that only the formation is completed, it is possible that at least one-third of the labour involved on that line is yet to be done. If that be so, there is work for two or three months ahead of those men, and that w ill allow ample time for the Works Committee to report thoroughly on the project. If there is not work ahead of those men, we must recognise that there is a moral responsibility on this House to keep them in employment, inasmuch as they were brought to the country under certain conditions. If necessary, I would prefer to come back in a few weeks' time to deal with tlie report of the Committee rather than vote to authorize the project on insufficient data. sire to remind honourable members of the obligation of this Parliament to South„ Australia in regard to the OodnadattaAlice Springs railway.
