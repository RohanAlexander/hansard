11,Mr Lazzarini (Werriwa) [11.10]. I Shall Show That Such Goods Are In Readi,"his party who wanted to trade with .Germany, 'but that if they wanted to do so he would ho longer be their leader. I -suppose that in a few month's time the long-threatened reconstruction of the Government will come about, and the right honourable member for Bendigo( Mr help to kil l their own industries. The Hughes), if he stands up to his statement of 1918, not made once, but often repeated by him, will no longer be Prime Minister. In order to show that goods are held in readiness to be sent into Australia, and so that the House may know what the people of this country are up against, let me quote a few prices given in Stead's Review for the current month. The following are some of the export, prices of German goods: Pianos, £6 10s. Some honourable members saw German pianos in a shop in Melbourne to-day quoted at £70 and £90. Sewing machines, 18s.; street arc lamps, 10s.; clinical thermometers, Id.; nickel razors, policy of the Government has been purely 4d.; silk neckties, 4£d.; very small stoves, 3d.; tooth-paste, Is. 5d. per dozen; circular Baws, £2 10s.; bread machines, lid.; carpenters' planes, 5s.; best tennis .racquets, 6s.; milling wrote to the Round Table stating that he machines, £70. I am told that circular saws are being sold in Australia to-day up to £70. ar© about to trade with Germany, but, like the.LeadeT of the Opposition ( Mr the ChamberI definitely charge the Charlton), I am not concerned about what is likely to happen in any other country. My sole anxiety is to uphold the economic standard of the Avorkers of Australia. I am dealing with this question merely from the point of view of the serious threat towards the standard O'f life in this young Commonwealth. Germany is to make Australia reparation payments, but, as a matter of fact, we in Australia are to be called upon to pay these amounts ourselves by the operation of imposts upou imported German goods. The German Government, first of all, places a reparation duty on the goods, and when they reach Australia, our Customs Tariff (Industries Preservation) Act will come into operation and impose on them a .fairly high duty, still enabling them to be sold here, the argument being that German goods must be permitted to be so sold, otherwise there will be no possibility of the Germanpeople paying reparation. The consumers of German goods will pay Mr Lazzarini. a reparation duty to the German Government which they in turn will pay to the Allies, and the people of Australia, by the excess prices they will pay for German goods, will help to meet the German reparation payments, and at the same time policy proposed to be pursued will utterly destroy the national organization of their own country. In ten or twelve years the economic and industrial life of Australia, and even of the Empire, will thus be dislocated, if not destroyed, and Germany will emerge, after its reparations have r been paid, the only economically efficient nation of the world. We know that our importers had expensive stocks on hand at the conclusion of the war, and that the Government were obliged to give them time to clear away these stocks before the new policy of trading with Germany came into operation; otherwise Ministers would have struck very hardly at tlieir own friends and supporters. In fact, the in the interests of Flinders-lane and Yorkstreet. An Englishman visiting Germany had been told by large numbers of Germans that their country was a long way We better off by losing the war. Along with other honourable members on this side of Government with having created unemployment for the purpose, of assisting private enterprise and the captains of industry to bring about the white-anting process of unemployment, and thus compel the workers to work longer hours and accept lower wages. During last session the Government callously threw out of employment hundreds of men working at the Small Arms Factory, Lithgow, although! the honourable member for Macquarie ( Mr Nicholls) showed clearly that the factory could be kept going at high pressure with the full comple. ment of employees producing articles of utility. It could have been turning out tools of trade>,kitchen utensils, and postal requirements. But -we) were' told by the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) and by 3 the then Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook), that it was not the policy of the Government to indulge in private trading. Consequently, hundreds of men were thrown out of employment at Lithgow, and after many of them had fonght npon the fields of Flanders. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) last session informed honourable members that if they voted the money he wanted for shipbuilding he would immediately proceed with the construction of two . 12,000-ton merchant steamers at Cockatoo Island. Everything was available at the time to proceed with the work there. The men were ready and anxious to work, the material was available, the machinery was all there. was done. 2,000 to 3,000 had to lose employment because the building of these ships was held up, enabling the Government of the day to assist their friends the financiers and the captains of industry to create an army of unemployed. As opposed to this policy of ""do nothing"" in this country, where we are at least supposed to put consideration for our own people first, nearly £3,250,000 is being spent upon shipping construction in Great Britain. I have no objection to Australia spending money in Great Britain, but I do object to Australian money being spent anywhere outside Australia when it could easily be spent in this country in providing employment for men who are out of work. Another matter for the consideration of honourable'members is the charge made during the recess by the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) that Commonwealth steamers had been sent to Antwerp and India, where cheap labour could be obtained, to be repaired. That charge has not been refuted satisfactorily. for distribution in this country, and by I do not propose to follow the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse) through all his arguments in regard to laying varieties and ncn-laying varieties, but I shall deal with one of his statements in which he advanced the old fallacy that we want new money in Australia. The honourable member spent most of his time in attempting to show honourable members the best method of preventing the operation of that policy. honourable member mean by "" getting new money into Australia?"" Can he point to any occasion on which new money has come to the Commonwealth from another country? prove it to the honourable member would goods, because we should become a credibe too great. member cannot prove that new money has ever come into Australia. He says that we have to increase our exports in order to get more money. Let me point out that, except during the short period of the war, during the last fifty years Australia's exports have always heen greater than the imports, yet we are still a debtor nation, still hundreds of millions of pounds in debt to people 'overseas. What happens when we export £100 worth of goods from this country to any other country? But nothing We do not get cash in return. If we did Employees numbering from so, it would not be much good to us. We are obliged to take goods in return. we would get cash? member for Swan, in saying that we required new money in Australia. member imagine that the honourable member for Swan meant actual cash? member for Fawkner is swinging to the old argument that we want credit. But how much credit do we get when we export £100 worth of goods? First of all, the shipping charges and trader's charges on the other side have to be met, and the primary producer of Australia does not get a ful l £100. But in order to pay for this produce let us say that £100 worth of merchandise has to be imported into Australia. Upon this value shipping and other charges, amounting to, roughly, £15, must be paid before the goods arrive the time the importers, who are mostly agents of British or foreign firms, have taken their profit the value of the goods amounts to fully £200. Thus the primary producer is obliged to pay £200 for the £100 worth of produce he has exported. The only way in which we can get out of this difficulty is to turn Australia from a debtor nation to a creditor nation by What does the manufacturing its own products, keeping here all the profits derivable from that process, and ultimately exporting the manufactured surplus. get in return for our manufactured surplus ? tor nation.",14,Supply Bill No 1 1922 23 Censure Amendment Budget Old Age Into Operation Immediately It Was Passed Pensions Telephone Extensions And Had The Price Of Imported Materials Accommodation Fob Commonwealth Been Kept At The Level Of That Of Local Departments

19,Mr Lazzarini,"We may not wantwe must get goods from overseas. able gentleman is. rushing in too quickly. I contend that we will turn ourselves from a debtor nation to a creditor nation. will be more goods and still more goods imported. As a creditor nation, we can demand them. them if we want them. being a creditor unless one is going to be paid ? millions of pounds for imported goods made from our own originally exported raw material. export and sell our goods in competition with the world when there is such heavy Protection now? or any commodity which we make, if the markets of the world required it . If we withheld our primary products from export aud manufactured them into finished articles here, then if the outside pose to deal with the coal position, as it world required those goods they would be compelled to buy them from us. But while we continue to export-our primary products, and to import finished articles manufactured therefrom, we shall, never be in a .better position than we are in todaya nation of 5,000,000 to 6,000,000 people, and one half of us starving. I wish to refer now to a statement of the Leader of the Country party, the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), which I understand he has repeated several times in different parts of New South Wales. The honourable member said that the standard of life of the Australian people has gradually fallen, that the consumption of meat per head has been considerably reduced. The honourable member's colleague, however, namely, the honourable member for Swan( Mr Prowse), wants the standard to fall still lower. He desires that the economic position of the consumer should be still further considerably reduced by the reduction of wages, and, thus, also the purchasing power of the people. The Leader of the Country party says we must raise the standard of the people in order that they may have the wherewithal to purchase meat. Incidentally, the honourable member points to the lack of the people's ability to purchase necessary supplies of meat as providing one of the reasons for the slump in the meat industry. Tbe honourable member for Swan, however, takes the reverse view. He would create a still lower demand for the commodity iu question, for he holds that we must reduce the economic standard of the people by wholesale reductions of wages. The honourable member for Cowper furgood of ther dealt with the cry that the price of coal must come down. That argument has been heard for a long time; it found expression at the economic conference in Sydney. It is ahout the only proposition that ever comes from the Government and their supporters. We are told over and over again that the only way in which we can reconstruct the economic situation is by forcing the workers to accept less wages. In effect, the Govermnent, and those .who support them, state that the only way by which the capitalistic system can be reconstructed is to force the people back to the conditions of economic slavery which existed in the eighteenth century. I proaffects the workers, by quoting the price of the commodity, covering the output of the various districts in New South Wales, The price of coal hew-n in the northern district is 17s. 6fd. per ton; the price in the southern district is 16s. 6d.; and, in the western district, 12s. 10d., at the pit's mouth. The miner's labour in hewing the coal is the main cost of production; it amounts to 3s. 6d. to 5s. 6d. per ton. The coal is sold at Newcastle for 21s. 9d. per ton, which is equivalent to a profit of 24 per cent. From Newcastle it is shipped to Sydney and sold at from 30s. to 35s.' per ton. Very often it is carried in coastal vessels belonging to the coal-owners themselves; so that, in addition to the profits made directly upon the coal, they "" rake in "" tlie profits on freight. When the coal reaches the consumer it is so l d e r 3s. per cwt., or 60s. per ton. Throughout the processes by which the coal is despatched from the pit's mouth to the consumer, in five out of every six instances, the coal-owners themselves are directly interested. They reap fully two-thirds of the total profits. Yet they say that the miners, who have the worse and the most strenuous feature of",16,Supply Bill No 1 1922 23 Censure Amendment Budget Old Age Into Operation Immediately It Was Passed Pensions Telephone Extensions And Had The Price Of Imported Materials Accommodation Fob Commonwealth Been Kept At The Level Of That Of Local Departments

27,Mr Lazzarini,"We could sell steehthe industry to cope with, namely, the actual hewing, must suffer a reduction of the economic standard. The owners cry, ""Don't touch the profits, but make the miner work the coal for 2s. per ton.''The latest proposition has been to reduce the hewing rate by 33£ per cent -on e shilling in every three earned. Such a policy will never bring about the reconstruction of this country; and, if the workers are expected to accept it, those who fondly look for such an outcome are anticipating more than will be achieved: I wish to deal briefly with an interjection of the Minister for Defence( Mr vernment. He told a deputation, repreGreene) in the course of the remarks of the honourable member for Cowper, having to do with pig iron. The Minister said the great trouble was that the cost of p*ig iron, in Great Britain, was less than ever. Possibly it may be so, but the figures which have been quoted by the honton) are quite opposed to that view. The suspicion still remains iu the minds of honourable members on this side, and of the great majority of the Australian people; that the pig iron is not produced in Great Britain at all. Certainly, if it is, its proto listen to him, or to take up his sugduction is not having the effect of reducing unemployment to any noticeable extent. The fact that,pig iron can be produced more cheaply in foreign countries is an overwhelming ai""gument against the suggestion that reduction of wages will cope with unemployment. As a matter of fact, the industry in Great Britain is languishing, and there is the grave suspicion-to put it mildly-that the pig iron is being imported -into Britain from Germany or Belgium, and is being transhipped as a British product. The honourable member for Cowper stated, with respect to unemployment, that it is the duty of the State Governments to handle this difficult subject. The matter is actually a financial one. State Governments cannot deal with it unless the means are placed in their hands. The Federal Legislature is the only Parliament which can cope effectively with the financial institutions and' the existing financial situation The honourable member for Swan has spoken of men leaving the land for various reasons^ More men have been forced off the land in Australia ister) [11.45] -It is to be regretted that because of the'squeezing tactics of the the Leader of the Opposition, the honorShylock banking' institutions than for any able member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), other reason. During the war the resources of the nation were made available through the Commonwealth Bank in order to pull the Commonwealth out of its difficulties. To-day, however, when we are no longer coping with war conditions, but are reconstructing for peace, the resources of the Commonwealth Bank have dried up; we cannot use them. We were, as a nation, thoroughly financially organized during the war. The resources and functions of the Oommonwealth Bank were used to the utmost, but Sir Denison Miller has now been turned down by the Gosenting the unemployed in Sydney, that he would be prepared to consider the raising of a loan of £2,500,000 to cope with unemployment, provided that he could get the necessary authorization and assistance of the Government. No honourable member and no Minister in this House will sneer at Sir Denison Miller, for he has proved himself a financier of the first' rank. It was he, more than any other individual, who pulled this country through the perils of war-time financing. But the 'Government are not now prepared gestion, or, indeed, to do anything. By introducing a measure the Government could effectually deal with the Shylock banking institutions which are squeezing hundreds and thousands of men from their holdings by foreclosing ou overdrafts, and refusing to advance reasonable credits. I trust honourable members will not misunderstand the position, for this is what is going on in the face of, our economic situation when there are tens of thousands of unemployed, when there are men, women, and little children who do uot know where they can get the next meal, or where they can find a home. The Government, by refusing to use the great powers in their control, thus to endeavour to alleviate the situation, are proving themselves almost destitute of the common instincts of humanity. If we do not quickly cope with the desperate state of affairs by every means in our power the national cancer will spread with dreadful rapidity, and eventually destroy our civilization.",17,Supply Bill No 1 1922 23 Censure Amendment Budget Old Age Into Operation Immediately It Was Passed Pensions Telephone Extensions And Had The Price Of Imported Materials Accommodation Fob Commonwealth Been Kept At The Level Of That Of Local Departments

29,Mr Hughes (Bendigo,"Prime M i nshould have taken the somewhat unusual course of moving an amendment upon a motion relating to Supply when it was opento him to move an. amendment to the Address-in-Reply. Under ordinary circumstances no exception could be taken to the course he has followed, but had he known that it was imperative that Supply should be obtained to-day he might not have taken, it . NothingI have said is to be regarded as by way of censure of what the honourable member has done; I merely point out that it is unfortunate that on an amendment involving questions of such magnitude, the debate must necessarily be restricted by the circumstance that Supply has to be obtained without delay. With these prefatory remarks I plunge into the discussion. The leader of the Opposition has submitted an amendment which, in substance and effect,, is a motion of censure of the Government, and was intended to be regarded as such. It urgesThat tlie Government be . condemned for its callous administration, which has caused dislocation, of industry, intensified unemployment, and created widespread misery and distress. These are very serious charges. Having made them, the honourable member was called upon to prove them; but he has failed to do so. Since, to my own personal knowledge, he is most earnest and sincere in his. desire, to advance the cause of the people, I was expecting to hear from him some clear and 'convincing proof that the Government, by some act which, possibly, had escaped my attention, had done something which had the effect of aiming a blow at the very heart of the Commonwealth. But no such evidence was adduced. The charge is baseless. Why has this motion of censure been moved? The reason is not far to seek. Recent events have placed the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues in a very awkward position. I had better state it. As is well known,, the members of the honourable member's party have been passing through a period of great tribulation and trial. going from bad to worse. Recently they have been in battle, and if all of them do not show upon their unnaturally cheerful countenances to-day the scars of battle, yet all are suffering from tiie strain and shock of conflict. Some of Mr Bughes. their colleagues in New South Wales and Tasmania have fallen by the wayside. There has been a war in New South Wales. trouble in South Australia? honourable member's country in a moment. I am dealing now with what has happened in New South Wales. The tom-toms were beaten; the clans were bidden to. rally, and with sound and fury the hosts met in fearf u l conflict. Eor a long time no one knew who had won. Everybody agreed, however, that it had been a dreadful fight. When at length the lists were issued, and the names of the survivors made known, it was found that members of tlie ""party which the honourable member for Hunter leads had suffered a debacle, and that nothing but proportional representation, had, saved them from utter annihilation. That puts the matter quite fairly. If"" honourable members opposite doubt my statement, let them look at the figures,, OT, still better,. let them search their own consciences. Today they thank Goda very unusual thing, for them to do in these hard times-for the Proportional Representation Act of New South Wales. Then, again, there have been conferences of the Labour party. You, Mr Speaker, despite that air of almost unnatural detachment from the affairs of the world which you affect, must have read of that stirring episode in Sydney. your ruling, Mr Speaker, as to whether a conference held in. New South Wales in connection with the Labour movement, and the result of the recent State elections have anything to do with the amendment before the Chair? son) -A t this stage I am quite unable to say that they have, unless it can be shown that they have some relation to the matter of unemployment or the callous administration or other matters of which complaint is made in the amendment. Does the Prime Minister propose to show that they have? they have a very vital connection, with the amendment. They are, indeed, attached to one another by a tie of almost indecent familiarity.

Several honourable members interjecting, are now breaking another rule, which demands that Mr Speaker shall be heard iu silence-that Avhen Mr Speaker rises, honourable members are not to talk. I have repeatedly called attention to the loud hum of conversation, and I ask honourable members, if they find it necessary to converse, not to do so in a manner which involves discourtesy to the House, or to any honourable member who is addressing the Chair.

That charge is levelled against the GoA ernment by a r party the members -of which now find themselves so situated as to call for the most heroic efforts, and recourse to the. most desperate devices, in order to extricate themselves, and, above all, to divert public attention from their really most deplorable position.

But I ask honourable members to look through the columns of the reports of the proceedings of this conference -whic h is the final arbiter of the Labour party throughout Australia-and see whether there is the faintest hint of any attempt on the .part of that conference to do anything for the unemployed.

The warring factions can never be nnited, and those gentlemen know that very well. But, since they are going to the country-no t because they want to go, but because they must-the y say, "" Let us go as a united body."" Let them do so. Their pretence will deceive no one who does not want to be deceived. But let them not in the mean. while come along with this sickening affectation of concern for the unemployed, when at two conferences they have devoted themselves entirely to washing their dirty linen with complete disregard for -the unemployed. The unemployed men knocked at the door, and they were told to go away, and they may look in vain fornelp from, the party whose chief concern is to hide its leprous sores from the gaze of the public. That is the reason why the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) has moved this motion; i i is ""not moved because they are concerned with . the unemployed, but to divert attention from recent revelations, deeply concerned at the way in which both the unemployed and the employed workers regard them. On every occasion on which they have gone to the country they have been rejected; naturally they feel ib imperative to make some sort' of demonstration in order to divert public attention from facts that are only too obvious. NowI come to the case put forward by the honourable member, and I am sure he knows that I think too highly of him to believe that anything I have said about the conference is applicable to him. If he had control of the conference and of the Labour movement, it would be a movement very-, different from what it . is. be under the impression .that because the Every honourable member opposite knows Anti-Dumping Act was passed last session that to be the case, but I have to deal the Tariff Board was prevented from -with the position which the honourable operating at an earlier date, and that its member has put before the House. His powers are derived from and limited by chief ground of attack was the alleged that statute. But that is not so. The failure of the Grovernment in regard to Tariff Board would have come into existthe anti-dumping legislation. He said ence and its powers would have beeu that if the Government had given that almost co-extensive with the Customs Act early and close attention to anti-dumping itself even if there had been no Australian legislation that he had urged conditions Industries Preservation Acti The Board to-day would be very different. I think does not derive its greatest powers from the honourable member is under a comThese breaches can no plete misapprenension as to the facts. When he sought to put this problem of unemployment, the greatest of all industrial questions, upon the tiny pedestal of the anti-dumping law, he belittled it. He endeavoured to make what is a world-wide problem something peculiar to this country and due to the lax administration of a certain statute. I ' do not hesitate to say that if all the statutes in the world were gathered, together and placed in charge of a man, who should be the man of all the ages, still they and he would fail to cope effectively with the unemployed question. However, the honourable member has sought to place this problem upon that ground, and there I must deal with it. I repeat that he seems to be entirely under a misapprehension. He says thai; the Tariff Board, for example, has done nothing, that it is waiting upon the suggestion of the Minister, and can do nothing on its own initiative, that it has done uothing, and that although he is unable to prove that goods are reaching Australia from Germany he believes they are; in short, he says that owing to the lax administration and dilatory methods of the and because they are Government unemployment exists which, had we acted in a different way, would not have existed. Then he and his colleagues say that we are partners in a diabolical conspiracy to create unemployment. I give such a charge the only rejoinder that it deservesI say that it is an infamous lie,. and well they who make such a charge know that it is so. They surely cannot mean that I and my colleagues are partners in a conspiracy to create unemployment! Our record and the circumstances under which we hold office, those evidences of. the confidence, of the public in our administration are a complete answer to such a charge. The Leader of the Opposition Beems to that statute; it derives them from the enumerated, the Board has other powers Tariff Board Act. And they are very to which I have referred the Leader of great powers. Whilst the Board does the Opposition, and which I will not rederive authority and power from capitulate.

52,Mr Hughes,"I come now to what waywas in 1914, it is obviously impossible by any law or by any Tariff-excep t by downright prohibitionto protect local industries against such a set of conditions. I think, however, that these gentlemen do not quite understand the position. Those who imagine that the cost of production in Germany is determined by the depreciation of the mark fail to understand the basic principles of economics. The cost of production is determined by the cost of the labourer, who produces, plus, of course, the overhead charges, &c, of the machinery the labourer uses, and the cost of the labourer is determined by the cost of his food. Now, it is self-evident that the German workman cannot live on one-seventieth of what he did in 1914. , moment that one could purchase commodities in Germany at one-seventieth of the price they were in 1914 is on the face of it absurd. It will be found, I think, upon a general review of the whole situation that the people in Germany cannot produce goods except in very special circumstances and for specialized purposes at very much less than they can in Great Britain, and I intend to prove it. At any rate, if they do produce them cheaper it is only because the workmen eat less, wear cheaper clothes, and, in short, have a lower standard of comfort than that prevailing in the Commonwealth or in Britain. It has little or nothing to do with the depreciation of the mark. our sovereign to the value of one farthing the miners in Newcastle, for instance, would want just as much to eat, and the price of whatever they con. sumed and the value of the clothes they wore would determine the price of coal. I am not for a moment saying that these problems are not complex and difficult to understand, quite apart from the problem of unravelling the riddle of the exchanges. I know that that, of itself, has a profound effect; but it is not the foundation of the problem. It has been said by the Leader of the Opposition that the German competition is such that the British steel manufacturer is buying blooms, bars, and billets from the German steel master-the honourable member will correct me if I am misquoting himand is working them up into manufactured goods for sale in Australia. The Tariff Board is charged with being lax in the performance of its work, and with being hampered by the failure of the Minister for Trade and Customs to direct it . That is not so. It has been unceasingly vigilant in the performance of its duties, and watchful in the interests of the industries of the Commonwealth. Nor is it true that the British iron-master is buying German bars, blooms, and billets and working them up into steel and sending them out here. For the information of honourable members-1 shall read some of the reports received from Great Britain weekly or fortnightly from representatives of the largest firms of steel and iron workers in the United Kingdom. The first is dated 7th December. 1921, and the To say for one last 23rd March, 1922. They are as follow :7th December, 1921 --German deliveries, as we hare already advised you, are very bad, and numerous strikes caused by workers' demands for advances to meet the dwindling Mark, has made conditions of delivery worse than ever. German sellers of fuel and semimanufactured products are not fulfilling their engagements to French and Belgian manufacturers, consequently the deliveries in these two countries are also getting very unsatisfactory. English prices are becoming more competitive, and we may say we ourselves have had the price of £8 10s., less l i per cent., quoted for British steel joists. 11th January, 1922 -Many"" German sellers are months behind hand with delivery, and there seems to be a chronic coke and fuel shortage in France, Belgium, and Luxemberg, partly due to non-delivery by Germany of coke. If we were to reduce Continental prices are fairly steady, not s fluctuating more than a few shillings a ton either way, according to whether or not sellers want orders. English prices are still tending downwards. We have been quoted £16 10s. per ton f.o.b. for galvanized corrugated sheets. English joists -We are told sales have been made at £S per ton f.o.b., but we have been quoted ourselves £8 6s., less l i per cent. 2nd February, 1922 -German prices get less and less competitive, their deliveries worse,. SeriouB steps towards deflation and towards proper taxation of the German people are overdue, and these must increase their costs. Belgian, French, and Luxemburg prices are rather firmer than when we last wrote. 3rd March, 1922 -We should say that Continental prices are a little firmer, though all the Continental countries are in such a hopeless mess with deliveries that it is hardly safe to buy anything. Pig-iron prices in this country have reached a figure which must be nearly, if not, the bottom. Cleveland No. 3 being £4 10s., and Scotch Foundry No. 3 about £5 f.o.b. 23rd March, 1922 -As a matter of fact, Continental prices are, in a number of cases, higher than English prices For instance, this week we have bought a parcel of black hoops in England at a price 30s. per ton below thc lowest Belgian prices we had. Furthermore, we hear that Continental works are now coming to this country for billets, bars, &c. Those facts speak for themselves. well in Great Britain, how does it come about that the furnaces are closed down, and there are large numbers of unemployed in that country? bers of unemployed there for very many reasons. One reason is because orders cannot be got at any price. But one thing is clear, British competition is becoming more keen, and the cost of production has been so greatly reduced that there are Continentalbuyers of British bars, billets, and blooms. I am dealing now with that part of the honourable member's charge which dealt with German trade and the Anti-Dumping Act, and I am endeavouring to state the position as I see it . I agree entirely with those who say that the question of employment is the greatest question of all, and I want to deal with it fairly. I am dealing with German trade, and I speak as one who has, perhaps, been as bitter an enemy of Germany as any other person in this country. I am still opposed to the resumption of German trade. Speaking as an individual, I say to this House now, that it has only to declare ""We will have no German trade,"" and, at any rate, it will not find an opponent in me. I am trying to get at the facts and to set them up before honourable members. ' The statements I have read are facts, and I think the House may take them for granted. They are made by, perhaps, the largest firm in Great Britain, and one that is in daily touch with Continentalconditions. When Germany, and other Continental buyers come to Great Britain to buy bars, blooms, and billets, it tells the very opposite story from that which we heard just now from the lips of my friend the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). The question of unemployment is one that cannot be solved by scratching on the surface and talking of German or English competition. If we are to deal with this question thoroughly we must go fathoms and fathoms below that. I am trying to deal with it on the level on which the honourable gentleman chose to launch his attack I come now to deal with the position in Australia, as it is affected by the position in Europe. As is well known there are', in the constituency represented by the honkins), large numbers of men, amounting to thousands, out of. employment. The iron and steel industries are the foundations of industry generally; when the .. workers in them are out of employment, other industries are affected. Why are the steel works closed down ? This morning .the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini) made a most amazing suggestion. He said that the Government ought to guarantee the banks a loan of £2,500,000, or some other number of millions, and that then somehow or other the works would start again. .Of course, they would, so long as this £2,500;000lasted, but such statements as those show such an abyssmal ignorance of the great basic principles of economics as to make one almost weep. 'Let us run the thing to earth. For all practical purposes in this country we have an inconvertible note issue, and we have a printing press. All we have to do is to put another shift of printers on, and we can keep these works going for ever! That is what they have done in Russia, and now I am coming nearer the home of the honourable member for Barrier (i Mr Considine). That action has not solved the problem in Russia. So far from providing a solution it has intensified the difficulty to an extent that stands unparalleled in the history of the. ancient or modern world. I come back again to the question, "" Why are the men in the steel works at Newcastle unemployed?"" The answer is set out at some length . in a statement that I made before the Economic Conference held in Sydney some two or three months ago. The Government, so far from callously and deliberately creating unemployment, were the first representative body to try to ward off a catastrophe which was then impending. I called that Conference to prevent the calamity which has now overtaken the steel and iron industry. I set out the case quite clearly. I invited the unions, including representatives of the steel workers, to meet the employers. The steel workers' representatives wanted to come, but they were not permitted by the Australian",23,Supply Bill No 1 1922 23 Censure Amendment Budget Old Age Into Operation Immediately It Was Passed Pensions Telephone Extensions And Had The Price Of Imported Materials Accommodation Fob Commonwealth Been Kept At The Level Of That Of Local Departments

55,Orable Member For Newcastle ( Mr Wat,"Workers' Union, by which they are now absorbed. Union, which has become the One Big Union, would not let them attend. So a Conference called td deal with a question which was a matter of life and death to them, had to be considered in their ab. sence. From the printed report of the Conference, which was held in Sydney on 22nd February last, it will be seen that I made the following statement:Do you admit that there ia a problem, or doyou say that there is none, and that all that is needed is to do nothing, and that the community will have to go on on your terms -whatever they are? Buti t is impossible to go on producing goods at a higher cost than you can sell them for. Perhaps you do not realize, or some of you do not, how utterly futile it is to speak of maintaining a standard of Australian wages under circumstances such as I hove indicated. If we get . a high rate of wages in this country-and tliat high rate of wages has been established for some years-it is because oE the amount of wealth which we have produced. Now, wealth does not flow naturally and inevitably from labour. Men may labour and produce no wealth. If men produce an article at a production cost of 27s. 6(1., and it cannot be sold for more than £1, that is not producing wealth. It is dissipating wealth. If you produce a ton of steel at £25, and it can be sold, for only £10, that is not producing wealth, but losing wealth, and the community would be better if you were'idle and it kept its money in its pocket. It is not pro'ducing wealth to bring a ton of lead to the surface at a cost of £25 when you can sell it only for £19. Therefore, labour must, in order to produce wealth that will enable a high standard of living to be enjoyed in this country, conduct its'industrial operations in such a way as to leave a margin over and above the cost of production.. In those industries which I have indicated, it does not do that now. A high standard of living is only possible in this country so-kmg as those fundamental economic laws which I have just outlined are observed. To speak about the Australian standard of living being in danger because a Conference is failed to consider the causes of unemployment, shows to what lengths men will go. The only danger the standard of living is in is tbe continuance of the present position: producing goods that cannot be sold at a profit. Why are men unemployed? If a resolution would put them in work, there would be no lack ol employment. If the award of a Court could not only prescribe the amount of wages they were to get, but actually see that they got those wages, there would be no unemployment and no distress, and there need be no labour. The position, however, is far other. unions, combinations of employers-non e of these affects the question at all. Nor does it matter how much labour you put into a thing. The question is, ""How much value do you create?"" The Conference sat for some days. ConThe' Australian Workers siderable publicity was given to the proceedings, and at length the parties came forward with their respective remedies. It is useless for honourable members to attempt to dissociate themselves from, the remedies put forward by the 'respective sides. Whether the remedies put forward by the employers meet entirely with the views of honourable members on my side of the House or not, they have to take a certain amount of responsibility for them. As tb the views put forward by the employees' representatives, all I can say is that, since those views were put forward by the gentlemen who were representing them at the Conference, they must take the entire responsibility. The employers' representatives accepted the standard of living now existing, and statedThe standard of living accepted in Australia as necessary and proper can only be impaired hy diminished production, whether this be the result of lessened effort, obsolete methods, or unemployment arising out of foreign competition or industrial disputes. That means that the only remedy is for men to produce an article that can be sold at a market price that leaves a margin over the cost of production. I now turn to what my friends on the other side said. So far from hinting for one moment that the Australian Industries Preservation Act or the Anti-Dumping Act had anything to do with the situation, no mention was made of the Tariff from beginning to end. the men at that Conference to have the same knowledge as we have of our legislation, did you? ber should not denounce his-leaders in that way. If he contends that they were ignorant of those Acts, I say nothing; but it is obvious that they had'' a right to be present as the representatives of Labour. Messrs. Willis, Howie, and Voigt were there. These are the men making the laws under which honourable members opposite have to live! They understood the position quite well. They Court3, did not fall into the error of supposing that the cause of unemployment was the Anti-Dumping Act. The anti-dumping laws have nothing to do with the bringing about of unemployment. If so, what about the unemployment in",25,Supply Bill No 1 1922 23 Censure Amendment Budget Old Age Into Operation Immediately It Was Passed Pensions Telephone Extensions And Had The Price Of Imported Materials Accommodation Fob Commonwealth Been Kept At The Level Of That Of Local Departments

57,Mr Hughes,"The honourable memEussia, Germany, Erance, and America? Does any honourable member say that there is dumping in America? How ridiculous! The representatives of the unions at the Conference went to the root of the matter. was no half-and-half one. They declared that "" Only the socialization of industry, with workers' control, offers a solution for the impending collapse of industry."" .Here is the Brisbane objective! I shall not go on to elaborate the matter, but that is the remedy which those who now control the Labour movement put forward. Honourable members opposite may say what they like, bub they are flies in a spider's web. their wings as much as they like, but they cannot move. members to follow the statement of the representatives of the employees at the Economic Conference. to listen to our honourable friends opposite, but to those who are controlling them, and this is their remedy1. No reduction of wages or lengthening of hours. 2. Adequate unemployment insurance as a legitimate risk of, and charge upon, industry. 3. Effective share by the workers in the control of industry. .The Joint Gommission would require to draft concrete proposals for:1. The institution of a national credit system to provide for the continuous needs of industry. Talk about a dog -watch-if they kept the printing press going with three shifts it woidd hardly meet their demands. 2. The adoption of methods for the maintenance of production and distribution at a high level. 3. The elimination of non-essential' distributive costs. 4. The amalgamation, centralizing, . and pooling of industrial concerns where practicable. 5. The establishment of comprehensive developmental schemes, such as electrification, railways, roads, sewerage, and land settlement for the absorption of the unemployed and the development of industry. Coincident with the establishment of the foregoing Joint Commission, an effective inquiry should be undertaken by the Commonwealth Government into the productive capacity . of the nation. This last paragraph is a sort of benediction and "" Amen"" is the only word necessary to complete the analogy. their remedy-the try. posite are up against is that the great mass of unemployment Mr Hughes. arises from the closing down of the steel works. This matter so f a r from being new is very old. The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) came to see me about it in November last. On 24th They set out their remedy. It of November he introduced to me a deputation that covered the whole ground. The members of the deputation set out their position, which even then was desperate. When I had heard their story, I found that it made out a case which no legislation could affect. Members of the deputation referred to the position in the United Kingdom, in the United States of America, and in Australia w i th regard to wages on the basis of eight They may flap hours per day. They explained that the wages of founders in the UnitedI want honourable Kingdom were 13s. l ^ d . , in the United States of America. 16s. 2d., and in Australia 19s. 4d. The wages of furnace They are not hands were in the United Kingdom 12s. 6d., in the United States of America 12s. I d . , ' a n d in Australia 17s. 2 d . : and the wages of fitters and turners were in the United Kingdom 12s. l i d . , in the United States of America 19s. 6d., and in Australia 23s. They showed in short that wages here are such that it was impossible for Australian manufacturers to compete. Mr Hoskins plainly said that for unskilled labour, he had to pay 2s. per hour for what Is. was paid in Pittsburg, in the United States of America, the country which boasts of paying the highest wages in the world. So when we are told that there must be no reduction in wages, and that the steel works must go on, all I have to say is that if our friends apply that to the circumstances of the primary industries they will arrive at a position which will result in one of two things. They will either destroy this country utterly or else w ill enable the primary producer to ichaxge what he likes for producing an article, and enforce that cost of production plus a margin for profit upon the people willy nilly . If it costs 5s. to produce a bushel of wheat if the producer works fro m dawn t ill night, and it costs 7s. per bushel if he works only the eight hours, and 10s. per bushel if he works only eight hours . and works. as slowly as he can, then no matter what the price of That is wheat in other countries, the people socialization of indusof tbe country must pay 10s. or What my honourable friends op20s. per bushel plus a living profit for the producers. It is a poor cock that in this country will not fight both ways. That is the position which our friends are taking tip, and it is untenable. If they had the socialization of industry to-morrow, if they had realized the Brisbane objective, against which they are fighting so desperately, but so hopelessly, the law would still obtain that you cannot get more out of an industry than you put into it. Yet that is what our friends are trying to do. Mr Menzies and Mr Hoskins, speaking on behalf of the employers, said that unless there was a reduction in wages and the price of coal they could not carry on. I said to them on the 24th NovemberThe Government proposes to enact anti-dumping legislation before the session closes, but nothing of that kind will meet the situation in the face of the figures which Mr of 153 per cent. Menzies has quoted. They should be written in letters of fire and held up before everybody in the country, particularly the industrial classes, both employers and employees. How can you expect to compete and hold the market when you are paying 50 per cent, and, in some cases, 100 per cent, more to produce an article than your competitor, and when one of your competitors is the highest paid labour country in the world, a country which has always boasted that its workers are paid the highest wages in the world? . . . I do not hesitate to say that there is only one real solution of this problem, and that"" is by facing the fact that if you cannot produce an article at a price which will enable yon to justify your existence as a competitor against the products of your competitors you cannot live. To encourage an industry is one thing, but to create such artificial conditions as to make your industry nearly a hot-house exotic is another. Those words are true to-day, and abundant proof is now furnished us that there is no way of saving this industry, but that which I have indicated. I will deal now with the price of coal. I say that the price of coal has to come down. My honourable friends opposite have endeavoured to make out that coal is cheaper here than it is in the United Kingdom. They say that the price is 21s. 9d. per ton here, and in England 23s. per ton. There is nothing so dangerous as a half-truth. Let me tell honourable members the facts. It is perfectly true that we produce best coal more cheaply than it is produced in England, but we do not produce the coal which is used to make coke, and so to make steel more cheaply than in England. We produce this coal at a higher price, and this is the trouble. friends opposite speak of coal they do not refer to the coal which makers of steel use in England, but coal which they do not use. The trouble has arisen in this way: In England a sufficiency of small coal, out of which coke is made, is available at small-coal prices, and, therefore, the English steel master gets his raw material at a price that enables him to produce coke considerably cheaper than is possible in Australia. The price of small coal in the Commonwealth is relatively higher than the price of large coal, and there is not enough of it, so the steel manufacturer is obliged to buy some large coal, which has increased in price from l is . per ton to21s. 9d. per ton, approximately 100 per cent., while the price of small coal has increased from 7s. to 17s. 9d., an increase ter tell us what is the price of the English small -coal? He has not inenti&ned that ' fact yet. Newcastle Steel Works, manufactured in up-to-date ovens, in 1921 was 37s. 4d. per ton, as compared with 22s. 6d. per ton in England and 13s. l i d . in the United States of America. question I asked. You are making a comparison of small coal prices, and declaring that small coal is cheaper in England than in New South Wales. I want to know the English price for this small coal. have the figures the honourable member asks for, but I shall obtain them in the luncheon hour. I am giving the price of the raw material, out of which the coke is manufactured. WhatI have said demonstrates amply that it is most misleading to say that the cost of coal to the steel works in Australia is lower than in the United Kingdom. As a matter of fact, it is very much higher. It is as 37s. 4d. is to 22s. 6d., or as compared with the price paid by our other competitor, America, it is as 37s. 4d. is to 13s. l i d . AndI understand that 3 tons of coal are required to make one ton of pig iron. These figures satisfactorily dispose of the statement . made by honourable members opposite as to the cost of the raw material in this country. In some figures issued by the When our honourable Broken Hill Proprietary Companyi t is stated that twelve months ago' between 5,000 and 6,000 men and officers"" were",26,Supply Bill No 1 1922 23 Censure Amendment Budget Old Age Into Operation Immediately It Was Passed Pensions Telephone Extensions And Had The Price Of Imported Materials Accommodation Fob Commonwealth Been Kept At The Level Of That Of Local Departments

61,Mr Hughes,"I do not know that Iemployed at the steel works, as compared with only 840 at the present time, and the chief reason given is the high pride of coal, high wages, and the hours worked. Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. the position. The conditions at Newcastle to-day are not in any way due to importation which the anti-dumping legislation was designed to prevent. There have been no importations of iron and steel from Germany, cither directly -or indirectly; the material which has come into competition with the output of the steel works of Newcastle has been imported from Great Britain, America, and Belgium. In Belgium there is the greatest difficulty in obtaining coke, which is essential to the production of steel; indeed c6ntinental steel makers are buying billets, bars, and blooms in England,' where they can be produced more cheaply than in Germany. It cannot be suggested that the iron and steel which has come here of late from America has been German in its origin. Unemployment is at present a world-wide phenomenon, manifesting itself in its greatest intensity in Great Britain, America, and the European countries from which it is alleged that competition in iron and steel is most to be feared. The state of affairs in Newcastle, as is only too obvious, is due to the rates of wages, hours of work, and output of workmen, which must all be adjusted to world conditions, that being the only remedy. These matters were discussed at length at the Economic Conference held in Sydney in February last, when the only suggestions made by the representatives of the employees were such as would have revolutionized society, and brought about conditions analogous to those which have existed in Russia since 1918, producing there a state of absolute economical chaos. happened in Russia .affords <a glaring example of the course not to follow, but I it is that example which we are adjured 1 to follow by those who speak with I authority on behalf of Labour. In Australia unemployment is most prevalent in the two States that have enjoyed the doubtful benefits of Labour rule during the pas* few yearsi-Queenslan d and New South Wales. It will not be contended that the Government which has just come into office in New South Wales is responsible for the unemployment in that State, because that Government has been in power only a few weeks, and the conditions which exist in the State were deliberately created by the Labour Adis ministration which it displaced. In au article on unemployment published in the Brisbane Daily Mail of 24th January last, under the caption "" A disgrace to the State,"" the, percentages of unemployment in the various States are set out as follows:-Ne w South Wales, 13.5 per cent.; Victoria, 9.8 per cent.; Queensland, 21.8 per cent.; South Australia, 9.1 per cent.; Western Australia, 8.3 per cent.; and Tasmania, 10.3 per cent. Those figures speak for themselves. It was stated in the Sydney Morning Herald of 20th February last that the Bureau registration of unemployed men at the end of January numbered 13,000, showing that the unemployment of New Soutli Wales then was in excess of that in the other States, both relatively and in actual numbers. These facts and the remedies suggested by the representatives of Labour furnish a complete and crushing answer to what has been said by the Leader of the Opposition on the subject. The honourable member said further that this Government has deliberately created unemployment by stopping shipbuilding. That statement is quite contrary to fact. The work of, constructing the 12,500-ton ships has proceeded continuously since Parliament authorized the expenditure on. them. During a period of about six weeks the work of constructing the hulls was eased up slightly, pending a decision whether the vessels were to be constructed to carry passengers or be purely cargo vessels, but at no time was work actually stopped. The position in regard to the first ship What has is that about 2,000 tons of steel work for the hull have been prepared, half of which is in position; that 70 per cent, of the main engines of the first ship have been completed, and 40 per cent, of those of the second. Of the boilers, one has been water tested,and passed by Lloyd's; the remaining five are 70 per cent, complete. The boilers for the second ship are in hand, and the boiler shop is taxed to its f u l l capacity at present.

64,Mr Hughes,"I come now to thew i th the .Western Australian Government is for that purpose. ence to this matter, I have an extract from a statement made by me in October, 1921, when I said:As for the yearly introduction of 100,000 immigrants to Australia, this, no doubt, represented an ideal; but the possibilities of realizing this ideal require careful consideration. The practical position was that between 12,000 and 20,000 immigrants would represent the influx into this country this year. The idea of bringing 100,000 immigrants was absurd, unless, and until adequate arrangements could be made for this absorption. As things were at present, no such arrangements existed, and he would take' an early opportunity to set out the policy of the Ministry in regard to immigration as a practical question. Until then, the position is as I have indicated. Much as I recognise the necessity for peopling Australia, it would be crass folly to attempt to bring population into a country without making such arrangements for their settlement upon the land as would make them wealth producers, rather than allowing them to congest still further the already overcrowded cities. That statement is again an answer to honourable members' assertions. Mr Gullett, with whom I had some discussion in the press, criticised me in the Age of 2nd March, 1922, in the following words:By a close detailed study of the industrial position, sound openings could have been found for a number of specialists unavailable in Australia; the nominations could have been substantially increased; and by a special effort, some thousands of domestic servants might have been gained. Mr Hughes, however, was adamant in his attitude against the introduction of domestic servants, giving me as his reason that it would be better "" for the women of Australia if they had more work to do.""' I quote this to emphasize the fact that, in my opinion, my attitude has always been against bringing people to this country tb put them in the cities. I have set myself resolutely against bringing people to Australia unless they can go on the land. The Government stand or f a l l upon that policy. Tbey w ill not bring people here to put them in the cities. Extension' of time granted. NowI propose to deal with this question of immigration in a general way. The statements made by honourable members opposite are completely opposed to the facts. The total number of arrivals of State-assisted immigrants during 1920, when the States controlled recruiting and the shipping of emigrants, was 9,669. The total of arrivals during 1921, when the first party of immigrants sent out by Mr Bughes. the Commonwealth arrived during A p r i l In further referof athat year, was 14,677. The total of arrivals expected during 1922, based upon the present monthly average, is 24,652. -These are the facts; they speak for themselves. The total number of persons who arrived in Australia in 1921 was 87,938, and the total number of those who departed was 72,149, leaving a balance of arrivals over departures of only 15,000. These statistics reveal conclusively that unemployment has not been caused by immigration. I have demonstrated that unemployment has had nothing whatever to do w i th the Industries Preservation measure; that there have been no impqrtations from Germany. As to the remedy for unemployment it is as I set it out to the Economic Conference. The workers of this country w ill have to adjust themselves to present world conditions. I say this with all the emphasis at my command. We stand by the maintenance of the present standard of living. But there is no way by which that standard can be maintained except by greater output and production upon an economic basis. Those are responsible for unemployment who are giving to the workers counsels of despair and destruction; who are telling them t h a t by doles, by a system of .subsidizing the steel works w it h a grant of £2,000,000, unemploymentwhich is a world-wide phenomenon and has resisted doles to the extent of £200,000,000 a year in England a l o n e can be alleviated. Doles w ill not solve the problem. Nor will subsidies. There is only one means of solution. We are only a unit in the community'of nations, and we must depend upon world conditions. We must produce on economic lines. We can do it . . We can produce wealth in abundance, and so maintain our standard of living. But there is no other way by which we can solve this problem. We must produce more wealth, for it is not by going slow, but by going fast, that we shall be saved. Before, concluding, I desire to furnish the honourable member for Hunter with particulars which I promised regarding the price of coal in Great Britain. They are as follow:Price of coal delivered at British steel worksWelsh, large.22s., small 13s. per ton; Scotch, 16s. and 12s.; Midlands, 25s. and 15s.; Tyne, 17s. and 15s. Belgian steel works are mostly using Tyne coal, costing 2Cs. c.i.f., plus transportation from wharf to steel works. The Iron and Coal Trades Review of 28th April, 1022, gives the following prices as at that date:.Leeds, washed coking smalls, 9s. to 13s. per ton; non-coking smalls, 7s. to 9s. Sheffield, smalls, from 2s. Cd. to 6s. 6d. per ton. Cannock, rough slack, 9s. to 10s.; fine slack, 5s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. North Staffordshire, rough slack, ns. 6d. to 16s.: fine slack, 2s. 6d. to 4s. Nottinghamshire, smalls, 2s. 6d. to 6s. 6d. ruling at the pit's mouth or at the steel works ? figures have to do w it h quotations at the pit's mouth. But I point out that no steel works in the world are more advantageously situated than those at Newcastle. To all intents and purposes they are at the pit's mouth. If those works cannot continue to compete w i th oversea competition, the f a u l t clearly lies, not in any difficulty created by geographical position, and is not owing to the cost of transportation, hut lies with the cost of production. Moreover, it is not large coal, but small coal which is available and used by these works; and, as I have just quoted, the price of the small Welsh coal is 13s. per ton, and of M i d lands and Tyne coal, 15s. per ton. That is the English cost, as against 21s. 9d. per ton here. 'There are 3 tons of coal to 1 ton of coke, which fact accounts for the great difference in the price of coke, and, therefore, of the price of steel. paid at the Newcastle steel works, taking the small coal, runs out at 19s. I d . per ton. be compared w it h the Welsh and English prices respectively of 13s. and 15s. per ton. Honourable members opposite have talked about a deliberate attempt on the part of the Government to create unemployment. liberate attempt the accusation cannot be levelled at the Government, but at the men who support honourable members opposite. Yesterday the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Mahony) asked me what was the cost of those magnificent new "" Bay"" liners, and I gave him the figures. What is the position to-day ? How do unemployed seamen treat these magnificent vessels, which belong to the people? How, indeed, have they treated [7] each of the units of that fleet as it has come out here ? Each has been held up by the Seamen's Union, which is now -hopelessly bound in the coils of the Soviet organization which controls it . An attempt is made in sections of the press only this morning to convince the public that the present state of affairs is the outcome of the mere application of the rules of the union itself. I do not hesitate to say -and the proof is at hand-that not one vessel has departed from our ports, prior to the ""Bay'.' steamers calling here, which I assume that these has not had two or three men placed on board by this organization; men who are Communists, Bolshevists, members of the Soviet, whose business it has been to see that only those who worship at the Soviet shrine should be allowed to remain in the services of the Commonwealth Line. The trouble has been, not that there has not been an abundance of union labour available, but that no unionisthas been permitted to go on board unless and u n t il he has bowed the knee to Walsh's Baal. The Commonwealth Line of steamers was asked to place a man on board the Moreton Bay, who was a notorious member of the Industrial Workers of the World, a spy, a go-between, an agent of tbe Soviet. He is a fool who shuts his eyes to' plain facts to-day, whosays there are no agents of the Sovieti n this country. The Bolshevic Communists Oif whom I am speaking rejoice in the fact that they have agents in this country. But we know them. We will not allow them to . dictate to . . us. We will decide, and not they. The whole of the people of this country, through their representatives in the Federal Legislature, w ill decide who shall man these vessels. We w ill not employ men who are put on board to carry out the behests of the Communist party in this country. The Leader of the Opposition says there is a plot! Yes, there is ; If there has been a debut it is a plot hatched by the Communists, who desire unemployment in order that their wild schemes may be acceptable to the mass of the people. They have created unemployment amongst our seamen, our waterside workers, our carters, 'and others; there are from 800 to 1,000 seamen idle today because of the plotters' machinations.

I tell those men that unless they are able to bring their in fluence to bear upon the members of the Seamen's Union, the Commonwealth Governmenb will nob go on building ships. We will not build ships and throw our money into tlie sea. We w ill not be made the mere tools of an arrogant and ambitious minority in this country. The Government are in an unassailable position. They have clone everything in their power to create conditions which would permit of employment. The Government called a Conference months ago, in Sydney, with a view to settling this whole question. It is a fundamental one, and the Government addressed themselves to it with a f u l l appreciation of its seriousness. The Government wasted no time in talking about anti-dumping legislation, but got right down to bed-rock. I would rather follow a man there, no matter where it might be taking me, and particularly in respect of this greatest of all problems to-day, than pursue any other course. Honourable members opposite have put their case for reasons which are perfectly plain. Their proposed remedy is one which, if it were accepted, would bring about a state of affairs in this country analogous to that existing in Russia. Honourable members opposite, and they alone, are responsible for very much of the unemployment in Australia at present. Until the workers recognise world conditions, and are prepared to adjust themselves to them, there w ill be no hope of abolishing unemployment. The standard of living must remain, but the maintenance of the standard of livin g depends upon the production of abundant wealth. That is the first and last lesson which I wish to impress on the workers. have their destiny in their own hands. If they w ill produce wealth in abundance they w ill live like kings. But they cannot maintain their high standard of living by tactics of the kind to which I have referred, by strikes, by going slow, by passing resolutions here or in the Conference down the street, or by any other of those means to which uhey have recourse from time to time. , Mr Hughes. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) has absolutely failed to answer any of the arguments put forward by th© Leader of the Opposition in support of the amendment moved by him. The first part of the right honourable gentleman's address was pure camouflage. By endeavouring to show that certain Labour conferences held in different State capitals lhad put forward no solution of the unemployed problem, he sought to divert the attention of honourable members and the public generally from the real issues which this censure mobion raises. The amendment attacks the Government for its lax administration, the callousness of which, to a large extent, has resulted in the present condition of unemployment. The Prime Minister probably was not here last' session when we dealt with the Tariff, and with the anti-dumping legislation. The dangers to which our industries would be exposed were then fully put before the House. To-day the right honourable gentleman complains of our action in attacking the Government in connection with a motion for Supply, which, he says, must be dealt with to-day. With whom does the fault lie? Was it not the duty of the Government to see that Parliament met in time to enable Supply to be obtained some days before it was required ? Instead of doing so they refrained from calling us together until the Supply granted had almost expired. In the circumstances why should the Government blame us for challenging, at this juncture, certain of their administrative acts of which we have such good reason to complain? Having endeavoured to camouflage tbe real issue the Prime Minister then tried to belittle the seriousness of the situation as revealed by us. It ill becomes him of all men to refer in sneering terms to the present unemployment in Australia. The situation to-day 'is worse than it has been at any other period Theyv it h in my recollection. Unemployment, to the Prime Minister however, is merely a matter for merriment. years since he was unemployed. the right honourable gentleman would dismiss by a mere wave of the hand the whole question of unemployment.

I hope to show before I resume my seat that the workers of this country have followed his advice only to find that under the administration of the present Government they have apparently produced too much since the market for their output is overcrowded. As to the coal trade, the Government properly took control during the war period, and placed an embargo on the export of one class. The idea was that the Australian market had to be supplied with this class of coal, while other classes stopped, the foreign trade was cut off, and of coal might be sent abroad. Later on, when prices became inflated abroad, somebody "" got to work,"" and an embargo was placed on the export of all classes of coal, resulting in the disorganization of the whole trade. abroad, all classes of coal are required in take a year or two, under the most favorAustralia; but the Government, instead of simply placing officers in charge to see that Australia's needs were supplied first, and those concerned allowed to look after their foreign contracts as best they could with their surplus coal, adopted a bungling system and ruined the foreign trade of Newcastle.

The trouble is that the honourable member dees not understand how the embargo worked. was placed on the Maitland coal because it was said to be wanted for Australia, and the Government placed officers at Newcastle in order to see that no such coal was exported. The other coal was allowed to be exported, but when the demand for coal outside became greater, and prices rose, some pressure was brought to bear in order that the exporters of Maitland coal might reap some of the advantages of the position. Instead of removing the embargo on the Maitland coal, the Government placed an embargo on the other class of coal as well. control, and it was the only way in which control could be exercised. was that the price of coal fell outside, while the price of Australian coal did not f a l l with it . much later. The Minister is evidently unaware of what was happening at that time a.t the port of Newcastle. Never while this embargo was on either class of coal could anybody at Newcastle complete a contract or order from abroad, simply because there was no certainty that the coal could be exported. That is what has ruined the coal trade at Newcastle; it was net the price of coal, because, contrary to what the Minister would have us understand, the price was good in the Australian markets. The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) today made some reference to the anti-dumping legislation, and pointed out that the Government have appointed the Tariff Board to thoroughly examine into rhe condition of industries throughout was Australia.

My The trouble understanding is that Ave passed that legislation to protect our industries against importations from any country if it could be proved that such importaT h a t came about tions Avould be prejudicial to Australian interests; the Act did not apply to Germany more than to any other country.

108,Mr Watkins,"It has had thatabout Australia seeking orders for steel to be delivered in 1922 without quoting any definite price, but giving an undertaking that the price would be below the Australian price, whatever it might be. Yet after all the acrimonious discussion in this House regarding the Tariff, the anti-dumping legislation' and the Tariff' Board Act, the Government allowed six months to elapse before appointing the Board, and even to date no big question has been decided by the Board or referred to the Minister or this Parliament. Honourable members will recollect that during the discussion upon the proposed higher duties to be levied upon iron and steel, Sir Joseph Cook, who was then in charge of the House, in order to expedite the passage of the Tariff, stated that the Government and Parliament Avould see that the established Australian works which were of a national character would not be allowed to close down. Yet, notwithstanding that promise by the Government, those works-have to all intents and purposes ceased to exist. ber think that had the Anti-Dumping Act been applied to explosives the unemployed problem would have been relieved? Mr ""WATKINS The honourable member should direct his attention to something which he understands. him why the Government, who took so much care of the primary producer during the war, have allowed some of the secondary industries to languish through lack of assistance. Many men have retired from the land in order to enjoy the wealth that they accumulated during the war. Good luck to them! Throughout my political career I have done everything possible to assist the primary producer, but I think he should show a little consideration to the people engaged in other industries. has done more for Australia than Australia has done for him. done a lot; but the country has been good to him. No other man is so beholden to a paternal Government as is the man upon the land. In times of drought and trouble he is supplied with seed wheat and cheap wire-netting, and his stock is carried at cheap rates on the railways. I do not object to the granting of that aid, but I ask the primary producer and his representatives to realize that he is 7io t the only member of the community for whom the Government should care. The Prime Minister in his references"" to ^shipbuilding side-stepped the charge which had been made against the Government in that regard. During the war period the Govermnent embarked upon a big policy of shipbuilding. After skilled artisans had been collected in different centres in the various States, they entered into an agreement with the Government to keep the work of ship construction in progress, and at the request of the Government expert tradesmen settled in the vicinity of ship-construction yards at Port Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, and Newcastle, on the understanding that permanent work would be available for some considerable time. I do not think any one could possibly take exception to the quality of the work performed by the men, and it was admitted by the Minister in charge of ship construction at the time that' the workmanship was equal to that performed by more experienced men in other parts of the world. After this great organization had been undertaken, and the 5,000-ton vessels had been completed, the Government allowed the work in connection with the construction of the I ask 12,000-ton vessels to go to Great Britain, with the result that the Australian shipbuilding yards were closed down, and large numbers of highly-skilled men were thrown out of employment. Surely this is striking evidence of repudiation. Not only were the workmen penalized, but others .outsidje, including a State Government in one case, who were supplying certain materials, were placed at great disadvantage. It is possible that the larger vessels may have been constructed abroad at a somewhat lower rate, but even if such, were the case, it was the duty of the Government to carry out its promise, because the indirect benefit to the Commonwealth would have been considerable. Many of these men have been I admit that he has cheated by the Government, and have been put to considerable inconvenience and expense in transferring their homes to the centres where shipbuilding was being undertaken. In many instances they have been compelled to remain in those centres, and submit to unemployment, owing to the unfair tactics of the Prime Minister and his supporters.

The Leader of the Opposition, in support of his amendment, said thab he suspected that German goods were evading our Tariff, but he did not give a solitary positive instance. It was on this alone that he based his case for the extravagant words of the amendment. He gave no facts; his speech was all conjecture. I have attempted to ascertain the facts. There are as many factories in Cook electorate as there are in any district in Australia. Some time ago I wrote to the managements, individually, of every factory, in Cook electorate, and inquired if there' was anything I could do in this Parliament, or by approaching the Administration, which would enhance the prosperity of those factories or extend employment. I have heard rumours that the importation of German goods has been damaging to the -factories of Australia, but in only one instance was I informed by the management that it suspected thab such was the case.

114,Mr Chablton,"me precise information. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Rodgers) will remember that I obtained, only last week, preliminary information to enable the firm to find out positively whether there was any dumping going on that was prejudicially affecting the factory. So far I have not been able to ascertain any positive facts. knowledge that factories are being prejudiced by dumping. Such information can be supplied only by the managements of these industries. These managements will not be slow to bring such a matter uuder the notice of the members for the electorates concerned.

121,Mr Hughes,"The honourable memberi t was natural to the occupation that I followed. MrJ . H . CATTS -The aanendment now asks us to -refuse to grant Supply to pay the public servants of Australia by declining to consider the recommendation, of the Governor General of the necessary appropriation. that if the amendment were carried there would have to be an election, and that Labour could gain nothing by contesting an election at the present time. lie unemployment. Wales the present unemployment is due absolutely to the maladministration of Labour. In 1.920, immediately upon the return to office of a Labour Government in that State, Canadian financiers offered to advance the money necessary for the building of the North Shore bridge and the construction of the Sydney underground railway, works of absolute urgency. The transport of Sydney is now practically at a stand-still for lack of expansion of means of conveyance, it being impossible to run another car on the existing tram-lines, and the citizens are suffering enormous inconvenience in consequence. The Railways Commissioners bave reported over and over again that the city transport arrangements are 50 per cent, above the safety point. This money was offered at a cheap rate. HadI known the matter would come up for discussion I would have' brought with me documents relating to the offer. long time to make up your mind to talk about it . MrJ . H . CATTS -If my honourable friend had taken any real interest in this unemployment question, and had read the Labmw News he would know that week after week I wrote special articles begging the Labour movement to undertake urgent payable public works that would give employment to the people, and that week' after week, on Friday nights, I put this case before the Labour Executive. It was a Labour Government that sent Mr Bradfield, the engineer, to Canada to obtain tenders outside Australia for the construction of the North Shore bridge. Before the Queensland Government had borrowed money fro m America, at the rate of 1 \ per cent., the New South Wales Government had been offered a loan of £10,000,000 from New York a.t 6 per cent. Sir Denison Miller has shown that taking the rate of exchange into account the Queensland borrowing was profitable, and the advance offered to the New South Wales Government was, therefore, a wonderfully good business proposition from their point of view. Labour members know the loan. to. be made? MrJ . LI . CATTS -Fo r ten years. All this time. I was endeavouring to thrash out some of these matters with Ministers. The late Mr John StoreyI n New South asked me to go through the papers dealing with the New York and Canadian offers, and work out the details for him. If the £10,000,000 loan offered from New York had been accepted, and within ten years the rate of exchange had come back to par, as it was predicted by leading financiers of the world it would, New South Wales would have obtained the money for nothing. A t the present time the rate of exchange is nearly at par. However, that opportunity to borrow advantageously was lost. Then £2,000,000 was offered by'land-, holders living between Port Stephens and the northern line to build a railway from Port Stephens to Guyra and Inverell. That offer was not accepted by the Labour Government. Mr O'Halloran, a. Labour member for the eastern suburbs of Sydney, stated publicly that £500,000 was offered locally to build the eastern suburbs railway, a line which is very badly needed. That has taken you a. offer was refused. Then the Nationalist member for North Shore, Mr Weaver, stated that local people were prepared to put up money to pay for a. much'needed tramway to cope with the congested traffic. That offer was not accepted. There are wealthy municipalities around Sydney which have offered, times out of number I might almost say, toreuse the money needed to carry out water and sewerage extensions within their boundaries which they are unable to obtain from the Government, and those offers have never been accepted. W h a t were the reasons for the refusal of these offers ? All these works are of admitted urgency. Unemployment was increasing on. every hand. The finance was offered to set the men to work One reason was this: The late Premier( Mr John Storey) said that the rampant corruption in the party made",39,Supply Bill No 1 1922 23 Censure Amendment Budget Old Age Into Operation Immediately It Was Passed Pensions Telephone Extensions And Had The Price Of Imported Materials Accommodation Fob Commonwealth Been Kept At The Level Of That Of Local Departments

The zarini), who sits near me muttering, has cursed the ""Tammany boss"" (John Bailey) up hill and down h ill , but has not had the courage to help to fight for a cleaning up. It was because of the urgent appeal of Mr John Storey, whose fatal illness was precipitated by the onslaughts and worry of "" Tammany"" in side the Labour movement, that in 1921 I wenb to the New South Wales Conference, and put up a. fight to save the Labour movement of the State from, as he put it , "" a pack of savages."" It is high time the whole of the workers were informed how they are sacrificed by the very organizations created for their special protection. The Labour movement in New South Wales has no chance to regain the confidence and good-will of the people until there has been a thorough cleaning up of the rottenness' and corruption that is rampant among those controlling the movement in that State-. I have matters of the utmost concern to the workers of New South Wales particularly, and, indeed, to the workers of Australia generally, to bring before the House, and I do not propose to deny myself that opportunity, by assisting to bring this Parliament to an end at the present time. There is a notice of motion in the name of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro( Mr Austin Chapman) that the old-age pensions shall be increased to f l per week. I desire to support that motion, but if I voted for the amendment now before the House, I might assist to terminate this Parliament and thus deprive myself of the opportunity to vote for an increase in the old age pensions. There are also notices of motion with reference to the building of the hostel at Canberra and for the extension of the sewerage services of the projected city, to take the Eederal Capital scheme a very long stride forward. If we carry this amendment, we shall be delaying all these works, and without an} possible hope of doing the slightest good for the workers of this country, because not a man on this side of the House believes that a dissolution and an appeal to the country will mean any material increase in the numbers that sit in opposiMr J.

I am, applying two principles to my conduct-on e to observe the pledges which I have given to my constituents, and the other to exercise my own common sense. In all cases where action contemplated is in consonance w it h those pledges, I shall vote in accordance therewith without regard to where it may take me I am applying the principle of common sense in the present instance. I do not propose to vote against the request of H is Excellency the Governor General that the House should go into Committee in order to provide the necessary means for the payment of the Public Service, which in cludes a considerable amount in wages, to returned soldiers, besides the expenditure of nearly £200,000 for repatriation, and a number of other very worthy objects. I believe that an overwhelming number of my constituent? wish to see these services provided for straight way. I am satisfied that the adoption of bhe amendmenb would nob conserve the interests of the workers or my constituents in any shape or form . amendment submitted by my honourable Leader( Mr Charlton) contains some very grave charges against the Government. U p to the present there have been three speeches in defence of the Ministry, one by the Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr Rodgers), one by the Prime MKnister himself ( Mr Hughes), and the speech we have just listened to from the honourable member f p r Cook( Mr J. H . Catts). The only comment I have to make concerning the iast is that it should have 7 been delivered from the other side of the House, for it contained many charges against the inside working of the Labour movement. All I will say on that point is that whilst these things were alleged to be happening at the gatherings of the party, the honourable member for Cook",40,Supply Bill No 1 1922 23 Censure Amendment Budget Old Age Into Operation Immediately It Was Passed Pensions Telephone Extensions And Had The Price Of Imported Materials Accommodation Fob Commonwealth Been Kept At The Level Of That Of Local Departments

There has been practically no answer to the charges which have been levelled against the Government. Only courtesy would characterize the speech by the Minister for Trade and Customs as a reply, and as for the Prime Minister, . well, his speech was degrading to a degree to the dignity of this Parliament. orable members supporting the Government may laugh. I know this statement does not quite suit them, but, nevertheless, it is true. Por nearly half-an-hour the Prime Minister's remarks were absolutely irrelevant to the whole question before the House. . He was simply camouflaging the position by talking about the Labour Conference, and about the Labour deb&de, and misrepresenting the things that were done in assemblies of the Labour party. Nothing that he said had anything whatever to do with the amendment submitted by my Leader-. he was speaking I was reminded of the squid which, when alarmed, ejects a lot of dirty murky fluid in an effort to escape detection. vou know. original.

Honourable members that round-table conference. Before he opposite are welcome to that questionconvened the conference he went to his able honour. The Prime Minister, in constituents at Bendigo and declared his own polite language, characterthere, that wages must come down. Thereized the charge that the Government fore, the Economic Conference was called had deliberately created unemployment for one purpose, and one purpose as an infamous lie. My reply to that is only, namely, to sanction a reduction that.the charge is irrefutable. I say that in the wages of Australian workers. the action of the Government is infamous In that speech, delivered on 21st January, to a degree, and as I proceed I shall prove 1922, he said that prices had come what I say. First of all, the Prime Minisdown, and that wages must also come ter said that we can only solve the prodown. And here is the other part of the blem of unemployment by. reducing the scheme. In the very same speech he said cost of production. And then he went on tliat the Government's scheme to increase to say that the price of coal could be rethe flow of immigration to this country duced if the miners in the coal-fields had cost £250,000 in overhead expenses of Newcastle ate less. That is the alone. It was well named a ""scheme.""

There vernment on the question of the Antimust, so they declare, be lower wages and Dumping Act, but there is an equally longer hours of work. During the whole strong, if not stronger, indictment upon of the Prime Minister's speech, we heard which he had merely time to touch, against nothing at all about the 150 per cent, their immigration scheme. I heard the profits of the coal barons, and no suggesright honourable gentleman to-day speak tion that in order to bring down the cost of production they should eat less or drink less or waste less in luxuries. No! But the men who go down into the bowels of the earth and do the hard toil in order to carry on our industries must, says the Prime Minister, eat less and receive less. That is the remedy, and that is the moHontive behind the immigration campaign. Not so long ago a Commission appointed to inquire into the profits of the coal barons showed that profits ranged from 10 per cent, to 154 per cent., but, as I have said, we heard nothing of this aspect of the cost of production from the Prime Minister. A ll we heard was that the miners must eat less and get less. In a lucid moment he said that the question of unemployment went down deeper than the question of Tariff protection. I agree with. him. We shall never solve our unemployment troubles until we wipe Whilst out the cursed system under which we are living and working to-day.

He stands condemned by his own admissions. spent £250,000 to organize a scheme to . bring out immigrants to Australia, and then he turned around and declared that no arrangements had been made to settle them on their arrival. Let us sec how these immigrants are being "" settled "" on the land. In a speech delivered in the Melbourne Town Hall on 30th May last, Mr Ryan, M.L.A., the president of the New Settlers League, Victoria, said that we had the best type of immigrants coming here, and he supplied proof that men were working contentedly in the bush for 34s. per week. that statement. If this country could be flooded with men who would work contentedly for 34s. a week, the question of settling Australia with the "" best type "" of men would be solved for those who are after cheap labour. made personal investigation into these matters. that immigrants are not being brought out unless they are in advance provided with land, and are likely tobecome producers. first made for our landless and workless people no one would welcome immigrants from overseas more readily than would the Labour party, but in spite of the fact that there are 50,000 or 60,000 workers out of employment in Australiathe registered number of trade unionists now out of work is 43,000, and if the unemployed were all registered the number would, probably, be 50,000 or 60,000-and in spite of the fact that Ministers admit that they are unable to find any solution for the problem of unemployment, they are now embarked upon a scheme for bringing out still more immigrants from Europe. The statement has been made that' the whole immigration scheme is on a satisfactory basis. I met a group of men who landed two weeks ago from the Largs Bay. They were Mr Scullin. mostly ex-service men whose passages had The right been paid, I believe, by the British Government. One man had left a railway job in England because alluring advertisements paid for by Commonwealth He Government money had promised him better conditions-in fact, splendid opportunities, and a chance to make a home in.

I can give his name and First of all he told us he had address, and if the Government areprepared to do their duty they can find him one of the jobs promised in the Commonwealth Government's lying advertisements. He went to the Labour Bureau immediately on his arrival and interviewed Mr Whitehead. He was offered a chance of "" settling "" on the land. What was that chance ?

In order to t u r n aside thc attack to-day, the Prime Minister came along with a. great deal of empty talk, emitting stuff like a squid. He spoke about Labour conferences and about Labour washing its dirty linen and all that sort of thing. He was very nice in his epithets. All I can say is that the oceans are not vast enough to wash the dirty record of his own party. I have not been in Parliament very long, but I . have at least some idea of what should be the standard of honour of a National Parliament. any Government could have survived the Ready-Earle scandal. the Prime Minister talking about d i r t and the washing of dirty linen.

138,Mr Scullin,"The Prime Ministerwho declined to face reasonable conditions of employment. Because the workers of Australia are not prepared to reduce their standard of living-becaus e they are not prepared to accept lower wages and longer hours-the y are not to be given the protection of an Act of this Parliament designed to prevent dumping and to provide more employment in this country. I heard the Prime Minister to-day refer to the "" abyssmal ignorance "" of economic principles displayed by an honourable member of the Opposition. What of the economics of the Government side of the House. I do not think honourable members opposite really believe in them. tainly do represent the most abyssmal ignorance. The suggestion that the way to provide more employment for the workers is to reduce wages and lengthen hours is the most absurd economic statement to which one could listen. Its absurdity is intensified by a reference to the masses. They are seeking to fulfil a history of the centuries. We need not go baok to the history of Old World countries. We have only to refer to the reports of Royal Commissions in Victoria and New South Wales as to the conditions of labour here before a Labour Government, or, indeed, a Labour man had appeared in a State Parliament. Those reports show that men working in tailors' shops received 2s. 3d. for making a suit of clothes: that people were working eighty hours a week for a wage of 7s. 6d. Such conditions were typical. A Royal Commission reported that tlie workers had only one option-they had either to accept starvation wages or to appeal to charity. If the economics professed by honourable members opposite were sound, one would imagine that there would have been plenty of work for the people under those conditions. there was not. Minister, when he was leading the forces of Labour, from the place where he now stands, make the most passionate appeals to the House in support of better working conditions, and declare that he himself had starved in the big cities of this country. He has about him to-day men who were then supporting Labour and who have had a like experience. There has been a change, but it is not we who have changed. We are still the same Labour party-standing Mr Scullin. working classy-fightin g and resisting the same old schemes that have been brought'in again and again to drag down wages and working conditions in Australia. I want only to say, in conclusion, that' the charges we have levelled against this Government are based on two main facts-(1 ) that they have not administered an Act passed by this Parliament to protect Australian industry from dumping-and on the facts and figures produced by the Leader of the Opposition that charge has been proved up to the hilt-and (2) that they are spending the workers' money in flooding Australia with If they do, they cerimmigrants to drag down wages. Members of the Nationalist party are also advocating the recruiting of coloured labour to assist in the degradation of the worker. By these means they hope to bring about prosperity for themselves and the degradation of the toiling prophecy made some time ago by one of the most prominent leaders of the anti-Labour movement, in Australia, who declared that "" In the .plenitude of time, when our millions shall have become tens of million's, we shall have a crop of misery which will solve for ever the problem of cheap labour."" This, then, is how they propose to solve the problem. ""Eat less and wear fewer clothes,"" says the Prime Minister to the miners. ""Never mind the profits of the 150 por centers; but eat less, wear less clothing, work longer hours."" That is the capitalistic solution of the problem of unemployment, and the Prime Minister and the Minister for Trade and Customs must bear the odium of it. If we do not carry this amendment, we shall at least have accomplished something by it. We shall have shown, But the people what the Government stand I heard the Prime for, and if we cannot win here we shall appeal to a wider and more humanitarian field, where we shall yet win. tivedThat the debate be now adjourned.

If honourable members financial year ends on the 30th June, will look at the summary at the comand, under the A u d it Act, all the grants mencement they will see that that total which have been made by Parliament is made up of three different amounts. lapse as soon as,the year has closed.

142,Mr Brtjce (Flinders,"Treasurer )second is £170,000 for refunds of revenue, and the third is an advance to the Treasurer of -£750,000. £1,561,850 , under the heading of ordinary votes, is based on last year's Estimates. .for ordinary votes was £24,715,282. In cluded in that amount there was, however, £5,548,815 for a .payment under the funding agreement w it h the British Government. This fundin g arrangement is now met .under an appropriation. For comparison, therefore, that amount should be deducted, as we have not to provide ib this year. From the £24,715,282 of ordinary votes last year we have to deduct the payment of £5,548,815 under' the funding arrangement; and the comparison we have to take after making that deduction £19,166,467. One-twelfth of that amount is £1,597,206 ; and now, for one month's Supply, £1,561,850, an amount less by about £30,000 than was voted last year. The reduction, greater, because, as I told honourable members when I commenced, we are including three pays instead of two, as would be the case with ordinary Supply for one month. The Committee w ill , I think, agree that the Government are asking for a very reasonable amount, the smallest that can be expected in the case ""of a month's Supply. funds of revenue, is not one that I think we can in any way control, because it is merely to make repayments and do justice to those who have paid in excess of their liability . taxation 1 eluded is a certain amount for payments of obligations such as the proportion of cable receipbs. All such payments are covered by this item of expendihire, and I do. not think that honourable members need worry themselves very much in regard to ""it. The £750,000 for Treasurer's Advance is a substantial sum, but it is one which has been asked for fairlv generally for many years past, though I do not put that forward as a. justification for the amount. The item is a necessary one; and if I give to the House one direction in which this advance will have to be expended, it w ill , I think, satisfy the majority of honourable members that we are not asking for an unreasonably large vote. As announced in bhe GovernorThe amount of General's Speech, proposals will be placed before the House for an exhaustive programme extending over some years with The total amount for 1921-22 regard to telegraphic and telephonic communication in this country. Thef u l l pro-' posals cannot at this stage be considered, and finalized, so as to enable us to proceed definitely with the work; and u n t i l such time as the House has set its seal of approval on them it is necessary that the Treasurer shall be able to make advances to the Postmaster-General's Department in order that the work may not be in any way delayed. That is the only abnormal item included in the payments from the Treasurer's Advance. The balance of the payments are of an ordinary character,"" is with the figure of such as arise year by year, and inevitably have to be met. They mainly embrace moneys to carry on work already approved we are asking for only by Parliament, but in regard to which the grants have lapsed, in consequence of the determination of the year. There arehowever, is considerably also small matters such as credits for such establishments as the Government Printing Office. I think the House w ill be content with the assurance that there is no amount involved in the Treasurer's A d vance other than bhe advances which have to he made to the Posbm asterGeneral's Department. The next ibem of £170,000, for rethe Committee that there are no new commitments in the departmental items ? mitments; the item is merely for carrying on purposes. In presenting this B ill I should have liked to make some sort of in direct or indirect statement as to the Government's financial transactions for the j>ast year; but I think it would be inadvisable to attempt to do so. The accounts'are naturally not yet finalized; the last month of the financial year is that in which the greatest amount of revenue comes in , and the greatest alterations take place in the accounts, because of adjustments that have to be made at such a time. A statement today would inevitably have to be altered, and possibly very materially altered, in the next few days; and for that reason I refrain from making any comments on the position as already disclosed or estimated by the Treasury Department.

Aa soon as 1 am in a position to do so I shall lay on the table of the House a statement giving the Treasurer's estimate at that date. as well as revenue moneys? with both, but I cannot at the moment say whether we shall be able to do so; even if we are, the figures will be by no means final, for they can only be an estimate. For further figures I ask the House to .wait until the Budget is presented, which will be at the earliest' possible date. There is nothing further in the Bill to which I wish to refer. I can assure honourable members that there is no expenditure of an extraordinary or novel character contemplated by this measure, which I now commend to the Committee for acceptance. congratulate the Treasurer on the explanation he has given the Committee regarding this Bill and his promise to submit the Budget at an early date. I accept his assurance that the Bill includes no expenditure other than for proposals which have been already approved by Parliament. The only subject to which I desire to draw attention to-day is that of old-age pensions. Recently the Treasury has been reviewing the pensions, and the payments to very many of the old .people have been cut down because of an increase in the value of the property they own. That increase is due largely to the inflation of values that occurred during the war. In New South Wales a Public Valuators' Department was created, and it led to an increase in the valuations of property by 50 per cent, and 60 per cent. The pensions of the old people who own property have been reduced proportionately, and I ask that the Treasurer when preparing his Budget will consider whether he cannot make provision to increase the old-age pension? In view of the. fact that the cost of living to-day is 45 per cent, higher than it was in 1914, and that some of' the pensioners arereceiving less than they received then, it is difficult to understand how they are able to live at all. [8 ] I congratulate the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) upon his appointment to I3ie high office of Treasurer of the Commonwealth. Those of us who are looking for sound and economical government centre our hopes in his ability U do something to stop the financial drifi that has been in progress for some yeara I congratulate him also on the good commencement he has made by promising to submit the Budget before 4th August, and I hope that he will be able to show his determination to sit tightly upon the lid of the Treasury chest, in order to prevent any increase in expenditure, and, if possible, bring about a reduction in taxation. We expect him also to clear up many of the Government trading transactions, in regard to which we have not been able to get any satisfactory information in the past. I refer especially to the accounts relating to sugar and shipping. We want some of those transactions put before the public in all their nakedness, to show where the Government .stand and where the taxpayer will stand in relation to them. This exposure, whether it prove decent or indecent, is necessary in the public interest. This is the first opportunity I have had of dealing with the important subject of telephone services in the country. During the recess events occurred in my own electorate which should not be possible in a civilized. community -For between four and five years a telephone line to the villages of Valery and Marlbrook haa been sought, but notwithstanding repeated promises that it would be constructed nothing has been done During the last few months three deaths Were actually caused through telephone communication not being available. Valery is situated in the mountains midway between Coffs Harbor and Bellingen. In both those places there are doctors, but, if sickness occurs in Valery, there being no telephone communication with either of the other two places, the patient has to be conveyed 25 miles to Bellingen, only to discover on arrival there, perhaps, that the doctor has gone to attend a case 40 or 50 miles distant in the country The patient has then to turn about and travel another 25 miles to Coff's Harbor.

If there is one thing that tends to interfere with settlement, particularly pioneering, it is this condition of affairs. . I take the earliest opporthat arrangements are being made to retunity of placing this matter before the House, and saying that the excuse so repeatedly offered that material is not available for the construction of the line is not true. I discovered that when these deaths took place there was over 200 miles of telephone wire in Grafton which could have been utilized as soon as the Department installed 25 yards of underground cable. There were no obstacles to the provision of telephone connection with Valery. I make these observations in the hope of forcing the Department's hands, and preventing the further repetition of the statement that something will be done for the people in the country when the material is available. I understand that both thc Public Works Committee and the Public Accounts Committee have made recommendations to* Parliament in regard to the provision of more office accommodation for Commonwealth Departments; yet I find that the item for rent in this Bill appears exceptionally large. For the one month covered by the Bill an amount of £11,335 is provided for that purpose. I hope that when' the Government are formulating their financial policy they will consider the erection of Government buildings to house the public Departments. is required in the State Capitals.

Probably the Treasurer is investigating this matter, but it seems to me that both in Melbourne and Sydney moro office accommodation is required. One other matter to which I desire to refer is the dismissal of munition workers and others. I have heard only to-day tain or transfer some of the men whose dismissal had been recommended. wherever possible. be done, because the distress caused by these dismissals is cruel. The Government should not be guilty of that sort of thing, and if they will do nothing to avoid the distress that is being caused we shall have to ventilate this grievance again and again until some redress is given.
