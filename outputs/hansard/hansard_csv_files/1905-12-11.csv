It has been reported that very few complaints of such delays have been made of late, and that delays are not now so numerous as they were previously. 3. It is understood that the Public Service Commissioner obtains his information respecting Western Australia in the same manner as it is obtained in connection with the other States, that is through his Inspector and other responsible officers resident in the State, who are acquainted with all the circumstances. The value of the information so obtained is a matter for the Public Service Commissioner's determination, as under rhe provisions of the Public Service Act and Regulations, the rates of salaries and wages must be determined upon his recommendation. DUTV ON BICYCLES. Trade and Customs, upon notice1. Whether he can give the invoice value of the Massey-Harris and the Red Bird bicycles on which duty is paid by the importers? 2. What is the selling price of these machines? honourable member's questions1. Only certain portions of these bicycles are imported, and the machines are completed afterwards by the addition of other parts from various sources. The cost of completion is not officially within the knowledge of the Department. 2. The Department is not officially aware of the selling price. It may be observed the MasseyHarris bicycles are not manufactured by the company of that name which deals in agricultural machinery. I may add that certain information has been given confidentially to the Department, which of course I cannot use; but the invoice price and cost of these bicycles is a great deal more than that which has been represented to me--£ 4 or £5-by certain persons. Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) I move That the B ill be now read a second time. Some honourable members may ask why this measure has not been introduced at an earlier stage. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -The honourable member ought to know very well why it has not been introduced before. this stage ? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -In consequence of continual talk and waste of time there has not been an opportunity to introduce the Bill until the present time. sir, I desire to ask whether it is in order for the Minister to state that certain things have not been done on account of the Opposition wasting time? in order for an honourable member to accuse other ""honourable members of deliberately wasting time. member is a little too previous. I did not make an accusation against any honourable member; I said that owing, to the constant talk and waste of time, the Bill had not been introduced, but I did not mention members supporting the Government or any members of the Opposition. I think I was perfectly in order in saying what I did, because it is a fact. This Bill is considerably' different from the Bill which was introduced in previous sessions. The former Bill provided that under division VIA . of the Tariff, bonuses should be given to persons in order to induce them to establish the iron industry from the ores of Australia. It will be remembered that on two or three occasions, when considerable debate on the subject took place, very serious opposition was raised to the question of giving bonuses at all; and., although I strongly favoured) the method which was then proposed-in fact, I am ready to go to very great lengths with a view to getting the iron industry established here in a proper mannerI have altered the provision which heads division VI A. of the Tariff, with a view, not to grant anv bonuses, but, when the Government are satisfied' that the industry has been sufficiently established, to enable the iron made from native ores to be used in the manufacture of our machinery, and to give it what little protection division VIA . provides. It will also be recollected that since this question was last before the /House, the Government of New Sjbuth Wales have entered into a compact with one he can, all the iron which they mav require for Government works. Under that agreement he has not nearlysuch a great inducement as he would have had a few years ago, when, perhaps,",14,Telegraph Messengers

I have already spoken two or three times on this subject, and given certain information, which I do not wish to repeat. I propose to add a few figures to those which I gave on the 9th December, 1904, in order to show the immense importation of iron. On that occasion I gave the figures up to 1903, and pointed out that in that year we imported, in a variety of ways, iron and machinery to the value of ,£7,209,259. I have had an opportunity of taking out; the figures for 1904, and I find that in that year we imported iron and machinery to the value of ^6,989,876, as is shown by the official returnAgricultural implements machinery Electrical appliances Anchors Arms, rifles, &c.

Those who decry our country are confounded by the fact that Australia was never so wealthy as she is to-day. Our exports,, which have increased in value to On the last occasion the the extent of ,£.14,000,000 in three years, were never so large, and I believe that if we direct our attention to the development If the honorof our iron resources, we shall still more largely promote the prosperity of the community. I wish to point out the extent to which the provisions in the measure before us differ from those which are made in division VIA . of the Tariff. Some honourable members wish to make it appear that this measure raises the fiscal question, but if they refer to Hansard they will see that it was intended that the duties provided for in division VIA . should be brought into operation at an early stage. Provision is made that the duty shall come into operation on dates to be fixed by proclamation, and that fhe metals and machinery specified in the division,., except iron, galvanized plate andl sheet, shall be exempt from duty in the meantime.

Sir WILLIAM . LYNE -Although there might not be sufficient iron made from local ores to meet all our requirements, there might be enough to enable certain classes of manufactures to be carried on. Take, for instance, the case of reapers ' and binders which are now made in Australia to a limited extent. The industry has only recently been established, and the manufacturers find it difficult to compete against the importers. Reapers and binders would be subject under division VI . to an ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. Supposing that a sufficient quantity of locally-produced iron were available for use by manu[221]2 facturers of reapers and binders, it would be a. good thing to issue a proclamation relating to that particular item. the question as to why the matter is to be taken out of the hands of Parliament. the division as it now stands to subment, and a great deal of trouble and delay It was thought that provision as, that now proposed. Other has first to be produced. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I am perfectly aware of that, but it never will be produced unless the ihdustry is assisted in some way or other. Since the Bil l was introduced, I have had an opportunity of consulting several honourable members, and . I find that there is' a general desire that the control with regard to the imposition of duties shall remain in the hands of Parliament, and I am prepared to meet the views of honourable members to that extent. The Government do not desire to exercise the power of bringing the duties into operation by proclamation, except with the object of facilitating, as far as possible, the production, of iron and steel produced from native ores and tiheir use in our manufactures. is the reason mit every proposed duty to Parliament. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I understand that that is the feeling of honourable members, and, therefore, I shall either accept or propose an amendment in the direction indicated. There is no necessity for me to make a long speech, because I have already addressed the House at length upon this subject two or three times. I do not propose to enter upon the history of the iron industry in England, Great Britain. America. Germany, or any other part of the world. Honourable members have had. the matter brought before them so often that they are thoroughly well informed with regard to it.

I agree with the honourable member as to the unwillingness of officers of one Department to do work for another, and as to the desirability of the officers contemplated carrying out these electoral duties; but that object can be accomplished, although the administration remafins with the Department of HomeA f fairs. At the present time arrangements have been made with the Post and Telegraph Department by which, when the Bill is brought into operation, not only postal officials, but public servants generally, wherever they have time within office hours, shall be called upon to give assistance in this electoral work. I think it is reasonable that public servants should be expected to perform Federal duties irrespective of the particular office or Department in which they are employed, provided those duties do not impose undue responsibility on them, under which circumstances, -of course, they would be entitled to extra remuneration.

It is quite clear to me that if any Department ife found best suited for a particular work, it is possible to make -the requisite arrangements to meet the circumstances.

That is a reversal of the existing system. Commissioners would be State officials. of the Commonwealth Electoral Officer in each State they would all be State officials. Under the system we have adopted one Electoral Commissioner is appointed for each State. It is his duty to distribute the State into electorates, and when he has made his distribution, it is advertised, and objection can be taken to the divisions he proposes. Then the whole matter is brought before Parliament for confirmation, and the control of Parliament is thus preserved..

104,Mr Groom,"Section 23 of the printoral Commissioner for each State. It was pointed out that if three Commissioners were to be appointed for each State, heavy expense would be involved. It is clear that for a State like Tasmania, with only five electorates, the scheme now proposed is a very cumbrous method of dealing with the sub-division of that little State. When the matter was. previously discussed here, it was pointed out that to have three commissioners for each State would mean that there should be eighteen Electoral Commissioners appointed. Under that, twelve new appointments would be necessary. Each of the officers appointed would, of course, be entitled to extra remuneration for work done under this measure. The Commission would probably take evidence in investigating matters, and might wish to travel, and it would be a very cumbrous Commission for such a purpose. The division even of a State like New South Wales should not be a very difficult task for one officer acquainted with his work. Another objection to the proposal is that, in substance, it really leaves the House of Representatives at the mercy of the Executive of the day, because they are given the right whenever they think fit to say that there shall be a redistribution of the electorates. Under the proposal submitted by the Senate, immediately that took place the whole matter would be completely removed from the control of Parliament. The redistribution would have to take place in accordance with the s,cheme submitted by the Commissioners in each State, and honourable members will understand that the very fact that :i redistribution is decided upon implies a dissolution of Parliament, and the return of a new Parliament on the basis of the new constituencies. On the whole, I think it is not advisable, especially at this stage, to accept these amendments. The idea of the ©ill as introduced was to bring about certain administrative alterations found to be necessary for the efficient working of the Electoral Act. To accept the Senate's amendment now might render it exceedingly difficult to carry out in due time the object of the Representation Bill, which was introduced specially in order that the next elections might be conducted upon such principles as would insure to each State the representation to which it is entitled according to the latest statistics of the Commonwealth. We fixed the enumeration day with that object at the earliest possible date, so that all the administrative arrangements might be made to bring the principle of the Representation B i ll into effect at the next election, and to secure to each State its due representation. easily got over. Electoral Commissioners for each State, we cannot be sure how long they will take to do their work. three Commissioners for the smaller States. be necessary to apply this to the first distribution. have to insert special clauses in this B ill . I think that the present system has worked satisfactorily enough. It is inexpensive; it leaves to an independent person the redistribution of a State into electorates.; and reserves to Parliament the control which I think it should always keep over such matters. In the circumstances, I ask the Committee to negative this clause, and we can afterwards deal with the amendments consequent upon it. ney) I am very stronglv in favour of what is proposed by this clause. In some of the States and elsewhere it is not unusual to have a permanent Commissioner or Commissioners, or to appoint them by Act of Parliament when the necessity arises, to redistribute the electorates, and for Parliament to accept the distribution so made. the scheme of the Commissioners is subject to revision by Parliament. cision of the Commissioners is final, I ' believe, in . New Zealand, and, speaking from memory, I think the position is the same in the case of the British Parliament. It is undoubtedly desirable that Parliament should remit a matter affecting itself to the consideration of independent authorities. We know that members, and it may be parties, to some extent, are affected by a redistribution, and it is highly undesirable that those members or parties personally affected should be the judges of a matter affecting themselves.

On the last occasion the schemes to which objection was taken were not returned to the Commissioner. satisfied to allow the inequalities to continue. I quite agree that officers, ^-such as are proposed! to be appointed under this clause, may sometimes make errors, but those errors are not likely to be nearly so hurtful as are those which a Parliament commits when it attempts to correct supposed anomalies in a redistribution scheme. Errors that might be committed by the Commissioners could not be nearly so dangerous as is the system of allowing Parliament to reject redistribution schemes with or without good reason, and thus postponing for months, or, perhaps, for years, the adjustment of electoral equality. Ministry are pledged to a redistribution. but we are not legislating in relation only to the present Ministry. The Minister of Home Affairs has taken the valid objection that it would not do to delay the coming redistribution by making this clause apply to it. If this clause be adopted, the proper course to pursue will be to insert a further provision that it shall not apply to the forthcoming redistribution. A redistribution has actually been prepared, and if it were entirely abandoned it would involve .a sacrifice of time and money. lay which would thus occur might make.it difficult to have the new scheme read'y for next session; but that, however, could be avoided by providing that .appointment of the three Commissioners for ply to the forthcoming redistribution. The reason for proposing the appointment of, three Commissioners is that it is thought that there should be more than one man to bring his intelligence to bear upon the -questions to be submitted, because there will be no appeal. made to the cost of having three Commissioners, but it should not be'anything like so great as the expense of making a redistribution, which, as in the case of some of the first redistribution, which was rejected, is entirely wasted. Any expense incurred under this clause will give a return. My Under the Minister's experience leads me to regard it as. highly undesirable, and likely to lower the dignity of Parliament, that we should each be judges in our own cause. Other Parliaments have been content to hand over this work to trusted authorities, and I think that we should do likewise. We were no wonder that the appreciation of Parliament by the public and the press is said to be decreasing when honourable members themselves are afraid to trust Parliament to do its work. allowed inequalities to exist for years. allowed inequalities to exist. The instance cited by the honourable member tells against the present system, but I do not think that a similar instance will occur again. cumstances which created it are not likely I take it that the present to arise again. This Parliament seems to be more afraid than are other Parliaments to trust itself to act fairly and justly. One of our first actions was to prevent the exercise of political influence in connection with the management of the Public Service, in which matter I think we made a mistake, because we went to an extreme. Parliament has removed the control of the Public Service of that Sfate from political influence. Wales Public Service Act is not nearly so The dedrastic in this respect as is ours. Then we took from ourselves the right to deal with disputed elections, and handed it to a Court of Disputed Returns. I do not the feel stronglyl on that subject, though I think that a Parliament elected by,, and re each State should not apsponsible to, the people is the best Court to try such matters. Now the Senate proposes that the distribution of divisions for this House shall be determined without appeal by a Court of three persons.

A distinct party spirit was shown in that redistribution, though unintentionally, but it was a distribution made by a Commissioner, and not by Parliament. I do not suggest that he was guilty of party bias, but, strangely enough, that was a case of what looked like gerrymandering, in which Parliament should have interfered. but nothing was done, probably because we were at the time near the end of a session. If this clause were passed as it stands, however, a member would not have an opportunity to point out defects in any distribution, and very bitter feeling would be caused. The case to which I have referred shows the need for bringing these matters before Parliament, because what was done on a small scale in South Australia might be done on a large scale in another State, and in some instances the Court might be guilty of direct party bias. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Bill. think that safeguards might be added to the clause, because Parliament should have some control over the distribution of the divisions. We should, I think, be able to refer back to the Commissioners any distribution which we thought contained gross inequalities. I understand, however, from the honourable member for Boothby that, in the case to which he referred, Parliament refused to remedy the Inequalities complained of . That is evidence of the ineffectiveness of the present system. The House agreed to that distribution, and rejected the New South Wales distribution. Could there be a stronger indictment against the present system? I do not think that his argufakes, but it is worth a great deal to the If any of them side which is taken by the honourable member for North Sydney. It proves that, for some reason or other honourable members vote very often just as may suit themselves, and it is of no use to shut our eyes to that fact. The present distribution of New South Wales may not be the best which could be made. But what can be done with the plan, except to refer it back to the Commissioner ? Wheni t is clearly demonstrated ""that a distribution ought to be made,, it should be undertaken and be approved by the House. Buti f the House will not give its approval to a scheme what are we to do? In my opinion the House should retain the power to refer back a scheme to the Commissioners, but it ought not to be in a position to reject a scheme. No doubt this is a very drastic step to take. But. judging from our past experience, it would be f a r better for the House to have only the right to refer back a scheme with the suggestions of honourable members, in the hope that it might lead to an alteration which would' meet various cases of inequality. rejection is better and safer than the power of referring a plan back to the Commissioner. national Parliament; but we act too much on provincial lines. The present distribution of New South Wales, so far as my district is concerned', is not one which suits me; but I would not say a word in the direction of getting it altered.

Therefore, it seems to me that we shall act wisely if we entrust the work to experts. May I remind honourable members that we have already had experience on both sides.

The final result was not subject to the revision of Parliament, nor was it determined by Parliament. New South Wales Parliament did-and we might follow their example with advantage -wa s to specially select three Commissioners to do the work. that these appointments should be left to the Governor General. that the redistribution should be approved by Parliament. torates were redistributed, the decisions of the Commissioners were submitted to Parliament. last occasion three Commissioners were specially appointed by Parliament, and were intrusted with the final determination of all matters relating, not only to the reduction in the number of electorates, but also to the limitation of their boundaries. That arrangement worked satisfactorily, and T think we might very well adopt a similar course, instead of providing that the Governor General shall appoint a Judge, the Survevor-General, and the Electoral Officer of the State, to do the work. We could deliberately select three Commissioners, and leave the final determination to them, feeling that in our collective capacity we should not be able to bring such knowledge or experience to bear. If the clause be retained I shall certainly seek to amend it in the direction I have indicated. support the Government in their request that this clause be negatived. In the first place, I resent the interference of the Senate in the matter. I feel certain that if this were a matter affecting the Senate, and this Chamber interfered in the same way as they have done, they would express very strong objection. The question is one to be dealt with entirely by this Chamber. sure submitted to the Senatei n the first instance ? is not suggested that the redistribution should be placed in the hands of members of this Chamber, but it is intended to preserve to us the power to reject any proposed redistribution if we are dissatisfied with it. The honourable member for Wide Bay referred to what he described as a regrettable incident in connection with the proposed redistribution of seats in Queensland. same kind occurred in other States also. member for Boothby mentioned a case that I do not think had occurred in South Australia. If the decision of the Queensland Commissioner had been final we should probably have agreed with it. But it was not final, and The State law required that was what the representatives of Queensland took exception to. The ComN missioner arrived at a determination, and published his maps, and immediately afterwards, without any apparent reason, withdrew them, and proposed another redistribution, altogether different from that first made. The same thing might occur again. The Commissioners might be as liable to unconscious bias as are the members of this Chamber. So far as my electorate is concerned, I could make a better division than that? now adopted if I were to consult my own interests. But I regard the present division as being, perhaps, as good as any other in the interests of the State, and I do not object to it, because I recognise that finality must be reached sooner or later.

The present occupant of the office is a gentleman in whom I have perfect confidence, and whose administration has, on the whole, been very good; but occasionally matters crop up with which this House should be able to deal. When the Electoral Act was under consideration I strongly advocated that a Committee of Parliament should deal with disputed election returns, because I thought that the House would stultify itself by surrendering its. powers in this respect to another trrounal. Onlv this, afternoon a proposition of a serious nature was made, in another matter of importance,, to give the whole power to the Governor in. Council, or, in other words, a Minister of the Crown. Had not the House shown some resentment, an endeavour aright have been made to carry that proposition into effect. And here', again, we are being asked to surrender our duties to an individual or body., over which this Parliament would have absolutely no control. I entirely agree with the attitude of the Government, and hope they will defeat the present proposal, which I regard as a gross interference with the rights and privileges of this House. Comm'ittee will agree I o retain the clause as it is. sion. very kernel of the measure. jealously prevent any interference by honourable members, interested and interested associations in the delimitation of the electorates. I ha.ve always consistently held that the desirable course is to opinion, take any more effective steps to appoint one or more Commissioners to carry out this work. We have it in our power, when appointing Commissioners, to see that thoroughly good men are selected. My experience of a similar appointment in Victoria leads me to the opinion that a Commissioner, occupying so high and responsible a position, would not exercise his power in the interests of any section of the communitv, or any partu in Parliament. All who know the record of the Victorian Commissioner are convinced that he did not give one tittle of consideration to the invery desirable that Members of Parliament terests of any particular member, but was should, as far as possible, be relieved from concerned only with what he regarded as discussing the boundaries of electoral divithe just interpretation of his instructions,. sions in which they are personally interested. I take a, thoroughly disinterested' view of Tasmania, under present circumstances, has this matter, because the Victorian Commisa minimum representation of five honourable sioner has cut off the Toorak portion of my electorate, which, I think, ought to be represented by some member holding the views which I profess. M.r. TUDOR -There have been two Commissioners in Victoria; would not the honourable member's remarks apply equally to the previous Commissioner? missioner dealt with different conditions. This House has f u l l opportunity to select a Commissioner with the highest jualifications, and that is where, it seems to me, the discretion of Parliament can be exercised. It is the desire of every honourable member to have fair and just boundaries, and to keep the administration of the Electoral Act pure. Those who hold a contrary view to mvself on the question immediately under discussion do so, I am sure, with a desire to arrive at the object I have just indicated-wit h the desire that there may be a proper representation of the views of the various electorates. I have been asked by the Toorak electors, and by the Oakleigh borough, to endeavour to have these places retained in the Kooyong electorate, but my reply has been that I have no power in any shape or form-that the whole matter is in the hands of the Commissioner. I say deliberately that I am exceedingly sorrv these portions of my electorate have been deleted. After listening to discusBut, notwithstanding that fact, I think I regard this provision as the -the method proposed by the clause is the We must one from which we are likely to get the fairest results.

164,Mr Knox,"Certainly ; but that Commembers, and I think it quite possible that there will be no alteration made in the boundaries. If the Commission is to be a heavily paid one, it is worthwhile considering whether it would be necessary to appoint three Commissioners for such a small State. My personal opinion is that the Surveyor General of the State could do the whole of the work himself, practically as well as could three Commissioners. I differ entirely from the view that the Senate, in inserting this clause, is encroaching on the rights of the House of Representatives, considering that the Bill was submitted for the Senate's consideration. The principle we have to consider is whether the boundaries shall be decided by Parliament or by Commissioners. How absurd it would be to call upon a member like myself to express an opinion as to the boundaries of Queensland, for example ! I have absolutely no knowledge of that State to qualify me to arrive at a decision. I can remember a case in the State Parliament of Tasmania, when the representatives of adjoining electorates, each desired to have a portion of one of these electorates included in his own. There we had at once a conflict between two men directly interested. were disinterested, could decide the question. MrM c WILLIAMS formation?

Toorak electors are also glad. In such a case, it is highlv undesirable that an honourable member directly interested should be called upon to decide the boundaries. T am sure the Chairman would not allow me to say that the manner in which the redistribution of New South Wales was refused by the last Parliament was a scandal; but that would be the term applied to similar proceedings in any matter outside politics. The last Parliament refused to allow New South Wales to be divided into something like fairly even electorates, with the result, as has been pointed out, that there are cases of one electorate having more than double the number of electors to be found in an adjoining electorate. fuse ? cided that New South Wales should not be brought under the Electoral Divisions B ill . arrived at in regard to other States.

That is to say, I would make an express act of disapproval necessary before the scheme was rejected. If that suggestion were adopted, probably a good deal of debate upon this question, and the possibility of a difference of opinion with another place, might be avoided.

This deals with a matter which affects the larger States to a greater extent than the smaller States. would need to be eight divisions, differing from the quota to the extent set out in the clause, before any redistribution could take place. There has been great outcry in New South Wales, as well as in Victoria, on account of the inequality in the number of electors in the various divisions. In Victoria, so far as I can ascertain, only about eight divisions have contained a greater or a lesser number than the quota to the extent referred to. When the last redistribution was proposed the House saw fit. unwisely, in my opinion, to reject it. If thisamendment had then been made there would have had to be a redistribution at that time. The amendment would mean that, in Victoria, there would have to be only five electorates, containing more or less than the quota to the extent proposed before a redistribution would be necessary; but under the proposal of the Government there would have 'to be eight electorates, with more or less than the quota, before any redistribution could take place. amendment that the number of divisions I will consider the matter be one-fourth.

It was suggested that wherever a certain number of electors for a division could be found, polling places should be declared. I am quite prepared to accept the honourable member's amendment, with the limitation which it imposes as a safeguard against abuse. position to the case cited by the Minister* in which an abuse of a similar provision occurred in Queensland, I would point out that very great difficulties may arise under the existing law which prevents an elector from recording his vote at a polling place in an adjoining constituency, no matter how convenient it may be for him to do so. As illustrating my point, I may mention a case, which arose under the South Australian Electoral Act. The division of Albert embraced the whole of the eastern side of the River Murray. On the western side there were several towns at each of which there were a few settlers. Under the State law they were ineligible to vote at the polling place on the eastern side of the river. If they wished to exercise their 'franchise they were compelled to do so at a polling pla;e which was 300 or 400 miles distant. That difficulty had to be overcome by the clumsy expedient of passing a separate Bill year after year, altering the boundaries of the districts opposite Albert so as to include the settlers upon the eastern side of the Murray.

The practice was found to be a very convenient one in South Australia, where a saving of .£1,300 was effected as the result of its adoption. clause 30 has been amended in the Senate by the addition of sub-clause 2, which does not commend itself to my judgment.

If the application of an elector to change from one pollingplace roll to another polling-place roll, or from one subdivision roll to another subdivision roll in the same division, is required to be witnessed by an elector, who will know whether the person called upon to witness is an elector or not? There are hundreds of men who think that they are electors, but whose names do not happen to be on the rolls. I cannot see what difference this amendment would make. of Home Affairs) -In a preceding part of the Bill we require that a claim to be registered shall be witnessed by an elector. If a person changes from one polling place to another, it is desirable that his. application for a transfer shall be attested by some person who knows him, and an elector is considered to possess that qualification. Every one over the age of twenty-one years in the neighbourhood will be an elector, and there ought to be no difficulty in obtaining an attestation to an application for transfer. an elector without being on the roll. rolls are always available, and I do not think that anv difficulty can arise. cannot see any sense in making the alteration. of the polling place which he has left, he cannot vote at the polling place to which he has gone, unless he gets a transfer. "" Q "" form. this alteration may result in the disfranchisement of a large number of electors. In my opinion it would be far better to provide a roll at each polling place, and to make it as easy as possible for electors to vote; but when we require a man to vote harder for him to exercise his suffrage. Under the electoral law of New South Wales this was done, and I think it might be done under the Commonwealth law. At the last elections great trouble was experienced by many electors when they came to vote. In TamworthI met the manager of a station, who, I thought, would know all the electors in the district.

As a rule, it is very diffitransfer from one part of an electorate to cult indeed to get an elector to notify the head office of a change from one polling place to another.

319,Mr Page (Maranoa),"I hope that theCentral Pastoralists' Association on one occasion paid a man of straw to object to every name on the roll that was supposed to represent an elector opposed to its members in politics. The fee which, had to be lodged with the Revision Court at that time was 5s. But it happened that we knew rather more about Lhe electoral law than did this big squatting association. There is a section in the Queensland Act to the effect that any objector must have his own name on the roll before he can lodge an objection. I happened to be the agent on this occasion. we require that objections shall be lodged by an elector. Had it not been for that section in the Queensland Act, under which we raised a point for the consideration of the Revision Court, large numbers of electors would have been disfranchised. I will give another case, which occurred at Isisford, in the Central District. About eighty electors out of J20 were knocked off the rolls. Some of them were actually in Court at the time, but were not allowed to state their case. As soon as a name was called on, a policeman went to the door and called out ""John Brown,"" and, although the man was in Court, and got up in answer tp his name, he was not allowed to substantiate his claim. actually engaged in that case when it came before the Supreme Court. An application was made to Mr Justice Chubb, and he ordered the whole of the electors who had been thus disfranchised to be reinstated. A more scandalous proceeding I never heard of in all my life. When it was found -that we intended to fight these cases in the Court, our opponents let us alone. If such things have happened before, they can happen again, if a wealthy .organization chooses to put up money for the purpose of lodging objections. In the last case to which I have referred an election was to take place in about three months' time, and our party would have been beaten simply from the effect of striking legitimate names off the roll if we had not taken prompt action. I trust that honourable members will pause before giving, under the Commonwealth electoral law, an opening for abuses. hope the Committee will not make any alteration in the amount of the deposit. A few weeks ago a great outcry was made in the State of Western Australia in connection with the State elections. A considerable number of men complained that, without having been notified, their names had been struck off the roll. A conservative organization in the State had been doing this work for some months previously. A few days ago I received a letter from a gentleman in Fremantle, asking me to pay particular attention to the efforts being made to deprive persons who were entitled to vote of the franchise at the next election, by the simple process of striking their names off the roll. If there had not been a five-shilling deposit to pay., probably hundreds of names would have been struck off the Fremantle roll. The organization to which I refer submitted a list of some 2,000 names to the returning officer, and said: "" These names are not on the State r o l l ; therefore we think you may as wel I strike them off the Federal r o l l . "" Because the returning officer insisted on the objectors putting down a five-shilling deposit for each objection, they refused to lodge them formally, and I am given to understand that, after being refused by the returning officer, they appealed over his head to the Minister of Home Affairs. I have not seen the correspondence, but the Minister will know the case to which I refer. It is a scandalous thing that a political organization, no matter on which side, should stoop to such tactics. The only possible means of preventing such things being done by any party is to fix a sufficiently deterrent fee, such as five shillings, .and requiite it to be lodged with the objection. It would be a backward step if we reduced the amount. It has to be remembered that there are many electors who icannot attend the revision court to maintain their rights. Many are working at distances from their homes, and do not see the objections. --Has any honourable member, in the course of his political career, every known of objections having been lodged against the names of wealthy persons on the rolls? Never. This practice is resorted to for the purpose of disfranchising working men and women. It is difficult enough to get them on. It is well known that the rich people of this country are friends of the "" j y P y e s ."" Most of the "" Jy-Pyes"" dance when they whistle.

We should take the temptation out of their way. It is only by means of legislation of this kind that we can do it. On the West Coast of Tasmania there have been efforts to strike many people off the rolls, but I never found that any steps were taken to strike off the names of .the "" boodleiers."" If any names are to be struck off, they should be those of the grafting "" boodleiers,"" who are corrupting and bribing the community. Let us retain the objection fee at five shillings, and, if a claim is not sustained, the objector should be made to incur a penalty of £ 2 0 , the money to go to the hospitals. discussion is rather amusing to me. I have had something to do with elections, but I have never known of such difficulties as have been mentioned here to-day If the fee of five shillings is retained, it simply means that, if a poor man desires to challenge the right of a rich man to have his name retained on the roll, he may be unable to do it. I have never seen' any wrong done by means of objections to the rights of voters to be retained on the roll, nor do I believe that objections are made for improper purposes. The argument that, if the fee is reduced, rich men will take steps to remove hundreds of names from the rolls is to my mind so much bunkum. There may have been a few cases of the kind, but they are very few indeed. I have never come across any. If the fee is retained at five shillings, it will operate rather against the poor than against the rich. Personally, I do not care whether the fee is reduced or remains as at present. member deal with frivolous objections ? to allow a penalty to be inflicted in such claim. cases.

I hope that the amount provided for in the B ill will be retained. I have a very 'distinct recollection of an attempt which was made not to stuff rolls, but to sweep rolls clean of the names of electors who were undesirable from the point of view of a certain political party. This occurred in an electorate very near to the centre of the Moreton electorate. A sweeping list of the names of persons objected to was sent in with the result that the election was lost to the man against whom the party taking this action were opposed, although if the names of all who were entitled to vote had been allowed to remain on the roll, the election would probably have gone the other way. It may be said that there is not now the same objection that there was previously to objections to names appearing on the roll, inasmuch as those whose names are objected to will not be compelled, under the new provision, to appear at a Revision Court to substantiate their claims. But I point out that in some of the outside districts there are many men and women who are averse to writing official letters, 'and in many cases, even though they should write them, they would have to travel a good many miles to post them. I see no reason why people who are justly entitled to have their names retained on ran electoral roll should be put to the trouble, not only of writing a letter, but of riding from seven to fifteen miles to post it,, in order to substantiate a claim which has been objected to.

His object is very much the same as that which I had in view when I moved that reasons for any objection to a name upon a roll should be communicated to any person who might feel himself aggrieved. The honourable member for Riverina thinks that the application of any person who lodges a claim for a postal vote, and who expresses the belief that he will be more than ten miles away from the prescribed polling place upon election day, should be accessible to any member of the public who may desire to inspect it.

My desire is to move that the whole clause be omitted.

I admit that there are a great many persons who use postal voting in a bond fide way. In my opinion I should have been satisfied if the section, as originally intended, had applied only to seamen, commercial travellers, shearers, and others whose occupations cause them to travel; but the system of postal voting has become a mightv engine of fraud, corruption, wholesale intimidation, and coercion. thing of these things. member must go through the world with his eyes shut.

I do And it is being undermined by our method of voting by post. At the last Melbourne election, more persons exercised this privilege than, exercised it in the whole of South Australia. Do what we will to prevent The incident shows that fraud and intimidation, once we do away with the necessity of the personal attendance of the elector at the ballot-box, we run a serious danger of leaving electors open to coercion. If we are going to allow voting by post for persons who are absent from home, there is no logical reason for not allowing it to all who will be inconvenienced by attendance at the ballot-box; and, if that is permitted, we have a system I support postal voting because it under which the ballot may be entirely abolished and voting by post may become universal. One of the greatest dangers threatening us arises from the fact that we. have constantly added to the facilities for voting by post. I took a hand in the original proposal in South Australia.

Postal voting is necessary, for instance, in connection with those engaged in the dairying industry. That is a point which ought not to be overlooked. In many cases there is not a polling booth within les.s than fifteen, Minister to give some attention to the miles of a dairy holding or farm. The husband may choose to travel to the polling booth in the morning to record his vote, but .the wife must remain to milk the cows and supervise the dairy during his absence. By the time that he has returned-afte r travelling thirty miles-it is too late for the wife corollary to a universal franchise. I have to be able to reach the booth before the closing hour. There must be some means of enabling women so situated to record their vote, and I , therefore, think that the postal voting system is necessary, provided that it be so safeguarded that it cannot be abused and subjected to manipulation. I Affairs, in administering this measure, will take care that the abuses which have been brought under the notice of the Committee will not be repeated at the next election, which, I presume, will take place during, or immediately prior to, the Christmas holidays of next year. been said as to the efficacy or otherwise of voting by pos.t, and one would imagine that the question at issue was a most important and material one; but when we turn to the records of the last general election, we find that, with the exception of those given in the electorates of Melbourne and Riverina, the number of postal votes for the whole of Australia was insignificant. If it .was difficult for electors to avail themselves of the voting by post system in 1903, how much more difficult will it be for them to take advantage of it under the restrictions now to be imposed? In order to prevent the sys.tem being abused, we are so loading it up with safeguards that it will become useless, and I , therefore, think that the honourable member for Darwin should press his proposed amendment. As it stands^ voting by post is a dangerous system, for it can be worked by those who wish to gain an advantage over their opponents. Even in the case of the electorate of Riverina, the postal votes recorded were less than 5 per cent, of the total number polled, and 33 per cent, of them were absolutely informal. This shows that the question of voting by post is not a material one. If the Minister would bring the polling booths closer together, he would secure a larger vote than is likely to be the result of the passing of these provisions. Instead of doing so, however, the Department is endeavouring to abolish polling places that have existed for years. I ask the; desirableness of increasing, rather than diminishing the number of polling places. to hear so many of my friends attacking the postal vote provisions of the Electoral Act. I regard those provisions as the necessary a very lively recollection of the time when you, sir, and I spent a great deal of our time in endeavouring to educate the people of Queensland up to an appreciation of the justice of universal suffrage, and of the wisdom of offering special facilities to those engaged in nomadic pursuits to record their hope that the Minister of Home votes. Nothing has since occurred to cause me to alter my opinions in that connection. Because certain persons may have misused the privileges conferred by an Act of Parliament, we ought not to deprive even one eligible voter of the opportunity to exercise the franchise. One would imagine, from the statements of some honourable members, that these postal votes are open to the public. As a matters of fact, they are, and ought to be, as secret as if'they were placed in the ballot-box. member know that in voting by post electors vote openly, and in a room filled with people ? is merely referring to instances in which tbe law has been violated. Does he say that we cannot reach such offenders? cannot. such offences are proved, the Government which failed to reach their authors would not continue in office very long. Upon the proposal to require an elector who wishes to avail himself of the postal provisions of the Act to go before a postmaster, I am opposed to the honourable member for Boothby, for the rea^ son that there are many cripples who are mentally sound, but whom it would be absolutely impossible to take to a post-office. Why should they be deprived of the right to exercise the franchise ? The honourable and learned member for Corio points out that the mere fact of another person looking at",62,Pairs

I hope that the time is not far distant when the Courts will regard them as offences of the first order, and will commit their perpetrators to imprisonment for a term of years. Amendment agreed to. opinion that the provision requiring an elector to be ten miles distant from the division for which he is enrolled before he is entitled to record his vote at a polling place in an adjoining division is an unreasonable one.

MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) I hope that the Minister will give tliis matter his very earnest consideration. [223] I the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has made a very good point. In many parts of Tasmania, especially in the mining districts represented by the honourable members for Darwin and Bass, there are practically no roads at all, and it is as difficult to travel five miles as it is to travel twenty or twenty-five miles in districts near a metropolis. The regulations under these Acts seem to be framed by persons who know nothing Of the conditions of the country districts. I would have no objection to making the distance ten miles close to the large cities, but I do not think that it should be made more than five miles in rural districts. If we increase the distance we shall practically take away the franchise from many electors. matter, and' will consult with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie in regard to it, and F i v e miles in some then recommit the Billi f necessary.

I should prefer uniformity in this matter, though I have no great objection to a difference being made between metropolitan and country districts. The fraud which takes place in country districts under the previous provision is not so great as that which takes place in the cities. However, if I understand that the Minister has agreed only to consider the advisability of recomI ask the honormitting the B ill , and that he is not weakening in his position in regard to it, I shall say no more on the subject at the present time.

They are as competent to do this work as any of the other classes of persons mentioned, and have been intrusted with it by the principal Act. trusted with it by the principal Act, and are the only persons mentioned in the clause who are non-official. are hawked round. the honourable member's electorate; but I have known of no case of the kind. The justices of the peace of Australia will compare with any other class. justices of practitioners should be left out, for the reason given by the Minister, that they are not Government officials. Neither class was mentioned in the original Act. That is one reason why the amendment is being proposed, and I hope that it will be adhered to by the Minister. draw the attention of the Minister to the necessity of making a distinction between an authorized witness to 'an application for a postal vote certificate and an authorized witness who is able to go round to witness and to collect the postal voting papers. the same way. a justice of the peace being an authorized witness to an application for a postal volt: certificate. shall have votes made informal by reason of the difference. is that we ought not to allow any of these persons to collect postal ballot-papers. The trouble has arisen from allowing peripatetic all officers in postmasters, or masters of State schools, or justices of the peace, to go round to witness and collect these papers. What they may do with them afterwards depends upon their honesty of character. I consider that a serious inroad is being made upon our voting system. I ask honourable members to limit the use of this system to the polling place and the post-office. Between the issue of the writ and election daythere is an opportunity to a person to get to a post-office and record his vote. Surely that meets the case of every one except the few persons who, on account of serious sickness or infirmity cannot go, and whot. as a rule, are not able to exercise the suffrage. We have to trust entirely to the honour of the authorized persons who witness and collect the postal voting papers. A reference has been made to the capacity, honest)-, and integrity of justices of the peace.
