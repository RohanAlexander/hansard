The Prime Minister( Mr saying that he did' not think that there Hughes) has said that it is impossible, to. secure from business enterprises the. information which the honourable member for West Sydney proposes to obtain by meansof hisamendment. In support of that contention, he has referred to. the decision of the Privy Council in the case of. the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited v. The Attorney-General of the Commonwealth. The decision given in. that case, however., was not that the Commonwealth Parliament lacked the power to obtain the information which was sought of the company, but that, owing, to anomalies in the Royal Commissions Act, the company was able to evade giving the evidence demanded of it. Lord Haldane, in giving the judgment of the Court, very clearly intimated that the Government failed in its claim, not because of want of constitutional power,, but owing to bungling in the drafting of the Royal Commissions.

Still, I fail to see why the people of this country should be subjected to exorbitant charges, especially for goods that are manufactured in Australia for much less than the prices charged for them.

9,Mr Makin',"I agree with the honortralia, and of the landed cost of all goodsbeing able to catch, up the arrears into which they have fallen during recent years; suffering is universal because of exorbitant charges: anxiety is becoming intensified, and privation is rampant. Since these are the facts, we should be prepared at least to make the 'necessary inquiries to ascertain the reason for the present state of affairs. We should endeavour to investigate the ramifications of profiteering, and the Government should be ready to prove the sincerity of the desire which they profess to relieve the people of the hardships of life. If fchey really want to free the people of the tremendous burden represented by the present high cost of living, they must io something of a 'practical character, such as the honourable member for West Sydney suggests. I urge them not to regard fche amendment from a partisan standpoint, but to recognise in it a sincere desire on the part of the Opposition to assist them to find a means whereby there can be brought to justice those persons who dealt so unfairly with the people during the whole course of the war, and who even now, in times of peace, are aggravating the offence. be anj' reasonable excuse for the Government refusing the opportunity now afforded to. them to do something practical to deal with a question which so agitates the public mind. It is an unfortunate, feature of our system of government, that we should have to admit that this Legislature, which is supposed to be clothed with full power to govern the destinies of Australia, and to conserve the best interests of for affording relief, especially as we its people, is unable to control those agencies which to-day are doing so much to bring down the standard of living to such a dull, sordid level as is now being created. I hope that, as the result of the remarks of honourable members on this side, the Government will do their part to put into effect-the suggestions of the honourable member for Wjest Sydney. I trust that they will withdraw the Bill temporarily, with the object of bringing in at the earliest possible moment a more comprehensive measure to deal with matters which are of such grave importance to the whole community. Surely the fact that we have power over imports and exports suggests that we can do something to help the people to secure the necessaries of life at a lower margin than is possible to-day, especially in the case of Mr Makin. goods which are manufactured in our own country. Unfortunately, there are a number of Australian manufacturers dealing unfairly with the people by availing themselves of the protection of the Tariff, and, at the same time, charging prices almost equivalent to those demanded for imported articles . of a similar character. In view of comparisons which can be submitted between the cost of manufacturing different goods in this country and the cost of similar imported articles, it is the duty of the Government to see that' local manufacturers, who are given the benefit of Tariff protection, extend to the people that share of the benefit which they have every right to expect and demand. between the price of an imported article and a similar local article of good quality. twill manufactured in New .South Wales at 8s. 6d. per yard, and retailed to the general public at 25s. 6d. comes in there, and reaps an immense There cannot benefit. this anomaly is the attitude of the manufacturers, many of whom deal only with the wholesale firms. They will not supand even an outrageous, ply direct to the retailers. This system of imposing double profits on the consuming public is grossly unfair, and whilst I have a seat in this HouseI shall do all I possibly can to speed up the machinery understand the Government are clothed with sufficient power to do all these things if only they had rJhe courage and strength bo face the position. I may be permitted to refer to a case that, perhaps, is sub judice, in connection with which it is 3tated, on behalf of the wholesalers, that a profit of 22£ per cent, is not sufficient to cover overhead charges. In my opinion, iJhat profit gives a very wide margin. It is far above what I am prepared to allow to any trading firm. We should do all we can to bring prices down to the very lowest point. I hope, therefore, that the Government will do their part by endeavouring to clothe the Judiciary with sufficient power to deal effectively with those profiteers who have made such inroads upon the welfare of the people of this country.",22,Judiciary Bill Second Reading

13,Mr Makin,"Another reason forI t should be unnecessary for honourable members on this side to urge upon the Government the necessity of incorporating in this Bill the principles laid down in the amendment submitted by the honourable member for West Sydney (' Mr Ryan). (During the last election campaign, when candidates of both parties were seeking the suffrages of the people, profiteering, which is dealt with in this amendment, was a burning question, and candidates representing the Government side of the House claimed to be just as anxious as were their opponents to deal with the evil. Well, they are now behind the Government; but,' up to the present, nothing has been done to ease the burdens which the profiteers have been placing upon the community for a number of years. We were even told, on one occasion, that the Prime Mincharge for the commodity he produces. ister ( Mr Hughes) intended to shoot the profiteers. Surely, then, some effort should be made to redeem these promises made to the electors, and which they accepted in good faith by returning the Government to power. when a no-confidence motion was being debated, we were told by Ministerial supporters that, as the Government proposals were turned down at the referendum, they had no power to deal with profiteering. Sydney, however, challenged the suggestion, and, in support of his views, he has taken this, fche first, opportunity afforded facturers and others to dispose of their him, of embodying them in the amendment he has moved to the Bill now under consideration. Eveni f the Government had not power to deal with profiteering, one would have thought that, immediately they were placed upon the right track, immediately it was shown that it was possible to do something, their first act would have been to pass a measure to put down the evil. But, as a matter of fact, this Bill, in which it is possible to do something, has been for some time consistently at the bottom of th,©. business-paper. have spent a great deal of time during the last few months in consideration of measures intended to deal with industrial troubles; but, so long as profiteering conment to stem the tide of growing indignatinues unchecked, all the time occupied by this Parliament on those measures [224] to which I have referred, will have been wasted, because this industrial unrest has its root-cause in the economic condition of the workers, who find themselves menaced by the profiteering practices of the commercial and moneyed classes of this country. One would have thought that common sense would dictate fco the Government the necessity for prompt action, because, while Wages Board and Arbitration Court awards may have the effect of increasing wages, we ' are moving in a vicious circle, because after every award employers put up prices to a higher level, so that, instead of being worse off, they are really better off. The wages awarded by the Arbitration Courts or Wages Boards aro always the maximum rates paid, and although they are the highest'rates to which the worker is entitled, there is no restriction on the manufacturer as to the price he shall It-is useless speaking of industrial peace, and of wasting our tiime in this Parliament endeavouring to improve the position by other means, because the worker cannot expect any improvement until proSubsequently, fiteering, which is keeping so many on the bread line, is checked. It is not a question of wages, because, comparatively speaking, the rates paid are sufficiently high to enable the workers to live in reasonable comfort; but the difficulty arises from the prices at whicli 1 The honourable member for West the nece.ssaries of life are sold. It is merely a question of reducing the cost of living by compelling manuproducts at a price more in conformity with the cost of production. That can only be done by giving the Court 'the powers set out in the amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan). The question of profiteering was 1 a burning one at the recent election, and it is one that has been agitating the minds of thoughtful men the world over. It is a problem that must be solved, and we are telling the people that this Parliament has no power to deal with it. There is nothing more calculated to bring the We Government into ridicule, or to stimulate direct action, than to tell the people that we have no power to deal with profiteering, and it will be difficult for those who still have faith in constitutional governtion and disgust towards parliamentary",23,Judiciary Bill Second Reading
14,Mr Lazzaeini (.Werriwa) [3.44],"government. In New South Wales a Necessary Comirriodities Commission, presided over by Mr Justice Rolin, has jusc published its report, from which it would appear that there was no evidence to prove that excessive profits had been made in the clothing trade.. I believe it was stated by the learned Judge that there was a profit of only 5 per cent, on the turnover; but it is useless to endeavour to gull the people in such a way when they know that clothing is being sold at ridiculously high prices. It is useless for a Commission to report that excessive prices are not being charged when working men realize every time they receive their pay that its value has been reduced owing to the increased cost of commodities. The agitation and discontent at present existing is likely to end in revolution unless this National Governanent tackles the problem seriously, and exercises every means at their disposal to check profiteering. It is hardly necessary for me to go into details in regard to prices, and the profits that are being made, when children in Melbourne and other cities are going bootless because of the prices that are charged. Ask the children in every city and town in Australia who have to go to bed, if not hungry, at least with their appetites not satisfied, if there is any profiteering. Ask the housewife, who experiences considerable difficulty in making ends meet, if there is any profiteering. The amendment provides that statistics of the cost of production of all goods manufactured in Australia, and of the landed cost of all goods imported into Australia shall be obtained.

Quite apart from the price of imported articles, we have only to refer to the cost of boots. The price of hides, plus the cost of tanning, is the basic cost. The prices of boots are chiefly determined by the prices of leather. But have the prices of boots declined in sympathy with the reduction in the prices of leather? Only to a very small extent. Boots which up t ill three years ago could be purchased for 12s. 6d. Der pair are to-day being sold at 25s. and 27s. 6d. per pair. I do not desire to go into details regarding the increased prices of many commodities. The little children are familiar with them. But there is one matter which was touched upon by the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( MrM a k in ) to which this Parliament might very well devote its attention. It should spare no effort to deal effectively with the Combines and Rings which exist in the commercial world to-day, and which constitute one of the means by which profiteering is successfully carried on. In particular we should give earnest attention to the honourable understanding amongst our manufacturers that they w ill unload their goods only to warehousemen and soft-goods middlemen: If the consumer could purchase lines of clothing, hats, and boots direct from the manufacturer, the prices of these goods would be Some time ago I reduced by 25 per cent, or 30 per cent. _ hats, which could be some cases. would be reduced by much more than that. If we can bring the .consumer into direct touch with the manufacturer, we shall certainly eliminate the profits of the middlemen, and we shall do something to restore healthy competition. Whatever That wa3 in pre-war may be said by the opponents' of this The same class of hat is now amendment, it certainly contains provisions which would make for the effective control of profiteering.

21,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports) Decision When Only Four Justices May Be,"and in respect of which specific items they are being robbed. If I were to buy a hat branded "" Galatea""I do not know that there is a hat so branded-and if I were to be charged 25s. for it when T knew from a Gazette intimation that such hats had been sold to the retail merchant for 120s. a dozen, I would perceive that the shopkeeper was trying to make a profit of 150 per cent, out of me. The fact of the price having been publicly gazetted would make the most daring profiteer hesitate. The trouble is, however, that the retailer might get out of his difficulty by erasing the original brand, and selling the hat under another name-no t gazetted, of course-stil l at 150 per cent, profit. was in better form when dealing with the constitutional, aspect. I suggest that he revert to that. something of which I have knowledge at the moment. I feel certain that if we were to legislate to compel the gazettal of prices there would be considerably more reluctance on the part of the trading community to profiteer. I must repeat, however, that there would still be opportunities to evade publicity in the matter of prices by changing the branded names of clothing and the like. were to buy from a wholesale house a shirt branded '' Prince of Wales,"" at the rate of 72s. a dozen, and if he were to try to sell me that same shirt for 15s., I would know, upon reference to the Gazette, that he was proposing to make 150 per cent, profit. would put an end to profiteering-so long, I repeat, as the retailer did not evade the publicity of his deal by changing the name of the commodity which he was selling. But I do not wish to in sinuate that the retailer is the only profiteer; he also has his troubles. I see no reason why we should not take these proposed powers to end profiteering. I do not say, of course, that legislation along the lines indicated in the amendment would immediately succeed, for it would be experimental, and might not be perfected straight way. when it was decided to insure corroct weight in respect of the sale of a 2-lb. loaf of bread. Many bakers were fined for selling under weight. brainy man conceived the idea of selling his bread under a fancy name. He called it a French loaf, or something of the kind, and he was then not compelled to guarantee it to be a 2-lb. loaf. The opinion is gaining strength in Australia, as well as in the Old Country, that it would be well to fix the prices of standard articles of clothing, furniture, and other things. That would be very well if everybody were to agree to wear standardized clothing. However, there are too many people who would not be seen in a standardized suit or pair of shoes, and these proud folk would still be prey 'for the profiteers. There are plenty of women who w ill pay as much as £3 10s. for a pair of boots worth really about 25s. Standardized clothing would not appeal to them. However, from empty pride, some may prefer to be robbed, but for those who I am talking about are .civilized, and who are only desirous of wearing clothing for comfort, standardized articles could be supplied. Various Governments in Australia have attempted since 1914 to fix prices, and found it most difficult to do so. It is a difficult task, I admit, but to make such an admission is merely to play into the hands of the direct actionists. They say that it is 'impossible to legislate against If a retailer profiteering, and that relief can be obtained only by direct action. Therefore those who are opposed to direct action must use every means possible to enable Parliament to give effect to the wishes of the people. I have given instances of the way in which the suggestion of the ;Such knowledge honourable member for West Sydney may be evaded; still, by the exercise of common sense, I think it would allow those who are determined not to be robbed an opportunity of preventing to some extent tbe depredations of profiteers. I know that the Government are not prepared to accept the excellent suggestion of the honourable member for West Sydney, whom the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) in the early part of the session proclaimed to be not a constitutional lawyer-of course, he was quite mistaken, because I remember by the cases he has taken to their utmost limi t in, the Courts, and won, the honourable member has proved that he is a constitutional lawyer. They will not accept However, a any suggestion, except, perhaps, One on a matter of small importance, from",26,Judiciary Bill Second Reading

23,,"Mr MATHEWSany honourable member of the Opposition. House will accept from any honourable member a suggestion which is good. We are still obliged to adhere to party government; otherwise we would have strong press rule, which would be even worse. However, although they are not prepared to take the big departure now suggested, I hope the Government will take some of the points from the honourable member's suggestion, even if they dish it up in some other form, so that they may give the people some opportunity of preventing profiteering. If the Government would accept the suggestion put forward, evasion by traders would not be as easy as it is to-day. In the street, one may see a pair of boots advertised at 35s., and in another window a pair marked at 45s. may be of exactly the same make. Of course, a man's pride may lead him to purchase the higher priced article-nothin g on earth Would save a man from wasting his money in that way-bu t there is a great section of the community who do not desire to be robbed, and having a limited amount of cash, and great responsibilities in their homes, cannot afford to waste money for the sake of empty pride. However desirous we may be of placing on the statute-book legislation for the benefit, of the. people, it will not be beneficial to them if they themselves w ill not assist in sire to do this, to advocate it is merely giving effect to it . But the suggestion of the honourable member for West Sydney would at least afford assistance in beating the profiteers. We hear a great deal of talk about the universal desire to bring dowii the high cost of commodities, but to me the possibility of bringing it down seems very remote. My trouble is to prevent prices from rising further, and I believe that if the Commonwealth and State Parliaments were really in earnest, they could prevent the inflation of prices above their present level. Of course, the real value of an article is based upon the amount of profit earned by those who sell it , and if , by any set of circumstances, the vendors are able to force the public to buy at liigher prices, naturally they earn greater profits. The great fear of vested interests to-day is that a crash may follow any drop in prices. When we see cablegrams in the press announcing a drop in prices in other countries, we also see the fear expressed by those who deal in the particular commodities affected and in allied lines that there may The day is far .off when the be a general crash all round. I believe that if ever we have a repetition of the crisis through which the State of Victoria passed in the nineties, there w ill be an enormous drop in prices. It was the working section of the community which suffered most during that crisis. I am willing to risk the charge being levelled against me that I am endeavouring to bolster up profiteering when I declare that I do not wish the people I represent to experience again all the horrors of that period. If it had .not been for the discovery of gold in Western Australia, the people of Victoria would have starved, notwithstanding the fact that, at the time the State was enjoying bountiful, harvests. The boom which preceded the period of depression had deflated prices considerably, and people were making large fortunes out of them, u n t i l the howl for economy arose, and the Paterson Government came into power, and by applying that economy caused a heavy "" f r o s t , "" which was accompanied by a tremendous drop in prices. I have no desire to see that time arrive again But I claim that legislation of the character suggested to-day, if the Government and the people were all desirous of helping, would prevent any further inflation of prices u n t i l we could re-arrange economical conditions in the body politic. Of course, if the Government does not deto talk to the wind. But on three occasions already I have told the people of this State, and I shall continue to do so on every opportunity I get during the present electoral campaign, that the high trend of prices can be stopped if the Federal and State Governments desire to stop it . The State Parliament undoubtedly possesses sovereign powers, though the exercise of those powers may raise this difficulty, that the lessening of the price of a commodity in Victoria may mean that it will be sent to some other State for sale. I understand that we produce only half the hides that are used in the manufacture of leather in this State, and it has been said that were the price of leather reduced, hides would no longer be sent here from other States. Therefore, the State oowers have their limitations. Surely, however, the people have now arrived at the knowledge that the only Parliament that could deal effectively with profiteering is the Commonwealth Parliament. It is said that we have not now the necessary power, though a recent decision of the High Oourt considerably modified the view previously expressed as to our position. The proposed Convention for the alteration of the Constitution may take years to do anything, and if in the interim we can prevent the rise of prices, we should t r y to do so. The amendment of the honourable member for West Sydney provides an opportunity. Every member must admit that were effect given to it , traders could not continue to rob the people with their present impunity.. As for the alteration of the law proposed by the Government, in my opinion it will mean that on high constitutional questions a threepower vote may govern a seven-power organization. Of course, one of the four Judges not sitting on the case might agree with the three who dealt with it ; but, on the other hand, four of the seven Judges might'hold an opinion contrary to the decision of the three who determined the matter. ""Under a proposal like this we get no stability, and, although the M in ister may t w it me with not being a lawyer, I say that laymen can foresee the effect of laws just as well as lawyers can, and 1 have followed the decisions of the Court on the constitutional powers of this Parliament with fear and trembling. We thought at first that the thirty-nine articles of the Constitution gave us the powers which they were intended to give; but the H i g h Court said that that was not so, and we have been floundering ever since. The honourable member for West Sydney, however, has conceived a (method whereby we may frighten the profiteers from charging high prices, and I think that the Government should adopt it . A conference of women that recently (met in Melbourne determined that they would discontinue the wearing of gloves u n t i l the prices of these articles became more reasonable. A mere man, perhaps, Las no right to enter upon what may be regarded as the preserves of the womeniulk, but I have often said in my own family circle that the wearing of gloves does not enhance a woman's appearance, and that they are not necessary except in biting cold weather. For a woman to wear gloves on a swelteringly hot day is to make herself uncomfortable. women know how difficult it is nowadays to get much for £ 1 , and I believe, with them, that the public would do much to bring down prices if it resolved to abstain from the purchase of many articles for which it is now charged an exorbitant rate. Buti n striving to reduce expenditure a f a m i l y might deprive itself of commodities absolutely necessary for the sustenance of its members, and no Parliament could stand idly by and allow such sacrifices. It may be said, "" The people have the remedy for the present state of affairs in their own hands;' let them take it "" ; but a Parliament that had the power to reduce high prices, and did not do so, would be unworthy. The 'Hungarian Parliament has passed laws imposing penalties for profiteering, and has enacted, among other things, that, a person found guilty of charging excessive rates for goods shall be taken into a public square, there to receive so many strokes of the cane. elsewhere for my examples. getting a long way from the measure before the House. all-embracing, and it is the real essence of the B ill . for the withdrawal of the B ill . we had a law like that of Hungary, so that a member of a big Flinders-lane f i r m found guilty of charging too highly for goods might be ordered, a public flagellation in one of our parks?

In the Bulletin .of Australian Statistics, No. 80, compiled by Mr Knibbs, there will be found, on page 73, a table dealing with the purchasing power of money, showing the amounts necessary, on the average, in each year from 1901 to the second quarter of 1920, to purchase in each capital town what would have cost, on the average, £ 1 in 1911, in the .Australian capitals regarded as a whole. the purchase of groceries and food, house rents, and also ''generally.""

However, we expect that sort of conduct from them. say that this Government has done one good action, and then you will die. case, I shall never die. I should deserve to die if I said such a thing, because it this Bill, to confer that power on the would be untrue. I venture to predict that the Government will die first, which will be a very good thing. comes back I lieve the ex-Treasurer will say many worse things against the Government than I have said, and then the sudden death for which the Treasurer is not looking may come sooner than he expects. I am pleased that the opportunity is now given to the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) to speak to his amendment. I hope something will be done to redness the grievances under which the people are suffering to-day through, the .prevalence of profiteering. The Treasurer endeavoured to throw cold water, on the very telling facts brought forward by the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton), who showed that in Queensland, according to the latest figures published, the cost of living and by the time it got through Flindersis less than in any other State of the Commonwealth. honorahle member say that. quoted the figures for the respective capitals of the States to show that the cost of living was less in Queensland than in any other State. That is a fact, because the figures are published by the Federal Statistician, and I am sure that even the Treasurer will accept them. It will, of course, be said .that the Government have no power to deal with the profiteer. That has often been said' before; but here is an opportunity to confer ample power, by means of a Judiciary Bill, upon the High Court and die other Courts of the Commonwealth and the States, to call upon manufacturers to furnish a statement of the manufactured cost of articles.. Those can then be traced right along the road from the producer to the consumer, and an estimate formed of what should be a fair profit upon any particular commodity. fied with the High Court as an investigating tribunal. We have an opportunity, by means of High Court. No doubt the people who are suffering as the result of the profiteering that is going on will watch proceedings with intense interest, ih order to see whether the Government take advantage of the chance offered' to them to bring about an improvement of the conditions under which they have been compelled to live for the last four or five years. The honourable member for Maribyrnong spoke of woollen goodB; Two months ago I visited the woollen mills in the electorate of the honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister). They are doing splendid work. The honourable member for .Flinders( Mr Bruce) has previously attempted to throw cold water on any statement of this character) but I now say, deliberately, that the sub-manager of this particular mill assured me that material that was turned out by themthis was two or three months ago-a t 12s. per yard went into Flinders-lane, lane its price was 30s. per yard.

140,Mr Gboom,"To some extent, at allhuge dividends declared by these firms who are standing between the producer and the consumer show that profiteering is being indulged in, with the result that we have to pay enormously enhanced prices for clothing-as much as £14 14s. and £15 15s. for a suit which in pre-war days could have been obtained for £4 4s. or £5 5s. As an illustration of the way in which these people are preying upon the simplicity of the consumers, I may remind honourable members that on the day that the Victorian Fair Profits Commission, which is supposed to be making a serious investigation into this question of costs of production, but which is practically useless to all intents and purposes, granted an application for permission to increase the price of bacon to Is. l i d . per lb., the Victorian Government gazetted the acceptance of a tender for the supply of bacon to the railway refreshment-rooms at Is. 5d. per lb. workers are being robbed to the extent of 6d. per lb. that the increase granted by the Fair Profits Commission, compared with the' accepted tender price for the railway refreshment-rooms represents a tax of 6d. per lb. upon the general public. It is an unwarranted increase in the price of an important commodity. I do not wish to delay the House longer, as I am anxious that a vote shall be taken on this question. Members opposite have shown by interjection that they agree that profiteering is going on; and, while tbey agree with us to that extent, it is not their deelections, the Leader of the Opposisire to do anything to prevent it. Here is an opportunity for members to show their sincerity, and to get right down to bedrock. I claim that the Government have the power to move in this matter, because they could not do what has been suggested in regard to profiteering under the Tariff, or in regard to coal under the Industrial Peaoe Act, if they have not the power. The recent decision of the High Court has completely changed the opinions that were previously held, and has absolutely shattered our oid-time convictions as to what power Parliament possesses. authority in a direction in which we previously thought our hands were tied. I do not think it can be said by members opposite that we have not very extensive authority to deal with the great evil of profiteering, and this is our opportunity to show how sincere we really are. This is our chance to get down to bedrock and to do our work as a Parliament in stamping out the profiteer who is inflicting such hardships upon the people of the Commonwealth. > This Bill first came before the House in April last, and shortly after it was introduced the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr 'Groom) moved a motion which had the effect of altering its position on the notice-paper. I opposed that motion, and gave my reasons for doing so. I said at the time that it was imperative that something should be done by Parliament to deal with profiteering; but the Government had their way, and the Bill was placed well down on the notice-paper. I immediately gave notice of an amendment to be moved on the motion for the second reading, the object of which was to have a comprehensive measure introduced conferring the powers upon the High Court of Australia to make the necessary investigations into the profits that were being made by local manufacturers and importers. As soon as that notice was given tlie measure was dropped to the bottom of the notice-paper, and remained there for some months-unti l last Fridaywhen the Government suddenly discovered that the measure was an urgent one. I am glad to learn that, in my absence, assisting in the Queensland tion ( Mr Tudor) moved the amendment of which I had given notice, with ' the result that we are able to discuss it this afternoon. I do not know what reasons the Minister in charge of the Bill gave for treating the measure as an urgent one at this juncture.

144,Mr Ryan (West Sydney) [5.48],"upon constitutional questions. An amendment is to be made in the Act of 1912 which made it necessary for a majority of the whole Bench to concur in any decision declaring an Act of this Parliament invalid. In 1912, in supporting the measure which made it necessary to haye an absolute majority of the full Bench, the present Prime Minister( Mr cause is the profiteering that is allowed to Hughes) saidA law ought to be declared unconstitutional of appointing Committees to investigate only when it is obviously so. This can be clearly indicated only when a majority of the Justices of tlie High Court are of the opinion that it is unconstitutional. Then nothing furfact that profiteering is the main cause of ther cnn be said. But the people and Parliament have a right to complain when their deliberate enactments are set on one side, although a majority of the Justices of the High Court is not of the opinion that they are unCourt for the different .States, the power constitutional. That is taken from Hansard, volume 69, page 7097, and gives the reasons of the Prinie Minister for inserting the provision which the Government now propose to repeal. They now make it possible for a minority of Justices of the High Court of Australia to declare an Act of this Parliament unconstitutional. I ask the Ministeri f that is not the proposal of the Government? minority of the Justices of the High Court of Australia will be able to declare an Act of this Parliament invalid, although a majority may think-if they have the opportunity to confer-that the Act is quite valid. Prime Minister's reasons for amending the Act in 1912, and I know of no reasons being advanced for repealing that provision. Were any representations made by the Justices of the High Court? If so, what were they? When were they made, and is that the purpose of this amendment? 1915 was one which would operate during the war period, and now it is proposed that that shall continue indefinitely. What urgency is there in a measure of this sort? There is very great urgency, indeed, in having a measure that will enable a proper investigation to be made into the question of profiteering. Every one,even the Ministers on the Treasury bench, admits that profiteering is going on. They also admit that they are not doing anything, and say that they have not the power. The Government bring into this Chamber measures to deal with industrial unrest, including an Industrial Peace Bill, and an amendment of the Arbitration Act. They elaborately set about appointing bodies to investigate the causes of industrial unrest, although they know perfectly well that the most prolific exist in the commuuity. What is the use this matter, and to go into the causes, when we wilfully blind ourselves to the industrial unrest? We are refusing to confer upon a tribunal such as the High Court of Australia, or the Supreme to investigate the matters to which I have referred. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition is not intended to wreck this Bill, although it would not matter if it were wrecked, because there is hardly anything in it. Our object is to get a more comprehensive measure immediately introduced. tend to wreck the Bill? the Treasurer ( Sir Joseph Cook) to ""mouth"" about wrecking the Bill. member who is doing the "" mouthing,"" and not me. to confer upon the High Court the power I have quoted the to investigate the profits made by local manufacturers and importers.

No one knows better than the Government that they have the power, but they refuse to exercise it. Now they will have an opportunity. We are taking The amendment made in the only opportunity that is afforded us of making a'move in this direction. The Government are in charge of the business of the House, and can bring forward whatever they like; and it is not often that we have the opportunity of amending their proposals.

He is actuated by a highsouled desire to prevent profiteering. Yet, when there was an opportunity of conferring upon this Parliament by constitutional means the power to deal with the evil of which he complains, he asked the people to turn the proposal down and to leave Parliament impotent in the matter. endeavouring to cover up his tracks. Upon previous occasions the honourable member has raised party cries for political purposes.

It is significant that the profiteering to which the honourable member refers is almost in variably associated by him with the food tliat we eat-wit h our primary products. That is the profiteering which he is so eager to attack. He has affirmed that it is our duty to show reasons why his amendment should not be carried. If he adopted that attitude in a Court the Judge would promptly say to him, "" You are putting forward an affirmative proposition, and it is your duty to establish it . "" The honourable member says that he is not out to wreck the B ill ; but that statement sounds strangely in the light of his amendment, which proposes the omission of all the words after "" t h a t , "" with a view to in serting other words in lieu thereof. The purpose of the amendment is obviously :to block the measure. He desires the B ill to be absolutely withdrawn, and the Government to introduce a measure to confer jurisdiction upon the High Court to investigate certain matters and, inter alia, to provide for the furnishing of statistics. Practically he wishes to convert the H i gh Court of Australia into a sub-Department of the Department of Statistics. That is the effect of his amendment. He desires to make a judicial body, which has been endowed with the highest functions under our Constitution, nothing Of course but a sub-Department under Mr Knibbs. His amendment purports to deal with profiteering. But he knows that under the Constitution this Parliament cannot effectively deal with that question, that the powers over trade and commerce are exceedingly .limited, and that this Parliament can in reality deal only with Inter-State and external commerce. He knows, also, from the inquiries on the subject of profiteering which are proceeding in Australia to-day He is now that, if nrofiteering is to be dealt w it h effectively, we must get right down to the individual transactions within the States, because, after a l l , this is essentially an Intra-State problem. If we look at the methods by which it is being attacked in every country in the world That cry it will become apparent that it is individual transactions which must Let honourable members study the Profiteering Acti n Queensland. Let them iook at the proposals for dealing with this evil which are at present before the New South Wales Parliament. Take the inquiries which are being conducted in Victoria to-day, and it will be seen that, in order to deal effectively with profiteering individual cases have to be reached. Federal legislation cannot affect that matter, it being generally one of Intra-State trade. The honourable member's proposal is merely a bluff. It seeks to empower the H i g h Court Justices to do something which can be done just as effectively by somebody else, it aims at bringing about a perversion of the functions of the Justices of the H i gh Court. Of course there is Federal power to deal w it h statistics, and we were effectively exercising that power long before the honourable member came here.

S. essence of the B ill . The necessity for this Livingston, J. measure arises, not from any political cirMackay, G-. H cumstances, but because of the position Maxwell, G. A. in which the Judiciary has found Poynton, A. itself in carrying on its work. Let me Rodgers, A. S. trace the history of this matter. In 1902 Smith, Laird the H i g h Court consisted of a Chief JusTellers: tice and 'two justices These three carried Fleming, W. M. on the work u n t i l 1906, and decisions Marr, C. W. C. were l e f t practically to the m a j o r it y of the Courtf o r the time being. In 1906 Page, Jamesi t became advisable to strengthen the Ryan, T. J. . H i g h Court Judiciary,' and the number of -Justices was increased by two. Then, Mahony, W. G. again, the majority prevailed. By 1912 Riley, E. the work of the H i g h Court had grown very much, and its difficulties had been Cunningham, L . so considerably increased by arbitral Anstey, F. work that it became necessary to again West, J. E. strengthen the Bench by the appointment Makin, N . J. 0. of two additional Justices.

H . tween Commonwealth and State legislation, or as to whether a State has exercised certain powers in conflict with those of the Commonwealth. Parliament accordingly passed a law providing that in a F u l l Court consisting of less than a l l the Justices no.decision should be given on matters affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth unless a majority of all the Judges concurred in it . In other words, although there might be six or seven justices sitting in the F u l l Court, at least f o u r Justices had to be in agreement.",43,Moloney The Y Thin G Practical I F So We Will Help You

It must not be forgotten that Justices get leave of absence from time to time, but there is no power to appoint a Deputy Justice of the High Court. If it is wished to add to the Bench while any Justice is absent, a Justice of the Court must be appointed: Powers is away on leave of absence, but even before he went away the Court found itself hampered in carrying onits work because of the provisionof the Act requiring decisions on such constitutional matters to begiven by four Justices. two Justices areconstantly engaged, in the Arbitration Conrt amendment -it is sought to enable the arose at the beginning of this year in connection with a judgment given quite recently as to the extent to which the Commonwealth could by its legislation interfere with State instrumentalities.

There has already been one very important case in connection, with the eastwest railway, which necessitated a Justice being away fromVictoria for a considerable time. Then there is the work cast on the Justices under the arbitration laws. Consequently it has been found very difficult to get the necessary . quorum for a sitting of the Pull. Court. Furthermore, the Justices must have tice Powers,, whois returning shortly, thoroughly deserved his leave, being: almost, broken, in health by 'the continuous strain of attention to arbitrationduties-; but Mr Justice Isaacs, who has not had a holiday since his appointment in 1906,. is now going on leave, so that there will still be only six Justices in active emi ployment. It is not desirable to appoint an additional Justice, and, therefore, the obtaining of the quorum, required under existing law, to constitute a Court for the decision of constitutional questions has become a practical difficulty, and it has been suggested that the Act might 'be amended by allowing such questions to be decided by a judgment concurred in. by three Justices. It does not necessarily follow that every constitutional question will be decided by three Justices only. It is certain that on any big At present, Mr Justice issue arising, involving a reconsideration of the fundamental provisions of the Constitution or a revision of very important judgments, the Chief Justice would convene as large a Court. as he could get. 1 It sometimes happens, however, that cases, which involve the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth are not of such great importance.

W it h all deference to the Minister( Mr Groom), I hold that his explanation ment in favour of increasing number of Justices of the H i g h Court. Sof a r as I can gather, the only reason for the proposed change is that the preseut Justices are overworked. It must be remembered that there is absolutely no appeal from the decision of the Court in constitutional cases, although from time to time issues vitally affecting a State may arise through a conflict between Commonwealth and State authorities. I ' can conceive of no more serious questions coming before the Court than those affecting the respective rights of the Commonwealth and a State. In other countries where there has been a surrender by States to a Federal Government, difficulties have arisen, and Ave know that a difference between a large and powerful State and the Commonwealth might become very serious. It was not enough for the Minister to say that in a very i m portant case more than three Justices would sit. Ministeri n charge of a B ill is always a most dangerous procedure. It is not the speech of the Minister, but the wording of the Act, that declares what is the law. They have In matters affecting the sovereign rights of the States, we should require a better reason than the convenience of the Justices of the H i g h Courtf o r an alteration of the existing law regarding the adjudication of constitutional cases; and unless a better reason is given, the Committee should hesitate about agreeing to the proposal of the Government. The remarks of the honourable member for replied to by the Minister( Mr. Groom). A t the present time, four Justices of the High Court must concur before. a law can be declared unconstitutional, and the Minister has given no reason why this arrangement should be departed from . It may be that some representation on the subject has been made by the H i g h Court. If so, the Committee should be favoured with it. I quoted, earlier in the day, the reasons given by the Prime Minister( Mr. Hughes) for requiring a majority of the whole of the Justices of the Court before a law could be declared invalid. He paidamounted to an arguTlie law ought to be declared unconstituthe tional only when it is.obviously so. This can be clearly indicated only when a majority of Justices of the High Court is of the opinion that it is unconstitutional. Then nothing further can be said. But the people and Parliament have a right to complain if their deliberate enactments are set on one side, although a majority of the Justices of the High Court is not of the opinion that it is unconstitutional. Those reasons hold as strongly to-day ns when they were uttered, unless in the practical working of the Act something has occurred which makes it inconvenient to proceed under it . Perhaps the M in ister w ill be good enough to explain to us what has happened to make the arguments that I have just read inapplicable.

I have pointed out that the reason why it was enacted in 1912 that no decision on questions affecting the constitutional powers of the Commonwealth should be given by the F u l l Court unless at least four Justices were in agreement, was that the number of Justices of the H i g h Court had been increased from five to seven, and that it appeared at the time desirable to insist upon this requirement. I have also informed the Committee that, up to that time, many decisions on constitutional questions had been given by a majority of two out of three Justices, and in other cases by a majority of three out of five. that time concur in the measure requiring a majority of four out of seven? tempted to make party politics out of a matter affecting the welfare of the country. ThisB ill originates from the difficulty which the Judiciary has in providing for a Court with the majority required. argument for the proposed change. explaining the origin of the B ill . that we are now proposing is that, on constitutional questions, it shall be' sufficient if at least three Justices concur in the decision. That is a safe proposition for the Committee to accept. does not follow that the F u l l Court will always be constituted of three, or even five. Justices. As many Justices as are available are always summoned. Attorney-General has no r i g h t to interfere w i th the administration of justice except to assist the Judiciary to carry out its duties by providing the necessary conveniences. He has no power to determine what the constitution of the Court shall be. That is a matter for the Justices themselves to decide in accordance w it h the regular practice of the Judiciary. presentations as to this matter ? plained that this proposal arises from difficulties in which the Court has been placed, and to which the attention of the Government has been drawn. There is great pressure of business awaiting the attention of the Court, and this measure is therefore one of urgency.

It may be that three Justices are sufficient to decide any question, but it i.s idle to spin from one point of this argument to the other just as one is found for the time being to be untenable. It is idle to tell us that this alteration is being made merely because the Bench has been reduced in numbers by the fact that certain members of it are away, and then, when it is pointed out that that is an almost flippant reason for effecting such a change, to inform us that in any case the number provided for under this clause is sufficient, although the Prime Minister himself was most emphatic in declaring that it was not. inconsistency which the Government might well clear up. have given the reasons from the .present Government's stand-point as guished from, the stand-point of the Opposition in 1912, for this retrogressive move on their paTt.

If the Parliament does not know what the people want I am sure the High Court does not. A Judge is often governed in his decisions by his environment. As a rule, a Judge does not keep pace with the times. I agree with all that has been said by the Minister( Mr Groom) in regard to the first three occupants of the High Court Bench.

I believe that we can do things "" of f our own bat,"" without looking to the Empire. We are elected to represent the people of Australia, and to make laws for the Commonwealth to the best of our ability. When a law which has been passed by this Parliaiment is tested in the H i g h Court its validity is decided by men who have not been elected by the people, but have been appointed by a Minister because they happen to be friends of the Government, or may stand at the head of the Bar. Political parties may have appealed to the country in connection with the passing of a certain law. Its enactment may have received the endorsement of the people, and yet its validity is, under this B ill , to be lef t to the decision of three Justices of the H i gh Court.

Some honourable members are very much concerned about the. decision of constitutional questions involving rights between the Commonwealth and the States; and I point out, for their consolation, that Part XII . of the Judiciary Act of 1910 is not affected by this B ill .

245,Sir Robert Best,"I do not recallpart of an Act, was ultra vires. Parliament therefore decided to adopt an inexpensive process, at the cost of the Commonwealth itself, of ascertaining the true interpretation of the law, where it was contemplated that the interests of the States might be involved. It is compulsory that the States shall be notified, that the Attorneys-General of the several States shall have the right to appear, and that a majority of the Full Bench, if present in Australia, shall determine the true interpretation. Those provisions referring to constitutional questions are not affected by this amending Bill. they ? 94. The fears of the honourable member honourable member for Dampier( Mr wealth. It is not an ordinary case beGregory) regarding the rights and interests of the States are not Well grounded, because those rights and interests are, to some extent, protected by the terms of the Judiciary Act itself. In the vast majority of matters which come before the High Court, the practical difficulties which have been experienced under the present law, and which have involved serious congestion and delay, will be overcome by the Bill, which I commend to the Committee. The honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) has put before the Committee a provision of the Judiciary Act that has never yet been put into operation. The point he has brought forward in no way touches cases affecting the rights of this Parliament on the one hand aud of the States on the other. tant decision has recently been given by the High Court, that State instrumentalities come under the operation of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. That is a case which materially affects the legislation of this Parliament and the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States. Any similar case materially affecting the powers of the Commonwealth or of the States, and the interpretations of the Constitution, ought to be decided by all the Judges available. I quite agree that in ordinary cases coming before the High Court the Bill meets the situation, but where a case affects the right of this Parliament or of the State Parliaments to enact legislation, we are in duty bound by the compact entered into when the Constitution was framed and accepted by the people, to see that no decision is given except by the majority of the Judges who are available. speaks of "" the majority of the Judges who are available."" Six Judges might mean three on one side and three on the other. that fact, and in such an event the opinion sections, are of the side on which the Chief Justice gave his opinion would prevail; but still we should have six men deciding a big constitutional question affecting every man, woman, and child in the Commontween litigants, but a matter affecting the ambit of our Constitution. If the Minister( Mr Groom) can satisfy me that the Bill will affect only. ordinary cases, leaving the position so far as concerns constitutional matters between the States and the Commonwealth as it now is, I shall vote for it. I am not prepared to vote for a Bill that will put into the hands of three men the power to decide in favour either of the Commonwealth, or the States on matters affecting the vital relationship of the Commonwealth and the States under the Constitution. do not wish to urge any increase in the number of Justices, because we know the necessity for economy all round. I can see no necessity for increasing their numbers, but the question of the constitutional rights either of the Commonwealth An imporParliament or of the State Parliaments is of vast importance, and cannot be dealt with lightly. I should be quite prepared to accept the amendment of the Act as advocated by the Minister( Mr Groom) if we could add words to provide that, where a majority did not agree, an appeal either by the Commonwealth or the States should lie to the Privy Council.

Act was originally introduced it had no limitation of time whatsoever. limitation was put in at the suggestion of the Opposition of the day. The power which it is sought to continue is contained in sectious 2 and 3 of the Judiciary Act 1915. The Constitution vests in the H i g h Court original jurisdiction in regard to matters(i) Arising under any Treaty; (-ii) Affecting Consuls or other representatives of otlier countries; (iii) In which the Commonwealth or a person suing or being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth is a party; (iv) Between States or between residents of different States, or between a State and a resident of another State; (v) In which a writ of mandamus or prohibition or an injunction is sought against an officer of the Commonwealth. In addition to those powers so conferred upon the H i g h Court, section 76 of the Constitution provides that the Parliament may make laws conferring original jurisdiction on a H i g h Courti n any matter(i) Arising under this Constitution or involving its interpretation; (ii) Arising under any laws made by the Parliament; (iii) Of Admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ; (iv) Relating to the same subject-matter claimed under the laws of different States. In 1914 the law was altered to give the Court jurisdiction-in addition to matters arising out of' the Constitution, or involving its interpretation-in ques-, tions relating to Admiralty or maritime jurisdiction. Another additional power was given in the Act of 1915, in relation to trials for indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. It was felt that the High Court, which is a specially constituted body for exercising judicial powers of the Commonwealth, should have jurisdiction in trials of indictable offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. able member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan) objects to the High Court having the power in relation to indictable ' offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. When that used for the reason that the exercise of criminal jurisdiction is a matter for the This State Courts. Such Courts sit in many parts of the Commonwealth, and cases ought, as a rule, to.be tried where-the offences are committed.
