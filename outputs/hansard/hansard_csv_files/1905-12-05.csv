It is considered to be so, as the special rate their duties according to tbe new classification? referred to is required in connection with the guarantee provided for in an agreement entered into between the State of Tasmania and the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company, prior to the transfer of the telegraph service to the CommonWealth, and it was at the request of the Tasmanian Government, provided for in the Post find Telegraph Rates Act 1902. The subsidy referred to is also included in that agreement. 2. Telegraph charges within the Commonwealth are regulated and governed by the Post and Telegraph Rates Act 1902, and they cannot be altered without legislation. asked the Postmaster-General, upon notice1. Are the Victorian letter-carriers to be reduced to rates provided in the Classification scheme next month, or when? z. Has any Attorney-General advised that section 19 of Act No. 1721 of Victoria does not preserve existing and accruing rights under the Constitution ? 3. Are only those transferred officers affected by section i q of Act No. T721 of Victoria to be reduced, while other officers under the same Act retain status and pay conferred under such Act? 4. Why is there this difference ? swers to the honourable and learned member's questions are as f o l l o w : 1. They were paid reduced rates from ist November, 1905, in accordance with the classification of the Public Service. 2. An Attorney-General has advised that notwithstanding the Act No. 1721 of Victoria, the salaries paid under that Act can be reduced legally by classification under the Public Service Act of the Commonwealth. 3. The status and pay of all transferred officers depend upon their classification under the Public Service Act of the Commonwealth. 4. All officers who obtained increases under Act-1721, whether under section 19 or any other section, have been allowed to retain such increased salaries where the work has been classified as of corresponding value.

We have decreed that strikes and other forms of industrial warfare shall cease to exist, and 'that disputes between employers and employees shall be settled in the calm and dispassionate atmosphere of a judicial or semi-judicial tribunal.

In view of rhe amendments It which the Attorney-General has promised to bring forward, T do not distinguish between the employer and the employee. It is. proposed to give to both si'des opportunitiesto enforce their demands by means of strife. The debate upon the measure I say that anything which tends to increase the opportunities for quarrel, anything which tends to make mote potent and effective, the weapons which each side carr use in a quarrel, is not what we have come to expect, or hope for.

As one who has. long, hoped to see Australia continue to work in the direction of making peace more certain, I am very sorry to seeproposals made, which, in my judgment, will make for war between class and class.

31,Mr Watson,"Honorabl e members, in",15,Trade Marks Bill
32,Mr Mccay,"Honorabl e members do.sures as will make for peaceful settlement, lather than such as will inevitably bring about industrial warfare. Honourable members who have spoken in advocacy of these proposals have stated that they will enable the public to know what goods are being made under fair conditions relating to hours of work, sanitation, wages, and kindred matters. They have urged that the public wants, and even if it does not consciously want, should have, an opportunity to know under what conditions goods are made, in order that they may by their purchases assist to. increase the consumption of goods made under fair -conditions, and to limit the consumption of those made under unfair and sweating conditions. I suppose that is an object with which we can all agree. We wish to see production in this community carried on in such a way that all concerned are fairly and decently treated. It is not proposed to certify by means of the union label that goods are made under fair conditions, but only that they are made by an association, corporate or unincorporate, that has registered a workers' trade mark. More than that, tbe legal sin committed by a breach of the conditions sought to be imposed is not the making of the goods under unfair conditions, but the pretence that the goods are made by the members of a certain association when they have not been so made. It does not matter whether the association in question works under fair conditions or otherwise. prevent an association of sweaters from registering a workers' trade mark. MrM c CAY that a sweater would do would be to register a workers' trade mark. He could use what words and symbols he liked, and he would not be compelled to fully describe the facts. He might say that the goods were made by the X.Y.Z. union, and that would convey no information to the public, except in cases where they were already acquainted with the nature of such a union. The public may be made aware of the existence of a mechanics' union, and, to a limited extent, of its object, which may be a perfectly legitimate one. The trade mark in such an instance mayconvey some indirect information, but that will not be the most common case. What is the use of saying that individual workers will be treated on the same basis as great corporations or unions, because they will be able to register a workers' trade mark? If John Brown, working under proper conditions, registers his individual trade mark, what knowledge of John Brown will that convey to the public of Australia? How can they get any information as to the conditions under which his goods are made? But in the case of one of these great unions, that mark would become a lever, not merely for industrial purposes, but for other purposes which I need not mention, because they are uppermost in the minds of all honourable members. In other words, these proposals will only tend to give information to the public in cases where the unions are widespread and powerful. In the case of small unions or individuals, the workers' trade mark will be as useless as anything conceivably can be. Therefore, the proposal to put individuals, or small associations formed for the purposes of this B ill , upon the same basis as the great unions which have political aims is nothing but a pretence. that the Government proposal will give the individual the same actual advantagesI admit that it will give him the same technical advantages-as it confers upon a large and powerful union. A t first sight it may seem to be impartiaj in its application, but as a matter of fact it is not impartial in the way that it professes to be; and, therefore, I think it is unwise to embody it in this measure. There is another point to which I desire briefly to refer. I pass away from what I have been saying, because I wish to bring my remarks to a conclusion as speedily as possible. I deN o ; and the first thing sire to emphasize a point which was made by the honourable member for Moira in his speech on Friday last. He pointed out thaf under this Bill unknown country workers, or even an association of countryworkers, engaged in exactly the same calling as those employed in the cities will be placed at a great disadvantage, inasmuch as their marks will convey no impression to the public mind, and therefore will be of no service. ber for Moira. made some fine points in his other speech. second thoughts are best, as a wholesome proverb says, and I do not agree with the view that, in his speech on Friday last,",15,Trade Marks Bill

37,Mr Mccay,"Even if that be so,the honourable member went back upon what .lie had previously said. repeat both speeches. MrM c CAY course open to the honourable member is to point out how hairmoinious are the two utterances in question. It is said that these union labels are to be affixed to goods for the purpose of shewing that they have besn made uncier fair conditions. Surely the inevitable inference which the public will draw from that is that goods without that mark have not been produced under fair conditions. But such an inference will be absolutely incorrect, because wherever industries are carried on under Wages Boards, or under awards of the Arbitration Court, they will be working under similar conditions, irrespective of whether the goods are produced by union or non-union labour. I quite admit that the Wages Board system does not extend as far as it should do. Tliat, however, is not my fault. I always assisted to extend it whenever I had the opportunity. Mr. learned member is amongst those who are opposed to Wages Boards. "" No case; abuse the plaintiff's attorney."" I am giving my reasons for opposing the Government proposal. My reasons may not be the same as those entertained by others who are adopting a similar course. learned member is in favour of Wages Boards, but against their operation. proposal, wherever non-unionists engaged in an industry are working under an award of the Arbitration Court, an implied falsehood will be told every time the union label is not attached to their goods. I ask, "" Are we to give legislative force to these grossly, unfair implications"" ? There are plenty of 'factories in which employees are working, under conditions l'ust as fair and righteous as those which obtain uncier Arbitration Court awards, or under the Wages Board system.

In the first place, I do not think that a daily newspaper throughout Australia has been in their favour.

We have also had the advantage of the clear and exhaustive exposition of these provisions which was given last Thursday by the Attorney-General, who made a most searching examination of the position, as shown by the American cases. I trust that the honourable and learned gentleman's address will be printed and distributed amongst such honourable members as may wish to obtain copies, because, if ever there was a time when it was necessary for us to supplement the in""formation given by the daily newspapers and through other sources, it is the present.

I hold that when the question is put in that simple form, those who object to make men liable to a penalty for lying and deceiving, their customers, take upon themselves a verygreat responsibility. Several points have been made absolutely clear, but, unfortunately, they have not been fairly published in the press. The first of these is that any employer who uses union labour, may use union labels without asking leave. That is not the case in the United States, and, I think, that it is one of the advantages of the proposal now before us. 0 ing the alteration of verbiage, these clauses arstill provide for a union label? kernel of the issue. I do not by any means adopt the position of those who say that it is hypocritical to speak of these as I am not surprised at workers' labels. Such a contention is absolutely wrong. I recognise that these labels will be used for the most part by the unions, but, at the same time, the fact that the boon, such as it is, will not be confined to unions, brings prominently into relief the point that no advantage will be given to unions which is not to be given to every one else who asks for it . to indicate that any commodity is made by a worker?

There we ha.ve hall marks treated as trade marks in a Trade Marks Act, and in each case can a the goods to which they are applied do not belong to the proprietor of the mark. I refer to those provisions merely as showing I shall refer the honthe principle; there is nothing whatever exceptional in keeping quite separate the proprietorship of the goods and the proprietorship of the mark. Our opponents scarcely recognise what a compliment they are paying, by their arguments, to the unions. Although in Australia only one worker in ten-the proportion, perhaps, is less-is a unionist, our opponents thLnk that the public will rush for the goods made by unionists as against those made by non-unionists. On the one hand, the extreme popularity which, unions have achieved among the working classes is shown by the fact that they regard them as their champions and their warriors. I know of many men who long to belong.to a union, but are not allowed, and dare not join one. AtI could wish that some the same time they look to the unions to fight their battles for them. Looking back at the History of unionism in Australia, I feel that it is most fortunate that .the unionists have taken up the labour moveUnder ment. The labour movement has been kept on a safe and sound course by the fact of its having been taken up by these organized bodies. As bearing on the question of unionism, I have extracted a short passage from Industrial Democracy, by That stage will remain; Sidney and Beatrice Webb. At page 817 they point out thatThe organized trades are vitally concerned in the abolition of "" sweating"" in all occupations whatsoever, whether these compete with them for For incustom by .manufacturing for the same demand, or for the means of production by diverting the organizing capacity and capital of the nation. And this self-interest of the better-paid trades coincides, as we have seen, with the welfare of the community, dependent as this is on securing the utmost development of health, intelligence, and character in the weaker as well as in the stronger sections. There are no persons who have given such a thorough-going study to trades unions, and to the conditions of trade unionists, My as have these writers, who were here a few years ago. They have there put it most truly that the self-interest of the betterpaid trades-that is the trades in unionTh-at has coincides with the welfare of the community, and that it is to their interest to see that there is no sweating. The greatest drawback that the unions have is the great number of sweating trades around tbem upon which unjust employers draw in a crisis. The whole of this framework depends, happily, upon public opinion. If",19,Higgins Th E Honourable And

I recollect that years ago a number of persons never bought cotton goods. Why? Simply because they knew that cotton goods were made with slave labour. There they had a way of knowing whether the goods were slave-made or not. They could buy linen or cotton, but they always bought linen. do not see why we should not allow persons who wish to buy union or non-union goods to know whether goods have been made Jby; iunionisits or by non-unionists. Those who wish to buy clean and wholesome goods made by clean and wholesome jaersons under clean and wholesome conditions ought to be allowed to do so. We desire to increase the liberty of the people. In the North American Review for 1897, volume 165, there are two articles, one being for the label and the other against it. The former article is by Miss Kelly, who says that the trade unions never urge the union label amongst 'the employers; but they urge the purchasers to ask for labelled goods, and she adds that when the ethical sense of the community is so highly developed that no one will wear a garment for 1 which just wages have not been paid, the sweating shop will disappear. may be wrong, it may be exaggerated. But at the same time. I do not see why she should not be able to buy as she wishes.

There is nothing which annoys me more, personally-and I am glad that he is present while I am saying it-tha n to find him working on the same side as those who, with the same breath, curse both factories legislation and the union label.

I have a habit-it may be a bad habit-of liking to know what is to be said on the other side beforefinally making up my mind.

I say this, especially with regard to the American cases that have been referred to. They are cited in this document as if they had somte jbfearing on the union label, whereas they have no bearing on it whatever. In some parts of tbe statement the writers of it do not choose to look at the more recent amendments put forward by the Attornev-General. They have assumed everything that has been said by newspapers and by interested people in reviews and journals in America, but they would not go into a critical examination of the Bill as it stands. For instance, they sayThe principles underlying the union label have morrow.

The unions But I do know that many of appear to shrink from having the law stated by a tribunal whose decision would prevail in every State in the great American Republic. Would you believe it, sir, that the writers of this document do not know that the Supreme Court of the United States cannot declare upon the constitutionality of a State law at all ? It has no right to declare upon the validity of a State law. Fortunately, our High Court has that right. If any one takes the trouble .to go through this document, they will find-I have looked up the references made in it-that time after time the cases referred to have nothing at all to do with the union label. to the cases quoted in the newspapers here. may be said as to them. For instance, here is a reference to a case in Canada, which is put forward as conclusive against the label. It is a case in which Mr Fullerton gave a certain opinion, which was afterwards approved by the Supreme Court of Ontario. In that case, all that Mr Fullerton said was that a certain by-law of a municipality was beyond its powers. It had passed a by-law which said that the municipal authorities would only accept union-made goods-clothe s and so forth..

The rates of wages in very many cases-a t least it is so in Victoria-wil l be prescribed label to be a trade mark. We 'have a perfect by Wages Boards; in other States under Arbitration Acts. Some honourable members seem to think that the fact of the States having Factories Acts and Arbitration Acts is a reason why we should not have union labels. I venture to think that it is an additional reason for having the union label, because industrial legislation, such as If we take such a thing as a fancy name that referred to, involves more persons working under reasonable conditions. An employer is in a great difficulty when he does not know that his rivals are conducting theiir business under the same terms as himself. But the more you have Factories Acts and Arbitration Acts, the more the employer sees that the same whip will be over the backs of his rivals, as is over his back. I confess that I think that the union label is a mere complement to our Factories Acts and Arbitration Acts. Mr culty in connection with the matter, but the Hoyt winds up by saying that he has no objection to the union label if it can be treated as a guarantee of satisfactory conditions. We, however, know by experience that trade unions are the best guarantee that we can have-the best practical guarantee-of satisfactory conditions. I quite admit that, logically, honourable members may say that there is no reason why there should not be a sweaters' union.

It is a matter upon which-no one can pronounce with certainty. The strong inclination of my own mind is towards thinking that we have power under the Federal Constitution to declare a union right to make laws for the "" peace, order, and good government of the Commonwealth,"" with regard to trade marks ; and, in doing that, we can define what a trade mark is. If we define what a trade mark is, we can make it include more things, or fewer things, as we please. or fancy word, which some laws treat as a trade mark and some do not, is it to be said that we cannot say that we will treat that fancy name or a fancy word as a trade mark? I say that if the Legislature can define it can enlarge, and if it can limit it can also enlarge. I would not presume to deny that the learned counsel, Mr Cussen. who gave an opinion on this matter, had very substantial grounds for his opinion. He has expressed himself as in diffiCommittee should bear ih mind that Mr.1 Cussen's opinion, so far as I have seen it , related to the trade union mark as first put before another place.

I regard the action of the Government, and of the Labour Party, in tacking on those provisions to the Trade Marks Bill as an indication of weakness. A good deal has bean said about the experience of America in regard to the trade union label, and therefore I should like to place before the Committee a few examples of what has occurred thereIn San Francisco, after the 1901 strike, ""burials of the dead were actually impossible, because of the demands of the union gravediggers. The people who patronize the restaurants narrowly escaped going altogether hungry because of the demand of union cooks and waiters. And every time it is the public on whom the expense and inconvenience has really fallen."" "" One restaurant-keeper, MrM . Johnson, has fought the organization since 1901, the other restaurant-keepers giving up the struggle in December, 1903. The boycott of his restaurant has been unruly, and at times insulting. Threats have been used, and even proper police protection only obtained after an appeal to public opinion."" "" San Francisco is a city where labour, even to the boys who se!l gum in the streets, is closely organized and directed by keen business men; the mayor is elected by the Union Labour party; a paid union labour lobby is maintained in the State Legislature; the force of the militia has been effectively reduced at the request of union labour; union labour by the strike and the boycott has monopolized the labour market of the city; and the employer who can face all this opposition is a brave and resourceful man."" "" The demand for union label goods is consequently very great, and the lot of the non-union labourer is hard. He is told to ' join or get off the earth.' "" *' The label is the recognised engine of boycott. Members dealing with a merchant who does not use the label are heavily fined. Public attention is called to the boycott by a sandwich man placed in front of the tabooed shop, and often assisted by a curbstone orator."" "" The union label in many of the States is traded upon unfairly by candidates immediately preceding an election. The label upon a candidate's card is represented as a passport to the good graces of the working classes. This is a species of intimidation."" "" In States where the judiciary is elective there President. are instances of union label litigation that has been influenced by covert threats of the power of the unions. A judge known as an upright and able jurist, a candidate for re-election or for higher political honours, has been known to f a l l , protests against passing union label clauses in under this influence, into the pettifogging attitude of catering to union influence by unfair and, morally, unlawful practices."" In Chicago the union label system is carried to an extreme. Members of the unions are commanded to buy only union goods under pain of heavy penalties. The walking delegates are constantly on the watch, and may at any time inspect the clothing worn by members, who must even [REPRESENTATIVES.] Marks Bill. take their boots off so that it may be seen if the latter are stamped with the label. Their wives and children must also obey the edict. Bargain shops may not be patronized unless the walking delegate is satisfied that everything sold comes from unionized factories. The penalty f o i a first offence is 5 dol., second 20 dol., and for a thiid 50 dol., and expulsion from the union for a fourth offence, and the consequent loss of employment, many employers being terrorized into employing union men only. There is a retail clerks' union throughout the United States, the members of which are bound to present and recommend to purchasers goods bearing the union label, while they hold back as far as possible competitive goods not bearing it . They have great influence in support of the label. An unconscious employer, finding that certain goods sell better than others of the same class, naturally orders them in preference. orable member been quoting? reading a statement of an American newspaper, republished in the Argus of 28th November. or three times already, and contains am unfair misrepresentation of the position. agree to the proposals of the Government, A.'stralia's experience will be similar to that of America.

We want to secure good conditions for the slave wage-earners. the time of the House being wasted, as it has been, in discussing these miserable proposals, when we have on the business-paper measures of fa r more importance, not only to Queensland, but to the whole of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister told us some little time ago that he expected us to pass the Electoral B ill , the Sugar BountyB ill , the Excise (Sugar) TariffB ill , the Immigration Restriction Amendment B ill , and other measures before the session was brought to a close at Christmas. I do not think that it will be possible to carry out that programme. Sugar Bounty Bill. delay that has taken place in regard to that measure has inflicted great injury upon the sugar industry in Queensland. I do not think there is anything to justify the provisions now before us. The use of union labels would be legitimate, if the unionists owned the goods to which the labels were affixed. Where the unions have no ownership in the goods, it savours of tyranny on their part to attach a label with the object of bringing pressure to bear upon manufacturers and retailers to give them an undue preference. The ordinary trade mark carries no compulsion with it, and threatens no one, whereas the union label is absolutely worthless, except as an instrument of coercion. It would be well for the Government to drop the union label proposals, and permit honourable members to devote their attention to legislation designed in the best interests of the Commonwealth. the honourable member for Oxley, I also desire to enter my protest against the waste of time that has occurred in connection with this unfortunate proposal.

His observations in that connection were emphasized by the honourable and learned member for Corinella, who endeavoured to point out that the adoption of a workers'"" trade mark would confer no benefit upon the country worker, because he is not so well organized as is the worker in the towns. Nobody regrets more than I do that the workers in the country are not better organized. better off if they were, and their employers would not suffer one bit.

I am not aware of the precise conditions which at present prevail in the country, but I know that in a rural district in Victoria a few years ago the hours of labour were longer, and the wages paid lower, than those which prevailed in the cities.

Nobody is more ready to recognise that fact than is the country worker; and therefore it is idle for honourable members to attempt to cloud the issue by setting one class against the other.

We simply ask that the same protection shall be extended to a worker's Give us a label trade mark as is extended to the trade under mark of an employer. Efforts have been made to make it appear that this workers' trade mark is something new. But-as has already bean pointed out-in Western Australia a similar mark has been in use for years; and, so far as I am aware, not a single complaint has been made as to any evils resulting therefrom. It is well known that the Tailors' Union of Kalgoorlie has a label ' affixed to all the goods which it produces. The result is that the citizens of that district, who have strong unionist leanings, experience no trouble whatever in discovering goods made under fair conditions. When they go into a shop they simply ask : '' Are these union-made goods ' ' ? They purchase the goods, knowing that the label They would be much is merely a guarantee that proper wages have been paid by the manufacturers, and that the workers, male and female, have enjoyed proper conditions. In Fremantle, the Tailors and Tailoresses' Union, in stead of affixing a label to the goods, have It is a ticket printed which, by an arrangement with each shop-keeper who sells their goods, is displayed in his windows. It informs the public that all the goods sold in the establishment have been made under the rules and conditions of the Tailors and Tailoresses' Union of Fremantle.

All we ask is that those who have been doing this, and who may do it in the future, may have extended to them the same protection that we are extending to employers, ima certain porters, and agents all over Australia.

But I had no intention of doing that. The honourable member for Wannon recently read a writ, issued against the Hatters' Societya society of which I happened to be a member when I was in America-to show that it had to pay damages for restricting the output of a firm by boycotting their goods. From the October number of a manufacturers' journal, called The American Hatter, I learn that in the Supreme Court in the State of Connecticut the United Hatters of North America proceeded against C. H . Merritt and Son, and obtained a permanent injunction to prevent that firm from fraudulently using labels which were imitations of its label. Judge Shumway is reported to have said:The injunction is made permanent, and judgment that the defendants account to the plaintiff for profits derived from the wrongful use of such imitation label, as provided in section 4910 of the General Statutes. Honourable members on the other side would T5e perfectly agreeable for any society or body of men here to bring a label into use, and to give the proprietors no power to prosecute any person who forged it. I desire to read a few paragraphs from the report of the case to which I have just referred. Section 4916 of the general statutes makes it the duty of the Court to grant an injunction to restrain the use and display of any counterfeit or imitation of a label adopted by any union of working men. Section 4909 provides that the record of the label shall be sufficient proof of its adoption, and the right of the union to adopt it. It is apparent from an inspection of the eight exhibits, C to K inclusive, that they are imitations of the plaintiff's label. These exhibits were fraudulent imitations of the hatters' label, whicli honourable members on the other side would not attempt in any way to prevent. The defendants have used and are using these imitations, and it follows that the plaintiffs are entitled to the relief that the statutes provide in such case. Honourable members on the other side try to make out that the use of the union label would entail some cost to the manufacturers, but according to this manufacturers' journalhonorable member Paragraph 4 and 5 of the complaint read as follows :4. The Association issues its said labels gratuitously to manufacturers who employ its members in making and finishing hats, under rules and restrictions which prevent said labels from being placed in hats made by unskilled workmen or imperfect hats. Honourable members opposite also say that the union label is no guarantee as to the quality of an article, but the United Hatters of North America only place the label in perfect hats. The condition of wages, workmanship, and inspection under which the Association allows its said labels to be used are such as guarantee to a customer that a hat bearing such label is of sound and workmanlike construction. 5. The said label has become associated in the minds of the public with good workmanship and standard quality, and a large and increasing demand has grown up for hats bearing said label, and the same are now being used in hats at the rate of over 1,000,000 labels a month, under said rules and restrictions. This report is published in a manufacturers' journal, not in a trade-union journal ; but not one word is said against the union label. lers' paper. honourable member, it is a boodlers' paper, or one which is used exclusively by employers. Another paragraph of the complaint reads as follows :(12) On or about the 15th day of March, 1904, the defendants, for the purpose of obtaining the advantage of the market for hats bearing the label of the United Hatters of North America, and for the purpose of palming off their hats as hats manufactured under the rules and restrictions imposed by the association of manufacturers entitled to use its label's, and for the purpose of defrauding and deceiving the public by palming off their hats as union-made hats, and for the purpose of injuring the association, and by"" unfair devices, competing with manufacturers who comply with the rules and restrictions under which the association permits its labels to be used, adopted and used in their factory at Danbury, Conn., eight several styles of labels made in imitation and counterfeit of the labels of The United Hatters of North America; all of said eight labels having the characteristic and distinguishing features of the genuine label, as_set forth in paragraph 8 hereof, and all of them resembling the label of The United Halters' of North America so closely as to enable the defendants, by use of said labels, to palm off their hats as made by members of The United Hatters of North America.

Honourable members on the other side have said that if the use of the label were adopted in Australia, prices must go up here as in America. But we learn from a paragraph in this manufacturers' journal that the tendency in America is towards lower prices. We have been told in the various articles which have been quoted that there is ino organization in America which has used the union label with such effect as the Hatters' Union. Yet we learn from a manufacturers' journal that the tendency in that country is for prices to come down. This issue of The American being with a wholesaler and the other with a retailer of forty years' experience. In a series of interviews which are running through its pages, neither a wholesaler nor a retailer says one word against the union label. I admit that the persons interviewed do mot mention the union label at a l l ; but if we are to believe honourable members on the other side, no wholesaler or retailer could have been interviewed on any trade in which the union label is used without bringing down upon it a storm of condemnation. Yet we find that in the two interviews to which I have just alludedand these are not peculiar cases-the persons interviewed did mot say one word either good, bad, or indifferent against the union label. Of course it is not likely to be praised in a manufacturers' journal, but if it is as bad as is sought to be made out by honourable members opposite, these gentlemen would be sure to denounce its use. Surely that is an answer to the absurd statement of the honourable member for Oxley, that the Americans are anxious 'to get rid of tbe union label. The quotations which he gave had no reference to the union label. In this issue of The American Hatter, the United Cloth Hat and Cap Makers of North America advertise another label; and alongside a fac-simile of it these words are printedAsk for this label, as it's the only genuine one. Endorsed by the American Federation of Labour and Organized Labour in general. Do honourable members think that if tbe union label were as bad as they have tried to niake it out to be, any manufacturers' it? In England the Hatters Union has had a label for the last twelve or thirteen years, and I have never heard a retailer or person in trade object to its use. I happened to be in England when the label was introduced, and I know that the retailers did hot say a single word against it. In fact, the demands for the label became so great that it was immediately counterfeited by unscrupulous traders, and the union had to print across the fac-simile of the label on the cards which it issued for advertising",32,Ranson

He did not say on which side of the wall the Government were on; no doubt he was waiting to hear from the honourable member for Wilmot. We have been told that in the United States there is a growing feeling against the union label; and that a Citizens' Alliance has been formed to oppose it. I have here an extract from The Meatcutters' Journal, published in April last, in which it is stated thatAt a meeting of the American Economic Association, held in February of this year, reference was made to Robbins Lumber Company, of Wilksbarre, Pa. This company has withdrawn from the Citizens' Alliance. In order to do so they have forfeited 81,000. Withdrawal from the Alliance involved the forfeiture of the amount of the bond into which they had entered to observe its rulesIn the future union men with their ""buttons"" will take the place of non-unionists. They say, "" We withdraw from the ance, because we believe it to be unlawful, unjust, ana"" against the best interest of the community, because it believes in a systematic boycott against employees, who are to be, at the will of the employer, blacklisted, boycotted, and starved into submission; that a member of the association may brand an employee as unworthy; and that he w ill not be given employment by any other member."" These are the statements not of a walking delegate, as the honourable member for Wentworth would describe the representative of a union, but of a firm which was a member of the Citizens' Alliance. They were made, not at a trade union gathering, but at a meeting of the American Economic Association. plained that they had withdrawn from the Alliance, not because they had been compelled by the unions to endorse union conditions, but because that/ association believed in a systematic boycott against employees, who were to be starved by their employers into submission. visions are to encourage that system. union label legislation of the United States learned member seems to be worried in in operation, it is idle for honourable memregard to this matter, but I may say that bers of the Opposition to try to force their I have more hope of being able to convert fairy tales upon me. that the use of the label there has not led most other honourable members of the Opto a boycott.

I invited the Opposition to produce such proof during the debate on the motion for the second reading of this Bill. But' what did they do? We know that the United States has a population of about 80,000,000, distributed over a very wide area, and that there are probably more newspapers published there than in any other country. And yet, -when we ask for proof of their assertion that the union label has led to boycotting, honourable members opposite content themselves by quoting extracts from American newspapers, the dates, and even the names of which they suppress, so that it is impossible for us to verify their quotations, I think that many of the alleged quotations from American newspapers that have been published here are the concoctions of Mr Walpole, or some other individual who, like himself, believes that marriage'is a luxury for the workers, and is strongly opposed to any provisions of this kind. Honourable members Alliof the Opposition assert that a label used by a trt.de union has never been counterfeited by a manufacturer in Australia. Some honourable members have even gone so -far as to say that if proof of such an occurrence were given they would be prepared to reconsider the decision at which' they have arrived in reference to these proposals.

The unions may be plunged into contests that will not be advantageous to themselves, nnd will merely have the effect of exhausting their funds. I pointed out, when we were discussing the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill , how a similar result might accrue. Honourable members opposite have now had a few years' experience of what has taken place under the Conciliation ancl Arbitration Act in New South Wales, and are aware that what I said has come true. I have no hesitation in saying that to carrv these clauses as they stand is against' the interests of the unionists themselves. It would have been very much better, from their point of view, if a separate measure bad been introduced to deal with the subject. I am rather doubtful as to the constitutionality of the clauses. member for Illawarra said that in Svdney he had heard opinions upon both sides. speak too positively on the point. Perhaps owing to an oversight on the part of the Convention, we have no power to deal with the matter. But recognising that power, for the sake of argument, € still think the clauses go beyond what they ought to do. It is generally conceded that the object of legislation to-dav should be to break down any barriers that may exist between the classes to abolish any differentiation between the work of one man and that of another. The interests of all men ought to be equally dear to the Legislature. It is only by legislating on that principle that any true progress can be made. To put forward any particular class, whether it be a manufacturing class, a farming class, or a labouring class, as being entitled to SDecial legislative rights, seems to me to be directly contrary to the objects of sound legislation. We should do all we can to break down the disadvantages that arise from past mistakes, which very often are still continued by custom long after the legislation embodying them has ceased to operate. I shall not dwell further on th^t aspect of the question at the present time, but I do say that the main object of our legislation should be to prevent as far as possible any differentiation between one citizen and another, and certainly distinctions between Of course, it must one class of citizens and another. to use trade marks of this free hand? member is making a mistake. We should not allow conditions to continue which enable one class to gain at the expense of another. To do so is just as much class legislation as if we passed bills specifically intended to bring about such a result. When certain proposals were brought forward in this Parliament, by which one or two individuals who happened to have money, ancl to have put it into particular industries would be advantaged the honourable member for Herbert never for a moment took into consideration how many persons would be disadvantaged by the carrying of such proposals. that the' honourable member, in common with many Other honourable members, did not. and it would have been well if honourable members generally had then been guided by the simple principle that Parliament is not here to set up any one class against another, and that it is here to pull down, as far as possible, all such bad legislation. I repeat, that we should not permit legislation to continue in force that allows of such differentiations as I have referred to.

I should be prepared, to go even further, and permit their application, not to one class, but to 150 different associations, if there were so many.

First of all', I should like to say that the members of the Government do not feel it necessary to express their individual opinions, more particularly in view of the limited time that is at the disposal of the Committee, having regard to the arrangement arrived at. There is one thing I wish to do, 'however, and which I think I can do in five minutes, and that is to dispel a misunderstanding that has been circulated throughout the community as to the attitude of Canada in regard to this matter. It has been asserted time after time in the press, and in circulars that the attitude of the Canadian Legislature is against this principle. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is true that the nominee House, tbe Senate of Canada, wh^ich is nominated by the Governor General, and the members of which hold their office for life, and, therefore, are not in touch with the people of Canada, have, on various successive occasions, rejected this measure. But it is equally true that the House of Commons of Canada, occupying the same position as our House of Representatives, in constant touch with the people, has on many successive occasions passed it. there was no misrepresentation by me. learned member was not guilty of any misable to correct me; but I understand that representation. finite statement, and to refer honourable passed the Bill, but limited its operation t» [208] [5 DECEMBER, 1905.] Marks Bill. 6217 members to the Canadian Hansard-no t the latest edition, I regret to say, because I believe it has not yet arrived in Australia a Trade Marks Bill in Canada, or in a separate measure? ference to the principle of this legislation, and so far as the principle is concerned, it matters very little whether it was passed in conjunction with another measure or by i tself. the question? quibbling as to whether it was passed in one measure or in two.

I have the Canadian Hansard, debates for 1904, and I propose to refer very shortly to what I find there. Unfortunately, in that year a technical error was committed in not putting the B ill , which related to trade, before a Committee of the Whole House in the first instance, and the Speaker was, therefore, reluctantly I should say, compelled to rule it out of order. The reference to the Bill', to which I direct the attention of honourable members, is to be found in the Canadian Hansard of the House of Commons for June, 1904, Vol. I I . . columns 3829 and 3830, from which I quote the following: second rending o£ the B ill (No. 35) respecting union labels. He said : I do not think it* necessary, Mr Speaker, to take up the time of the House for many minutes in explaining this measure. A Bill similar to this has alreadv gone through the House, but was defeated in the Senate. This HouseHe is there speaking of the House of Commons of Canada, the popular Chamberhas given its opinion three different times that the request made by the trades unions of this country in favour of a registration of the union label should be complied with. Members of this House on both sidesI ask honourable members' attention to that have agreed to that principle, but unfortunately the Senate has seen fit to k ill each Bill to that effect as it came before that body. The principle of the present Bill is very simple. It provides that any body of men may present a label representing their production to the Minister of Agriculture, and the Department of Agriculture shall provide a certificate of the registration of such label. The Department of Agriculture takes the place of fhe Registrar of Trades Marks. The report continuesthat ? mons has never objected, but the objection comes from the Senate, inspired by the Manufacturers' Association. The union label is operating in this country very extensively, and there is nothing in this Bill which would bring about a condition of things that might not happen under the present operation of the label. pulsory. provided in the Bill to compel any employer to use it. The use of the label, if the Bill passes, will be the same as it is now. It will only become operative on the voluntary consent of the workin"" men and the manufacturers. vides against a fraudulent use of the labelMr Isaacs. That is what we sayThe request is a very reasonable one, and one which has been granted by thirty-one States of the American Union. Since then other States have legislated on the subject, and now there are forty States and Territories which have done so. Of course, there the power to provide legislation of this kind is in the hands of the State Governments, which is not the case in the Dominion, but thirty-one American States have provided for the simple principle of registration of the union label. In England the same thing is provided for under the Trade Marks Act, and the Manufacturers' Association of that country do everything to encourage the operation of fhe principle of the label. Finally, I invite the attention of honourable members to this statement, which was made, unchallenged, by a responsible member of the Canadian House of CommonsIn my opinion the tendency of the operation and use of this label would be to bring the organized bodies of working men and the organized bodies of manufacturers together, and thereby bring about a better understanding between them, and better conditions of industrial peace. been quoting the remarks of the Minister in charge of the B ill ? ber in charge of it. father it .

298,Mr Joseph Cook,"We should betimes. May not that be the reason why the House of Commons has .agreed to it? I have heard nominee Houses referred to as cowards' castles, because they afford an opportunity to members of the popular Assembly to evade their responsibilities by not offering opposition to measures which they know the Upper House will reject. When the honourable member for Wentworth asked the Attorney-General whether in Canada the union labelprovisions were associated with a Trade Marks Bill, the latter declared that to be a quibble; but the question goes to the root of the matter, because the Government have themselves admitted that this Parliament has no constitutional right to legislate on the subject, extend our powers under the Constitution unless union labels can be regarded as trade marks. power to legislate in this connection was covered by the trade marks provision of the Constitution.. why did the honourable and learned gentleman characterize the question of the honourable member for Wentworth as a quibble ? tralia is not the same as that of Canada, and therefore the question did not arise there. The point which I wish to make clear is that the Canadian House of Commons favours legislation of this kind. General admits that this Parliament has no right to legislate on the subject, except by doing what has not been done anywhere else in the world-in neither Canada nor the United States-by tacking these provisions on to a Trade Marks Bill. jected in Canada when inserted in a Trade Marks Bill, because the Department reported against them. is evidence on that point. The Commissioner of Patents and the Commissioner of Trade Marks were summoned to the Bar of the House to give expert opinion, on the subject. opinion here. the United States and Canada the opinions of experts were obtained, and in both countries it was declared that legislation of this kind was entirely foreign to a Trade Marks Bill, and, consequently, was rejected when associated with such a measure. The Attorney-General admits that this Parliament has no right to legislate on the subject, unless by some process of reasoning the union label can be brought within the constitutional provision relating to trade marks. States of America the subject has been left to the legislation of the States. Why should not the same thing be done here ? , Constitution any idea that the trade marks power would be used in this way ? expressed the opinion that we are trying to in every conceivable direction, and I am certain that if we pass these provisions the workers of the community will reap a crop of litigation which will be very costly to them. When they set that cost alongside the paltry benefits which will be conferred upon them, they will not thank us for legalizing the union label. traordinary that honourable members of the Opposition should now display such anxiety to proceed to a division upon thisi important question. Only three hours ago the honourable and learned member for Corinella was denouncing honourable members on this side of the Chamber for having entered into a conspiracy of silence, and even more recently the honourable member for Parramatta, referring to some agreement that had"" been entered into, threatened to disregard it if honourable members on the Government benches exercised their right to address themselves to the proposal now before the Chair. do so if they spoke at undue length. almosti impossible to influence the votes of honourable members upon the main, question at this stage, but I think that it is only right that I should place mv opinions on record. I propose to deal with the matter from only two aspects. I am content to leave the constitutional question to such an eminent authority as the honourable member In both for Parramatta, but only because I am convinced that his view will not be-shared by the majority of honourable members.

312,Mr Frazer,"I recognise that it isof the mercantile and manufacturing community who use trade marks, whilst denying it to workers or associations of workers who may desire to attach a distinguishing label to their workmanship. It has been urged that the proposal for the adoption of workers' trade marks is on a par with that made in connection with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, under which the Court would have the power to give preference to unionists in certain cases. A l though I approve of preference to unionists -and I think that it might, with greater propriety, ""Be termed ""security to unionists""I claim that the proposal now before us is quite distinct from any such provision. It is proposed thatNo person shall falsely apply to . . . . or knowingly sell or expose for sale . . . any goods to which there is falsely applied a mark which is a distinctive device design symbol or label registered by any individual Australian worker or association of Australian workers corporate or unincorporate. Those who would deny the protection thus sought to be extended to Avorkers' trade marks must stand self-confessed as defenders of thieA'es. I knoAv that honourable members of the Opposition will at once say that they do not believe in thieving, or in permitting persons to improperly make use of trade marks belonging to others, and yet they are prepared, by default, to practically give their countenance to such proceedings. We have been told that these proposals AA'Ould confer undue advantages upon the unions, and honourable members opposite have expressed great concern for the unfortunate men Avho are outside the unions, Avho, Avith their Avives and families, will, according to their representations, be driven to starvation, owing to the tyranny exercised by the unionists. In this connection, I propose to quote one or two statements which appear in a report recently published in the Argus. According to the report referred to, a witness who recent!yf gave evidence before the Coal Commission said that he and other hands employed in one of the coal mines in Southern Gippsland conceived the idea of starting a union, and posted a notice to that effect. Although he Avas not told so, he was sure that he Avas dismissed from the service of the company because of his participation in that movement. well ""known that no man can obtain employment in the coal mines of Southern Gippsland unless he is a non-unionisthe must be a free labourer or a "" loyalist."" It was stated, further, that the men employed at one mine AA'ere earning only 5s. 1 id. per shift. One man stated that he Avas induced to apply for employment at the Outtrim Colliery, but upon being told that he Avould have to pay ,£15 for a block of land, which he thought was Avorth only -£2, he left the mine. member read the manager's categorical denial of all those statements which appear at a later stage of the report? is not correct in stating that any sucb denial appears iri the report to which I have referred. published on the folloAving day. made, it must have been published AvhilstI Avas temporarily absent from Melbourne.

Buti f they did take such extreme measures they Avould have abundant justification in the examples furnished by employers I need only refer to the operations of the shipping ring for another illustration of the boycotting tactics purs.ued by large trading organizations.

Under the proposal now before us, the public will have an opportunity of declaring whether they are in favour of fair conditions of labour, or whether they are content that the goods which they require should be manufactured under circumstances such as have been referred to by the honourable member for Bland. is not necessary to go to Adelaide in order to find instances of sweating, in Melbourne, Sydney, and other large industrial centres in the CommonAvealth. When it was proposed to establish' a daily labour newspaper in Sydney the proprietors of the Sydney Morning Herald and the Daily Telegraph sent out circulars to their agents notifying them that if they associated themselves in any way with that project they would cut off supplies. If that was not a threatened boycott, I do not know what is. Thein, again, those who have been connected with mining communities know that it is recognised upon all hands that the Employers' Association keeps a black-list. Maranoa produced such a list upon one occasion, and of my own knowledge, I can say that such a list exists in various miii'iig camps in this country. It has been urged that this is the wrong time and place to insert the proposals of the Attorney-General. It is not often that I am guilty of quoting from the New South Wales Hansard, and if the circumstances were not so exceptional, I should hesitate to do so now. In speaking to a motion of censure on the Dibbs Government in 1892, regarding the arrest of certain strikers at BrokenH ill , I find that the deputy leader of the Opposition 1892? is a long time ago, but the quotation will serve to indicate how the opinions of honourable members may undergo a change. own ideas have changed. change to the extent of inducing me to consider, with the honourable member, that the residents of the back-blocks have degenerated. Upon the occasion to which I refer the deputy leader of the Opposition saidThat is why I protest so strongly against the way in which the Government have trotted out the law and order bogey, because I believe it to be detrimental to the whole of the people of this country, and the best interests of any country, to accentuate the question in such an acute form. Leniency should be shown to men striving in a legitimate way to improve their position. A little later on he saidPeople say they do not object to trade-unions ; It That is exactly what we hear from honourable members opposite. Everybody is a trade unionist nowadays, but when the conditions become hard enough, and a because similar conditions exist conflict arises between trades unionism and tyrannical conditions, these people are the first to turn round and say, "" You have gone far enough."" That is precisely the sentiment which we hear expressed by members of the Opposition. They declare that they believe in trade unionism, but only to a certain extent. I am prepared to admit that there is some justification for certain honourable members entertaining a particular view. For example, the honourable member for Wentworth, who has been reared in the atmo-^ sphere of Oxford, and under luxurious conditions The honourable member for his mouth. fact will contribute to his happiness to any great extent. in my mouth than a "" gag."" may get the latter before he expects it . There is a certain amount of excuse for the honourable member holding the views that he does, although it is regrettable that he does not thoroughly understand the aims and ambitions of the toilers of this country, but there is no excuse whatever for the honourable member for Parramatta, who is an ex-coal miner and ex-check weighman of New South Wales, denying the right of the COOK --S o long ago as miners of Lithgow to purchase goods manufactured under proper conditions. I see no reason to anticipate the dire disaster that has been predicted in the event of trade unions being granted the measure of justice that is proposed in this B ill . We have been told that some honourable members believe The honourable member's in voluntary trade unionism, and that they will support the non-unionists as against the I ' hope they will never unionists.

Honourable members will recollect that when the Commerce Bill was uncier consideration it was pointed out that we could not constitutionally make the same provisions in regard to internal commerce as we were making in relation to the external trade of the Commonwealth. But that is what we are proposing to do in this Case. It seems to me that the word "" knowingly "" has been omitted from the paragraphs in question so as to make them more stringent and less fair to the party charged in connection with internal offences, than are the provisions of the CommerceB ill . For instance, clause 9 of the Commerce Bill provides that no person shall import any goods to which a false trade description is applied. That is practically the offence dealt with under paragraph a of the clause now under consideration. the Commeri:e Bill there is the following qualification in favour of the defendant, which has been omitted from this clause: It shall be a defence to a prosecution for an offence against this section if the defendant proves that he did not knowingly import the goods in contravention of this section. But for that provision, the offence is practically the same in each case; in the Commerce Bill it relates to a false application . of a trade description; whilst under this clause it is the false application of a worker's mark. Under the Commerce Bill, if . the defendant can show that he did not knowingly apply the false trade description, he is held to be not guilty; but the Attorney-General's draftsman has omitted all reference to that defence in the clause now under consideration. tion to the Trade Marks Acts of the States. The South Australian Act of 1892, like several of the Trade Marks Acts of the other States, is based upon English legislation, and it contains several of the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act of visions such as we have inserted in the Commerce Bill, against falsely trade marks to goods, and in that Act also the word "" knowingly"" honourable members will see that it was with a view to make this provision more stringent than the ordinary law of the States and the Commerce Bill that the word ""knowingly "" 1 has been omitted from these paragraphs. If the Committee wishes to leave the clause as it stands, well and good. All that I can say is that if a man imported goods, and did not know at the time that fhe trade mark which they bore Mr Glynn. had been registered, he would be adjudged guilty, although he could really prove his innocence. goods, and be unaware that they bore a certain trade mark until they arrived here. graph b, the offender must knowingly sell or expose for sale any goods to which a mark has been falsely applied. mark on goods, he must do so knowingly. of the draftsman was that if a man falsely places a trade mark upon goods, he must know that he is doing so in contravention of another man's right. But the same observation might be applied to the EngBut in lish Trade Marks Act of 1887, the Acts of the States, and the CommerceB ill , where the word "" knowingly "" is used. There are several other variations from the existing States legislation, as well as the Imperial Act, and the Commerce Bill, to which I could draw attention. It is my Jury to call attention to the fact that we are making the law as regards the false application of the union mark far more harsh against the defendant than under the existing law would be the case, where there is a penal violation of the rights of the proprietor of a registered trade mark. My inclination is to move that the word "" knowingly "" be inserted before the word "" falsely."" I do not know whether the Attorney-General will accept an amendment to that effect. know whether the Attorney-General intends to accept the suggestion of the honourable member for Angas, either to use the word ""knowingly "" as regards all the provisions, or to add a proviso, as in. the Commerce Act, that it shall be a defence if the de1887. That Act contains profendant proves that he did not knowingly do it. I do not feel inclined to accept the first is used. I think suggestion., because I cannot con:eive that a man can falsely apply a mark of this kind to goods without doing it knowingly. I am inclined, however, to accept the suggestion to insert the word "" knowingly "" in paragraph c. I was discussing this matter with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne this afternoon, and the result of my consideration was that it is possible for a man to innocently import goods that have a false trade mark, be-",46,Pairs

339,Applying Mr Isaacs (Indi,"Attorney-General) .cause the)' may have been, produced here, exported, and imported. cumstances, I think it is fair to put the word "" knowingly "" in paragraph c, but not in paragraph a. That the word ""knowingly"" be inserted before the word "" i m p o r t "" in paragraph c of subclause 1. Attorney-General ought to insert the word "" and "" after the word "" of "" in the phrase "" for the purpose ot indicating,"" in subclause 1. As the clause stands now, if a mark is one which has been adopted for the purpose of indicating conditions of trade, how is the man who imports the goods, or falsely applies the mark, to know the state of mind of the man who adopted the mark ? It may have been adopted for the purpose of indicating conditions of trade, but there is nothing on the mark itself to show that. If a man is to be punished for putting on a trade mark, it ought to be clearly such a mark as shows the object of its registered owners.. But, as the clause stands, as long as their purpose exists, although it may never have been indicated to the defendant, still he is guilty. WhatI ask the Committee, in common fairness, to do is to insure that, not only must the object be to indicate conditions of trade, but that that object must be somewhere indicated to the person who is charged. would be great controversy as to whether, in fact, it did indicate it . Suppose that in England, or elsewhere, a man did register a mark or symbol such as may be obtained by a union in the Commonwealth, and honestly put that mir k on his goods, and that a union in Ausinilia registered that mark as a trade mark. Surely it is not intended to punish ihe mnn in England or elsewhere for doing that which he had a perfect rigbt to do! We ought not, by our legislation, to prevent such imports from coming in. Attorney-General to consider this matter very carefully. I regret that I cannot accept the suggestion to amend the clause in this direction, because, if I did, it would break down the whole part. one abroad can invent a mark which signifies that it is an Australian union mark, and then honestly apply it to goodfs being Under these cirsent to Australia. has no reference to Australia, and simply consists of the words "" Hatters' Union."" tion of one registered here. are legislating for ourselves it is difficult to imagine that any foreign mark can accidentally be such a close imitation of an Australian workers' mark as to be calculated to deceive. Suppose that a star, together with the words ""Hatters' Union,"" or "" Bootmakers' Union,"" is registered in England, and is honestly applied to goods made by unionists, but is similar to a label which has been registered here, should the English manufacturer be liable to punishment for honestly using his own mark to represent that his goods were made by union labour ? It will be an outrage if 'we attempt to do anything of the kind. An amendment ought to be made in order to prevent that man from being punished. towards the end of sub-clause 1 the words "" substantially identical with a labour m a r k "" are used. These words are not contained' in the legislation on which the clause has been framed. This is really an adaptation of the provisions dealing with the fraudulent application of trade marks I think that in cases there contained in the Trade Mark Acts of the States and in Imperial legislation. I have compared the Statutes very carefully, and I can see that with certain omissions to make the clause more stringent it is simply a redraft, of course with such variations as are necessary for its general object. In the Commerce Act the words used areor any mark so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive; but in this clause the words used areor any mark substantially identical with a labour mark, or so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive. I ask the It is a pity to have two Federal Statutes directed to the very same end, but containing different methods of creating the offence. It will introduce confusion. In the Commerce Act it is provided that no person shall import any goods to which a false trade description is applied, and its definition of ""false trade description"" I cannot conceive that any ends with the wordswhich makes the description false or likely to mislead in a material respect.",47,Pairs

Surely every one desires to secure those conditions for the workers. are all heartily agreed in that desire. We are told, in addition, that another object is to resist the pirating of trade marks which any individual or association of workers may register under this Bill. I also agree with that. If organized workers are entitled to register a trade mark, they should have the f u l l protection of the law to insure that it shall not be pirated.

If their professions are to be accepted-and I do not dispute them-the y can have no reasonable objection to my proposal. would have reason to doubt our sanity if we We have been repeatedly accepted this amendment. doubt that now, but I should not be so rude. I should prefer to say that most honourable members opposite are fully alive to the advantages which they hope to gain under this Wer Bill. The proposed new clause has received a great deal of consideration. We have debated its subject-matter at considerable length. Its language is plain and straightforward. Its object is to prevent boycotting. I have much pleasure in submitting it . member for Kooyong in this clause is, I think, trenching very dangerously on the limitations to the constitutional rights of this Parliament. I do not think we have the power to enact conspiracy laws. Some honourable members on the other side have comthe honorplained of the introduction into the Trade ,'Marks Bill of provisions to give protection to a workers' trade mark as being foreign to the general purposes of a trade marks law. Surelyi t is still more foreign to the purposes of such' a law to include in it a series of provisions relating to conspiracy ? Apart from those who are known to be pushing their opposition to the union label provision to the utmost possible extent, and speaking of unbiased persons, it is news to me to hear it contended that to enact provisions for the protection of a mark to be applied to goods in the course of trade is foreign to the purposes of trade marks legislation. But certainly it can reasonably be held that a provision dealing with' the subject of conspiracy, and enacting something completely new, is foreign to legislationdealing with trade marks. Leaving that matter, I point the common law alout that the honourable member for Kooyong said that the voting upon this, clause would test the sincerity of the professions of honourable members on this side.

I am sure the honourable member will be candid enough to admit that he personally knows of a great number of manufacturers who limit their agency to one trader in a town, and boycott every other trader in it . Mernda does the same thing himself, in Queensland. Rockhampton. that? improper for a manufacturer to do that. In some cases, I can quite understand that it might be absolutely justifiable from business considerations; but I do say that it is in restraint of trade. There is no freedom to the one hundred and one other traders in a town to purchase the goods of the manufacturer who adopts that practice, in order to distribute them to the public, though they may desire to do so. The practice, therefore, resolves itself into a boycott of certain individuals in that town. The principle on which legislation has always proceeded in regard to trade marks in every British community, and indeed in every civilized community in the world, bas been to grant legislative Protection to the owner of a trade mark, independently of what he does with that trade mark. In the laws of England, of America, and of every continental country, so far as I have been able to ascertain, no question is raised as to how the owner of a trade mark mav care to use the symbol in respect of which the community bas given him protection, and in the use and enjovment of which they have confirmed him. Why should this principle be introduced now, when the interests of tbe workers are at stake? Because tbey are concerned the honourable member for Koovong has suddenly become alive to the necessity of protecting the public against hoycottincj. that there is no likelihood of any effective boycotting resulting from the establishment of the proposed union' label, because the public will soon show by their lack of sympathy that it is not profitable for any one to indulge in boycotting of the kind suggested. I say that if honourable members who are opposed to the union label provisions insist upon and succeed in introducing a clause that will have the effect of limiting the operation of the workers' trade mark, I , for one, will take every step possible to provide that the owner of every trade mark used in the ordinary course of business, and given protection under this measure, shall be brought under review by the authorities as to the manner in which he uses that trade mark, and as to whether it is used in the public interest or not. If we are to have legisHe has only one agent in lation to say how this concession by the community is to be used, it should be applied all round without discrimination. This clause should be proposed in another part of the B ill, and applied to all trade marks, in order that the action taken under them all might be brought under review in every instance, and that some public authority, whether a Government officer, a board, or some such body, shall pronounce whether the holder of a trade mark is entitled to continue in the use and enjoyment of it, in view of the manner in which he is operat ing it in the interests or against the in, terests of the public.

Under these circumstances, and having regard to the facts to which I have already referred-mor e particularly the onesided nnture of the proposalI have no option but to oppose the amendment. much amused when I found that the honourable member for Kooyong had given notice of this amendment. stand that his intention is to prevent what It does not alter the is known as boycotting; but such an amendment as he has moved would have come with It says, better grace from any other honourable member. My reason for saying so is that he is associated with a company which employs probably more men than are emI do ployed by any other company, and uses the boycott very rigorously. I know from personal experience that it does so, because it boycotted me. I was president of the Miners' Association at BrokenH ill previous to a certain strike, and was boycotted on that account, by not being allowed to work in any of the mines there. Mr Vosper, who was then treasurer of the association, was similarly treated, and had ultimately to leave Australia to obtain work. He went to South Africa. class citizen. things were a little more mixed, and a number of persons were placed on the black list. A Mr Greenhalgh, who was working as an engineer for the Block 10 Company, was boycotted, not being allowed to obtain work in BrokenH ill . I suggested that he should try to get work in Adelaide. We went there together, and on arrival he was met in the street by a man whom, he knew as associated with one of the large engineering firms there. This man told him-, "" Y ou will get no work in Adelaide. Immediately you left BrokenH ill , we received a telegram saying that you would come here to look for work, and instructing us that you were not to be employed."" If any of the mine managers at BrokenH ill ""dismisses a man for a reason which he thinks to be beyond the ordinary, he submits his name to the secretary of the Mine Managers' Association, whose duty it is to communicate the fact of the dismissal to each of the other mine managers, and, consequently, the man is not only not-allowed to obtain work again from the company from whose service he has been dismissed, but is unable to obtain employment from any of the other companies in the town. Some years ago a man named Williams was working for the Proprietary Company under a contract. Previous to the visk of the New South Wales Arbitration Court to Broken. H ill , those working under contracts in that company's mine were dismissed' if they broke them, although the company could break them at any time.

Cann, who now represents BrokenH i I in the State Legislature, I saw the right honourable member for East Sydney, who was at the time Prime Minister, and Attorney General of New South Wales, and the Honourable member for Parramatta, who was then Secretary for Mines; but nothing could be done. ever, is still acting in the same way, and, as the honourable member for Kooyong is its managing director, be is the last man in the Committee who should have moved such an amendment as this. member thinks that boycotting is wrong, he should prevent his own crowd from boycotting. prietary is his servant, and he could, it ne wished to do so, put a stop to the practices to which I have referred. W arren, the manager of Blocki o , told T 'Greenhalgh that he would take him back but for the fact that his directors had instructed him that Greenhalgh and several others were not to be again emploved. I have referred to these cases to show that the employers of Australia resort to the boycott. workers, who are in a majority, will not use the powers which they possess as electors, to protect themselves against such action, they must suffer tbe consequences. But the bonorable member for Kooyong, before trying to prevent them from boycotting when they have the opportunity, should prevent the companies which he controls from using the boycott. man who misbehaves or does not do his work should not be dismissed by his emA ployers, but it is going too far to say that he should not obtain employment from any one else. There would be a certain amount of fairness in the amendment if the honourable member applied the same penalties to all. But his great anxiety is lest the workers shall use the boycott. better to prevent either party from using it? when boycotting is absolutely justifiable, and it is certainly unfair to prevent men I was asked by the Association to from boycotting, when their employers boycott them. I trust that the honourable member will withdraw the amendment, and allow us to get on with the B ill . Peramendment suggested by me before he has Had an opportunity of consulting the Chamber of Commerce, because it might not suit the members of that body. As the proWith Mr posed new clause stands at present, it would be unjust in. its operation, and, if it is pressed, I shall certainly vote against it. the honourable member for Kooyong to withdraw his amendment. I agree with the honourable member for Bland and the AtThe Proprietary Company, howtorney-General. I do not think that we have the power to pass the amendment. Moreover, if the evils at which it is aimed do arise, the laws of the States will suffice. As we have passed clause 73, we should If the honourable stultify ourselves if we immediately afterwards adopted another provision intended to stop certain developments that were likely The mine manager of the Proto follow.

In addition to this, I think that the proposal of the honourable member goes a little further than he intends, because it makes an invidious distinction. If the think that any argument would go to the root of this question so \directly as' that which might be based upon the history of the honourable member for Kooyong in connection with the exercise of the very weapon which he now desires to place bevond the reach of the workers.

When the people of the island State awoke from their stupidity, and decided to follow the example of the electors in the Australian States by returning to the Stale Parliament ,a representative who was in sympathy with them, they selected a man of clean reputation, who was considered one of the best workmen employed on the Mount Lyell mines. Immediately he was elected as a Uibour representative, the boycott was applied to him by the directors of the company for whom he had been working,, and he was thrown out of employment. The allowance made to a member of Parliament in Tasmania is very small, and yet an honest toiler,' merely because he was considered worthy to represent his fellows in the Legislature, was, through the instrumentality of men of the type of the honourable member for Kooyong, absolutely prevented from earning his living. The weak point of the proposed new clause was clearly indicated by the honourable member for Bland, and the honourable member for Kooyong had the ground completely cut from under bim when he was asked to remove the invidious distinction made to the disadvantage of the workers, and to permit the provision to apply to all persons who bad the privilege of using trade marks. Those honourable members who talk most glibly against class legislation are prepared to place a weapon in the hands of the employers which will enable them to hound down the workers. They are content that the directors of the Broken Hill mines should be allowed to conspire to deprive men of an opportunity of earning their livelihood. When honourable members bring forward propositions of this kind, it is well that we should be able to turn back a few pages of their history, and see the black marks recorded against them by the workers. This is a bare-faced proposition, and I scarcely expected that the honourable member for Kooyong wonld stoop so low as he has done. No men in the world are less inclined to use coercion, or to resort to monwealth Parliament. the boycott than are the workers. No men have suffered more than they have from the -exercise of such powers, and they would be the last to mete out to others the injustice That bas been inflicted upon themselves. The honourable member for Kooyong apparently regards the workers as demons almost equal to those with whom he is associated. He represents them as men who ought to be shackled, to be loaded with leg-irons as in the past. Thank God, those days are gone, and it is not possible for individuals like the honourable member for Kooyong to work their will. The workers are now represented by men who will see that justice is done to all, and I hope that this will be the last time that any honourable member will have ,the temerity to submit a proposal of this kind. The honourable member may well be prepared to withdraw his amendment. He may well regret that he ever brought it forward. Perhaps it is as well that the proposal should be put to the test, in order that we may demonstrate that such legislation cannot be placed upon our statute-book. The object of the amendment is to rob the toilers of their true representatives, or, in other words, to destroy their unity outside, so that they may not be able to secure proper representation within the walls of Parliament. The employers wish to have full liberty to meet together, and conspire against the workers who may be within their control. No legislation -is proposed to limit their powers in this direction, but the moment that the workers desire to exercise the same liberty of action, and to prevent the employer from robbing the consumer, and misrepresenting the producer, gentlemen, like the honourable member for Kooyong, wish to put leg-irons on them. All such efforts are, however, too late. The time has gone, never to return, when the people would submit to such restraints upon their liberty. They have received the advantages of education, and are fortunately in a position to safeguard themselves against the machinations of the representatives of capital. If the otherlegislative proposals of the honourable member are no more liberal than that which he has put forward tonight, his place is not in this Parliament. He should be consigned to the museum, so that enlightened citizens might go there and gaze upon the curiosity which once represented a section of the people in the Comdent that my amendment has bitten my honourable friends in the Labour corner.

This treatment was not meted out, as the honourable member for Kooyong would have the Committee believe, to an undesirable class.

They were simply unionists, and the cruel part of this action was that they were not made aware that work was not to be given to them in the 'BrokenH ill district. were practically starving whilst they were seeking employment, and although every mine manager to whom they went said, "" I have no room,"" not one of them told them that they were boycotted. zation of employers practices the boycott. In no mining district where the employers have been organized, has the boycott not been -practised. manager to whom I have referred said that no reason was given to him for refusing to employ these men; but he dare not give them work. I have had a personal experience of the boycott. of the Amalgamated Miners' Association for sixteen, years, but am not sorry that I was boycotted out of the mining industry. Hundreds of men are systematically boycotted. I have known a man to be boycotted, not only in his own district, but in other districts, and indeed in other States, whither he had gone in search of employment. This means, in individual cases, the grossest persecution based on personal spite. presentative of tbe employing classes should have dared to put before the Committee such a one-sided proposal as that now under consideration. We know that there is no likelihood of the workers availing themselves of the union label to exercise the boycott', but the employers, measuring other people's corn by their own bushel, appear to consider that there is. The most 37 systematic up-to-date boycott is that practised by the Pastoralists' Union. It is so completely organized that confidential circulars are sent out, and confidential reports are obtained. In New South Wales and Queensland the pastoralists not only boycott a man, but try to drive him out of the country. With them it is not a matter of preventing a shearer from getting work in a particular shed, or at his occupation, but preventing him from getting any employment in the Commonwealth at that occupation. A man is to be driven right out of shearing. Why? Because he dares to stand up for his rights, or for those of his fellow-men. Some honourable members talk about what the employers do. But any one who has had experience of bushmen's work knows how employers boycott a hawker. He is not even allowed to go to the station to provide the men with goods. He is boycotted so that the men shall be compelled to get their stores and clothing from the station store-in the olden times at very exorbitant rates. The pastoralists Their wives and families attempt to boycott even the employment of' the cooks for whom the shearers pay. No doubt an action for conspiracy would lie against an organization for boycotting in this way, but there is great difficulty in furEvery organinishing the necessary proof. Men attempt to dodge the boycott, frequently by changing their personal appearance, but generally by changing their names. The The BrokenH ill mine boycott is so complete in some cases that I am astonished that the employers do not adopt the thumb-print system. It is astonishing to me that this proposal of the honourable member for Kooyong should lie I was secretary upon the table for so many days without its unfairness dawning upon him. He has had ample evidence of the tendency of the class which is crying out against the union label to practise the boycott. Perhaps he has done a wise thing in asking for leave to withdraw his proposal, because, in my opinion, the common law is sufficiently strong to deal with such cases.

I need not take up the time of the Committee in further explaining the clause, the intention of which must be perfectly clear to every honourable member.

I have no objection to expressing, in a clause, what I think would really give effect to the honourable member's intention. I do nof think there is any possibility, of the natural operations-if I may so refer to them-o n farms and vineyards being affected by this part of tbe Bill. There was no intention to apply this part to those primary operations. I have framed a clause which I admit will carry out his intention, and if the Honourable member will move his clause in the form I suggest I shall be willing to agree to it. like the expression ""mo person shall apply any worker's trade mark to any product."" from the common law rights of individuals. the honourable member might propose his clause in the following form:This Part shall not apply to any primary products of the agricultural, viticultural (including wine-making), horticultural, dairying (including butter-making and cheese-making), or pastoral industries. That, I think, would carry out, in perhaps, a more perfect form what the honourable member desires, and at the same time will clearly not impinge on the real intention of the Bill to cover manufactured products. apply to wool ? duct of the pastoral industry. If the honourable member for Echuca will move his clause in the form I have suggested, I am willing to accept it. much pleasure in accepting the Attorney General's suggestion. The clause as the honourable and learned gentleman has framed it appears to me to cover all the It is giound that I intended should be covered. formed the Committee on several occasions that personally I believe that, as a matter of principle, we should extend legislative protection to a trade mark, symbol, brand, design, or whatever other form it might take, whether it is held or owned by a non-unionist, an employer, or an employee, or any one else in the community. So long as it is his own property, I think we should extend legislative protection to it. In view of that principle, I certainly see very grave objections to the proposed new clause; but But, as framed, I ' think it I must admit that, as a matter of practice, I see no possibility of the union iabel, which has been made the bone of contention in this, Bill, being applied to the products described. For that reason, I am not prepared to press the objection I undoubtedly hold to the principle involved in the new clause, even in the form suggested by the Attorney-General. no reason why the Committee should agree think the honourable member will to the proposed new clause, even in the amended form suggested. Why should we pass this exceptional legislation when we are being continually I do nof, for instance, charged by honourable members opposite with supporting class legislation? I agree with the honourable member for Bland that there is very little likelihood of the union label being applied to the primary products of the industries referred to; but if it should happen that any wine-maker or any other primary producer should desire to make use of a workers' trade mark, why should we prevent him ? An associated body of agricultural labourers might desire to use such a mark, and, as it could only be applied to the products of their labour with the consent of their employer, why should we prevent its use where that conSent is obtained ?

I refer to the pastoral industry. I think it most improbable that those concerned in that industry would ever desire to apply a union label to its products, because the whole object of the label is to aid the sale of the employer's product. ists' bales of wool are not likely to sell any better, because they happen to have a union label applied to them. I admit that it is possible that on occasions they might have sold better if such a workers' trade mark had been applied to them, because, at one time, it was admitted that union-shorn wool fetcbed higher prices and was better classed because it was shorn by unionists. Tbat was in the days when strikes and difficulty existed which, under the laws we have passed, may not exist in future. I do not think it likely that the primary industries will ever call for a union label, and for that reason it appears to me to be unnecessary to insert any such clause in this Bill. I can conceive that the time may come when those engaged in the butter trade may desire to make use of a workers' trade mark. the dairying industry are disposed of wholesale. the union label will be effective only in congether. I am prepared to remove one innexion with the retail trade. I have no strong objection to the proposed new clause, but it does not appear to me to be worthwhile to include it in the Bill. My difficulty is that if pastoralists or others engaged in the been told that the obiect of the industries referred to in the clause should desire to make use of a workers' trade mark, whilst it is possible the unions concerned would not object, I do not see why they should be prevented from doing so. to support the proposed new clause. I agree with the honourable member for Bland and others who have spokenthat it is not practicable to applv the union label to the products of the primary industries referred ta I support the clause, however, for another reason, and that is because there has been so much misrepresentation as to the effect of the union label provisions. From one end of the Commonwealth to the other, farmers especially have been invited to believe that under these provisions, when their bags of wheat and boxes of butter reach MelI am connected with bourne, Williamstown, or Sydney, they will not be shipped unless they bear a union label. If we remove these industries from the operation of the Bill, it will show that although many members of the Committee have been charged in the press with voting against the interests of the farmers and primary producers, there are persons inside this House prepared to safeguard their interests as well as persons outside. rather amusing to me to witness the new development. The honourable member for Riverina has told the Committee that because the farmer has been informed that if the union label is not put on his bag of wheat or box of butter, it will not be shipped by union men, he is prepared to vote for the proposed new clause, to show that that statement is not true. member is proposing to vote to remove those industries from the operation of the Bill, This is most extraordinary logic, because if the statement made is not true, there is no reason why this clause should be agreed to. The honourable member for Riverina represents a farming constituency, and this is the kind of legislation we have here, where men vote for classes. If the union label is a good thing, let it be applied all round. I do not propose to vote that it should, because I object to it altodustry from its operation, if I cannot remove all. Buti f honourable members think that it is a good thing, they should see that it is applied all round. We have union label is to enable the retailer to raise tbe price of h's goods. The great object of it is to benefit the retailer. That is an extraordinary way to put the position. This is a generous and kind piece of legislation ! We have been told that the mark cannot be placed on things sold wholesale: that it is intended for things sold retail. Is that why it is not to be placed on butter? Do housewives buv butter by the box? If the workers' trade mark is a good thing, why should it not be placed on every pat of butter? Honourable",65,Pairs

For these reasons, I think that the Committee ought to reject it. Proposed new clause negatived. posedThat the following new clause be inserted.:78Q. This Part shall not apply to any primary product of the agricultural, viticultural (including wine-making), horticultural, dairying (including butter-making and cheese-making) or pastoral industries. -I would draw the attention of the honourable member to the fact that substantially the Commonwealth trade mark will not apply to anything tb which a State law does not apply, 00 that it stands in a different position, it seems to me, from that of what is called fhe union label.

My idea is that if the mark were to be used in Whether they consist trade, the State could no longer deal with it. The point is that the Government proposal will not apply if there be no State law to allow it to be carried out. provides thatThis Part shall apply to all goods included in or specified by a resolution passed by both Houses of the Parliament that in their opinion the conditions as to the remuneration of labour in connection with their manufacture are fair and reasonable. My'object in moving the amendment is to exclude the rural industries from the operation of the Commonwealth trade mark and workers' trade mark clauses of this Bill. unions involved. would be more satisfactory if the farmers were kept beyond the Tange of these provisions. the Committee will reject the amendment. to which the honourable member for Echuca refers. The clause does go a little beyond the State right. For instance, if it is thought right event, the Committee will not make an exception of the character sought by the honourable member for Echuca. I did not press my objection to the application of this proposal to the workers' mark provision of the Bill, although I opposed the exclusion of rural workers from the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and, on principle, must still object to such an omission in this case. I take it that the Commonwealth label is to be a certificate that the award of the State authority has been observed in the manufacture of the This progoods to which it is applied. although I do not say that it means any addition to the principle involved-that the mark may be applied upon resolution passed by both Houses of the Parliament. of that provision is simply this : That whilst the Commonwealth label might be applied under an award given by a State authority, a man living in another State, where there was mo such legal machinery in existence, might be paying equal wages and",69,Mauger Th E Honourable Member S Rement Offends Exactly As That Moved By The

I consider that we have gone quite far enough in adopting the previous proposal. ney) I cannot follow the Attorney-General in his statement that this necessarily applies to only goods which are dealt with by the laws of some States. practically where there is no State law, both Houses of this Parliament have to pass a resolution, in order to apply the Commonwealth mark to primary industries. Unless they are dealt with by the State law it will not apply. apply to a single firm as it standls ? that it applies to goods, but I see nothing to prevent the Parliament, whether a State has fixed the conditions or not, from fixing the conditions; that is to sayj it could override any fixing of conditions by a State. Where the Commonwealth law comes into conflict with the State law, the former, if it is constitufibnal, will override the latter. must see that there is the safeguard of both Houses of this Parliament. Mr. DUGALD THOMSON -To my mind, the Parliament of the Commonwealth we has already gone very near to exceeding its powers. If it' has the power which is I take it that that is claimed by the Attorney-General, and it is no safeguard to say that the two Houses of this Parliament have to pass a resolution which will enforce those powers and override State laws. How the Attorney-General can say that it is constitutional to give power to the Houses to override the decision of a tribunal appointed by the State tb fix rates of wages and hours of labour, I do not know. orable member, if he supports the amendment, proposes to ignore the decision of the because it only provides that the Commonwealth label shall not be applied to these goods. The Attorney-General is trying, by I think that in granting the Commonwealth label, to practically override conditions which may exist under the decision of the State tribunals that States tribunals, differing as they do in form, and dealing with different conditions, do not impose the same labour conditions. The Commonwealth condition must be, I take it, a universal conditiibn, and there must be no discrimination. They can refuse the granting of the Commonwealth label to one State, although the rate of wages and the hours of labour may have been decided by its tribunal, whilst they can grant it to another State, where different rates of wages and hours of labour may have been established by its tribunal. In my opinion, we are trying to go too far, and, therefore, I support the proposed limitation.

I wish, also, to refer to the statement of the Attorney General in relation to what appeared in the Argus this morning. I had no recollection of the Attorney-General making the statement to which he has just referred. I was perfectly willing to accept the honourable and learned gentleman's assurance, and was prepared to do so although I had failed to find the reference to it in Hansard. know that amongst members of the Opposition there was a general belief that no such intimation had been given, and that this was an entirely new proposal. In the circumstances it appears to me that a very natural error has crept into the Argus, and I certainly do not think that the statement appearing in that newspaper was wilfully made or made from any vindictive or improper motive. think we should adhere to the term of six months, as already agreed upon, because there will be a great many arrangements to be made. the Attorney-General, as I have tried to do before, . that, in making arrangements for the coming into operation of the Bill, the opportunity should be taken to prepare officers in the different States for the reception of applications under h, so that all shall be placed on the same fooling. I endeavoured to secure an amendment of the Bill to give effect to that suggestion, but the Attorney-General assured me that provision for it would be made by regulation. It is only fair that applicants in any of the States should be given an opportunity to register their applications in the States in which they reside, and that the time at which they are received in those States should be accepted as the time of their reception in the central office. I hope that arrangements will be made to facilitate the reception of applications in all the States. [209]2 ney) -It was at my suggestion that the extension of time was -originally agreed to. I argued not that it would take that time to get niatters ready in the Department, but that there were many trade marks registered in the different States by people at the other end of the world; that there would be a rush to register existing trade marks under the Commonwealth law, ancl that success would depend very largely on getting in first. Therefore, I suggested that time should be given, so that it should not be said that we prevented any one now having a State registration, and entitled to Commonwealth registration, from obtaining it, and so that those not on the spot should have the same opportunity to place their case for registrar tion before the Registrar as would be given to others better situated. I also thought that time was required to enable the Go^ I veminents of the'States to re-arrange their staffs. In my opinion, some such re-arrangement will be necessary, because I do not think that the Commonwealth will take over all the States offices'since, in many of these offices, the officials are doing other work besides attending to the registration of trade marks. I admit that the Attorney General, in accepting the amendment, said that he did so for another reason also. '"" another reason also."" I should like to impress upon posed that my arguments had something to do with his acceptance of the amendment:' At any rate, he said that it would probably take six months to make re-arrange* ments. Still, my arguments are as strong now as they were when I first expressed them. I do not think that the honourable and learned gentleman will lose anything by, delaying matters. '; I will meet the honourable member by agree: ing to a period of four months. that the period should be six months; but I feel that, under the circumstances, I cannot force the Minister, and must accept four months.

In the case of a patent, a transfer in the case of a trade mark, the position is dorsement upon the back of a trade mark mark, unless he transfers with it the goodwill of a business. WhatI propose is that there shall be a notification of the assignment. This provision will be an intimation to those who frame the regulations that they must provide for a short registration.

That the Bill be now read a third time. is very undesirable that any Bill should be pushed through the House in one sitting. In my opinion, after amendments have been made in it, and before the third reading is proposed, it should be reprinted. The adoption of that course forms one of the greatest safeguards which the public possess against hasty and ill-advised legislation. the honourable member for Corangamite will not object to the procedure which is now being adopted. If this House were a deliberative assembly, I could understand his arguments; but, as it is merely a machine for registering the opinions of small coteries outside, his remarks have no application. I am sure that the honourable member for Wentworth is speaking for himself, and himself alone. Under those circumstances, we may accept him at his own valuation. I agree with the honourable member for Corangamite that, under ordinary conditions, it is well to allow as much time as possible to elapse between the report stage of a Bill and its third reading.'

We have taken a good deal of trouble to see that it is in proper order, and when we have obtained a fair print of it, after it has passed from this Chamber, I shall have it carefully looked into, and any verbal inaccuracies corrected. Although we have passed through a very exciting time in connection with this Bill, during which we have very sturdily sustained our respective am happy to say that there is not the slightest vestige of anything but good will amongst honourable members all round. agree with the statement of the honourable member for Corangamite, that it is in the highest degree undesirable that Bills of this important character should be rushed through hurriedly. But I should like to remind him that this procedure is simply an alternative to a much more brutal way of completing the consideration of the measure. that the remarks of the honourable member for Parramatta are about the most ungracious that I have heard emanate even from a member of the Opposition. Of his own free will he deliberately entered into an arrangement by which this Bill should be put through all its stages in one sitting, even in the brutal way of which he complains. that the force and brutality of which the honourable member complains has been exercised? Undoubtedly to members of the Opposition, who, not satisfied with legitimate discussion upon it. have persistently and constantly wasted time from the very .moment it was introduced. claim that the Opposition have discussed this measure upon absolutely fair lines. Upon the first occasion that it was considered in Committee, we offered to agree to 57 clauses of it. say a single word in connection with this motion, but when the honourable member for Bland takes the stand that he did, he cannot expect to close our mouths. the Chair is the motion for the third reading of the Bill. When the honourable member for Bland went, as I thought,, beyond fhe scope of fhe motion, I called him to order, and I cannot allow the honourable member for New England to proceed beyond the limits to which I allowed, that honourable member to go. member made statements as to ""the attitude of. the Opposition, to which there should be some reply.

If he considers that they are engaged in a hypocritical pretence of the kind he suggests, that is an additional reason why he should assist us in resisting the proposal that the House shall meet at such an early hour. At this time of the session, the Government ought to make a clear and definite statement as. to the business which they intend to transact before the prorogation, and, if necessary, they should put a period to the time of rising. That has been done in the Legislatures of Victoria and New South Wales. The Victorian Government has stated their intention that the local Legislature shall rise on the 12 th instant. -flays before the contemplated prorogation that such a statement is made. to which I have referred was made a fortnight prior to the proposed date of prorogation. A fortnight will carry us to the 16th December, when honourable members must leave, if they are going to spend Christmas at home. The representatives'of North -Queensland and Western Australia indeed must leave Melbourne not later than the 16th inst, if they are to be home by Christmas, and unless we make up our minds to come back after Christmas, the Government ought to be in a position to say on what day they propose that the House shall rise. Unless they are prepared to treat honourable members in that reasonable, fair, and customary way, I , for one, shall object most strongly to this proposal to take up the further time of the House. If we are to be here from 10.30 a.m. until r i or 12 p.m., we cannot give to the proposed legislation that attention has been a definite object in view. which it requires. Such a proposal means not only sweating in a physical sense, but the degradation of the House in a way that is demoralizing. Why should honourable members sit here till midnight grinding out legislation, about which they are practically ignorant. the honourable member does not know half of what is going on. He is kept here to interject about legislation of which he is ignorant. as usual, is absolutely incorrect. as I have risen to speak, the honourable member has at once jeered at me. the honourable member to address himself to the question before the Chair. out that the Prime Minister is making an outrageous proposal. Let him say when he intends the House to rise, and what is the minimum quantJity of work that he desires us to deal with. If his proposal be reasonable, we shall be glad to help him to carry it out as completely and readily as we can, but he ought not to try to deprive us of the few hours we have to prepare to consider the legislation submitted to us. If his proposal be carried, legislation will be voted upon in ignorance by the majority of honourable members who follow the blind lead of the Government. This motion can mean nothing else. It is unfair to the country that honourable members should not be allowed time for the consideration of the important questions awaiting their consideration. Therefore, in the absence of any further statement by the Prime Minister, I shall be compelled to resist to the utmost his proposal that we shall meet as early as 10.30 a.m. ways been regarded as the duty of the leader of an Opposition to protest against a proposal of this kind, but I think that it is one of the most practical suggestions for clearing the notice-paper that has come be-« fore any Parliament with which I have been associated.

We can put up a good record if we will only apply our minds to our work. It is not uncommon in the States Parliaments for nearly all the important Bills to be passed in the last week or two of the session. hope that if the Prime Minister has made up his mind to have. prolonged sittings, he will make some special arrangements for the Hansard staff. Otherwise, it will mean sweating of the most brutal description. Even sitting as we do, the Hansard staff have to come back in the mornings to read proofs. Their work is not finished by any means when the House rises; they have their ""takes"" to complete, and if we sit thirteen hours a day they will have to work from fourteen to sixteen hours at a .stretch'. ought to have considered that when he was assisting to keep us here for fifty-seven hours. I am saying is reasonable, and I hope that it will receive consideration from the Prime Minister. consideration. by the members of the Anti-Sweating League, or, I am sure, by Labour members to make the Hansard staff work for fifteen or sixteen hours a day until the end of the session. I hope that if we are to have prolonged sittings, special arrangeBay would have been more pertinent and ments will be made for their relief. Approaching the close of a session it is customary for the Prime Minister to state what work he wishes Parliament to do. In the newspapers we read that a number of new Bills are to be introduced. Minister cannot expect that the Bills on the notice-paper, ancl the new Bills which are to be introduced, can receive proper consideration if we sit so manv hours a day? There is a sort of idea abroad that when a Bill is drafted it is perfect. If that were the case, the best thing we could do would be to close the Parliament, ancl allow the draftsman fo frame our legislation. has been wasted this session, not by members of the Opposition, but by honourable members on the Ministerial side. For instance, fourteen days were wasted over the closure. A good deal of time has been wasted in the past by the honourable member for Wide Bay. But for the waste of time which has occurred these long sittings would not be needed. If the Ministers had gone on straight with their measures they would have been almost passed by this time. If we are to meet at half-past 10 o'clock in the morning, the Prime Minister should let us know what work he expects us to do. I do not wish' to come to Melbourne every week. I am willing to sit for whatever time may be necessary, in order to bring the session to a close. We are told that we are to have an Anti-Trusts Bill, and I presume that we shall be asked to sacrifice our opinions, and to accept it holus-bolus. The Trade Marks Bill furnishes a good example of the manner in which the Government Bills are framed. The contingent notice-paper is crowded with amendments which have been framed by Ministers, in order to perfect their own measures. Although the Bills are introduced in this imperfect form, still we are expected not to sav a word about their defects, but to accept them all. If the Prime Minister will outline his programme for the rest of the session, I. shalt be prepared to do all I can in order to get out of this place as soon as possible, but I am not prepared to sit long hours in order to pass an Anti-Trusts Bill. ance of the honourable member for Wide apposite to the occasion had it been made tast session when the honourable member for Maranoa and others thought it necessary, in discussing the Appropriation Bill, to describe the colour of persons hair and eyes, what they ate, drank, and wore, and to mention the number of buttons on their Surely the Prime coafe. There has been nothing of that kind attempted from this side of the House. All criticism has been confined to legitimate channels, and I guarantee that a reference to Hansard will disclose that the waste of time took place last session, at the instance of Labour members then sitting on the Opposition benches, and not this session.
