Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997, the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Bill 1997 and the Migration Agents Registration Renewal Charge Bill 1997 it is also my intention to move a second reading amendment which has been prepared for the consideration of the Committee. The opposition is opposing this legislation for a range of reasons. We believe that, five years after Labor established the first migration system to protect the vulnerable and to try to stop the shonks, the crooks and the rorters, the coalition government unfortunately is about to water down the scheme. The migration agents registration scheme .was introduced in 1992 by the Labor Party, aimed at trying to protect people in the community who are vulnerable to exploitation by unscrupulous or incompetent migration agents. Today, unfortunately, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs( Mr Ruddock) is taking the first steps to increase exploitation of the vulnerable. We would respectfully request that the minister read the front page of the latest Weekend Australian. An article there warns about the misuse of our migration scheme by criminal elements. That is of central importance to our consideration of the legislation before the Main Committee for consideration today. In vkw of that article, the Australian community should understand whether the minister can assure this parliament that the steps he is now taking will not lead to further abuse by criminal elements exploiting our migration scheme. The migration agents registration scheme set up by the former minister, Mr Gerry Hand, under Labor, was quickly judged a success and was strengthened following the recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, in June 1995. We believe that the government is now intending to gut the scheme. That is what it is about, gutting the scheme and basically throwing out elements which we believe were clearly intended to make the operation of the migration system in Australia a system based on integrity and, basically, one in tune with the community's needs. To throw out those aspects which made it valuable and useful to the community, to keep the shell and then to have the hide to pretend that the government has kept the scheme is far from acceptable to the Australian community. Self-regulation is asking the stronger parts of this sector to refrain from exploiting their position. It would be nice if it worked. However, the reality on the ground is that mostly it does not work. Did this government not state only a few weeks ago that self-regulation with",186,Adjournment International Shame Australia Would Suffer If
277,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Nehl) Took The Chair At 10.00 A.m.,,188,Representatives Main Committee
278,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (10.00 A.m.),"In speaking to the MigrationThursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10383 respect to the relationship between small business and big business was not a goer? It would seem that, where the government believes that there are votes out in the small business community, it is willing to oppose self-regulation to try to buy back small business's support. But when it comes to protecting the vulnerable in the community with respect to the operation of the migration system in Australia, this is a government which supports deregulation without proper consideration of the consequences of such deregulation. Was this not because, so the government stated, there was a major power imbalance? I think the role of government is to ensure that we try to correct some of those power imbalances from time to time, not only to ensure that there is integrity in the Australian community but also to ensure that all Australians get a fair go and can operate on the basis that there is a government in place that is committed to ensuring that any imbalances in power are corrected as required from time to time. Under the bill before the committee for consideration today, it is proposed to delegate the regulation of migration agents to the Migration Institute of Australia. Perhaps if this body really represented the majority of migration agents, this scheme would have some chance of operation. However, the membership of the Migration Institute of Australia currently is only about 10 per cent of all migration agents. I must say I take exception to endeavours by this organisation in recent weeks to actually seek to negotiate with the voluntary sector fees that they might feel are appropriate for the purposes of registration if they are to obtain the authority as embodied in the bill to operate the migration agents registration scheme in the future. If the scheme is to come into operation, I would have thought that sector ought to be totally excluded from the requirement to pay fees, yet we have these usurpers out in the community seeking to negotiate, even before the bill is properly considered by the Australian parliament, appropriate registration fees. For the Migration Institute of Australia to take over an efficient scheme for the regulation of migration agents, they will need massive assistance from the department. Minister, your government's own review of the migration agents registration scheme conducted by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in March 1997 found that: The current ... scheme has resulted in the removal from the industry of a number of grossly incompetent or unscrupulous operators who were practising as migration agents prior to its establishment. I also contend that it has succeeded in establishing sufficient barriers to exclude those who have demonstrated a capacity for behaving unethically. Clearly, the role of government is not only about restoring the power balance but also about ensuring that the system operates on the basis of some ethics. The scheme as set up at present works to protect the vulnerable against the greedy, and I think that is exceptionally important. Many people who require assistance on the migration front clearly require special protection and a willingness by a government to actually intervene to ensure they are not exploited and, if anything, ripped off by the greedy in the Australian community. So if the system is working well, why does the government want to change it? Who is pressuring the government to get rid of regulation of the industry? After all, the government's own review also found that the scheme had not adversely affected the competitiveness of the migration advice market. There seems to be no reason to move towards self-regulation other than an ideological reason. 10384 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 I must say from this side of the House that we are not amazed at this approach to issues judging from the government's current consideration of a range of policy issues. It is a government run by ideology, rather than the proper consideration of the impact of those ideological decisions on the Australian community at large-be it with respect to aged care, industrial relations, employment, a willingness to invest in industry policy and support regional Australia or, unfortunately, on this very sensitive issue, migration. The changes, I suggest, must be due to some crass ideological bent-to bash the public sector and contract out whatever you can get your hands on. If anything, it is to reward their mates in the Australian community. That is what it is about. You only have to look not just at this bill and the changes on a range of policy fronts in more recent times but also at the range of appointments across many committees and councils established by the Australian government-be it with respect to sporting activity, employment activity, regional Australia or whatever. It is clearly about rewarding mates. That is what it is about. I also suggest that this is related to the bill currently before the House. It must be so because there is nothing, even in the review which the government bases this bill on, which indicates that self-regulation would be better or even as good as the current system. I understand why some members on the other side of the House get sensitive with respect to these issues. I refer to the fact that the review simply states: There is no basis for public funding of the regulation of the migration advice industry. The entire regulation scheme is currently paid for by registration fees. I might take issue with that but, in any event, who pays does not determine who regulates the agents. A government run regulation system funded by registration fees is perfectly feasible and legitimate. The review also stated that the industry had grown in size, developed a better reputation and had a stronger focus on standards and training. I believe that the issue of training is important. The review states baldly, with no supporting evidence or even argument, that self-regulation is needed to develop industry standards and improve client services. This interesting view immediately follows a paragraph which says that the industry has improved since the advent of the migration agents registration scheme. I The Labor opposition agrees that more training is needed by those who work as migration agents. The bill acknowledges this fact. But, in that context, by cutting funding to the Victorian Immigration Advice and Rights Centre and the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre, the non-profit organisations which provide the bulk of the training, the government has, in effect, cut access to such training which is so fundamentally important to the bill before the House. Agents employed by the voluntary sector represent 21 per cent of all migration agents. Currently, many of these agents are registered but do not pay registration fees. It is proposed by the bill that employees of these agencies pay registration fees. As I have indicated, I object to certain elements that seek to take control of this scheme in the future, that actually seek to engage people in the marketplace to determine registration fees without proper. authority or consideration by this parliament or the minister. Is this a deliberate strategy by the government to undermine the financial viability of the voluntary sector? It is basically about ripping away from those who really try to assist the underprivileged in the community their capacity to look after the people who really need assistance, while, at the same time, looking after their mates in the broader community. Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 10385 Those who go to the voluntary agencies-the migrant resource centres, the IARC, the needy in the Australian community. They are those who want to sponsor their parents, their children, their husband or their wife. If the voluntary agencies have to pay registration for their employees and volunteers, they will not be able to afford to provide this very valuable service to the Australian community and, more importantly, to those most in need in the Australian community. The question, therefore, is: in whose interest is it that the poorest of the poor will either have nowhere to go or be forced to pay higher, sometimes exorbitant, fees to the private sector? That is the crux of this bill, forcing the poorest in the Australian community into the hands of the greedy and the exploiters while those who want to bring in someone to take the job of an Australian worker will be able to pay for good advice. Of course they will be able to pay for good advice. I am not saying that all migration agents in the private sector are greedy or unscrupulous by any means. Many of those who support self-regulation do so not because they hope thus to evade scrutiny but for reasons which they see as valid. However, we currently have a good system which provides some protection for consumers, and I would argue that we are obligated to protect it. There is a responsibility on this House to seriously consider that question in this debate today. It is about ensuring that, if you have a good system which provides some protection for consumers, you must seriously consider protecting it and keeping it in place. If anything, the House should be debating how we improve it, how we strengthen it, not how we rip it apart. Let us, as proposed by the bill, ensure that migration agents undertake some training each year to upgrade their skills. On the whole, migration advice cannot be controlled by market driven competition. It should be beyond market driven competition. It is not about selling apples or pears; it is about looking after people, looking after the needy in the Australian community. It is not about dollars and cents; it is about people who need assistance. Most of those who use migration agents, as I have said, basically use them on only one occasion-to apply for a family member or a spouse to come here. There really is not an opportunity to shop around. It is often at a time of desperate need. The aim of the registration scheme is to protect the Australian community against the activities of unscrupulous agents aiming to rip off the community, not just their clients. Whenever an agent helps a client lie on a form, he is rorting the system. We should not forget that fact because we all see those types of cases come across our desks. I must say that there is generally on both sides of the House a commitment to ensuring that those types of people are not allowed to rort the system. We also go out of our way to expose those clien-s and agents involved in seeking to rort and destroy a system that is basically held up in the international community as being a decent migration system. Every fake marriage, I suggest, is an abuse of our hospitality. Make no mistake, migration agents have arranged fake marriages for clients. They have in the past and they will continue to do so in the future. Every time a prostitute is brought in on a visitors visa, and then applies for permanent residence, the Australian community is rorted; it is being ripped off. Make no mistake, migration agents have arranged this for their clients. They are to be condemned. 10386 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 Every time a business migrant moves funds into Australia for a strictly limited period, and then moves them out again, the Australian migration system is being abused. As I have said, there are good and bad migration agents. But every time one of these migration agents absolutely rorts the Australian system, then it places further obligation on this parliament to ensure that the system in place is able to control the capacity of those rorters to undermine the integrity of the migration system in Australia. Every time a criminal from overseas comes into this country with the help of someone here, we are being exploited and our safety is being put at risk, as reported in the Weekend Australian of last weekend. The migration agents registration scheme aims to weed out these unscrupulous, criminal agents, and so it ought. The system ought to be protected, it should be strengthened and it ought to have the support of both sides of the House. By gutting the system you are making it easier for the unscrupulous to function. That is what it is about: making it easier for the criminal elements to come into Australia, making it easier for those who want to rort the system amongst the migration agents-and it is not all of them-to actually undermine the integrity of the migration system in Australia. I am not saying that the current disciplinary procedure is ideal. However, self-regulation will not deal at all with the crooks and the rorters. And that is what some of these migration agents are, they are crooks and rorters, they are un-Australian, and they are working against the best interests of Australia as a nation both domestically and internationally. We do not object to setting up a mediation process to deal with consumer complaints. That can be done without self-regulation, and the minister knows that as well as I do. The opposition fears that self regulation would be a backward step and may lead, in actual fact, to deregulation. Minister, you know, and every MP in this House knows, that electorate staff have quite enough work to do without returning to the bad old days of trying to sort through misleading, wrong and illegal advice to would be migrants and their sponsors. More importantly, those hard cases often land on our desks after unscrupulous migration agents have ripped off ordinary people in need, charged exorbitant fees, misled them as to their capacity to assist them on a range of migration issues, and then, having ripped them off, basically said that it is the government's fault-blame the government irrespective of who was in power: 'It's not our fault, you go and see your local federal member of parliament, they are to blame-not me, the migration agent; I have just taken your dollars and run, and I will continue to work one step ahead of you with money in my pocket while you and your family suffer.' Those who are competent and caring agents-the majority, I suggest-have nothing to fear from the current system. The current system is for their benefit because it is about ensuring that those decent agents-as against the crooks and rorters-are out there in the Australian community with a respect and a capacity to operate in a proper way. But the community as a whole has a lot to lose from the dismantling of the safeguards put in place to weed out the shonks and crooks and rorters. That is our fear about the bill before the House today-we go down the deregulation path and it can potentially lead to the shonks, the crooks and the rorters getting the upper hand, unfortunately, with respect to the operation of a system which is basically aimed at assisting the needy in the Australian community. On that basis, as I indicated at the outset, I move: That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: ""the House declines to give the Bill a second reading, and: Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10387 (l) deplores the Government's proposal to self-regulate the migration advice industry, being of the view that this will open the way to the most unscrupulous agents to exploit migrants' vulnerability and lack of knowledge; (2) condemns the Government for proposing that voluntary agencies pay registration fees and regards this action as a deliberate strategy to undermine the service delivery of the voluntary sector; (3) notes that under the self-deregulation proposal there will be no overall monitoring authority and that consumer rights and protection will be marginalised as the decision makers are also members of the industry association, with no independent overseer to review any decision made; (4) notes that the reduction in the time allowed to lodge an objection reveals the Government's disastrous failure to ensure a high standard of character, professionalism, expertise and accountability within the profession and that this will further compound the barriers for consumers to complain, as many who have grounds to will be from non-English speaking backgrounds and will require extra time in order to respond to a nomination; and (5) is of the view that arrangements should be introduced to continue the present arrangements"". Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (10.20 a.m.)-Thank you for the opportunity to speak today on the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Bill 1997, the Migration Agents Registration Renewal Charge Bill 1997 and the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997. This legislation is design-d to further enhance the migration program and focuses on the move towards self-regulation for the migration advice industry. Essentially, the bill is about consumer protection and ensuring that those in need of immigration assistance will have the confidence they need to get a service based on the minimum standard of quality, and that they will be protected. It also ensures that the service is competitively priced and that those seeking that advice will have the opportunity to get redress of a service which may be incompetent or unscrupulous. The need for protection in this particular service industry arises because of the extraordinary vulnerability of those who seek to make use of the service. The member for Batman( Mr Martin Ferguson) is not really concerned about the vulnerability of people. He speaks about protecting people who are unable to protect themselves and, clearly, this bill is about protecting those people. I would also like to note for the information of the member for Batman that the government is currently giving more money-some $5 million a year for the next four yearsthrough a grant scheme to help those people most in need, particularly refugees. This vulnerability is partly due to consumers lacking skills and knowledge in this area, and this was noted in a 1995 report by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. That report acknowledged the adverse consequences which could flow if people received inadequate or inaccurate advice-the most serious being that the applicants could lose their chance to qualify for a visa or to stay in Australia-so the federal government has long been aware that there have existed inadequacies and loopholes in the present regulatory migration advice system. It is amazing to hear the member for Batman speak about migration agents in the way that he has, implying somehow that all migration agents act with impropriety. The experience that I have had in the industry is that there are good and honourable people providing good advice and high quality counsel and care for their clients. It was incredible to hear him slur the industry the way that he has today. Mr Ted Grace-There are some crooks. that the majority of agents behave with impropriety. I find those views he expressed here today offensive; I am sure that many migration agents have high integrity. One of them, the former",188,Representatives Main Committee
279,Ms Gambaro,"There are crooks in any industry, but the member for Batman is implying10388 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 member for my seat, the Honourable John Hodges, would find those views very offensive. I know that the previous member for Petrie has an outstanding reputation in this field in Queensland. It is also important to note that early in June 1996, we commissioned a review of the migration agents registration scheme-and I have this booklet here with me today. The terms of reference were agreed to by both the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs( Mr Ruddock). It was the first regulatory arrangement to be reviewed by the Commonwealth as part of the competition principles agreement which were reported in March of this year. The bill is in response to this very comprehensive review. I would like to highlight who was on that particular review. We had some rather outstanding people on that review. You could not get a more balanced group of people. We had Mr Ian Spicer, the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; Pamela O'Neil, Chairperson of the Migration Agents Registration Boardof the Australian Trade Practices Reporter; Cheryl Webster, a grant-in-aid worker for Careforce for the Anglican Home Mission; the Honourable John Hodges, whom I have mentioned: a former member of this House and very well respected on both sides, and Queensland State President of the Migration Institute of Australia, who has worked for many years in this role as a former minister in this area; and Pauline Mathieson, a national committee member of the Migration Institute of Australia. All these people worked very diligently on the report, and you could not get a more balanced group of people. In light of today' s debate, it is worthwhile highlighting some of their key recommendations, and I would like to do that now. They reported that the migration agents registration scheme must improve its competency standards. This is what it is all about. It is about competency and doing the job right, particularly in relation to entry level training. It is important to stress that. They said that higher entry standards were needed in the restructuring of registration and the accreditation process. What is wrong with an accreditation process and having a higher standard? They reported that the registration fee scheme should reflect those particular competency skills; that legal practitioners who provide assistance should be required to register as migration agents; and that provision should also be made for an industry-run complaints resolution service. The committee said that serious consideration also needed to be given to options necessary for the industry to achieve self-regulation and to develop an industry standard. The report went on to outline the three models of regulation. The first was voluntary self-regulation, working through mechanisms, including setting membership criteria which guaranteed that its members met set competency and ethical standards, and adopting disciplinary procedures to deal with members who breached the code. That is very important. When we look at a number of industries that are also increasing their level of competency, why does this industry have to be excluded from that? They should have a well-developed system and a code of competency and conduct. Other mechanisms were the adoption of a complaints resolution scheme to resolve",193,Representatives Main Committee

The second model was self-regulation. This model would see the power to register fall within the precincts of the Migration Act under the auspices of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs. The final model discussed was that of co-regulation, which focused on the linkages between the government and the industry to regulate the industry. But it was concluded that the migration advice industry still needs to mature in order to achieve true self-regulation. With this in mind, the bill reflects the government's decision to introduce a form of statutory selfregulation for a period of two years, set to commence in March 1998. This bill provides for the appointment of a Migration Institute of Australia as the migration agents registration authority, which will have statutory back-up and departmental assistance, particularly in the area of financial accountability. The referral of instances of unregistered practice and fraud will also fall within the scope of this particular authority, and it includes provisions in relation to performance, financial accountability and also complaints handling. The amendments geared towards monitoring the competency of agents are being spearheaded by the mandatory requirement for all persons, including lawyers, seeking to practise as migration agents to be registered. As well as the introduction of an annual registration renewal, there will now be a requirement for proof, on application for renewal, of continuing professional development, which includes keeping abreast of the most up-to-date regulations, legislation and other migration requirements. Clearer and more stringent registration will also be set for agents working in the voluntary sector, and that is for agents who do not charge clients a fee. There are some very good people in the voluntary sector who provide good advice. But there are also people in the voluntary sector who need to ensure that they maintain their level of accreditation and give good advice to people-because giving bad advice can have absolutely monumental consequences. The scheme will now include assistance to be provided by persons seeking to sponsor or to monitor another person for a visa. The term 'immigration assistance' will be clarified so as to not include assistance provided by travel agents or translation and interpretation service providers. All of these measures are designed to better streamline applications by persons who seek to register as migration agents-and what is wrong with that?-as well as to protect the applicants. In the areas of disciplinary measures and dispute resolution, the most significant amendment is that disciplinary matters involving lawyers and agents will now be referred to the relevant professional bodies, which are the most appropriate bodies to deal with these issues. Also, the Migration Agents Registration Authority will be able to refer parties in dispute for mediation, and there will be an enhancement of the relevant offence provisions to bring them into line with the Commonwealth policy on criminal law, which is a very good measure. It is proposed to introduce a registration fee for those agents operating in the voluntary sector. This has been found to be necessary as at present the absence of a fee for those in the voluntary sector sometimes results in cross-subsidisation in that private sector. To offset the difficulty that those in that sector will have in meeting the costs of registration, the government is going to impose a much lower fee. Also, the Migration Institute of Australia will be authorised to collect fees on behalf of the Commonwealth as a more efficient collection measure. 10390 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October· 1997 With the aim of the program being to progress towards self-regulation, there will.also be measures to ease its introduction over two years. Agents working in the voluntary sector will have a reasonable time to pay any new charges and agents who are already registered as agents wiIl have two years from the commencement date of this scheme to meet continuing professional development requirements. The migration advice industry, on the whole, has a very significant role to play. It is essential for the future development of an efficient and streamlined immigration program in this country that these measures be implemented to ensure that there is a competent, affordable, ethical and reputable migration advice industry. Not only is this for the protection of the industry's consumers and the community as a whole, but it is also necessary in order to complement the other wide ranging legislative and administrative initiatives that the government has already introduced into the migration program. These initiatives form a very tightly controlled package which will be monitored closely in order that the program be more efficient and be more effectively serving both migrants and the Australian people. The government should be commended for comprehensively addressing these broader issues within the program and for its continued commitment to improving the migration program. Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997, the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Bill 1997, and the Migration Agents Registration Renewal Charge Bill 1997. I support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Martin Ferguson), the shadow minister. Before those opposite get too excited about some of the things I am going to say about migration agents, let me make the caveat that I know there are good and bad in every community and that not all migration agents are crooks who rip people off. I ani going to speak about a couple of bad examples I know of because they are the only examples I know about. That is not surprising because many of the simple migration cases go through without ever first going to a member of parliament. We do not hear about the simple cases. It is the really difficult cases that go to migration agents. The almost impossible cases go there, and therein lies the difficulty. I enjoyed the speech of the honourable member for Petrie (Ms Gambaro). She said at the outset that this legislation was all about extra consumer confidence. I take issue with that because I do not think it is going to give the consumer any confidence at all. I think it is going to open up an area that unscrupulous operators will be able to get into and they will operate without the protection that is there now. Every member of parliament, just as they have five or six basket cases who come and see them when the full moon is out, has their five favourite stories concerning migration rip-offs. As I said before, we hear of these because it is the really difficult cases that go to migration agents. As the member representing the IIIawarra and its large ethnic population, so much of my time and my office staff's time is taken up with migration cases and always they are the very, very difficult ones. The migration agents registration scheme has been in operation since 1992. It was created in response to an alarming number of complaints from the community that unqualified and unscrupulous migration advisers were working in the field. I must put it on the public record that I have always been opposed to migration agents. It is no use saying that it was a",194,Representatives Main Committee
285,Mr Hollis (Throsby) {10.32 A.m.),"I rise to speak in this debate on the MigrationThursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 10391 government that I was part of which introduced it. I was opposed to the scheme even when we introduced it, and argued against it. NothingI have seen of migration agents' operations over the years has convinced me to think less unkindly of many-not all-of these people. Yet the government is going to make migration agents subject to self-regulation. I just cannot believe that: if any group should not be let loose on the public, migration agents are that group. My personal and long held view is that migration agents should be abolished. I think that they mislead and they build up false expectations. You only have to look at the advertisements in the weekend Sydney papers-I do not know about those in other states-to see that there are always as such as those I have taken up with successive ministers for immigration, saying that these as mislead. They say, in effect, 'Having problems with migration? See us'-all these issues. And people do go there and see them. Migration agents can do no more, and most often do far less, than the local federal member of parliament. As the shadow minister has said-and I will illustrate this later-many of these cases that start off with migration agents end up, after the fee is paid, on our desk. It is we members of parliament who have to do the work. I have no objection to that. I think that is one of the roles of a member of parliament, and that is why I have always been opposed to migration agents. I know that each of my colleagues can, and I suspect will, tell their stories about migration agents during this debate. I have had several shams operating in my area. One concerned Chinese immigrants, who would go to a lawyer who was also registered as a migration agent. This lawyer, after taking their money, would then start harassing my office about approaching the minister about a whole lot of other things. It was so blatant that the agent was pocketing the money and then wanting my office to do all the work that my office decided that we would have no dealing with that lawyer at all. Every time that lawyer would ring up or get people to ring up, we would say, 'Are you dealing with So-and-so?' If they said yes, we would say, 'He has taken on that role for you. Let him follow it through.' My office made it clear to these constituents that in future they would be required to come and see us before going to a migration agent if they expected us to take up the case. My objection was that they were paying this agent $5,000 but all they got for their $5,000 was a telephone call from the lawyer to my office, putting the case on my desk. It is just unbelievable. This is my argument with migration agents. They are in a business first and foremost; they must promise success to get people to part with their money. Yet they are fully aware that many of the cases they take on have no chance of success. I do not know why people are saying that migration agents give them all this advice. Many of the cases have absolutely no chance of success. We all know how difficult it is to migrate to Australia today. Over two million people apply to migrate to Australia every year, and what do we take-60,000 or 70,000 people. There are just so many cases that it is just absolutely hopeless. My policy has always been, in the 14 years I have been a member of parliament, that we will fight to the nth degree on a case. We will go and make representation and, if necessary, see the minister. We will make all the representations. But we are always very frank with everyone about migration problems or migration chances. When people come to see us, we go through the points score with them. We ask them all the usual questions-any remaining relatives there, the whole thing-and often there is absolutely no chance. Members would know the points system: if it is very close we can say, 10392 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 'Okay, we will have a look at your language skills. We will have a look at your qualifications,' and we will say, 'Yes, we will take your second cousin into account. You have an extended family.' We go through all these things with them. But when there are 30 or 40 points missing, even though people cry in your office and so on you have to be honest with them, because sooner or later you are going to face these people and say, 'I did everything I could. I went and saw the minister three times, I did this and I did that. But there was no chance.' Why build their hopes up for 12 or 18 months? It is much better to tell them first of all. We go through the points system; we do everything. We always say to people, 'If you really want me to write to the minister or to go and see the minister, I will. But this will probably delay it, because they will have to get the file down from Rockdale'-or wherever they keep it in Sydney-and things like that. I have always believed that if a constituent says, 'You are my local member. I insist that you do this,' or, 'that you write to the minister,' I should write to the minister or do whatever it is. But, in honesty, I tell them, 'Yes, I will write to the minister, but I have got to tell you honestly that your chances are Buckley's. It might change later on or the policy might be different' -and I go through all of the reasons why we are only taking so few people into Australia. We have to tell them. I believe it is wrong and immoral to build up people's expectations falsely, knowing that there is no chance of meeting what are very stringent immigration requirements. Only two weeks ago, I think it was, I had a Macedonian business person come in to see me. There are a lot of Macedonian people in my electorate. This Macedonian gentleman had a 44year-old female cousin here on a visitors visa. He came in to see me. because, as he told me, he wanted her status changed from visitor to permanent resident. First of all, I said, 'There is absolutely no chance. The best you can do is to get her to go back and then apply.' I went on with all the arguments about jumping the queue if they did it. I said, 'Whatever government it is, whether it is the Labor Party or the Liberal Party, the minister will not change. They are vcry hard on this, for right reasons.' I said if they went back and then applied, we would watch it through. I went through the whole procedure. I asked about the cousin's qualifications, but there were none; I asked about language ability, where the bulk of the family lived and about health; I said that they would have to have a police check-all the things we do. It was obvious that cven on the most generous interpretation this woman would not meet the requirements to migrate to Australia-not least in that she had a husband in Macedonia, yet she wanted to stay here. I just said, 'We can't do this.' I said that, even if she went back to Macedonia and then applied and came out, it would be very difficult. But there was Buckley's chance of getting her status changed from visitor to permanent resident. My constituent let me know that money was no object. He said, 'Colin, it doesn't matter how much it costs.' I said, 'It is not really the money. It is not a case of whether you can support the woman here or not. There are requirements and laws, and if she does not meet the requirements you have got Buckley'S chance.' It was not a question of money or of his financial support of the cousin, but there was no way that the cousin, on my reading of the points, could migrate to Australia. It was obvious that the person absolutely did not believe me. Rightly or wrongly, I do not have many Liberal members of parliament in my area. I used to have a Liberal senator there, and any time people were in a difficult situation like that I Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10393 always said to them, 'Go and see Senator Baume' -as it used to be; he had his office in Wollongong. 'Don't take my word for it. Go and see Senator Baume.' SoI said to this person, because money was no object to him, 'Why don't you see a Liberal member? If you think that I am just saying this because I am a member of the opposition or I do not want to take on the case or something like that, go and see one of the government members in our area or in Sydney. But I suspect that that person would come to exactly the same conclusion as mine.' The plot thickened, however, because that guy then told me that he had been to see a migration agent who suggested he come and see me. Do you know how much he paid? He paid that migration agent $12,000. Twe:-e thousand dollars he paid and do you know why he parted with that money? I actually said to him, 'Look, mate, you might as well have taken that $12,000 out there on the road and stuck a match to it and burnt it for all the success you are going to get.' That migration agent had promised that person that he would guarantee that that cousin would get permanent residency in Australia. He had given a guarantee. I said, 'Did you get it in writing?' He said, 'No'. I said, 'Mate, before you ever part with money like that, you get something in writing from that migration agent.' He had given $12,000 because the migration agent had promised that they would get that person in. He just could not get that person into Australia. The agent had said he would pull out all stops. I said, 'What do you think that person can do that I cannot do as a member of parliament? I can go and see the minister; I can go through the whole thing.' He said, 'Colin, he promised me that he would get them permanent residency.' It is outrageous that these kinds of promises are made and that such huge fees are taken from these people with so little result at the end of the day. The proposal to self-regulate the migration agents industry is yet another blow to those people who are exploited and vulnerable to the snake oil charms of those expensive advisers. The legislation allows the most unscrupulous migration agents to stay in business, to make their unending promises, to keep sucking money out of people who are vulnerable and lack'the knowledge of the processing of attempts to remain in Australia. The legislation provides for the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs( Mr Ruddock) to appoint a Migration Institute of Australia, which will be the authority which registers migration agents. Some of the migration institute's responsibilities will be to register applicants and take disciplinary action against registered agents. On page 44 of the bill's explanatory memorandum, it is made clear that the MIA preparation task for its new responsibilities will be quite extensive. It says that the MIA will need to 'prepare to take on a role of industry regulator, including building its membership base'. At this time the MIA is a small organisation with a membership not at all representative of the migration agent industry. At the time of the MARS review in 1996, the MIA membership comprised only 12 per cent of migration agents who dealt mainly with migration registration. I know that when the shadow minister mentioned sham marriages some people objected. I have seen sham marriages down in my area and I tell you one other area that we ought to look at when we are looking at sham marriages. We ought to look at the marriage celebrants. I had a marriage celebrant in my area and he was marrying people so that they could stay here in Australia. They did not have the requirements and I got him into my office and I went through the whole thing with him. I said, 'Look, this person was here on a visitors visa or this and that. They don't meet the requirements. Why did you perform this marriage ceremony?' He said to me, 'Because there is nothing in the regulations that says that I, as a marriage 10394 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 celebrant, should check the requirements of people staying here. You check whether they are married or not. You check all sorts of things, but you do not have to check their status in Australia.' They are in Australia as a visitor or whatever it is and they will marry them under the false belief that they will then be allowed to stay in Australia. I am most concerned also about the attack on the voluntary system. In my area, we have the Illawarra Migrant Resource Centre, which does a lot of good work. We often work very closely with them on some of these cases. Indeed, we sometimes ask people to go in and sethem when it is a really difficult case and we know there is going to be no success. We ask them to confirm our reading of the situation. As I understand it-and I could be wrong herewhere in the past only one fee has been charged, now each person given advice in that migrant resource centre is going to have to pay the fee. They are not going to be able to do it. I did hear I think it was the member of Petrie say that is was a lower fee. I am not quite sure how much it is, but I mean, this is going to put thehave had with the migrant resource centre on this, they are very worried that, if each person is going to be subjected to a fee, then that is going to put them out of that business and they will not be able to afford to pay that fee, especially given the cuts that have been imposed on the migrant resource centres recently. They are not going to be able to afford to pay that fee, therefore they are going to be put out of work. We are going to force these people into the agents who can afford to pay the fee-the wealthy ones. As I have always said, not every . migration agent is a rip-off merchant. But, my God, there are enough of them who are rip-off merchants to set alarm bells ringing in my mind. I think this is a disastrous step and this is why I so strongly support the amendment moved by the shadow minister. a contribution will be made in accordance with the standing orders. I object strongly to rowdy interjections across the chamber and I advise my intention to enforce the standing orders. I call the honourable member for Deakin. the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997, the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Bill 1997, and the Migration Agents Registration Renewal Charge Bill 1997, will provide certainty and security to some of the most vulnerable people in our society, Australia's would be or newly arrived migrants and their families. I think it is fair to say that all of us who are speaking on this bill recognise the need for such security and for such need to protect the vulnerable in our society. The problems are well known to us. They have certainly been elucidated quite well today by speakers from both sides. There is disagreement about the solution. With that in mind, I, too, rise today to support the government's legislation but oppose the amendments from the member for Batman( Mr Martin Ferguson). In my electorate of Deakin, one in four people, a total of 29,000, were born overseas. Recent evidence suggests their proportion is rising. Over half of Deakin's migrants are from non-English speaking countries such as Vietnam, China, Greece and Italy. English is not the main language spoken at one in six homes in my electorate. One in 10 local migrants speaks English not well or not at all. These people faced immense challenges as they prepared to move to this country or in sponsoring their relatives to join them.

289,Mr Barresi (Deakin) (10.51 A.m.),"These cognate bills that we are discussing today,Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10395 government and new laws from across the sea is a formidable task for everyone. And it is even harder for those who do not speak English. These challenges alone prompt many to seek immigration advice from third parties. They have every right to do so, of course, but some people may seek such advice not realising that they do not need it. In some cultures, for example, support from an official is mandatory for dealing with government. Potential migrants from these countries may not realise that they are allowed to apply by themselves in this country. I am aware that cases have also been documented where the migrants somehow gained the impression that a particular migration agent could sway authorities in his or her favour and those migration agents that create that perception, of course, are doing a disservice to their industry at best and are dishonest at most. Where people have migrated and are trying to support their family to join them, the stress of being kept apart from loved ones for a prolonged period sometimes makes them desperate. Sometimes they are pushed to accept the promises of these unscrupulous agents without question. Sadly, often those most at risk are the ones with the most to -lose-those who apply under the humanitarian program. It is heart-wrenching for them to know that loved ones live in arduous, even dangerous, conditions in their home country. Who in this situation would not seek out every avenue that offers even the slightest chance of successful reunion? In both onshore and offshore applications, many humanitarian applicants and their families enter into expensive and often futile appeals out of sheer desperation. In my experience, I have found that many people do not, for example, understand that appeals to the Federal Court can only review the way in which a decision was made and cannot overturn a decision made elsewhere. I am certainly not saying that migration agents in Australia have a widespread problem with ethical standards. Many in the industry, both profit and non-profit, have been shown to provide high levels of service at reasonable charge. Because of that, I am particularly concerned about the amendments that are being proposed by the member for Batman( Mr Martin Ferguson), who talks about self-regulation as being some sort of recipe for disaster, as being some sort of anomaly out there amongst the professions. He may not be aware of it, coming from an ACTU and union background, but for those of us who do have a professional background, self-regulation is very common. It is very common amongst accountants, lawyers, even with doctors. You cannot get permission to practise in those professions unless you go through the appropriate self-regulatory body. In my own profession too, as a psychologist, we have the Australian Psychological Society that regulates the profession and makes sure that we are ethical in what we do and we achieve the required standards that are set down by the profession. It is nothing new. It is not a recipe for disaster. It is commonplace. As we very well know, migration agents often have another profession, a higher profession. In the case of lawyers, of course, they will not only be part of a self-regulatory regime for migration agents but also for their own profession at the bar where they operate. The member for Batman also went on to say that a lot of them are crooks and rorters. I say to him that most of the people out there are not crooks and rorters, but in fact are very good, honourable people who have the interests of their clients at heart. Sure, I agree, as the member for Throsby( Mr Hollis) has indicated, that there are a few bad apples that spoil it for everyone. But there are other ways in which to tackle those individuals, and I know that self10396 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 regulation will do that. These crooks and rorters that the member for Batman refers to are not as widespread as he makes out. The other point that was raised is that migration agents, because they are crooks and rorters, are allowing criminals, prostitutes and other unsavoury characters into this country. Let me say to the honourable member for Batman that if he wants a bill which is going to tackle every specific issue in regard to migration, then it will be a cumbersome effort at best. There is a bill that will be before the House-in fact, I believe it might even be before the House some time this week; if not, when we come back-which looks at the whole issue of how we control those migrants or prospective migrants who have a character other than that which is seen to I be acceptable in this country. I believe that bill will be the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No.8). There are other mechanisms available, if the honourable member for Batman has those concerns; but trying to bring it into this bill and asking that this bill cover these sorts of issues is expecting far too much of one piece of legislation. Australia continues to be seen as a land of opportunity, freedom and democracy by people abroad. Given this reputation, no wonder migration advisory services are in demand. Those operating in this industry should be supported to offer their services and make the most of what has apparently been an underserviced market. Over the past 18 months, I have worked hard to build a good working relationship with the organisations in my electorate that provide assistance to these people. Groups such as the Communities Councils on Ethnic Issues, the Cambodian Community Welfare Association, the Laotian Migrant Welfare Association and other migrant resource groups provide valuable assistance and advice to newly arrived migrants and their families on a not for profit basis. For the member for Batman to suggest, as he does in his amendment No.2, that voluntary agents should not be paying a registration fee, is to miss the point of what the registration fee is all about. The registration fee itself becomes an incentive for those voluntary associations to make sure that their standards of operation, their professionalism, meet the requirements of the migration agents registration scheme. Without the fee, there is little control that can take place. The member for Throsby asked what the fees are. The fee for agents will be $1,000, but the fee for the non-fee charging agents will be $450. So there is a wide discrepancy there between the fee charging agents, at $1,000, and the non-fee charging agents, at $450. There is an incentive there, of course. If they meet the benchmarks that are required for levels of service, then that fee will subsequently reduce. Re-registration, for example, for the voluntary sector agent will then be $350. It is not a burden, as the member for Throsby( Mr Hollis) indicated, but certainly something which is manageable within the confines of those voluntary agents-and what better way to make sure that those voluntary agents, too, meet the standards required? This is a relatively young and fast growing industry. After all, the current regulatory framework-the migration agents registration scheme-was only established five years ago. Unfortunately, it is an industry where a few bad apples have threatened the reputation of all. Of the 4,000 or so applications for registration since 1992, 400 people have been refused registration and another 780 have been deregistered. So there is a deregistration process that can take place. Many of the people who have approached my office seeking information on Australia's immigration laws tell me that they do so because they cannot afford the thousands of dollars charged by immigration agents. Others have rung my office in tears because they, too, have Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10397 paid considerable sums and feel that the agent is not taking action. SoI am at one there with the story that the member for Throsby mentioned to us. It is not unique to one member's office; it is commonplace. But the solution is not necessarily to introduce amendments, as the member for Batman has, but to support self-regulation and the bill that is proposed by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs( Mr Ruddock). Complaints about fees and various unscrupulous practices have been well documented in this House through a series of previous reviews. I applaud the measures contained in this bill that will provide greater protection to migrant families in Deakin and elsewhere by requiring agents to prove that they have kept up with modifications to immigration laws. By improving the complaints process, simple measures, such as mediation, will ease the cost and complexity for migrants and their families while still bringing agents to account for alleged improper actions-and this service will be free. Agents will be required to provide a statement of services before being able to claim payments. If payment is made without such a statement being received, the client can reclaim the payment in full. So it is an up-front, transparent process that takes place between the client and the migration agent. The legislation will continue to ensure that practising lawyers who provide migration advice continue to be governed by the same codes of conduct as other agents. There will be a closing of a loophole that meant people advising on sponsorship or nominations did not have to be registered migration agents, and the establishment of a new body, the Migration Agents Registration Authority, will oversee the new system. There will be a system of penalties for violations which can range up to 10 years gaol for unregistered persons who charge a fee for migration advice services. These are the sorts of measures that, even with a self-regulatory mechanism, will ensure that the prospective clients are protected from those very unscrupulous agents that the opposition keeps referring to. In addition to establishing new benchmarks for protecting the vulnerable, today's legislation will also set the scene for future industry self-regulation without withdrawing that protection. Sixteen months ago I argued in this House for an extension to the migration agents registration scheme because self-regulation seemed premature at that stage. I also vowed to keep an open mind to the possibility of self-regulation. I now feel that the time has come to start offering this industry some additional responsibility, without the government handing over total control just yet. This brings me to the third point of the amendments moved by the member for Batman. Under the self-regulation proposal, he says that there will be no overall monitoring authority. What does he think the minister is? The minister is an overall monitoring authority over the entire scheme. He is there and he will be ensuring that not only the principles but the spirit of the legislation, in the way the migration agents perform their work, are maintained. The changes that we are debating here today will allow the government to reduce the red tape incumbent on migration agents, many of whom of course are small business owners. This is in keeping with our overall commitment as a government to ensuring that small businesses, whatever they are, have government regulation reduced. These changes will challenge those in this industry to continually upgrade their skills and ensure that we do not develop a twotiered industry in this country. The legislation will both require and provide the means for the 10398 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 hard-working people in community organisations to upgrade their skills and ensure that the advice that they provide continues to be of the best possible quality. It is right that governments should regularly review the regulation of a relatively new and growing industry such as this, and it is right for industries to move towards self-regulation as they mature. It is also right that those operating in such an industry improve their ability to operate ethically and to work with each other to continue to monitor developments in their field. I look forward to being able to advise my constituents that this government is continuing to look after their interests, and I commend the bill to the House. member for Deakin( Mr Barresi) talked about self-regulation not being new or novel, and about the coalition being committed to cutting red tape for small business-in this case, the small businesses of migration agents. The proposition turns upon an assumption that self-regulation in this industry in particular will be more effective than regulation, notwithstanding the disastrous performance of this industry before it was regulated. That performance has improved under regulation. An example in comparison is the self-regulation by the New South Wales Law Society in this particular area versus that of migration agents as covered by the legislation. There have been almost 1,000 complaints from individuals and agents during the term of the current legislation. Out of those complaints, quite a number of convictions of unregistered practices or unregistered agents, cautions, suspensions and cancellations were effected under the legislation. Those successful prosecutions brought about a reduction in real terms of the number of complaints-as compared with the difficulties that we confronted before the legislation. Compare that situation with the self-regulatory practices of the Law Society, which I suppose is a nice comparison. The total number of lawyers suspended by the Law Society of New South Wales, arising from over 1,700 complaints over the entire period of the operation of this legislation, was just one. This is self-regulation in what is essentially a closed shop-not the Migration Institute, which only covers some 10 per cent of the industry; you could hardly describe that as a closed shop. But you could certainly describe the Law Society as a closed shop. It commands a great deal of respect and has many members. Its degree of success of self-regulation in this industry resulted in the suspension of just one lawyer. That is how effective self-regulation has been in this industry. Compare that with the government's statutory regulations, and it is a much more favourable comparison. Prior to the introduction of the registration scheme by the Labor government in 1992, the provision of immigration advice was always a matter of chance and luck, pretty much. Prior to this time, there was no regulation of the industry other than the limited level of protective provisions in the Migration Act, which focused on misconduct rather than consumer protection. This was not a happy situation for any of the players. The respectable agents were given a bad name by the unscrupulous and ignorant operators. We can look at some of examples of things that happened before we introduced the legislation in 1992. Some of those were compiled by the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre in their report Free and independent immigration advice which examined data on clients collected between July 1990 and November 1992. The examples include: an agent who disappeared after being paid for advising a client to lodge an application which could not succeed; an agent who was holding a client's passport",200,Representatives Main Committee
290,Mr Dargavel (Fraser) (11.06 A.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, the previous speaker, theThursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10399 because he still 'owed' $800 for his advice bill even though the advice he received was wrong; an adviser who advised a client to apply for an entry permit which could never be granted and charged $3,000 for that advice, and when the client complained the adviser threatened to report her to the Department of Immigration. This is a situation where the clients are utterly powerless and the subject of predatory practices. Other examples include: an agent who charged a couple $4,000 to prepare an application that was never lodged; an agent who charged $1,200 to a person from Russia for assistance with filling in an application for a visitors visa extension which was less than one page long; a solicitor who told a client that his occupation was on the priority occupations list when it was not, and this gave the client a falsely positive view of his chances of immigrating to Australia; an agent who assisted a student with an employer nomination scheme application from which he was barred because of the prescribed non-citizen ban. There was also the example of an agent, a solicitor who had been struck off, who gave advice to a woman from Korea about lodging a marriage application on the basis of her marriage to an Australian citizen. When the couple eventually paid $2,500 to the agent he then lodged the application several weeks after the woman became illegal. This meant she was bound to fail and would have to apply from overseas after serving a six-month re-entry ban. The situation before the government instituted the legislation in 1992 was appalling. Yes, there is a great deal of room for improvement, all sides in this debate have observed that, but it is my belief that by removing the regulation that has brought down a reduction in the number of complaints we are going to see a return to the bad old days. The basic aim of this legislation has been described by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs( Mr Ruddock) as an interim measure introducing statutory self-regulation for two years in preparation for moves towards full self-regulation after that time. We have the government seeking, by incremental steps, to weaken the system which has been established over the last five years, a system which tries to ensure that consumers of immigration advice can have confidence in the accuracy and timeliness of that advice. However, in the process the government will lose control over the administration of those protections. The move towards self-regulation was initiated by the review of the migration agents registration scheme which was commissioned by the government in 1996. The review focused on the impact of the scheme on consumer protection and the cost of regulation borne by business. The review found that the existing scheme had achieved consumer protection and had not adversely affected competition in the migration advice market, although there was a recognition that the competency standards in the market could be improved. We do not oppose improving the competency standards in the market, we just believe that by taking away all the controls and giving them over to an unrepresentative body we will not be able to engineer an increase in the competency standards, neither will we engineer more protection for consumers, and neither will we improve the reputation of this industry which is mired by those unscrupulous agents. Raising the competency standards across any industry is something that we should always aspire to. Essentially, there should be no difference between the quality of advice provided by any of the three occupational groups in the industry. Therefore, the move to require continuing professional development and education, which the minister advises will be required under the regulations from March 1999, is also a positive move. 10400 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 However, it is unclear how competency standards will be improved by the introduction of moves towards self-regulation per se. In fact, I believe the focus on self-regulation of migration agents in this context distracts attention from the other issues which could improve the advice people receive on migration matters. These other issues include the clarification of legislation to make it easier for clients to understand, which is a subject that I raised in my previous speech on this ""legislation, the continuation of moves by the previous government to reduce the number of legislative changes that may occur in migration law each year, to make it more stable, and, finally, adequately resource the department so that departmental officers have the capacity both in time and information to provide high quality advice to a greater number of clients, thereby reducing the need to have immigration advisers at all. But that is another debate entirely. In the second reading speech on this bill, the minister pointed out other reasons why full self-regulation would not be achievable or desirable in the migration industry. The first reason pointed out was that the consumer group which uses migration agents is quite vulnerable to exploitation by service providers. This is due to a number of factors including language barriers, lack of information about the Australian legal and immigration systems, and the fact that they are unlikely to provide repeat business to the advice provider in the event of their application being successful. That last point is critical because what we do not have here is a free market. What we do not have here is a system where an Australian citizen can just wander between service providers, as they might in the legal profession where the reputations of those providers guides a consumer in the selection of competent advice. Because the consumer does not have any hope of being a repeat consumer, the reputation of the agent is not necessarily as significant as it might be in other industries. Another reason raised by the minister goes to the composition and operation of the migration advice industry itself. The minister described the industry as 'not yet mature.' That assessment raises the question of what it is that will make this industry mature. Nothing has been provided from coalition members and, particularly, the minister as to what it is about this industry that has suddenly become mature or what it is about this legislation that will create a sense of maturity in this industry. The three main occupational groups in the industry are lawyers, agents in the private sector of the industry and voluntary sector agents. According to the minister, there is only limited cooperation between these three groups and the proposed migration agents regulation authority, the Migration Institute of Australia. Indeed, the institute covers only 10 per cent of registered migration agents. It makes a farce of the concept of self-regulation when the proposed body to self-regulate is so unrepresentative. As I said, it is not like the Law Society of New South Wales, where they managed to effect one suspension. They are a closed shop. The coalition is proposing to hand over self-regulation to a mob that only has 10 per cent membership of the industry. In fact, the minister's speech provides no positive reason for travelling down the path of self-regulation at all. The primary concerns he raised in his speech regarding the barriers of the client group to introducing selfregulation, and the composition of the industry, are unlikely to change in the next two years, nor have we been provided with any propositions as to why they would change. Migrants to Australia will always be more likely than Australian-born people to experience language barriers, unless we move to a discriminatory migration program, which we must Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10401 avoid. Labor abolished the discriminatory migration program and it should stay that way. They will always be less familiar with the legal and migration systems. They will only need to go through the migration process once, thereby avoiding the consumer protection incentive of possible repeat business for the service provider, as I have mentioned. Even if we assume that consumer protection factors which were, after all, the primary reason for the enactment of the original legislation are not important to the minister, the other issues of industry barriers to self-regulation have not been addressed. The minister, in June, stated a commitment to the provision of voluntary or not for profit advice. Therefore, it appears that his goal is to eliminate the voluntary sector and thereby stimulate the for profit sector. Similarly, it is unlikely that the minister could seriously consider he was able to reduce the representation of lawyers amongst the industry. No government has been able to significantly reduce the courts' influence on the migration program. That is evidenced by the minister's own admission that he is the most sued minister in the Commonwealth. I do not think that that is something that he would be happy about. Certainly, I would not be happy about it if I were in his position. But this legislation is going to tum up the heat even more: there will be more litigation as a result of this legislation because we will not be knocking out the unscrupulous operators as we otherwise would. Finally, given that the review of the scheme was the first review by the Commonwealth as a party to the competition principles agreement, it is unlikely that the minister will be attempting to be reducing the involvement of the business sector in the provision of immigration advice. Neither is it likely he will be seeking to reduce diversity in the industry overall. If these three groups are to be retained within the industry, it is unclear how giving 10 per cent of the industry in the form of the Migration Institute of Australia control over selfregulation will promote competition between the sectors. That is particularly so when complaints against lawyers were able to be referred to their own professional bodies for disciplinary action. How effective has that been shown to be in the past? It has not been very effective at all. Another concern is that the move to self-regulation may indicate to unscrupulous service providers-which we as parliamentarians deal with quite often, or with the consequences of their shonky advice-that the government is less serious about maintaining control over fraud and misconduct in the immigration program. In the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs annual report of 1995-96, the department showed a reduction in refusals by the registration board and an 8.4 per cent reduction in the number of complaints as a result of a number of factors. The department attributed the increased successful applications for registration to, in its words: . . . an increased awareness of the standards required for registration, better self-selection amongst applicants, and a substantial reduction in the number of cases where the applicant was relying on their practice in the industry prior to the introduction of the scheme, to meet entry standards. That is, the regulations brought about a reduction in the number of either shonky claims or claims that had been made where perhaps they really should not have been. Whilst there are problems in this industry and the legislation should be toughened up, there has been no real reason advanced by coalition members as to why we should take away those things which have stimulated an improvement in this industry. 10402 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 According to the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the drop in the number of complaints cited in that report is an indication that the scheme has improved standards of practice in the industry. This scheme has only had five years to bed itself down. The figures show that it has improved the industry. For the government to chop and change, and go down the path of self-regulation at this stage, is inappropriate and risks the positive efforts made by the department to both control the program and protect the rights of consumers. Both are important. Although this bill is not seeking full self-regulation at this stage, it is explicit that that is the goal. There are other aspects of the legislation which require consideration in more detail. The bill represents a retreat from comprehensive complaints handling and disciplinary processes towards mediation. This is a worry in that a major aim of the scheme under Labor was to address the power imbalance between consumers and advice providers. It is difficult to see how this is going to be achieved through mediation. The shonky operators who make money out of operating shonkily are not going to be mediated out of their practice. If they do not have regulation to pull them up, they are going to keep doing it. Another aspect which is of concern is the removal of the cross-subsidy. Under the current arrangements, volunteer bodies who provide free or not for profit immigration advice already pay significant costs for the privilege of providing immigration advice to consumers who cannot afford to pay for it. The need to ensure that voluntary agents have up-to-date legislation and regulations costs at least $500 a year. We have the government imposing further continuing education costs on volunteer organisations, as well as fees equal to that of profit service providers, who can charge as much as they like to recoup their costs. We have heard quite a lot about the very high charges that are applied. A better prioritisation would be to require continuing education in the sector, but to continue to exempt it from fees. This question of exempting the not for profit sector from fees was addressed by the minister in his speech in June. He said: We expect that those people who are offering free advice through voluntary agencies ought to be the subject of supervisory arrangements. They will still have to be registered. They will not have to pay a fee ... The minister came into this place and said that the not for profit sector in this industry will not have to pay a fee, but the legislation says that they will. I am not quite sure what the minister is on about frankly. He is saying that they will not have to pay a fee, but it is very clear from coalition members today, and from the legislation, that they will have to pay a fee. This is clearly designed to run the not for profit sector out of business. And do you know where all the applications are going to come? They are going to come to us; that is where they are going to come. The people who cannot afford to fork out $10,000 for shonky advice are going to come to us. The question then arises as to whether members of this house are going to be covered by the scope of this scheme, but that is a question for another debate. If the government is really serious about stopping fraud in the migration program, particularly in the marriage categories, then we will need to ensure that the industry is regulated. There is no suggestion that the industry association will be adequately resourced to ensure that the migration agents who specialise in marriage cases are able to be adequately scrutinised. There is nothing in this legislation to provide us with any surety that the institute does have the resources or the capacity-or the commitment, for that matter-to regulate the Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10403 shonky operators. It is my view that the institute will not administer, to any satisfactory standard, self-regulation-nor can it with such a narrow base within this industry. Clearly, self-regulation for this industry, in particular, is inadvisable. The minister has, essentially, made statements to that effect in his second reading speech. The shadow minister certainly concurs that this is not an industry that we can move to self-regulate. We need to keep the rules. We need to keep the protection both for the national interest and for the sake of the consumers and we need to make sure that the not for profit providers are not applied with fees as was undertaken by the minister in this place in his previous speech. the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997and associated legislation to express the concern on behalf of my constituents and on behalf of many of the voluntary community organisations in my heavily multicultural electorate of Grayndler at this government's legislation and, secondly, to express my support to the amendment moved by the shadow minister, the member for Batman( Mr Martin Ferguson), in terms of all three of its clauses to attempt to fix up the government's failure to put forward appropriate legislation before this House. Migration related issues are very important in my electorate. My office does a large amount of assistance for people having problems with immigration issues. My electorate also has a large number of community based organisations doing similar work. I am fortunate to have on my staff Helen Rogers, who deals almost exclusively-three days a week-with immigration issues and with the multicultural community. But this legislation proposes to move the migration industry towards self-regulation. This is a move which has created a great deal of concern from, in particular, the ethnic communities in my electorate. These groups believe-and I support the view-that the migration agents registration scheme, implemented by the former Labor government, has started to successfully improve standards in the industry. The primary objective of the scheme to ensure that people seeking immigration advice could be confident of competent and ethical advice is now being achieved. Improved protection for consumers will be severely compromised by deregulation at this stage. Now is not the time for deregulation. Groups concerned with the welfare of migrant Australians, such as the New South Wales Ethnic Communities Council, have made their opposition to this legislation and to deregulation very clear. One of the primary concerns of the ECC is that it is completely inappropriate for the migration agents registration board, which is, essentially, a regulatory industry watchdog, to be exposed to the principles of competition policy. The ECC said in their submission on the review of the migration agents registration scheme last year that: The ECC of New South Wales believes the application of competition principles abdicates governmental responsibility in migration services to the wider community as a whole. The government has a role to play in ensuring the services provided to the community are provided at a standard that protects people in vulnerable situations. People wishing to migrate to Australia or family members looking to unite through immigration are often in a vulnerable position and may become prey to unscrupulous agents. Migration is a very emotive issue. The ECC of New South Wales believes the government has a duty to protect these people. I certainly endorse those comments because there can be no doubt that people seeking advice on immigration matters are a particularly vulnerable group in the community. Firstly, these people are often dealing with issues that concern their loved ones, their spouses or hopefully future spouses, their brothers and sisters, their parents and their children. Often,",204,Representatives Main Committee
291,Mr Albanese (Grayndler) (11.26 A.m.),"I rise to make a contribution to this debate on10404 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 in these situations, these vulnerable members of the community are susceptible to unscrupulous agents who may well be about lining their own pockets, rather than providing ethical and appropriate services. People seeking assistance often cannot speak or read English, or at least not fluently. This is in an environment where this government has cut back migrant services such as the Adult Migrant English Service. At the same time as there is an attack on the ability of the community to provide ESL services, you have this change which will severely impact on members of the community who do not speak English as their first language. These consumers are also unlikely to be aware of avenues of redress such as consumer complaint tribunals. So the unscrupulous agents would be fully aware that they have a greater chance of getting away with shonky arrangements and exploitation than if they were dealing with people who had been established members of the community, who had a greater level of language skills and greater connections with legal services. They are also dealing with an immigration process that is completely culturally unfamiliar, and they have no concept of what to expect from agents-about what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. The current scheme should, as a minimum position, maintain the current level of regulation. Indeed, I think, there is a case for tightening regulation as opposed to the deregulation which this bill proposes. I am not suggesting that all migration agents are unscrupulous, but there are certainly some who are. The fact is that, as a parliament, we have a responsibility to defend and protect the interests of intending migrants, their families, friends and employers. To make the scheme more accountable, there are two points to make. Firstly, there are a number of migration agents operating who make unrealistic promises to clients. I am sure that all of the representatives in this chamber today would have specific examples of cases where constituents have come to them in that situation. I intend to go through a number of cases later on in this debate. The action of these agents ensures that, although the case is doomed to failure, it will drag on for as long as possible, because the objective is not to assist the people requiring help and advice. The objective is to maximise the profit for the migration agent. The longer the case, the further it can be drawn out and the more money can be demanded from these vulnerable people. In order to achieve this dragging out process, clients are often advised to apply for visas that they have no chance of getting. When the primary decision is finally made, the agents then use the review processes to further extend the case. In the meantime, clients are on bridging visas that allow them to remain in Australia and usually to work. For clients who cannot work, the situation is even more dire. This not only creates unnecessary delays for other, more genuine applicants who would have an entitlement to permanent residency but this practice also gives clients unrealistic hopes about gaining that permanent residency. They can waste years of their lives-and thousands of dollars-when they could be establishing a life for themselves elsewhere. Also, agents can mislead applicants into believing that their case can be processed onshore when they are in fact banned from doing so under section 48 of the act, having previously been refused a permanent visa onshore. In these cases, the applicants may well be eligible for a permanent visa, but only if they apply offshore. When they are not told about this, they can waste both their time and the department's time with an invalid application. You only have to look at the number of Pacific islanders with no grounds for permanent residency who applied for protection visas after the 1987 coup in Fiji. Many of these people Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10405 were advised to do so by migration agents, particularly, I believe, by one I will call M, who is now deregistered. There also needs to be tighter regulations to prosecute people who are posing as registered agents. At present, the department must have proof that the bogus agent has helped someone in Australia. I want to run through some specific examples of disreputable agents that have come through in my electorate. I obviously will not be using the real names of my constituents, as I certainly want to respect their privacy. But I can assure members that this is but a small sample of people who have come to my attention in recent times. The first example I will give is that of agent S. This woman, who is an agent, has caused great problems for two of my constituents-a couple. I will call the male M and the female B. M is a Fijian national who is barred under section 48 of the act from applying for permanent residence onshore. AgentS was handling the case and told the couple that they could apply in Australia. She held on to the file for six to eight months before finally lodging the application. Soon after, the couple were told the application was invalid-not surprisingly. M then went to Fiji to apply there. His wife is 45 years old and desperate to have a child. She is running out of time, and now her husband may be in Fiji for almost a year. If they had known this, he could have gone back 12 months ago, applied in accordance with the proper processes and, hopefully, he would have been back here by now and both of them would have been settled together. The agent involved has been reported to the department and I believe they hope to prosecute, which would indicate that this is not the only case that this particular unscrupulous agent has mishandled. The second example I will give is that of someone who is not a registered agent but passes himself off as one. I will call him T. He is basically completely incompetent and has wasted hours of staff time at the Rockdale office of the department. He has taken money from many of my constituents and has produced no results. One particular case involved a family who were trying to get their brother back to Australia. T took their money and gave them false hopes when the case was hopeless. The boy in question had been criminally deported after serving a sentence for manslaughter. He will never be allowed back into Australia, and that is appropriate, yet still this person has been accepting money from this family. This person posed as a solicitor. In another example, he took $5,000 in advance to handle a preferential family case. He guaranteed the case would be finalised in six months or the money would be refunded. Of course, that was a verbal guarantee. Two years later when we asked for the money back on behalf of the constituents-my staffer assisted the constituents because they did not have the language skills to draft letters themselves-he refused and sent them threatening letters back. Further investigation showed that this person was fraudulently posing as a solicitor. He was not a solicitor, but because he happened to be of the same ethnic group as the people who were applying he was using his position in the community to exploit these people to the tune of $5,000. Another example is someone who is now disbarred and was prosecuted by the DPP with the help of evidence from one of my constituents. We have not got the result, so I am not sure if the case has been successful as yet. He submitted an inadequate application which subsequently failed, due to his incompetence, and for which he charged thousands of dollars. We see these cases, not yearly, not monthly, not weekly, but just about daily. And the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs( Mr Ruddock) knows, because I have had 10406 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 discussions with him personally-and so have my staff with his departmental officers-and he knows that there are literally dozens of these unscrupulous agents out there ripping off people. And, the solution is not to say, 'That is occurring. We will let them run their own show.' The solution is certainly not that, and that is why we have moved the amendment before this House. Another major concern I have with this legislation is the costs associated with registrationand section 2 of the amendment moved by the member for Batman covers this very adequately. I am sure that the will give that particular clause a great deal of thought before deciding to support it. I know that he will also be concerned about community groups that currently offer free advice to migrants. In my area there are a large number of these groups carrying out excellent work with intending migrants and their sponsors. Community groups include the May Murray Neighbourhood Centre, just down the road from my office, which has workers from the Vietnamese, Arabic, Pacific Islander, Greek and Chinese communities. They are all working damned hard for very little money themselves, it must be said, because they are honourable people who care about the community. We have migrant resource centres at Ashfield and Campsie which-when the migrant resource centre at Ashfield is not busy helping the member for Lowe( Mr Zammit) with his internal party activities-does good work. Other groups assisting migrants in my electorate include the Arabic Welfare Association at Bankstown. We have the Australia Lebanese Association, and the Newtown Neighbourhood Centre, which has a number of workers from similar communities to those of the May Murray Centre but also has a Yugoslav community worker who does a great deal of work out there. And we have, of course, the Immigration Advice and Rights Centre. For groups with a number of multilingual workers, you might be talking about having to register half-a-dozen agents. It is vital that these services be retained. Not only do they often offer multilingual services, but they can also be accessed by people who are financially disadvantaged. These communities, as a result of this legislation, will have to choose. They will have to charge fees for that advice, or stop giving it, and this will force many community organisations, already under severe constraints with cutbacks from government funding, out of offering that advice. It will mean that their clients will be either queuing up at our doors-at the offices of members of parliament-or, because they are not aware of those services, they will seek assistance from private agencies. That may well be okay if they go to the right ones, but in a deregulated environment there will be more shonks out there. The community sector, the non-profit sector, must be exempted from the registration charges in accordance with the minister's commentsbut not in accordance with the act-and thereby be excluded from these charges. The nonprofit sector must be excluded. Other issues of concern with these bills include the lack of a complaints resolution procedure. The provision in the bill for a complainant and agent to be referred to a mediator is a poor substitute, and it absolutely ignores the power imbalance between an unscrupulous agent and a vulnerable client who may have a poor grasp of English. The provision of a 10day period only for consumers to lodge objections is an onerous responsibility when you are talking about consumers who are not aware of their rights. If they find out two weeks later, it is too late. This bill represents a conflict of interest where the monitoring body, the regulator, is another association member. If there is one area where self-regulation should not occur, it is here. Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10407 I am also concerned about the bill because it will impact severely on some of the most disadvantaged of my constituents. Now that the migration agents registration scheme is starting to work well, we should not be cutting it back. The government should be building on and strengthening the scheme, but I guess that would not be likely. It would certainly be easy to get the impression that the Howard government is not really fond of migrants, based on its performance to date. The fact is that it is consistent with their cynical exploitation of the Hanson agenda, their preparedness to step back and their failure to show leadership on the issue of race in this country. If you need a model of where deregulation goes to, based on ideological creed rather than common sense, you can look at a number of examples. Take the Victorian Premier's example of deregulation of the health system, where you now have salmonella outbreaks, and ambulances just do not show up after they have been called. That is the sort of world that we live in when we have deregulation in an inappropriate fashion. I conclude my comments today by saying that the amendments moved by the member for Batman are entirely appropriate and deserve the support of this House. This House should be about protecting the most vulnerable people in society, and certainly that is the objective of the amendments. Now is not the time for greater deregulation. the area of the Migration Legislation Amendment (Migration Agents) Bill 1997 on a number of occasions and I will not unnecessarily detain people today. I have also had the opportunity of course to participate in the 1995 inquiry by the joint committee in relation to this field. I would have thought that, whilst the current Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs( Mr Ruddock) at that period was part of an opposition group that essentially did support deregulation, the evidence before the committee was in general extremely poor. From recollection, the only group that was actually critical in any real fashion of the operation of the board was the Springvale Migrant Resource Centre, or some such similar title, who----quite frankly-under examination, were less than convincing. In other words, the main thrust of that inquiry was that there should be a three-year extension and a review, as a compromise between the two parties at that stage. I have to say that there are positive aspects to this legislation. Certainly, in regard to sponsorships and nominations, a loophole that was in the previous legislation is now being tackled. The previous government certainly was aware of that, and I would be very supportive of that change. Similarly, it is quite rational and sensible that travel agents who give very minor advice should not be picked up by the legislation. There are some, as I say, positive aspects to it. However, I really do question the fundamental thrust of deregulating this industry. Many previous speakers have indicated that it is a very unequal balance in this particular field. It is not a situation where there is always actually competition. The reality is that various ethnic communities tend to go to a practitioner who is of their particular ethnic extraction. So, to some extent, there is a degree of monopoly in certain fields. Obviously, as people have indicated previously, people are indeed very vulnerable. They are very desperate: they come from countries that have far worse social and economic conditions than we do, they are prepared to basically do anything to escape that plight and they will grab at any straw to try to stay in Australia.",209,Representatives Main Committee
292,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid) (11.47 A.m.),"I have had the opportunity to speak on10408 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 We are well aware of some aspects of this area. The member for Grayndler ( Mr Albanese) earlier indicated the amount of money that these people charge for very little work, and the degree of incompetence in the field. That is not to deny that there are some very capable people and some very genuine practitioners who, at the same time, have a slant which talks about human rights and about the interests of their clients. But the area has been characterised by a large degree of opportunism and very mercenary attitudes by many. I want to also say that, if you are realistic about this field, you have also got to admit that often the clients themselves are just as guilty and are often part of the conspiracy to basically undermine Australia's migration regulations and laws. We should not always assume that, in each and every case where the agent launches ridiculous or preposterous claims, it is not without the connivance of the client. Often, these people are very willing parties, and that is a fact of life which should not be ignored. The migration agents registration scheme review is less than convincing about the need for change. As other speakers have indicated, this is more driven by ideological requirements, a thrust by the government which simply does not like a government role in the field, and it is a repeat of what we have seen through other sectors of the economy. In fact, one key finding states: · .. in the absence of regulation, the market for migration advice has tended to operate imperfectly with consumers bearing unacceptable cost in terms of exploitation and inappropriate practice by a sector of the industry ... Another finding was: · .. that the Scheme has provided a measure of consumer protection and ... its credibility as a consumer protection mechanism has strengthened somewhat in the time since the Joint Standing Committee on Migration (JSCM) conducted its review of the Scheme. Furthermore, the scheme has not adversely affected competition in the migration advice market. The only real point they made was the need for further training in the field, and I do not dispute that. That has got nothing to do with whether we hand over control of this industry to a body that represents practitioners who themselves-and the minister has often admitted this-are often very questionable. The report itself makes clear they only cover 10 per cent of the industry and, given the nature of the people that both sides of parliament have questioned, it really is a matter of conjecture as to whether we can rely on them to properly police the industry. The review certainly is not very decisive and convincing in regard to the need to hand it over to this group. It states on page 31: There are limits to the incentives that government would be able to provide to encourage agents to join the industry association both in times of restraint in government spending and in the migration law context. It further notes that the association was: · .. unrepresentative of the three distinct occupational groupings in the migration advice industry. It will become more difficult to establish consistent professional standards and to coordinate activities such as entry level training. It notes on page 33: At this stage, the industry has a disparate nature and the industry association has only limited coverage and as a result, the body that takes on the role of industry regulator may face legal and other challenges. Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITIEE 10409 The minister is postponing the final drift towards them controlling the industry but I do not think a very strong case has been made out so that they should be the paramount force in this industry. The minister might have been pushed in this direction by others and there might be a very tortuous process of getting there, but the fundamental thrust is to basically give management of the industry over to this group, which his own review states is not very representative, and I do not see any major evidence that it is going to become any more representative. Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER (HoD. J.A. Crosio)-I would ask both the minister and the member for Reid to direct their questions through the chair. I am here. The member for Reid and the minister will direct their comments through the chair. inquiry. It was chaired by Mr Ian Spicer, a person who has a predilection for this kind of concept. He has a long-term record of support for deregulation, believing that it is essentially the ant's pants regardless of the nature of a particular industry or the problems of those who are in it. as a member of it, would be quite aware that that is not the major thrust of that inquiry at all. The essential thrust was for a continued government presence in the field. I mentioned some admirable aspects of the legislation earlier. I think the need for training in the voluntary sector is also commendable. One cannot just take the view that these people are there for the community benefit and therefore we can allow them to be untrained and unskilled. I very much commend the government for going in that direction. However, the idea of forcing voluntary groups to pay is questionable. Occasionally, you might get people who put their ethnic loyalty before adherence to our laws, and there are questions about some of the advice given, but to ask these groups to pay-groups that are there mainly for community purposes, mainly to help people in dire circumstances, mainly to help people who do not have knowledge, mainly to help people who do not have the language-is undermining their operations. Asking them to pay is not a move in the right direction. The situation is that the earlier report which the minister cited-that is, the joint migration committee report-was not quite as fulsome in the points that it makes. In giving its account of the industry in paragraph 3.53 on page 53 of the report, the committee noted: A common theme in submissions was that regulation of the migration advice industry is necessary to ensure consumer protection and the maintenance of appropriate standards within the industry. IARC, for example commented: ... a regulatory scheme is necessary to support the reputable people working in this area as well as to eradicate the unscrupulous and incompetent operators. Just after that, at paragraph 3.54, it noted: In some submissions, it was argued that regulation of migration advisers is required because of the vulnerability of persons seeking immigration advice.",213,Representatives Main Committee

Further, at paragraph 3.82, page 61, the committee noted: Statistics obtained by the Committee support a finding that the achievements of the Scheme relevant to its objectives have been chequered. Quite frankly, the review that the minister has commissioned makes a similar point about the performance of the current system. The paragraph continues: On the positive side, around 600 persons either have been denied the right to practise as migration agents or have decided to withdraw from seeking entry to the industry. In addition, the avenues for developing expertise in migration law have increased noticeably, with various courses and seminars now being conducted at a tertiary level and within the industry itself. As I say, this is not really driven by an analysis of the industry. It is not driven by a conclusion as to what is best for the industry; it is driven because the government essentially believes that competition policy should rule. It does not analyse the particular nature of the industry. It does not have any understanding of the special problems faced by these people. It essentially opens the floodgates for exploitation. It turns over control to an unrepresentative group that includes these same people that both sides of the House are often critical of, and it really is a very questionable direction. It is also of a concern to me personally-and other speakers have raised this matter-that after Cunliffe, and the victory of the department with regard to regulation of lawyers, I do not have the confidence that the minister seems to have in the ability of the Law Society, and other bodies, to police those people in this field. Quite frankly, I have not seen in the media or heard on the public record much evidence that these bodies are all that efficient in policing their own members. Obviously, there is a degree of self-interest in the image of the industry in making sure that, often, these complaints are minimised. I believe that the scheme has worked. There are concerns that perhaps the onus is such that people often do not bring forward cases. I could probably be accused of it myself: I see activities by migration agents that probably should lead me to lay complaints but I guess there is a concern that, with the requirements of evidence, et cetera, it will not accomplish very much. One of the failings in the industry is that we have not been proactive enough in making sure that people feel that they can be successful in pursuing the more dubious practitioners. ,But, on balance, we have a situation here where there is a need for the government to have an overview of the industry. I an not only concerned-as I said earlier-with the nature of the practitioners but I also believe that it is very important for this country, and for the integrity of the system, that we are proactive to the fact of life out there that many of the clients are often just as questionable in the way in which they launch claims. The government should be very proactive in making sure that we give a signal to the industry that launching claims to buy time, and launching claims that manipulate Australia's refugee and humanitarian aspects, are not to be condoned. As I said earlier, I commend these amendments. I do not think the minister or his review or the review by the previous joint migration committee have made any case whatsoever for turning over control of this industry to an unrepresentative body in a field that both sides of politics knew would require, initially, strong intervention to police it. No case has been made out. It is essentially driven by an ideological position and does not analyse what has happened under this current scheme or the solution to the problems that are there.

Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (12.01 p.m.)-It is the case, as all members of parliament know, that youth suicide is one of the most intractable social problems facing our community today. It is however also true that it is not a new problem. All the statistics that were presented at the seminar that we had suggest that the rates of attempted and completed suicide among young people are increasing. But it is still very difficult to measure, given that many suicides used to be reported as accidents because of the stigma that previously applied to suicide. Indeed, experts at the committee's seminar believed that the current statistics also underestimate the real extent of the problem. Suicide affects young people from all socioeconomic and ethnic backgrounds in our country, although we do know that certain groups are at greater risk. Completed suicides among young men are four times higher than for young women. Some have attributed this to a greater confusion among young men about their role and their failure to adjust to women's greater equality. In fact, the explanation seems to be much more straightforward. Sadly, it is the case that many young men complete their suicide attempts because they use immediately lethal weapons, especially guns. More young women use drugs and poisons from which there is a greater chance of resuscitation. Were accurate statistics available on suicide attempts, rather than completed suicides, they would be more likely to show a smaller variation between the sexes. From my point of view, to focus on the gender differences sometimes clouds the issues. Experts at the seminar identified a number of groups at particular risk. They included young people in rural and remote areas, young Aboriginal people, young people confused about their sexual identity, those suffering from mental illness-particularly depression-and those 10412 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 suffering the effects of family breakdown. It is very true, as all who have contributed to this debate have said, that youth suicide is far too important an issue for political point scoring, because all parties are concerned about the problem and are committed to tackling it. Both the current and the previous government have allocated resources to initiatives designed to reduce its incidence. Some other initiatives of this government will also, I believe, contribute to a reduction in the incidence of completed youth suicides. The most important of these has been the gun buyback scheme which, by reducing the number of firearms in the community, will reduce accessibility to guns, among some young men at least. For this, we can be very pleased. Given that this is the preferred and the most lethal method of suicide among young men, it is to be hoped that it will result in the reduction in the number of completed suicides for this group. There are other measures particularly affecting young people in rural and remote communities that do however remain of some concern. Many of these communities are suffering significant hardships. These are not just from recent changes. I am not trying to apportion any blame but it is the case that many communities in rural areas are facing significant hardship from the closure of services. At a time when young people are calling out for help from these services, We really need to make sure that they are provided. We do know that young Aboriginal people are at particular risk of suicide and many of the programs that are designed to help these young Aboriginal people in their communities really need our support. We must, of course, through both the Wik debate and our response to the stolen children report, acknowledge the damage that has been done to Aboriginal people by all past government policies and begin the process of reconciliation. Without that, the most important thing, it is very hard to imagine how we might begin the very long process of overcoming what is the serious despair among young Aboriginal people, which too often manifests itself in deliberately dangerous behaviour and sometimes suicide. We also learned at the seminar about the contribution of anxiety and confusion about sexual identity and sexual orientation in triggering suicide among young people. I understand that there has recently been a poster and a booklet prepared by the Western Australian AIDS Council aimed at sexually confused young people contemplating suicide. It is very important that we face up to the problems that young people have in confronting their sexual identity and their sexual orientation and that we actually take it upon ourselves to do some of the things that might be seen to be unusual that encourage people to talk to others about these matters of confusion and concern. We do owe it to our young people to support any measure which might reduce the incidence of youth suicide in this country. Often that will mean that we have to be more innovative in our approaches, and that might sometimes challenge our particular views of the world-those of people of our generation, I mean. We need to support initiatives which have been shown to work and to look at other options in cases where they have failed. The committee seminar did provide some very useful insights into past successes and also some directions for the future, for example the need to provide a more user-friendly approach to counselling and mental health services for young people themselves and for those to whom they are likely to tum for support. Seminar participants also pointed to the need for all hospitals-and I think this was a very important point that was made-to institute follow-up care to young people who have been discharged following a suicide attempt and to the need to support families caring for a child Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10413 at risk. There is a need to realise that the families where we have children who are attempting suicide are also going through a very difficult time and they are in great need of support. We are gradually learning more about youth suicide and how to deal with it, and the seminar that was conducted by the committee has contributed to that process. I certainly commend the report on the seminar to all members of the House and support its recommendations. Certainly, from our side of the parliament, we will be seeking to work very cooperatively with other members of parliament to ensure that the incidence of suicide amongst our young people is reduced. Thank you. on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report called Aspects of youth suicide. I have waited a number of weeks for the opportunity to speak on this report. Youth suicide, in fact suicide of all ages, is a national tragedy. As reported in paragraph 17 of the report, in 1995 there were 350 young male suicides and 84. young female suicides. Members of the committee were shocked to hear that children as young as 12 had attempted suicide. On the central coast of New South Wales, which includes my electorate of Robertson, the suicide rate for young people is twice the national average. It is so easy to talk about the facts and figures and the statistics, but each and every single one of these young people causes immense tragedy and trauma-not only to themselves but to their friends and to their family and to the community in general. Even before I was elected to the Australian parliament, I met with Mr Eric Trezise, a central coast resident who is at the forefront of the fight against youth suicide, and suicide in general. Mr Trezise had been working hand-in-hand with the central coast coroner, Mr Bryan Wilson, and they convened the first central coast suicide summit in early 1996. This, to my knowledge, was the first community initiated summit on this issue. Some years ago, Mr Wilson, the coroner, recognised the fact that the central coast was having a high proportion of deaths by suicide. He was concerned that there were no identifiable records kept for each region on suicide and youth suicide. It was Mr Wilson who first started keeping records on suicide deaths. That is one of the flaws, and I am distressed to hear other members say, 'We have tried to identify what the youth suicide problem is in our particular area.' In fact, there are no statistics in their areas, broken down by region or electorate, to help them identify the problem or how great it is in a specific area. Mr Wilson is possibly the first coroner in Australia to recognise that fact and to have records going back a number of years to help with this problem. The central coast community recognised even then that we were in the grip of a major epidemic and, as a community, we had to act to do something about it. The central coast suicide summit was attended by local politicians from all sides of politics and by representatives from almost all community groups on the central coast. Approximately 300 people attended that meeting. The summit made a number of recommendations, which I had the pleasure of forwarding to the then Minister for Family Services, the member for Pearce( Mrs Moylan). As a result of this report and submissions made by many other members throughout Australia, members of the committee identified Australia's high rate of youth suicide as a problem that needed to be highlighted in the parliament and brought into focus by this committee.",215,Representatives Main Commitiee
298,Mr Lloyd (Robertson) (12.09 P.m.),"I am pleased today to have the opportunity to speak10414 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 The aspects of youth suicide seminar was convened on 28 February 1997, in order to gather information such as that collected at the central coast suicide summit to give committee members a comprehensive overview of the issues involved. The seminar also provided an invaluable opportunity for peak health and community groups, local organisations, youth workers, academics and professionals to exchange information about the suicide prevention programs throughout Australia. Among the invited guests was Mr Eric Trezise. At that seminar, I had the opportunity of introducing Mr Trezise to the Prime Minister( Mr Howard). Mr Trezise had the opportunity to put his views and his concerns about the situation on the central coast directly to the Prime Minister. I would also like to put on the record that I was a participant at the seminar and found it very valuable and informative. Unfortunately, my name· was omitted from the report. The Central Coast community is not standing still on this issue. We are not waiting for governments to take the lead. As a community, we are taking the lead. Only recently, I attended the launch and had the opportunity of addressing the audience at the launch of the Central Coast Suicide Safety Network. The Central Coast Suicide Safety Network was launched by the Premier of New South Wales, the Hon. Bob Carr, who has agreed to become the patron of the network. The launch was attended by over 300 concerned community leaders, as yet another step in the fight against youth suicide and suicide in general on the central coast. The aims of the Suicide Safety Network are: to raise awareness of the tragic loss of life to suicide in the central coast region of Australia, with emphasis on all age groups; to make the public and the governments-local, state and federal-aware of the needs for a collaborative and concerted attack on this problem; to draw attention to the factors which play a role in attempted suicide and to foster appropriate prevention and support initiatives; to highlight the suffering of those bereaved by suicide and those distressed by attempted suicide, and to encourage self-help groups; to install a direct access telephone service responding to suicide crisis calls; to establish a psychological and sociological autopsy suicide case review panel; to promote trial and pilot programs aimed at reducing the incidence of suicide and attempted suicide amongst all age groups; and to solicit funding and resources to enable these programs to become reality. You can see that the aims of this network are very comprehensive. One of the major contributing factors identified in the report Aspects of youth suicide is isolation and loneliness. In paragraph 41 of the report, the committee was told that any kind of youth support service must be targeted appropriately, otherwise young people will not access the service. Professional centres requiring appointments during school or work hours, or where a payment is required, will not meet the needs of many young people. Telephone lines, such as Lifeline, are also a valuable resource as they can provide 24-hour assistance and provide immediate counselling and contact to those young people at a time when they are most vulnerable to suicide. I am aware that under the Here for Life program the government has allocated over $1 million for improving communication networks among suicide prevention workers and coordinating information dissemination. In the 1996-97 budget, under the national youth suicide strategy, the government has provided over $19 million over three years to be spent in this area, including $6 million to Lifeline and Kids Helpline for the telephone counselling services. This is an admirable initiative and is to be commended. Current funding for youth suicide prevention amounts to $30 miIIion, and the committee recognised that while this amount is Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10415 significant much more still needs to be done. This includes research, coordination, education and counselling services. In paragraph 55 the committee recognised that consideration needed to be given to the possible reallocation of some of the existing funds. We on the Central Coast of New South Wales have been advocating for some time the establishment of a specific suicide prevention advisory phone counselling service for the Central Coast. It has been identified by a number of those who have been affected by this tragedy that the most effective way that the Central Coast community can help stop this tragic waste of human life is to have this specific phone counselling and assistance service. We have the premises, we have the trained staff, we have the volunteers on the Central Coast who can provide this service. What we do need is government funds to fund the service. I would appeal to the Minister for Family Services, Warwick Smith, and the Minister for Health and Family Services, Dr Wooldridge, to consider looking at our submission from the Central Coast for the provision of this telephone counselling service. I have already had discussions with Dr Wooldridge and, of course, like every Australian, he is concerned about the suicide problem that we have in Australia, not just the youth suicide problem. Whilst youth suicide is receiving a great deal of coverage, and it is a high profile concern to everybody, there is a major problem-and we have identified this on the Central Coastwith men aged between 25 and 45 who are not coping with the stresses of life. They are not coping with the responsibilities, as they see it, of raising families, of mortgages or losing jobs. They are what we call on the Central Coast the hidden tragedy of suicide. They are the people that cost our community far more than anyone else. The loss of the life of a person in the prime of their life, when they have children or family responsibilities and work, and the loss and tragedy for the community that are caused by someone in that age bracket taking their life are immense. It is something that we on the Central Coast wish to highlight-not only the youth suicide program. I know that Dr Wooldridge is looking at what we are saying and at the submissions that we are putting up. Very shortly I will be bringing a committee from the Central Coast, including our local coroner, Bryan Wilson, and Mr Trezise and a number of other leading people in the field, to meet Dr Wooldridge to put f0rward our ideas and our views on tackling this problem again. I have waited a number of weeks to be able to make my comments on this report. It is an excellent report. I know that the government has acted on some of the recommendations and certainly will be acting on more of them. I commend the report to the House. Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs report on the seminar into aspects of youth suicide, I would firstly add my words of commendation on the deductions of the report. It is a useful document and the recommendations are of value. I would like also to express a personal appreciation to those people who took part in it. The seminar presenters were diverse and well informed, and they brought forward information, ideas and experiences which were quite valuable. I think that, for those who were not aware of this problem, the day was a useful exercise in encapsulating some of the issues. I say 'some' of the issues because there is a very real danger that we start to treat suicide as a kind of disease that is preventable-that we actually look at some ways of inoculating people or perhaps immunising them against suicide. There is a real danger that we see it as being something in isolation. In that context, I want to make some comments about some of",219,Representatives Main Committee
299,Mr Allan Morris (Newcastle) (12.20 P.m.),"In speaking to the House of10416 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 the issues that are involved in youth suicide, and in suicide in general, so we are dealing with the person in a holistic way. At the seminar and in other forums it has become clear that suicide seems to be a person's statement that their life has no further meaning; there is no further point. For one reason or another, an individual decides that there is no longer a meaningful place for them here on this earth, amongst the people that they have normally been amongst. How those decisions are made and in what context varies enormously, and there is a very great danger that, because we use the same word, we tend to group them as having similar reasons and similar backgrounds. The fact is that they do not. If we look at, for example, sexuality amongst young males, particularly in remote and rural areas, we find that, as we discovered in our parliamentary inquiry into aspects of youth homelessness and from talking to some people in the gay and lesbian community, there is an enormous pressure there, particularly on young men who perhaps conclude that they may have a sexual preference which is not normal in their context and their environment and are therefore alienated. Many of those young men end up in cities and end up suiciding, one way or another. We have to understand that, when a society goes through the kind of changes that we are going through in terms of family breakdowns, there may well be casualties. And the casualties may well be young people who no longer have either a place in the world or a family. In our report on youth homelessness tabled in the previous parliament, we pointed out that some 60 per cent of young people on youth homeless allowance came from single or blended families. In other words, almost two out of three people who were claiming that allowance were from a family that had broken down. . At the same time, we have been watching with great alarm the massive increase in abuse of young people. One can argue about whether we are getting more reporting and whether or not the actual incidence of abuse has changed a lot, because in past years child abuse was not reported in the same way and was not investigated. But the fact is that, since it has been reported and since it has been mandatory, the numbers are increasing every year in a way that is truly alarming. If there is an epidemic in our society, the epidemic is more likely to be child abuse than suicide. Looking at those young people who do suicide and those young people who are homeless, one finds that the incidence of abuse appears to be very high. The fact that we have something like 30,000 confirmed cases of abuse of our young people per year should be a cause of enormous distress to us-as should be the fact that so many people who are committing abuse are not charged or in any way penalised for it. It is not simply paedophilia, currently in the public eye, but all abuse that is much worse. The effect of it in demeaning, demoralising and, in fact, eventually destroying so many young Australians must not be underestimated. Suicide is not necessarily a self-generated conclusion. In so many cases it is generated by what is done to one, and the effect of the loss of esteem, confidence and sense of self that is brought about by acts of abuse on young people is, to my mind, a vast and unrecognised dark· side of our society. As I said, every year the figures come out and they increase year after year. I suppose that those of us who watch that and are concerned about that would recognise the difficulty of definition. We recognise all those complications, but the facts are inescapable: there is a major problem in our society with young people being treated as objects that are able to be abused. Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10417 In .the report that we dealt with in 1995, after a very extensive range of inquiries around the country and submissions and a whole range of discussion.s, I was disturbed-and I still am disturbed-that so many parliamentarians were in fact blaming young people. The difficulty of determining homelessness and abuse is profound, but the risks are so great that most people working in the field tend to take the view that you give the first credibility to the young people themselves. All the evidence would indicate that in the vast majority of cases that is correct. I was therefore somewhat dismayed back in 1995 when members of the now government actually questioned that and actually made the claim in their minority report that they had reservations about the claims for homelessness. In fact they had the idea, which is still current, that our young people fabricate claims for the homelessness allowance. The fact that we are getting 30,000 cases of abuse per year should be grounds enough for every one of us to overcompensate and to be, if you like, totally alert to it. But the fact is that two current ministers and a number of other present government members were, in the previous parliament, saying two things. They were saying, firstly, that they had reservations about the bona fides of claimants; and their second point was, effectively, compulsory mediation. In other words, we should make the young person and the parent, who may well be a step-parent, engage in a process of mediation which would in fact expose the young person to having to confront the person that they were accusing or the person that in many cases was abusing. Of course, what that means is very simple: young people do not report. The whole message there was that the parent was always right. That is still the message. They have translated from opposition into government and have kept the message running, and I think that should be of concern. So, for those people in the government now who are concerned about suicide, I would put it to you that it does not come about by accident; it does not happen as a one-off thing. In so many cases, it is an end result of something else. Another ingredient involved is the question of mental health-and, again, during that inquiry we were alarmed at the evidence brought forward of the incidence of mental health problems amongst our young. The fact is that about 50 per cent of all severe psychiatric illnesses are diagnosed by the age of 19 and the median age for half of our mental disorders is 16; yet, when you look at the expenditure on mental health, you will find that the vast bulk of itsomething like 93 per cent of it-is on adults. In other words, we have a serious problem with the numbers of young people with mental health problems who are not being serviced, who are not getting the attention and support they need. Closely associated-;and, in many cases, linked-with that are the problems of drug and alcohol abuse. . WhatI am trying to suggest is that suicide, particularly youth suicide, is often a matter of their total environment-of their background, of family disruption, of abuse, and eventually the question of identity, esteem and optimism. Abuse and family breakdowns often destroy the identity. Equally, they destroy the esteem. Optimism is another factor in the sense that other matters impact on that. Confidence in one's capacity to play a meaningful role, confidence in one's capacity to have a meaningful relationship, confidence to be a successful parent themselves, in so many young people is lacking. That comes back to the question of economics. Our young people, together with the majority of our older people, see governments and parliamentarians as being preoccupied with economics and not the community. The famous Thatcher statement 'There are no communities, just individuals' echoes very strongly in this situation. If you are the individual that she spoke of and you have been a victim of abuse or of family breakdown, if you are not that clever and not that well educated, 10418 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 then do you exist? The idea that you exist by yourself has been one of the most damaging and destructive elements in our sociological development this century. The fact is that youth suicide is in proportions which should alarm us. However, as I said at the start, we should not see it as a disease in isolation that we cannot prevent. We really must see it as part of something else. Unless we get to the real symptoms and treat them and address them, all the rest is rhetoric and posturing . .I encourage those in the government who have not read the report on youth homelessness to read it because what we uncovered in that report, as did Brian Burdekin, was a sickness in our society of serious proportions. The victims of that sickness were not the adults; they were the young. In many cases those young people survived, and some heroically. I met a young woman who was 14Yz and she had been a prostitute for a year, since she was 13lh. I met another young woman who was a graduate of a university. She had left school at 14 and been a prostitute at 14, but she had come through all that and got educated and gained a degree. There were enormously heroic stories. I also met some people who I do not think are alive any more. I met a young man in a squat who is now dead, who suicided. When one looks at that evidence there is not much point in coming to the end of the thing and saying, 'How can we prevent youth suicide?' because the forces have been laid down in many cases five, 10 or 15 years before, and no-one gave a damn. Maybe they had told somebody but no-one cared, or they were not believed. There were so many cases where young people were sent back to abusive households. There were so many cases where mothers had to choose between their daughters and their then husband or partner. There were so many cases where no-one seemed to give a damn, and the end result is we all get worried about youth suicide. If we do not start worrying a lot sooner and believing these people a lot earlier and understanding them a lot better, we will see a lot more suicides, not fewer suicides. No amount of strategies in documenting, in isolating, in having help lines or anything else, will assistbecause they are all treating the symptoms when we have to treat the cause. We have to get back to understanding what is happening to our young people at an earlier stage, not when they are teenagers. In many cases the causes arise when they are four or five or six or eight years of age. The committee's report is of value to the parliament and the community. It is of even more value when it is linked with its previous report on youth homelessness. I would urge all parliamentarians to look much more closely at not just the issue of suicide but youth trauma, youth development and the family frameworks in which they grow up. report entitled Aspects of youth suicide. I intend to address the extraordinarily high representation that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians make in the national statistics. I do this not to downplay the human tragedy of non-ATSI suicide but to highlight the difference between the ATSI and non-ATSI experience of youth suicide, which should give some indication of how our best efforts might be better directed in combating suicide in an· approach which will recognise the uniqueness of ATSI suicide and self-harm. An indictment of the seriousness of youth suicide is evident in one of the ATSI communities in my electorate which, sadly, currently holds the unfortunate reputation of having the largest number of youth suicides in the country and one of the largest in the world. Standing almost as a monument, and an ongoing reminder to the tragedy of the children in this community,",221,Representatives Main Committee
300,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt) (12.35 P.m.),"I am speaking on this occasion about the summaryThursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10419 is a tree known locally as the hanging tree which, to date, has provided a means to suicide for 20 young people in that community-a frightening statistic by anybody's reckoning. The summary report Aspects of youth suicide points to factors such as age, family separation history, geographic isolation, unemployment, and drug and alcohol use. If these are important factors in increases in suicide amongst Australians, then it would seem that they would be more relevant to ATSI Australians, and I shall address these individually. Suicide rates amongst white Australians remain fairly constant at around 15 to 20 cases per 100,000 Australians from the age of 16 to 75-plus. ATSI suicide, on the other hand, is a problem that is particularly a youth related one. Suicide rates amongst black Australians can be measured in significant numbers from an earlier age of 13. The number rises dramatically to nearly double that of non-ATSI suicide by early adulthood. By mid-adulthood, the rate drops by two-thirds and, surprisingly, further reduces to insignificant numbers by the age of 55. The trauma of divorce or parental separation is a factor in many youth suicides. I guess the official state sanction of family separation would surely have had a greatly increased result, one would imagine. The Bringing them home report demonstrated the dramatic effects that this had on the lives of those that the family separation policy touched. The ratio of urban to non-urban ATSI Australians is roughly 70 to 30 whereas the reverse is the case for non-ATSI Australians. Those in remote and rural areas do notonly suffer from a lack of the many crisis support systems available for those in urban areas but they also suffer, as all members of regional electorates know well, worse standards in terms of infrastructure and opportunity. ATSI unemployment stands at four times the national average, at about 40 per cent. According to leading experts on ATSI suicide in Australia and to the author of Aboriginal health and history, Professor Ernest Hunter, drug use and alcoholism appear to be the most significant immediate causes of suicide. Professor Hunter heads an excellent team of academics with social and preventative medicine based in Cairns in my electorate. The work of this unit is well regarded nationally through its hands-on approach with the larger ATSI population centres improving ATSI health outcomes. Professor Hunter claimed a significant victory recently for Far North Queensland to lead the way in research and training to solve chronic problems facing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, when a $1.5 million funding allocation to establish a centre of excellence in ATSI health was awarded to a joint submission of the University of Queensland and the Queensland University of Technology, which will conduct much of its work through the social and preventative medicine units in Cairns. According to Professor Hunter, increased vulnerability to suicide was first experienced by young Aboriginal males passing into and through adolescence in the late 1980s. As suicide is an end point-as are also increasing rates of alcohol abuse, self-mutilation, child abuse and domestic violence-much can be learnt by exploring the background factors rather than seeking a cause in the immediate circumstances. We should look at the situation for Aboriginal Australians reaching maturity in the 1980s, which was shaped by the experience of those young adults who were having children through the 1970s. This is a period of tumultuous change, with significant consequences for social roles within Aboriginal Australia. A generation who were young adults at the time of the Commonwealth referendum experienced entry into a cash economy, with unemployment and welfare dependence and increasing access to alcohol, following the legislation of its sale to Aboriginal 10420 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 Australians. Circumstances of continuing social disadvantage and binge drinking provided a context in which the impulsive, aggressive expression of tension resulted in escalating interpersonal violence. This proposition of increasing violence is supported by statistics showing an increase in suicide by violent means. Research by Harrison and Moller conducted in 1994 showed that 93 per cent of Aboriginal suicides resulted from hanging or firearms, compared with 43 per cent of non-Aboriginal deaths, a comparison not shown in the Aspects of youth suicide summary report. The Australian Institute of Suicide Res-arch and Prevention report to the Commonwealth last year showed that those means are also the most lethal. Given the availability of means, with guns being readily available in remote areas and rural settings-and hanging being a matter of opportunity rather than means-and the connection with alcohol, the impulsivity is particularly important. Research conducted by Professor Hunter and others for the National Drug and Alcohol Research Centre in Sydney revealed that impulses to. self harm and suicide were widely experienced by ATSIC.informants, with a moderate association to drinking status. However, acting on those impulses was strongly associated with alcohol, and it was the quantity consumed per drinking occasion rather than the frequency of consumption that predicted past self-harmful or suicidal acts. Rather than being causal in an absolute sense, alcohol appears . to enable the acting out of simmering impulses that may be otherwise better coped with. Sadly, of a more sinister nature, an area of concern is the s,exual abuse of children, a contributing factor no doubt to youth suicide. Unfortunately, this is very prolific in some ATSI communities. Reports that I have received in my office would certainly appear to confirm this. A recorded high incidence of sexually transmitted diseases, particularly in very young children, in some of the communities undoubtedly confirms this factor. I have had evidence received in my office of children as young as six and seven with very serious advanced forms of sexual disease. Clearly, this is a major factor with regard to the well-being of that child. I feel that this is an area that really needs to be explored a lot more and to be dealt with very firmly and harshly if we have any way of being able to give those kids any sort of future. Unfortunately, it is because it is of a very sensitive nature that the issue tends to be swept under the carpet. Unless it is addressed in a more open forum, along with the other contributing factors like substance abuse and unemployment, the issue of youth suicide will never ever be resolved. Thirty years after the Commonwealth referendum, the tensions experienced by young adult Aborigines in relation to the wider society are probably greater than those experienced by their parents at a similar age. We are now at an historic point with the ability to accept these facts and seriously address them. The acceptance by the government of this report gives the opportunity for experts in the field to have a direct line of communication with the highest levels of the decision-making process. With this prospect, I certainly commend the report to the House with two qualifications. Firstly, I would be greatly concerned should the priority 3 recommendation that an immediate review of current funding and redirection of some funds to a more appropriate and better targeted program lead to a reduction of the level of funding for ATSI suicide prevention, which currently stands at $1.058 million out of a $32 million budget. Secondly, I support the recommendation of the report that a national advisory council be established to provide strategic advice to the minister and government on youth suicide Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10421 prevention and related matters. But I would recommend that this council must contain an expert on ATSI suicide, given the uniqueness of the ATSI situation. Youth suicide is certainly a blight on our society-a cancer, if you like-and it is clear that it crosses all cultural boundaries. Our youth are our future and it is essential that we as a society do all in our power to address this tragedy. I will, of course, continue to fully support all efforts and initiatives in this regard. Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (12.47 p.m.)-I rise today to also address the topic which has become so significant. There are very few communities that have not come to grips with the devastation of youth suicide. The incidence of suicide has now reached most unacceptable levels, particularly in regional areas and particularly with respect to males. However, the increase in the rate of suicide in cities should not be minimised. According to a recent publication from the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention, there are upwards of 2,500 deaths recorded as suicide each year. Queensland and Tasmania have the highest incidences of suicides. A report recently released by the Queensland government indeed confirms this very sad fact. However, even more disturbing is that for every successful suicide there are up to 300 female and 50 male unsuccessful attempts. In my own electorate of Petrie, as indeed in Australia, there are families who have known the pain and suffering of having someone close to them commit suicide. Recently, I hosted a breakfast in Margate, which Professor Baume and the member for Fisher( Mr Slipper) convened. Over 100 people attended this breakfast. It was particularly sad at the end of the breakfast when I was speaking to a number of people who had been touched by this particular problem. A mother in tears approached me. She was absolutely devastated by the death of her son 12 months previously. She was still in a period of denial and did not understand why he had taken his life. But she felt reassured by coming along to the breakfast and she thanked me enormously for organising the breakfast. It gave her great comfort and reassurance that there was nothing that she could have done and no way that she could have predicted that he would take his life. I was able to then put her in touch with a support group of parents who are able to meet on a regular basis and discuss the issues of youth suicide. The most tragic thing is that the people who are left behind are the ones that suffer for many years afterwards not knowing if there was something that they somehow could have done to prevent their young ones taking their lives. It is the not knowing that haunts them for the rest of their lives. It is important to emphasise that this touches everyone from family to friends. Quite often, the friends that are left in their wake and their family are the ones that really do need the help the most. But it is an issue that does affect the lives of families, not only in the Redcliffe areas I have mentioned, in Deception Bay, but throughout Australia. We cannot ignore it as a community and we cannot really take it very lightly. We have a responsibility as a community not to trivialise this or ignore it, because it has very great social ramifications. It is an issue that we see quite a lot. We see it in the media, in programs like 60 Minutes, and in publications. We even have the misfortune now to see it on the Internet. On one occasion, I heard Professor Baume speak of the role of the Internet and what young people use it for these days. They use it as a forum to communicate with each other on suitable and appropriate measures of suicide and they actually give each other tips on the most effective ways to commit suicide. It is disturbing to see that. There are thousands of hit sites on the 10422 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 Internet that deal with this. It is quite a blight on our society that the Internet is being used by young people to communicate these things. As with any tragic death, the ramifications of suicide are very widespread but, unlike other tragic deaths, suicide brings with it great sadness, disbelief and guilt. As I mentioned, family and friends are the ones who find it very hard to understand. Like ripples in a pond, these deaths, by their very nature, cannot fail to affect everyone in the community. One thing I have noticed is that, if there are cases of suicide in families, it tends to be an intergenerational thing. There are certainly issues that never get resolved in the first place. It gets buried away under the carpet or in the cupboard. People do not speak about it, and intergenerational suicide is a very common thing. We should really look at it very closely. We should be tireless in our efforts to find solutions because there is such despair and hopelessness among our young people. The member for Newcastle ( Mr Allan Morris) highlighted some terrible cases that he has come across. He touched me deeply when he spoke about the young women who had been to see him and the terrible cases of suicide. But young people can overcome some of these things. He spoke of some very positive instances where young women were prostitutes and were contemplating suicide but they were able to rebuild their lives and attend university and look forward to the future. He was right that we need to emphasise the youth aspects of it-the trauma and youth development-and I think that is very important to acknowledge. I have spoken on this topic on many occasions and today I would like to acknowledge the efforts of the House, particularly the previous chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs in producing the report Aspects of youth suicide. The report followed a very successful seminar that was held here earlier this year. I was not a member of the committee but I did gain quite a lot from attending on that particular day. The speakers were top rate and, as I mentioned, I have since had contact with one of the speakers, Associate Professor Pierre Baume. He has made a number of contributions in this area. It is an area that he has studied for a number of years. His extensive research has tended to emphasise the sociological factors that contribute to youth suicide. He believes that these can be divided into categories: the global aspects and the personal aspects. He mentioned a number of things, and a number of speakers have highlighted them-for instance, the high divorce rate. One cannot underestimate the effect of divorce. It is a devastating thing. What is more devastating, when people do split up, is that children sometimes feel that they are the direct cause of it. It is never talked through with young children, and it is not explained that they are not really the central issue in a divorce. Other areas were high youth and high female unemployment. Alcohol consumption, as the member for Leichhardt ( Mr Entsch) mentioned, is clearly a big problem. A number of speakers have raised the issue of unwanted pregnancies and the devastation this can have on people's lives not just in the immediate present but also well into the future. There is a trend these days not to attend church and not to be community or religion focused. One cannot underestimate the importance of those factors-when people have no-one to talk to-and having community support. There are some other facts that I would like to highlight, that come up frequently. The member for Leichhardt mentioned the rate of Aboriginal deaths by suicide. It is an area of grave concern. It is four times the rate of non-Aboriginals in Queensland. As I mentioned, for Thursday, 30 October 1997 MAIN COMMITTEE 10423 every suicide, there are a number of suicides that are attempted-and these are 100 times greater. There is also the fact that there is a larger number of men who commit suicide than females. Blood alcohol levels and alcohol addictions clearly have a strong correlation with suicidal behaviour, particularly when you talk about binge drinking, which tends to occur mainly in summer. That was something that was highlighted at the recent breakfast that I hosted. These particular bouts of binge drinking occur in summer, and the rates of suicide are higher in summer. Professor Baume mentioned that we needed to put more preventive measures in place. But then he highlighted that we need to be particularly concerned-and he quoted studies that go back 30 or so years-because sometimes if you do put in too many prevention measures, or not the right prevention measures, suicide rates actually go up in schools where they have had prevention measures. He emphasised that there was a greater need to put these measures in place when people reach young adulthood, rather than at schools. That was quite an interesting revelation. I was quite amazed when he made that particular revelation. The main problems are definitely in the relationship area. I feel that young men do not mature as quickly as young women. Most of the problems are on a very personal level and they compound the situation. Things like the loss or death of a family friend, as I have mentioned, and break-up of relationships clearly come into the equation, particularly with young males when they are not able to deal with the sense of rejection and loss. We need to spend a lot more money on relationship counselling and dealing with those sorts of issues as well because they are clearly a problem when people are not able to deal with the break-up of a relationship or with grief issues. The importance of these factors is seen in the results of a youth forum in my area, in Redcliffe. Those forums will be continuing. Whilst forums like these are very important to identify problems and suggest solutions, it is important that all levels in the community combine and cooperate to follow through in working out strategies and implementing programs to help realise these solutions. The federal government has taken some steps, and they are to be commended, particularly in respect to the youth suicide issue. Upwards of $31 million is being spent on the national youth suicide prevention strategy, and they are very real and positive steps. Also, there is a provision of $6 million to states and territories to improve access in rural and remote areas to counselling; $6 million is being committed to Lifeline and Kids Helpline; and $3 million is being provided for programs for parents. And let's not underestimate the benefit of parents. We all take an individual responsibility when we have children to ensure that they are brought up in the correct manner as far as their physical needs are concerned and their schooling. But psychological nurturing and self-esteem are just as important. I know that negativity can be one of the greatest downfalls of any young person. We do need to nurture and look after our young people. All the research that I have seen on overseas countries and the incidence of suicide-and, clearly, Australia and New Zealand seem to have the highest rates in the industrialised worIdpoint to the factor of cultural and family influence. It is no coincidence when you see European countries with lower levels of youth suicide. One has to detect from that: is the family environment such that it does not encourage suicide? What is being done culturally in these countries that prevents suicide? Is it a stronger family situation? Is it the role of the 10424 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 30 October 1997 extended family? We cannot underestimate how important family influences and upbringing are in this particular issue. The previous Minister for Family Services( Mrs Moylan) best summed it up in June this year, when she launched the national youth suicide program, when she said: When so many of our young people are dying by their own hand through despair, desperation, frustration, or loneliness, it is a problem that demands national attention and national action. The recommendations of the committee's report are that developments in the effective service delivery of these programs and strategies will be based on positive and up-to-date information. The integration of suicide research is needed to ensure that grants are used effectively. There has to be some sort of consistency and accuracy in data collection in Australia. It is very disturbing when you see that there is no national database for suicide, and that the statistics are very sketchily collected and are very ad hoc. We really need to look at focusing on that. If we know the extent of the problem that we are dealing with, we can deal with it much more effectively. I emphasise the need for greater research and figures in this area. The federal government has shown that it is prepared to support and assist those who are at risk and are classified as prime candidates for youth suicide. The fact that the committee advocates the constant review of Australia's suicide strategy emphasises the fact that the strategies and funding policies need to be continually monitored, and updated if necessary. I think that it is important that the information be provided, that it is designed to assist families and those at risk, and that it needs to be as readily and widely available as possible. Doctors, teachers, counsellors, representatives at all levels of government, and particularly young people, should have access not only to this relevant information but also to the contact details. This is particularly important for families in crisis. The solution to youth suicide is very complex and very sensitive and this government has made, and will make, a significant effort to listen to and address the needs of that part of our community which right at this very minute is crying out in loneliness and desperation. I think that the most important step, the next step-prevention-is going to be very much harder, and we really do need to emphasise it. Debate (on motion by Mr Anthony) adjourned.
