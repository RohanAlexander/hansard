But it is right because people accountable and, therefore, ensures that they who previously were not paying any tax, or more effectively compete in the market-place certainly not their fair share of tax, are now generally within both the public and private starting to do so. That is a most important point sectors, the whole question of the Government that needs to be made about the observation of concentrating on revenue raising and not on the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in his very reducing expenditure can be overcome.

That is an important ular way and for a particular reason, is magic part of the consideration of a lot of the measures and that that enterprise will function far more that will come before the House over the next efficiently and effectively. few weeks.
