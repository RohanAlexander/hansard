12,' Mr Deakin (Ballarat^Minister For,"-It is unnecessary to repeat the observations -which I made to the House two days ago in moving a similar motion. The malady -for which a remedy is proposed is, as I the'n explained, chronic, although this proposal has been provoked by a special attack. At first it appeared that a minimum limitation would suffice, but had I . been -aware that the Government would be refused assistance in obtaining anything approaching a real and efficient standing order for this purpose, I should at once have moved the -adoption of the whole system of closure in force in the House of Commons*. The criticism to which my first proposal was subjected has not impaired our justification for its introduction. It is essential for the proment. If , in the course of years, the rule per conduct of parliamentary business. It was thought last week that the standing -order then proposed would have taken less time to discuss, seeing the need, at this -.period of the session, for preserving our time, but, under the circumstances, and in view of the fact that that standing order is general in its application, it is desirable to prevent idle discussions on certain motions, and to deal with obstruction on the part of individual members. The first part of this motion aims -at prevention. It provides that motions which ought to lae treated as formal shall be dealt with formally, that is to say, that they shall not be subject to amendment or debate, but shall be put at once to the House, or to the Committee, as the case may be. In this way a great deal of obstruction will be prevented without any -active intervention. useful debate may also be prevented. 'the honorable member's opinion, and, I think, no one who has listened to the recent speeches on the motion "" that the Chairman do now leave the chair."" This part of the motion has received the approval of the Standing Orders Committee in the last Parliament and in this Parliament, and, therefore, is recommended in a fashion whicb should specially appeal to honourable members opposite. The second part of the motion is aimed at individual obstruction. If we relied entirely on the standing order adopted yesterday, it might happen that the House, exasperated by the irrelevance or undue length of' a few -speeches, might close a debate, and thus 'prevent honourable members who desired to address themselves, in reasonable fashion, to the question from doing so. This part of the proposed! new standing orderl is taken from the practice of New South Wales, where it has been in force for a great many years, and a somewhat similar rule exists in Western Australia. I am not aware that complaints have been made against its operation, except, perhaps, in a few cases. learned member aware that Sir Edmund Barton and Mr R. E. O'Connor were both closured when fighting for Federation? memory, but does not affect my arguhas been unwisely or improperly applied in individual cases, it has been ino more mishandled than the best and soundest laws may be. The powers of restraint on whicli civilization rests are all capable of abuse, and all have been abused at times, .since capacity to be used implies capacity to be abused. The object of this rule is to prevent abuse of the time of the House, and of the rights of honourable members 3 and to say that it can be abused in its turn is not a sufficient objection to it. If we cannot rely on the good sense and judgment of Parliament, on what are we to rely ? On the one hand, we have the judgment of the great body of members, and, on the other, the resistance of, often a small, and sometimes a numerically insignificant, minority, who set their individual desires against the clear wish of the House. Unrestricted individual speech is impossible in modern days, in any Parliament, no matter how small. There must be self restraint on the pant of the units if Parliament as a whole is to be free and to work effectively. The choice offered to us is between the risk that the units may occasionally suffer at the hands of the majority, and the danger that the business, standing, and dignity of Parliament shall suffer from caprice or deliberate attack ait the hands of the units. I am confident that both these rules will come to' be employed with due regard to the rights of honourable members, applied infrequently, and with as little abuse as possible. After the first experiences are over, they will take their place with the other Standing Orders, and be handled in the same way. The last rule is aimed at protecting free speech, by giving to the more modest and less loquacious members of the House opportunities of which they are now often deprived",12,Closure

It is in the power of either side to make any question a party question-that is one of the necessary conditions under which we transact our business; but in dealing with individual members, it is to be hoped that party considerations will not be allowed to influence the actions of tbe majority. It is the duty of honourable members not to sit idly by listening to irrelevant speeches, or to stand up themselves and make inconsequent observations, but to devote themselves to the business which they were sent here to transact, with as little delay as is consistent with due rewrong, butj. if so, the leader of the Labour gard to the discharge of their obligations. Is it not idle prattle for the Prime Minister to tell us that these proposals are not prompted by party considerations, and that the new standing orders will not be used for party purposes ?

I defy him to show an exAmple in which, a measure like the Trade Marks Bill has been suddenlywithdrawn for the purpose of submitting proposals -intended to enable the Government to stifle -debate upon the measure. Marks Bill withdrawn? The honourable jDiember would not permit us to reach it. ply because the Government made up their minds to rush the Bill through without a-easonable discussion, and because they refused a fair proposal, and peremptorily .required honourable members' to continue sitting for an unreasonable time. The Bill was withdrawn after the fairest of offers had ;been made-a n offer which will not be repeated when we come to consider the measure on its merits. Judging from the .amendments which have already been suggested, it will be impossible to pass at one sitting anyi such number of clauses as were offered to the Government upon, the occasion referred to. Now as to the merits of the Government proposal. The Prime Minister has stated that the guillotine provisions in the House of Commons have -worked well. Strange to say, this morning's Argus contains testimony to the contrary. that. -quite as able as the Prime Minister, who bave operated the guillotine provisions for themselves, and have worked under them for years, unhesitatingly denounce them, and say that they are undermining the 'functions of Parliament. -matter of common knowledge that there were never such complaints against the parliamentairy institutions of Great Britain ,as bave been made since the guillotine pro-visions have been in force. They have not justified themselves, either by uplifting the -character of parliamentary institutions or by -facilitating the work of the Empire as a whole. legislation would be absolutely impossible -without them. -make such a statement, but I would point out that legislation in Great Britain was not impossible before the guillotine was adopted.

It is. my duty to prevent any debate that was the Trade may have any bearing on the discussion which closed last night. This debate is entirely separate, and cannot be regarded as a continuation of that which took place yesterday and on preceding days. Any debate upon what were called the "" g a g "" or guillotine proposals adopted last night will be entirely inadmissible on this occasion. At the same time, I recognise that the second proposal which is now before honourable members does so far cover the area to which I have been referring that I cannot prevent references from time to time which may go back over the previous debate. It will be my duty-and I rely on honourable members to assist me-to avoid as far as possible any duplication of the debate which closed last night. tion to transgress that very wholesome rule. The case to which I was about to point was one in which the closure was applied to individual members time after time in order to pass through fhe New South Wales Assembly the provisions in the Land Act relating to improvement leases, which have given rise to the recent land scandals in that State. Those scandals must be attributed to the application of the "" g a g "" on that occasion. to the thieves who have profited by them. It is a ing of the legislation which made the thefts, as they are called, possible. The course of the "" g a g "" can be traced throughout the civilized world. In nearly every case in which it has been applied, as it was on the occasion referred to, in ill-temper and under the influence of party motives, it has led to the passing of some measure which did not commend itself to the public outside.

A Bill which, after remaining on 'the business-paper for two months, suddenly became urgent. Other business specially set down for consideration on the night in question was postponed in order to allow that Bill to be taken in its place. At whose request, if not at the request or demand of those most interested in the Bill, was that action taken? Did the Government willingly push aside the Electoral Bill, or the Copyright Bill, in order that consideration might be given to the Trade Marks Bill? Without notice of any kind that Bill suddenly became urgent, and found a first place among the proposals for discussion. I have already alluded to what took place on the evening to which I refer, and I do not wish to traverse it again.

The ""gag"" proposal was pushed through by bitter class feeling, and we have been told by the Prime Minister, from his own lips, that these later proposals have been made in revenge. He told us the other night that, but for our conduct regarding! the first proposal, he would not have submitted his further proposals, but would have been content to see how the first worked. What is that but saying that the Government are satisfying upon us their feelings of revenge? There can be no stronger condemnation of these proposals than the spirit which has prompted them, and the motives with which they have been brought forward. I do not intend to let the "" g a g "" make the slightest difference to me. Honourable members on this side will proceed with the discussion of business as if the "" gag"" did not exist.

I do not know whether the proposals now before us were in the hands of the Prime Minister at the time. I doubt if they were, because I understood him to say at a subsequent stage that' they had' not then been determined upon. If they only cropped up afterwards, the Prime Minister ought to have considered that it would be highly dishonourable to bring them forward after a settlement had been arrived .at without the slightest knowledge on the part of those taking part in the conference that any additional proposals were to be made. The fact that the terms of the proposal then before the House were not considered has nothing to do with the question. They were not considered for two reasons. The members of the Opposition thought, first of all, that they should be debated in the House, and, in the second place, they knew that if they were discussed, difficulties would arise, and that if any settlement were to be arrived at the fewer the differences of opinion the better. Prime Minister knew that the chief objection to the proposed new standing order then before the House was its severity, and if he had known that other proposals of an even more drastic character ward he should, as a matter of honour between man and man, have informed the other members of the conference. He should have said, "" I wish you to know that we intend to submit further proposals."" would the Opposition have continued the bers under certain circumstances had taken "" stone wall "" ? discussing that matter.

Despite his knowledge of that fact, the honourable and learned gentleman never in timated that he intended to make that proposal even more severe. I cannot regard his action in that connection as other than, a breach of faith, and I am sorry indeed that in making an arrangement of that character, anything of the kind should have occurred. I would further point out that in the proposals submitted for our consideration there has not been that strict adherence to the] promise of a Minister which' I believe should always attach to such pledges. We all know that the Attorney-General intimated to the House that the Prime Minister had promised to accept a certain proposal. I say that any such promise should be fulfille d to the letter. I know that there are someMinisters who-if such a promise were not fulfilled by the Prime Minister-woul d hand in their resignations. There should be nothing more sacred than the deliberate pledge of a Minister to Parliament. W© have had evidence that there has been an absolute breach of a deliberate Ministerial promise, and although the matter must rest as between the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, one of them has been placed in a false light, and one, of themshould consider his position. Last night the honourable member for Bland, by interjection, disclosed the very improper reaThe sons which are responsible for the attitude taken up by some honourable members, and possibly by the Ministry. He said that no amendment upon any of the proposals submitted by the Government would be considered, because of the action which were to be brought for the Opposition deemed it their duty to take towards the close of last week. What did his statement mean? It meant that for reasons of revenge, any promise whichhad been made to' accept an amendment should be departed from, and this House should commit itself to proposals which will affect not only the present, but future a certain course of action.

They represent an addition to other standing orders which we have adopted. SO. what I wish to point out. The proposals of the Government must be regarded as, an addition to the Standing Orders which have been adopted during the present and previous sessions. Honourable members who are supporting these proposals have upon a variety of occasions-sometime s outside the Chamber and sometimes inside it-give n expression to opinions which clearly show that any such proposals as those under consideration, in addition to the Standing Orders already in existence, should not be applied to any Parliament. To me it is astonishing to find that men who profess to be democrats should, the moment the opportunity presents itself, desire to become autocrats, and to go even further than the Conservatives have ever gone in any British Parliament. These proposals, added to our existing Standing Orders, will form a code of rules which exceed in severity those which are operative in any British Parliament. member does not know the nature of the I do not rules which obtain elsewhere, or he is making a deliberate misstatement. mark is unworthy of the honourable member.

They provide that the en^ forcement of the closure must be authorized by Mr Speaker or the Chairman bf Committees, as the case may be. Therefore the honourable member must see that my statement that these proposals, in conjunction with our present Standing Orders, are more severe than the rules which obtain in any other British Parliament is correct. in error. There is a standing order for the application of the guillotine, which is ten times more effective. does the honourable member refer? guillotine motion, under which a whole BiU can be passed practically without discussion. Government proposals a Bill can be put through without discussion. The honourable member is alluding to a practice which exists, not only in the Queensland Parliament, but in the British Parliament-the practice of fixing a time at which the debate upon a measure shall conclude. But I maintain that the proposals of the Government in conjunction with our present Sanding Orders-seein g that they do not provide for any control by Mr Speaker or the Chairman of Committees-ar e more drastic than the Standing Orders which obtain in those Parliaments. not indulge in fair discussion under the Standing Orders proposed is an Opposition! which is incapable of performing its duties.",24,Closure

That would be a very subservient position for the House to occupy. I regret exceedingly that the safeguards attached to certain standing orders of the House of Commons and the Legislative Assembly of Queensland were not embodied in the 1 standing order adopted last night, so that an impartial officer of the House, elected by ourselves, would be called upon to decide whether or not it was being rightfully applied. I do not view with pleasure the prospect of what may take place in connection with the application of these Standing Orders, for I have seen the enforcement of less drastic rules in another Parliawill enable invidious distinctions to be ment create much bitterness and trouble. A Minister who, despite his anxiety to push on with the business of. which he was in charge, and notwithstanding the irritation which criticism of that business so often creates, would not sometimes be in favour of the closure would be human. visions to be applied most unreasonably, by Ministers who were usually tenable to reason. I had hoped that the Ministry, having been a party to a certain arrangement, would be satisfied w;Uh some modification of the standing order originally submitted by them, and, at all events, would not require the second part of those now before us to be passed. I do not take such strong exception to those of the proposed Standing Orders now before us, which have been taken from the report of the Standing Orders Committee. So far as they are concerned, we have had some notice of them, for the report of the Committee has been laid on the table. But I do take the strongest exception to the proposal to add to the standing order already passed, one which is altogether too drastic, and is likely to lead to the making of an invidious distinction. A ll parties to the arrangement arrived at should have received honourable notice of what was the intention of the Ministry in regard to new Standing Orders. What would have been said if, in accordance with an agreement anived at, the Government had withdrawn the standing order originally proposed by lowing day? Had they done so, their action would have been, on all-fours with that which they are now taking. If it was fhe intention of the Ministry, when forced through without the conference took place, to introduce these Standing Orders, they should have notified us accordingly. They gave no such notice to those who conferred with them in regard to the standing order adopted yesterday, and this naturally causes vis to consider that we have not been treated as honorably as We ought to have been. WhilstI object to these proposals being introduced without notice, I am not so strongly opposed to the first part of the motion as I am to the latter part of it.

In the course of my speech this morning, I pointed out that a debate was sometimes carried on to enable an honourable member to reach fhe House in time to take part in a division. WhilstI was showing that such debate was not unreasonable, an honourable member behind me intimated that on one occasion, the honourable member for Coolgardie asked the honourable member for Kooyong to carry on a debate for that purpose. I made use of the information so given me, but have since learned that it was entirely incorrect. formant intended the statement to apply to J:he Home Rule debate, but I do know that the honourable member for Kooyong did not take part in that discussion, and that he was not by any means pleased that he had not an opportunity to deliver the speech which he had prepared on that subject. I therefore, did him an injustice! when I coupled the reference to the Home Rule debate. I desire to say that the statement which I made was incorrect, and should not have been made to me in the terms stated by the honourable member in question. sonal explanation, I wish to say that I was not in the House when the statement to which the honourable member for Parramatta has referred was made.

Shortly afterwards, when there was an opportunity for me to rise, Affairs) I find that, unforthere were loud cries of ""divide, divide,"" from those, who, like myself, were opposed to the motion, and the result was that I did not insist upon, my right to speak that evening. On the next occasion when the matter was I prefer to wait until they are under consideration, the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who had moved the motion, continued the debate, and in reply to a question which I put, you, Mr Speaker, ruled that he was replying, so that I was precluded! from addressing myself to the question. The suggestion that the honourable member for Coolgardie attempted in any way to influence me, is inaccurate. state that the account which the honourable member for Kooyong has given of what took place on the afternoon in question is absolutely correct. The incident occurred on 12th October last. An effort was made, both by honourable members opposite and by myself, to secure a division on the Home Rule motion that afternoon, and I asked the honourable member for Kooyong, who desired to speak, whether he I do not know whether my inwould forego his right. He very kindly consented to do so. Later on, owing to certain developments, I informed the honourable member that there was no likelihood of a division taking place that afternoon, so that it would be open to him to avail himself of an opportunity ito address himself to the question. I wish to corroborate the honourable member's statement. cellent speeches which have been delivered from this side of the House, and which have covered most of the arguments in opposition to the motion, I do not propose to occupy more than a few minutes.

Therefore, I ask the Government to withdraw the motion until that can be done. If my request is not acceded to, I shall move an amendment, which will have the effect of preventing the motion from being agreed to until the Standing Orders recommended by the Standing Orders Committee are considered by the House. Mr Asquith is reported to have made some very pertiI propose to submit an nent remarks on the danger of the application of rules of this kind. Amongst other things, he saidWhen measures reached the stage at which they ought to be properly discussed the guillotine was applied, and they were passed in the form devised by the Government but never approved or revised by the House. . . . Then, again, with regard to the voting of public money, the theory of the Constitution was that the people's representatives were sent to Parliament to control expenditure, but what was the practice? In 1904, under the supply closure, thirty-one millions of money were voted, not one item of which had ever been discussed, and this year the amount The rose to fifty millions sterling. This was a most serious state of things, for it amounted to nothing less than a creeping and progressive paralysis of the Parliamentary organism. What were the symptoms? First, a growing impotence of Parliament as an instrument of legislative production and financial control, and secondly, a growing resort to violent measures by the Government. That is the opinion of an old and experienced member of the British House of Commons, who went on to sayOn. the other hand, executive government by the joint operation of the guillotine and the block became every year, both as to legislation and policy, more and more emancipated from Parliamentary control. That might be convenient That is a for the holders of office for the time being, but in the long run it was bad for the Executive, derogatory to Parliament, and injurious and even perilous to the empire.

EDWARDS (South Sydney). I am glad that the honourable member has withdrawn the amendment, because the motion should be fully discussed before any amendment is considered. Had this motion been proposed in the first instance, it would have been debated more calmly, and would have received more favorable consideration than it is likely to obtain under present circumstances. though I feel that the Government stand in a wretched position in regard to the means which they have chosen for dealing with the evil waste of time in matters affecting legislation-the y having acted wrongly and unwisely in overlooking the Standing Orders Committee, to whom all such rules should be submitted, and in proposing to meet particular ends what should be proposed to meet general ends onlyI still feel compelled to support many of the rules contained in the motion. I have, for some time, thought that we might well prevent discussion on certain motions in the House and in Committee, which are of a more or less formal character, and I intend to ask the Prime Minister to so divide the motion that the House mav give a decision in regard to each portion of it. Should that request not be assented to, I shall appeal to Mr Speaker to act upon precedent, by putting the motion from the Chair in sections. I do not think there should be any discussion on the motion for the first reading of a Bill, because, although such a motion mav be necessary to draw attention to the proposal to introduce the Bill, and to put the Bill before the House, discussion is useless until the measure is in print, and in the hands of honourable members. Neither do I think that the motion ""That the debate be now adjourned,"" should be the subject of discussion, though an opportunity should be given to the mover of that and similar motions-say , five minutes-to explain the reason for moving it. Otherwise, a Minister who may have some special reason for reporting progress, because of something which has suddenly come to his knowledge,, will have no means of informing honourable the Government Whip to each of them individually. But I do not think that sucb motions should be taken advantage of by political parties, to delay business. In my. opinion, the present Opposition have not sinned to as great an extent in this respect as have other Oppositions in this House\ but opportunity should not be given to any set of members to delay business, and, therefore, I feel compelled to vote for at least several of the proposals contained in the motion. It cannot be ignored, however, that the standing order adopted yesterday makes the second part of the motion unnecessary. My chief reason for supporting in the main the proposals in the first part is that they proBut, alvide for rules which will be applied impersonally, and will not inflict injustice on any member individually.. I quite agree, with the first proposal under which all honourable members will be placed upon an equal footing, in so far that certain motions will have to be put without discussion. No party can take any advantage of such a standing, order, nor can the majority impose disabilities upon the members of a minority or upon an individual member. That is as it should be. There is some justice in a rule that will apply all round, and I regret to say that that element is lacking in the standing order adopted last evening, and also in the second of the proposals now before us. I object to a rule which would have the effect of depriving honourable members of privileges which, as representatives of the people, they should enjoy as fully as does a Minister. Under the proposed rule, it would be open to the majority . to prevent an honourable member from expressing, his view upon a matter of vital importance to his constituents. We have already conferred power to prevent waste of time, and I see no reason why we should direct the application of the closure to individual members. I have stated over and over again that every honourable member has a right to the full privileges of membership, irrespective of whether on not he be a Minister. If a Minister has the right-as he would have, without infringing the new standing order-to address the House for two or three hours, or for even-a week, in introducing a Bill, it would be a gross act of injustice to apply the",28,Closure

I think that there should be no power to apply the closure during debates on an Address-in-Reply, the Budget, or a "" Noconfidence "" motion, and that no limitation should be placed on the speech' of the mover of the second reading of a Bill, or of a resolution. vent an honourable member from occupying; badf-a-dozen hours, and thus depriving other members of an opportunity to speak?' any curtailment of the debate on the Address-in-Reply, when an opportunity is. afforded honourable members to ventilatetheir views on various political matters. Nor do I think that the closure should be applied to motions of ""no-confidence,""' when, as a rule, the side which -knows it will win leaves the other side to talk. Surely the winning party may be expected! to have the grace to allow the losing party its say. the last motion of want of confidence, wedid not know for three weeks how the decision would go. spice of interest to the proceedings. Furthermore, I do not think that a majority should have the right to apply the closureto an individual until he has had a reasonable time in which to express his views on the question before the Chair. I would' suggest that the closure should not be applied to an individual until lie has beenspeaking for not less than an hour in the House, and not less than half-an-hour inCommittee. Finally, I think that the proposed application of the closure to an individual member should not bake effect 1 unless twenty-four honourable members vote for it. I do not think that that numberis enough, but it is the number alreadyadopted by the House in regard to the application of the general closure. If theseamendments are made, I can no longer object to the motion. useless if all the amendments which have been suggested were made. suggest would prevent the application of the closure to a member before he had' exercised his right to be heard. amendment after amendment for evermore. the proposals of the Government; but let me say, speaking from experience, that it is a very difficult task to frame a long series of amendments, and one which Mr Speaker does not make, any easier.

Leave granted. tened with deep regret to the attacks which bave been made on the Ministry by honourable members of the Opposition. Apparently the friends of the Ministry have deserted (them, because up to the present time, not a single supporter has risen to speak in favour of the proposals or of the attitude of the Government. The Prime Minister has defended his proposals, and explained the circumstances which led up to their submission ; but it is well known that no criminal should defend himself, because, as a general rule, accused persons are incapable of placing the best points of their defence' properly before their Judge, and it is thereTore customary to appoint some one ' to -speak on their behalf. As no other honourable member appears willing to do this in the present case, I feel bound to come to the rescue of the honourable and learned gentleman. Speaking, for him, I say that neither he nor any of his Ministers is to be judged by the ordinary standards that govern men in keeping promises made specifically or impliedly. We must remember what led up to their occupancy of the Treasury benches. honourable member to go into that question. for a condemned criminal, I should be allowed some latitude. If you, Mr Speaker, will not allow me to take that course, I propose to speak against the motion. I had nothing to do with the meeting which took place on Monday last between certain members of the Government and the Opposition. HadI been present, I should have opposed, to the utmost of my power, any attempt to compromise, and events have since shown that we could not afford to trust the Government. Had they been actuated by the spirit of fair play, they would have stood loyally by the letter of the agreement arrived at; but, instead of / doing so, they, knowing that they had a majority who would support their proposals, and that the Opposition were honourable men who would keep their word, brought forward additional rules for the limitation of debate. Had these proposals been made in connection with a general view of the Standing Orders, they would have had my strong support, but, inasmuch as they have been submitted with the object of preventing fair discussion of a particular measure. I think that they are unjustifiable. I have always endeavoured to occupy as little time as possible in this House, arid charges such as have been levelled against some members, of the Opposition, and more members of the Labour Party, do not apply to me. I have never unduly taken up the time of the House; therefore I naturally view with suspicion drastic measures such as those now proposed. We all know what is intended. never makes long speeches, and therefore the closure will never be applied to him. able members may not desire to give me fair play.

With regard to the question which was addressed to me by the honourable member for Boothby, I may say that the remark which I made was of a purely jocular character, as must have been indicated by the words "" thirty coppers would be sufficient for some of them,"" which I added in the hearing of honourable members who were sitting near me. With regard to the proposals now before us, I feel sure that had the first of them been brought forward at an earlier stage, the debate which has taken place during the last fortnight would have been avoided. The provision referred to would in itself have been sufficient to prevent any undue waste bf time. It is an extraordinary fact that in Victoria, the adoption of a standing order similar to the first of the proposals now before us was found sufficient to prevent all-nig ht sittings and unduly long de( bates. Experience showed that the ""gag"" did not provide an efficient means of closing debate, and that it did not prevent all-night sittings, but, on the other hand, gave rise to very strong feeling. The best way to prevent "" stone-walling "" is to provide that motions such as "" That the Chairman do now leave the Chair,"" or "" That the Chairman report progress,"" should be put without debate. The Prime Minister stated that the closure, as applied to carries and to individuals, had been adopted by pll the Legislatures of Australia; but that is not the case, so far as Victoria is concerned. Singularlv enough, upon the one occasion that the closure was introduced in Victoria, exact] v Ihe same number of members voted for it as sunDorted it last night, namelv. fortv-one. When Sir William McCulloch introduced ithe ""gag""-whic h was then called "" the iron hand "" in the Victorian Assemblv. forty-one members voted in favour of if. "" gaggers "" ? to twenty at the next election. The closure provision was repealed, and although it was revived at a later stage by the present Prime Minister and his then colleagues, it. was eventually dropped. I do not see that any good purpose can be served by op posing the adoption of the first of the proI f I could feel asposals before us. As to the second sectiom of the motion, however, I entertain the very strongest objections to it. I think that it would place a very dangerous weapon in the hands of the majority, because a member could be closured before he had spoken for two minutes. I interjected while the Prime Minister"" was speaking that the closure had been applied to Sir Edmund Barton and Mr R. E. O'Connor when they were supporting the cause of Federation ini the New South Wales Legislative Assembly,, in order to enable an antagonistic Billto be carried through. I do not think that any instance can be quoted in whichv the closure has been used, except for partypurposes. The Prime Minister stated that he did not think that it would be used as a party engine. it would never be so used. shown that it is used almost invariably for the purpose of achieving spme party object. Honourable members must realize that in this. Chamber a certain amount of resentment is. directed to some honourable members, because of their strong fighting capacity, and it is ridiculous to suppose that the closure would not be applied to them. It is a significant fact that under the Governmentproposals no member of the Labour Party could be closured. The only persons to whom the rule could be applied would bemembers of the direct Ministerial Party, or members of the Opposition. Labour members might speak for as long as they choseand we have had experience of their capacity in that direction. these proposals give the Labour Party complete command of the business of the House. without the responsibilities of office. Some reference has been made by the honourable member for Parramatta to the fact that honourable members sometimes find it necessary to keep a debate going in order to enable other members of their party to reach* the House and vote. That practice obtains in all Houses, but it would be impossible to follow it under the proposed new standing order. It would be the easiest thing in the world to closure a member of the Opposition; but it would be i m -",35,Closure

If we were on the Government side and had a majority we .could apply the closure with effect against our opponents. and learned member for Corinella has said, every member ought to have some time allotted to him for the expression of his views. If an hour beconsidered too long, then half-an-hour should be allowed, and, say, a quarter of an hour in Committee. Honourable members should at least be able to feel assured that some minutes will be placed at. their disposal before the "" gag "" is applied. The absence of any such provision in the proposal before us seems to indicate that it has been conceived in a moment of heat. It is a great pity that the motion should have been brought before us without tair consideration. It was prepared when feeling ran high, and if appears to have been forced upon the House under the influence of a strong feeling of resentment against the Opposition. I agree with the honourable member for Parramatta that the Prime Minister has, been guiltv of a breach of the understanding which was arrived at with members of the Opposition in regard to the debate upon the standing order adopted last, evening. had some conversation with the honourable member for Grampians, who, I understand, is on friendly terms with several members of the Government, and he has succeeded in convincing me that the strong attitude which I took up in the first instance was incorrect. He has proved to me that, although there has been no absolute dishonesty on the part of the Government, they have been guilty of contemptibly sharp practice. sion like that contained in the latter part of the motion, unless it is accompanied by some safeguard, such as that suggested by the honourable and learned [194]' member for Corinella, will become a mere party engine for the purpose of crushing any speaker who may be making an effective reply to the arguments used on the Government side. External Affairs) I propose to say but very few words in regard to the main question. So much has been made, and properly made, of the statement of Mr Asquith, and of the manner in which these proposals were submitted to the House during tbe discussion ' of a particular measure, that I wish to call attention to an important fact. In the House of Commons to-day the practice is, when a Bill which does not come under the operation of the As the honourable guillotine standing order, is being unduly delayed, to there and then propose a resolution fixing a time at which the various stages of the measurje shall be taken. 1 Therefore, instead of, as in our case, suspending the discussion of a particular measure, to pass a general proposal which will apply to all legislation, the House of Commons suspends proceedings when the heat of debate is at its greatest, and party feeling is most highly aroused, to pass a resolution relating only to the particular Bill which has produced the conflict. Government are not acting in that way. in regard to the particular measure under debate, what we are proposing to do, not only with regard to the measure which was engaging our attention., but in relation to all other measures and proposals. I do not wish to labour this point, but if there be anything in the argument that we jouj^ht not to ihave introduced these proposals whilst a particular measure I have was under consideration, that contention would apply with tenfold force to the regular practice of the House of Commons. Then, in regard to the remarks of "" Mr Asquith, I desire to direct attention to what has happened 'in connection with one of the most debatable measures that has recently engaged the attention of the House of Commons. No later than July last, after the Aliens Bill had been "" stone-walled"" for some time, A provithe Prime Minister submitted a proposal that certain clauses should be taken upon a fixed date-o n a Monday -that certain others should be dealt with on the Tuesday, and that the report should",36,Closure

In the course of the discussion, on that proposal, which was made in the midst of the debate vipon the measure, three representative leaders of the House made observations to which I desire to refer. By reference to the Parliamentary Debates, fourth series, volume 148, 1905, I find that, at page 1155, Mr Balfour is reported as follows: I myself hold the view that such resolutions as that which I am now proposing, and which have been proposed by me on previous occasions, and by my predecessors, are an inevitable part of the present machinery of Parliament, and that their adoption will be found necessary by my successors, as they were found necessary by my predecessors. He then proceeded to state that he hoped hereafter they would develop into somediscussion upon the subject to which I can thing of a more satisfactory character. refer, of three leaders of parties, one The leader of the Opposition, the' Right pointedly declares that without some such Honourable Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerstanding order no business is possible, and man, in the course of a speech in opposition the other two, upon different grounds, practo the motion-as will be seen by reference ticallyaccept his statement.

He was almost entirely in agreement on this point with the Prime Minister. He had over and over again said to the House of Commons that in his judgment, as time went on, it. would become more and more impossible for this Assembly to fulfil its duties to all the manifold interests committed to its care -the authority of Mr Asquith and the ment for Home Rule, and not for the ""gag."" the application df the closure in the meantime as being the only means of meeting the situation. ter suggest that any comparison can be instituted between a Parliament which is legislating for 350,000,000 of people and a Parliament which represents only 3,5oq.ooo? does not enter into consideration.

NowI have to deal with what, to me, is a painful subject, because my conduct in parliamentary life has very rarely been called into question upon the ground that I have not extended proper consideration to those with whom 1 have been negotiating, or that I failed to appreciate what was due to my own self-respect. I must say that whilst prepared for charges of various kinds at different times in my political life, I was never taken so entirely unawares as by the unexpected charge that in the particular negotiations of last MondayI failed in fulness of candour and straightforwardness to the gentlemen who met me in conference. I iregret that the honorable member for North Sydney is not now in his place. Had he been present, I should have made a personal explanation at an earlier stage of our proceedings. But as two of the members of the Opposition who met me in conference upon that day are now present, together with my colleagues and the honourable member for Bland, who were associated with me in the negotiations, I propose to outline exactly what happened. Five of the six members who were present at that gathering can bear testimony to my statement of what took place. I desire to. be judged by the highest and severest standard that honourable members can set themselves in relation to this matter, when once they have heard my view of the facts of the case. Upon my airrival at the House on Monday morning I was informed that a proposal for some arrangement to terminate the prolonged sitting was to be submitted. I was asked if I was prepared to meet representatives of the Opposition to consider the situation, and agreed to do so without hesitation. I was not informed as to the particular character of the arrangement to be suggested, but at once came to a conclusion of my own as to what its purpose would be. I assumed, as most honourable members would have done, that it would take the shape of some proposition from the Opposition for the amendments which they desired to make in the standing order then under consideration. I naturally thought that they would ask for certain amendments, and object to others, with a view to seeing if wo could not agree upon the passage of some standing order. Honourable members [194]2 will recollect the circumstances of the position. We had been sitting from the preceding Thursday. A prolonged struggle bad taken place. We had adjourned at midnight on Saturday until the Monday morning. We met again, I venture to say, as to this side of the House, not only strong in numbers, but high in hope and. \resolute courage. upon this side of the chamber. I went into the conference without feeling that it could imply anything like surrender on our part, but with a preconception that it necessarily meant that some arrangement would be made with regard to Standing Orders. When first the question of making a proposition to the House in regard to that matter presented itself, the Government took into consideration, in a general wav, the whole question of Standing Orders. We dealt with the general question of Standing Orders, and resolved that we would, if necessary, go as far as the House of Commons provisions; but if it were not necessary to go to that length, we would go as far as was necessary to meet the circumstances of the case. When, therefore, a direct challenge came from the Opposition in regard to the conduct of the business of this House.in connection with a certain measure, we decided to take the first step and then the second, or any subsequent step that might be necessary. We lef t these matters generally approved, but in the rough. I wish to say that the second and third proposals, word for word as they are now before us, had not been agreed upon, but it had been agreed that similar pronosals and others,, if required, should be made. this side of the House knew nothing of that. members of the Government had any knowledge cif the matter I mention it now., because I have been challenged as to what I had in mv own mind, aiid in order to make that clear am obliged to say what would otherwise remain a Cabinet confidence.
