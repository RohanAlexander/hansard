Asked The Minister Of Home Affairs Whether He Was In A Position To Make A Statement Regarding Matters In The Northern Territory, And, At His Request, I Repeat The Question Now? Turned To Darwin On Friday, And On Satur","day met a deputation of the men. There were two or three difficulties to adjust, the Home Affairs intend to make any increase chief one relating to the starting of work at half-past 7 in the morning. By reason of the refusal of some of the men to commence at that hour, they have been working beyond the gazetted time, and made a claim for overtime, which the Administrator did not feel called on to pay, while some other men who had gone to Darwin under agreement had been summoned for not doing their work in accordance with the contract they had entered into. The proposal of the Administrator to the men was that they should start at half-past 7 in the morning, the gazetted hour, in which event he would pay to them the overtime asked for, and withdraw the Court cases in respect to those under agreement. After two conferences, I am glad to say that the men determined to do what the Adnunistrator desired, and at the present moment everything is satisfactory. prepared to state the intention of the Government regarding the abolition of the Excise and bounty on sugar?

53,Upon Which Mr Fairbairn Had Moved,,18,Trade Marks Bill
54,Mr Groom (Darling Downs) [3.22],,18,Trade Marks Bill
55,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"AttorI think that it would be fatal to the principle of the Bill, and that it is opposed alare actually exercised by the Registrar, I together to the object of the Act. We desire to make as economical and simple as possible the process of obtaining trade marks. There ought, therefore, to be expedition, and expedition is best secured by making, wherever it is possible, the depository of the decision 'the person who is seized of the facts, and who is charged with the administration of the Act._ The functions of the Registrar are, in the main, concerned with registration, and any applicant will be, for the most part, affected by his decision in that respect. There is an appeal from the Registrar's decision in the exercise of all those duties that are concerned with his main functions. Sections 34, 35, 43, 44 and 45 of the Act are all concerned with the exercise of his main functions, and in these cases the applicant has the right of appeal. The honourable member for Darling Downs desires that there should be a general appeal from the Registrar's decision, whether his decision be administrative or not. hundred-and-one things to do. His functions are not always judicial or quasijudicial; many of them are purely administrative. The honourable member's amendment would be practically to make the Law Officer a judge of the Registrar's act, and then to give the High Court an overseeing jurisdiction over the business of the Trade Marks Office. I submit that what we want to do is to enable any man who has a trade mark that he wishes to register to be able to register it as quickly as possible, and with the least liability to litigation. The honourable member's amendment, so far as I know, would not destroy or lessen the possibilities of a mandamus. A mandamus would still lie against the Law Officer. Why should it not be the case ? We cannot destroy the jurisdiction of the superior Court. When a Judge or an officer of an inferior Court does, or refuses to do, something, what is to prevent the person concerned making application to the Supreme Court or the High Court for a mandamus or an injunction, as the case may be? The chief argument which the honourable member put forward was that litigants were compelled to obtain a mandamus, and since his suggested amendment would not prevent that state of affairs, but would only thiuw upon the Law Officer functions that are now properly exercisable, and submit that it ought not to pass. I wish to point out to the honourable member for Fawkner, who first brought forward this matter, that, so far as the letter from the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce is concerned, I do not think th'eir attention had been directed to the fact that the Registrar's decision is now appealable from in regard to all those matters where he may be said to exercise quasi-judicial functions. Since that is the case, and since clearly no one desires that there should be an appeal from his decision in administrative matters, I think the Bill goes as far as it ought to go. It follows the English law and practice, the only difference being that in England the appeal is from the Registrar to the Board of Trade, whilst here it is from the Registrar to the Law Officer. undoubtedly some difficulties in the way of giving a general right of appeal, because where mere matters of procedure and not questions of. substantial right are involved the principle of the Trade Marks Act is to make the decision of the Registrar on the facts, and, of course, the merits, final. I have not been able to go through all the sections, but in a few cases there is a right of appeal either to the Court direct with, I think, the consent of the Law Officer, or to the Law Officer. What the honourable member for Darling Downs suggests is not that we should give an appeal in all cases, to avoid a mandamus, but that we should give, where a matter affected some person's rights affect a person's rights? with the statement that no doubt there were difficulties, and personally I do not think we ought to press an amendment at this stage; but why should we not avoid the necessity of obtaining a mandamus in compartively small cases? gested amendment. I think that it will lead to uncertainty and confusion: before the Chair applies to section 59, which relates to an appeal in a case where there is a subdivision or an assignment of a trade mark on the sale of the goodwill of a business.

64,Mr Glynn,"The amendment actuallyhas been raised, however, I would suggest for the consideration of the AttorneyGeneralI do not think that we ought to go further than that unless some one is prepared to submit a very carefully thought out amendment that in cases where a mandamus lies an amendment might be drawn up giving the right of appeal so as to avoid the expense of a mandamus. There are, for instance, cases where the decision of the Registrar is one in which perhaps he has declined to exercise jurisdiction, but has nevertheless given some decision upon the facts, or where he may have exercised a jurisdiction that he does not possess, and at the same time has given a decision. right arise out of a decision ? cases the Registrar might give a decision without authority. son concerned must go to Court to have the matter determined. Court, and not to a State Court. Thaiis the point made by the honourable member for Darling Downs. of litigation. prolific of expensive litigation. cases where the Registrar has mistaken his jurisdiction-ther e being no appeal allowed on the facts-the applicant, if he wishes to challenge his jurisdiction, must have resort to the High Court. I would suggest to the honourable member that it is unadvisable to press the amendment, on the ground that it may be of a more comprehensive character than he desires it to be. I would point out to the Attorney-General that section 28 of the Victorian Patents Act 1890 reads(1) Any applicant, patentee, petitioner, or obDarling Downs to say there should be an jector (including in the latter term any person who has appeared before the Commissioner as * party on the hearing by him of any application or petition, or in any other proceeding or matter before him under this Act) who is aggrieved by any decision or determination of the Commissioner in respect of such application, petition, proceeding, or matter, may, within fourexcept by appeal to the High Court, we teen days from the giving of such decision, or the announcement by him of his determination, appeal to the Law Officer. In raising this question, I have no desire to interfere with the administrative details of the Registrar's office. I recognise that there are a number of technical matters connected with procedure which should not be reviewed. But in the case which has been mentioned a distinct right was affected. I submit that in cases where something substantial is involved provision ought to be made for some form of appeal which would obviate an appeal to the High Court. It seems ridiculous that in order to preserve a right which is not covered by clauses 34 and 43 a man should be obliged to obtain a rule nisi from the High Court calling upon another person to appear, and that the parties interested should have to chance whether a Justice of that tribunal will be available to hear the application. In substantial applications some simple course of procedure ought to be adopted. I do not press for an amendment at this stage, but I hope the Attorney-General will consider the point which has been raised. I think the Attorney-General might well look further into this matter. The Attorney-General desires that the procedure followed should be as simple and inexpensive as possible. There have been three cases in which litigants have been obliged to proceed in a very round-about fashion by appealing to the High Court to compel the Registrar to do something. I quite admit that a general right of appeal might open the door to many cases which would render the workI n all ing of the Bill cumbersome. But merely, to provide for an appeal to the High Court for a mandamus is a most expensive and difficult method of procedure. I think that the Attorney-General might well adopt the suggestion of the honourable member for Darling Downs, and endeavour to adopt a simpler method of dealing with the class of cases which has been cited. torney-General) [3.45] -The difficulty here is a practical one, and I submit that the clause .ought to be sufficient. It is all very well for the honourable member for appeal from the Registrar whenever a question of right arises. I say that a question of right may arise out of any decision by the Registrar, and as there are no means of deciding what is a question of right, thus get back to the very tribunal from which the honourable member wishes to escape. As this provision has been found by experience to work well, I submit that we ought to adopt it.

In this clause we are following the Imperial Act, and I ask the honourable member for Darling Downs not to press his amendment. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. torney-General) [3.47] I move That the following new clause be inserted :""30. Section one hundred and twelve of the principal Act is repealed, and the following section inserted in its stead :' 112. (t) Any person who represents a trade mark as registered which is not so shall be liable for every offence, on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding Five pounds.' '(2) A person shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to represent that a trade mark is registered if he uses in connection with the trade mark the word "" registered,"" or any words expressing or implying that registration has been obtained for the trade mark.'"" This provision is intended to take the place of section 112 of the principal Act, which relates to procedure, and which says(1) No person shall falsely represent that any trade mark, applied to any article sold by him, is registered. Penalty : Five pounds. (2) A person shall be deemed, for the purposes of this section, to represent that a trade mark is registered if he sells the article with the word "" registered,"" or any word or words expressing or implying that a registration has been obtained for the trade mark, stamped, engraved, or impressed on, or otherwise applied to, the article. We are practically adopting fhe suggestion of the honourable member for Darling Downs. -The Attorney-General will remember that on the question of costs I asked him whether he could frame a provision_ under which there would be a scale of fees prescribed in matters which come before the Registrar. Section 96 of the principal Act saysThe Registrar and Law Officer, respectively, may for the purposes of this Act(a) summon witnesses; (6) require the production of documents; and (f) award costs against any party to any proceeding before him. At the present time there is no scale of costs fixed such as obtains in connection with the Supreme Court. The Registrar has power to award a lump sum-to fix fourteen guineas in one case, ten guineas in another case, and perhaps five guineas in a third case, according to his discretion.. The Attorney-General knows that intend-; ing litigants like to have some idea of whattheir costs are likely to be before taking, action. I do not want to take away thediscretion of the Registrar. He must have a discretion to give or refuse costs. In the Supreme Court a Judge has that right. There is a similar discretion in District andV Small Debts Courts. But, in addition to the general discretion, there is a scale of fees fixed. If the Attorney-General can see his way, after consultation with the Regis* trar, to fix a scale in the same manner, it will meet the purpose. I do not want toincrease the cost of litigation; but I dothink that the litigants should have some idea beforehand of what the costs are likely to be, by being provided with a scale of costs. ney-General) [3.51] -The question raised by the honourable member for Darling Downs has been considered, as promised. The position is this: The. Supreme Court scale of fees is quite inapplicable in this case. The Registrar considers the lower scale of Supreme Court costs, but at the same time it is, in very many cases, inapplicable. The costs in? cases under this measure are lower, and ought to be lower. Of course, I can appreciate the suggestion which the honorable member makes that there should be somescale, rather as a guide than as a precaution. The practice in England-as ha» been the practice here-is to proceed irrespective of any scale which operates in Courts of law. If honourable members canbring before me any case where costs have been awarded on a notoriously lavish scale,, a direction could be given to the Registrar, or a suggestion could be made to him, that these costs were too high. with his discretion in a judicial matter. That would not be right. But perhapa the Registrar himself might be able to suggest a certain scale. ber thinks that the Registrar's duties are judicial rather than administrative? once decided, I do not think he should be asked to turn round and revise the costs he has awarded. honourable member.

Section one hundred and thirteen of the principal Act is amended[a) by inserting therein after the words ' Royal Arms' the words ' or the Arms of the Commonwealth'; and .(i) by omitting therefrom the words ' so nearly resembling them' and inserting in their stead the words ' so nearly resembling the Royal Arms or the Arms of the Commonwealth.'

In an action for the infringement of a registered trade mark the Court, in determining the -question of infringement of the same, shall have -regard only to the trade mark itself, and to the mark which is alleged to be an infringement thereof, and not to any mark, design, or other -matter extraneous to the trade mark, or to the alleged infringement thereof, nor to the size, -or shape, or get-up of the package or goods to which the trade mark or the alleged infringement thereof is annexed or affixed, or upon which the same is printed, marked, or embossed. considering whether any mark is an infringement -of a trade mark, the Court shall have regard, in particular, to the colour or colours in which the mark and the trade mark respectively are -used."" -Section 53 of the original Act as it stands, and as it has been judicially interpreted, has immensely weakened the position of the holder of a registered trade mark. The section provides that a registered mark-shall be deemed to be infringed by the use, in -respect of the goods in which it is registered, of a mark substantially identical with the trade -mark, or so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive. Consequently, registration is infringed (1) if the mark is substantially identical with a trade mark; or (2) so nearly resembles it as to be likely to deceive. It is well recognised that a trader who stoops to imitate the mark of his rival is generally careful not to use a mark which is substantially identical with another, but uses one nearly resembling it. to deceive. Mr J. H . CATTS -Unde r the Acti t has to be both nearly resembling and likely to deceive. A dishonest trader is afforded immunity under the Act unless the proprietor of a registered trade mark can satisfy the Court that the mark complained of not only nearly resembles his mark, but is also likely to deceive. This is impossible under the decision in the case of Bourne v. Swan and Edgar Limited. Further, the Courts have held, in considering the question as to whether a mark so nearly resembles another as to be calculated to deceive, that they are entitled, not only to look at the mark itself, but also at the accompanying circumstances and general get-up of the goods. I should like to call attention to section 25 of the original Act, under which the Registrar cannot consider the surrounding circumstances and general get-up of the goods. The only things that are before him for consideration are the registered trade mark, on the one hand, and another mark which a trader is seeking to register, on the other. He has, therefore, to determine only two points-first , whether the one mark is identical with the other, and, secondly, whether it so nearly resembles as to be likely to deceive. The Court should, in determining the question of infringement, regard the matter in identically the same way as the Registrar has to regard it under section 25. In It may be further pointed out that it has been held by the Court that though a trader may use a mark intended to copy a registered mark, and intended thereby to deceive, yet the Court itself may come to the conclusion that, though he so intended, yet he has failed in his attempt, and that the mark used by him is not calculated to deceive I submit for the consideration of the Attorney-General that if a trader endeavours to copy the mark of his rival, and that fact be proven, it ought to be sufficient evidence that the mark was likely to deceive. Because, in all these matters I think the trader, who is an expert in his business, is better qualified to judge of a mark that is likely to deceive, than is even a Judge on the bench. The Judge is not",21,Trade Marks Bill
81,Amendment (By Mr Hughes) Agreed,,22,Trade Marks Bill
82,Mr Groom,"S o nearly as to be likelyacquainted with the business itself like the trader, because the latter has had probably an experience extending over many years, and is able to get so closely to the trade mark of his rival as to capture that person's trade under false pretences. He is able to test the matter over a period of years, and he can gradually alter his mark until it gets so nearly to the mark of his rival that he escapes a judicial decision, and yet captures the trade of his rival. I submit that when it is found that a trader has copied a trade mark, and that his intent was to deceive, it ought to be held by the Court that that trader is guilty of deception. That is, that his own intent ought to be sufficient to secure a judgment against him. Furthermore, it will be seen that my amendment refers to the colour and getup of goods. The idea or design of a mark, is frequently copied, and the trader copying such mark, not content with the copying, uses precisely the same colour as that used by the holder of the registered trade mark. The Court should, in ascertaining whether any mark is an infringment of a trade mark have regard in particular to the colour or colours ih which the mark and trade mark respectively are used. It has been held judicially that this matter need not be noticed in considering whether a mark is an infringment of a registered trade mark. Recent decisions in both England and Australia have gone a long way to encourage dishonest traders in closely imitating the trade marks of their rivals, and in sailing so closely to the wind as to enable them to avoid a decision being given against them by the Court. It is certainly undesirable to encourage a dishonest trader to closely imitate or copy his rival's mark, and obviously it is done first with the view of preventing his. rival's mark becoming more and more distinctive of his rival's goods as time goes on, and secondly with the view of getting up his own goods in -such a way as to more nearly resemble the get-up of the rival's goods. In Burford v. Mowling, it was decided by the High Court as followsThe fact that A, a trader, had for many years put up his goods for >sale in packages of a particular shape, size, and colour, such packages not being used by others in the trade, does not prevent B , even with the object of capturing the trade of A, from putting up his goods of the same kind in packages of the same shape, size, and colour, provided that B sufficiently distinguishes on the packages of his goods from those of A . Mr J. H. Catts. that judgment? Mr J. H . CATTS -Yes. Mr J. H CATTS -If it can be shown that a trader has set out with a view of copying the trade mark of a rival, and securing the trade of his rival, then the point of my amendment is that that ought to be sufficient evidence against the former to secure a conviction. I hope that the Attorney-General will be able to see his way clear to accept my amendment, which will do no damage to the honest trader, but will, on the contrary, go a long way to protect the honest trader against a trader who seeks by unfair means to capture the trade of his rival, probably built up after many years of effort. ney-General) [4.6] -This amendment is proposed with the laudable purpose of preventing fraud, or what closely approximates to it, and preventing a trader's rights in his trade mark from being filched; but the honourable member proposes to do it in a way with which I cannot agree. It is a well-known principle of law, and I think that no principle is sounder, that the less definitions are resorted to in a Bill the safer it will be afterwards. It is proposed in this amendment to practically direct the Court in such a way as to almost rob it of its powers of judicial discretion. Mr J. H . CATTS -But it is already robbed of those powers by previous decisions. man has expressed the opinion that a trader is a very much better judge of whether a trade mark is an infringement than is a Judge on the Bench. Mr J. H . CATTS -No; I say that the man who seeks to copy his rival is a better judge than is a man on the Bench. is not. All that I say is that while he may be, so far as practical experience and technical knowledge go, a much better man, he ought to be precluded-and he is in ninety-nine cases out of 100-fro m putting forward a biased opinion. The remedy of a litigant before the Court is not at all dependent upon such matters as the honourable gentleman seeks to introduce into the Act. It is for an applicant to state his case, and for the party who is accused to state his case, and on these facts the Court has to decide.

87,Mr Hughes,"I do not say that heright under the law, and he may bring an action against the other party for passing off as his trade mark what is really the trade mark of another person. I submit that since section 53 of the Act is quite clear in regard to infringements, anything further would inevitably, so far from helping any persons, complicate the matter all round. Such a direction to the Judiciary would hamper rather than assist it. I submit that the law as it is is infinitely more calculated to protect the honest trader than it would be if this amendment were made. Section 53 of the principal Act says The rights acquired by registration of a trade mark shall be deemed to be infringed by the use, in respect of the goods in respect of which it is registered, of a mark substantially identical with the trade mark, or so nearly reimitation that goods bearing the one mark may sembling it as to be likely to deceive. If the colour of a mark were thought likely to deceive, that would be a subject for inquiry. The Court deals with each case on its merits, and I decline to believe that what is the law of a country where trade marks are used, perhaps, more than in any -other, and has stood the test of time, is Inapplicable here. following the English legislation is obvious. We thereby obtain uniformity of law -throughout the Empire, and extend the protection of our trade marks to other countries. tially identical with the trade mark "" are perfectly clear in meaning, and to attempt a narrower definition would lead us into -quicksands.

That is to say, the Court may examine the tinueswhole question, from alpha to omega, and give its judgment on the evidence.

I agree with the Attorney-General that it it, -would be dangerous to embody the proposed belief, the Court considers the use of such a mark -new clause in our law. For a long time to be fraudulent.

The honourable member for Cook copy of his device. asks us to depart from the principles of that code, and to set aside the judicial decisions which interpret it, by accepting a new clause, the effect of which cannot be known at the present time. His proposal is to take from the Court the discretion which it now enjoys, and to lay down a number of rules to be followed. Were the honourable member to consult an ordinary text-book on this subject, he would see thati the principles of trade marks law are there pretty clearly defined, and have been generally acted on. Sebastian, in his Law of Trade Marks, page 142, saysThe real question which the Court has to try in a case of alleged infringement of trade mark, is whether what the defendant has done is calculated to deceive, whether there is so much be readily mistaken for goods bearing the other, and whether a more careful inspection than an ordinary purchaser would be likely to give is necessary to distinguish the mark and appearance of the former goods from those of the latter. Dealing with the tests of infringement, he says, on page 145It is obvious that, in these cases, questions The advantage of of considerable nicety may arise; and in the language of Lord Cranworth, C, in Seixo v. Provezende, "" it is hardly necessary to say that, in order to entitle a party to relief, it is by no means necessary that there should be absolute identity. What degree of resemblance is necessary is, from the nature of things, a matter inThe words "" of a mark substancapable of definition a friori."" The honourable member is trying to give that definition. All that Courts of Justice can do is to say that no trader can adopt a trade mark so resembling misled. It would be a mistake, however, to suppose The that the resemblance must be such as would deside by side. would be of no practical use.

Title agreed to. Bill reported with amendments; report, by leave, adopted. Bill, by leave, read a third time. General) [4.19]-I move That this Bill be now read a second time. The principal Act was passed to enable process warrants of certain State Courts to run throughout the Commonwealth, and to enforce the judgments of such Courts in States other than those in which they were delivered. In 1905 it was amended, so thatany Justice of the Peace, having jurisdiction in the State or part in which the person against whom the warrant was issued, is, or is supposed to be, may, before the endorsement of the warrant, issue a provisional warrant for the apprehension of that person. Prior to that period there was no means whereby a provisional warrant of this kind could issue. vision has been most useful, and it is proposed to repeal it in the Bill, substituting a more effective clause of the same nature. .It is further proposed to authorize InterState service, not only of writs of summons out of Courts of record, but also writs of summons issued by justices requiring persons to attend at Courts of record. In some cases, notably the desertion of wives and children, proceedings have failed because it has been held that summonses were not issued out of Courts of record; and it is proposed to make this measure apply to writs of summons requiring persons to appear at Courts of record. The Bill contemplates several minor amendments in the interests of deserted wives and children. At the present time a summons can be issued beyond the State in the case of an indictable offence or of an offence punishable on sum>mary jurisdiction; but in some States the desertion of wife or children does not fall within that category. It is, therefore, intended toamend the law to deal with this anomaly. Under the law as it stands, a subpoena toanother State, but it is doubtful whether that is so in regard to a subpoena to produce books and documents. It is, therefore,, proposed to amend the law so that a subpoena may be issued in regard to the production of books and documents. As to» warrants, it is proposed to extend the Act. In addition to those who have desertedtheir wives or children, it is intended to include persons who have disobeyed or failed to comply with the orders of the Court, or who have refused to pay fines. So* far as concerns judgments and the InterState enforcement of them, it is proposed' to make it clear that the enforcement includes bankruptcy proceedings. This seems to be a very proper and necessary provision. If an order in bankruptcy is to be evaded r as it may be if outside the Service and* Execution of Processes Act, there is considerable injury done, and the full effect, of the various State Bankruptcy Acts is set: aside. As to interest chargeable on judgments, the Bill provides that interest charged under a judgment in one State and registered in another is to be as from the date of the judgment, and not merely from the date of the registration. In procedure it is proposed to reduce the minimum time for the entry of appearance by defendant,, but only in the case of writs issued in the capitals of the various States, and in Fremantle, Launceston, and the Federal CapiThis particular protal. The reduction in the one case is to be from thirty to twenty days, and, in the other, from thirty-five to thirty days; but in the case of Western Australia generally and the Northern Territory there is no reduction. The measure is one which experience has shown to be necessary. It is, of course, of a severely technical nature, but its usefulness has been demonstrated, and I hope that it will receive the approval of the House. were some notes in reference to this Bill on the file of the Attorney-General two or three years back. The suggestion"" had been made by bodies interested in maintenance orders, such as the State Children's Council of South Australia, that we should facilitate, at all events the service, and, as far as possible, rthe execution of their",24,Trade Marks Bill

I refer the honourable member to the Annals of the American Academy of Social and Political Science, and the volumes published about eighteen months ago. I remember reading in one of them an article showing the extent to which uniform legislation has been brought about in the United States by reciprocal arrangements between the States. It struck me at the time that these volumes would be a useful addition to the lore of the Government, who are so desirous of extending beyond the limits of particular States certain legislation which they think should.be uniform in all. I think that, on the whole, the Bill is a good one, although it does not go so far as enforcing maintenance orders. I cannot see how we could do that by Commonwealth legislation. It would be necessary, for instance, to have arrangements' for the collection of moneys, and the matters would involve too much detail for Commonwealth administration.

Debate resumed from 24th October (vide That this B ill be now read a second time. orable member for Parramatta, who is temporarily absent from the chamber, proposes to continue the debate, and as he will deal chiefly with the merits of the proposal, and the machinery for which the Bill provides, I shall confine myself principally to a statement of what seems to be the position as a matter of law. We have already passed a Seamen's Compensation Acta very good measure, which received the approval of both sides of the House, and which was based upon the Imperial Act of 1906, the latest Imperial legislation on workmen's compensation. through this Bill, and it seems to me to follow on the lines generally of the Seamen's Compensation Act, and, incidentally, one might say that it follows the Imperial legislation. Amendments, however, have to be made in order to meet certain cases. I think that the Prime Minister mentioned last week that there was no remedy under Workmen's Compensation Acts for persons to whom this Bill applies, because the State Acts were considered by the Law Department not to apply. grave uncertainty. Constitution, which, I am happy to say, I proposed, and which provides that the Commonwealth shall have power to enable a subject to sue the Crown in all cases within the limits of the judicial power, the Commonwealth is able to provide a remedy in the case of a tort. The States in many cases at present do not allow a man to sue the Crown. A person who feels himself aggrieved has to petition the Sovereign, and there are certain Acts providing what the procedure after that is to be. It is to our credit that, wherever a subject would have a right against another subject in connection with a tort-negligence , or anything of the sortthe Crown is not permitted to block the remedy by saying,'' We are immune: Sovereignty is a bar, and no remedy can-lie against us."" The Constitution enables us to pass legislation in that matter, and the Judiciary Act enables a subject to sue a State or the Crown. The remedy extends not only to the Commonwealth, but to a State. A State can be sued in the High Court by another State, or by a resident. That power, of course, does not create causes of action, because the Constitution simply refers to cases "" within the limits of the judicial power."" It must be shown, then, in every case, that a cause of action exists. It may be that the common law remedy does not exist against the Commonwealth. It has been decided in America that, speaking generally, there is no common law in the United States. Liability for negligence depended on the common law. The old principle was that if an employer was directly guilty of negligence to a stranger, or to a person in his employ, either by reason of malfeasance or some omission, such as to provide proper machinery, or by the use of dangerous machinery, he would be responsible for any injury sustained, as I have looked long as that omission or act on his part was directly traceable to himself, and was not the act of a subordinate agent, or, to use a modern term, a sub-contractor. That was the law until a variant of it was made in 1837 in the case of Priestly v. Fowler. The theory was then discovered for the first time that if the injury complained of was caused by a fellow employee^ there was no remedy against the employer, because the workman was supposed, as an implied condition of his contract, to have accepted all the risk of common employment. of common employment. the Court in the case of Priestly v. Fowler, and was not generally accepted. Such writers as Ruegg on Compensation said that had the common law principle been logically followed by the Court, the Workmen's Compensation Acts of subsequent years-the Employers Liability Act of 1880, and to some extent the Workmen's Compensation Acts of 1897 and 1906. might not have been necessary. Probably the Employers Liability Act of 1880,",27,Service And Execution Of Process Bill Second Reading

115,Mr Glynn,"That was laid down by-which has been adopted by some of the States, would not have been necessary, for the reason that the general principle which held an employer responsible for negligence, also applied to negligence on the part of the person engaged by him. It is quite as logical to assume that when a man purchases a railway ticket he accepts all the risks of the journey, as it is to assume that because a person accepts employment he accepts all the risks connected with the industry in which he is engaged. That was the principle laid down in Priestly v. Fowler, and to such a length was it extended, that it was held that the chief engineer of a vessel was a common employee"" with an ordinary seaman. In other words, it was held that the employees in the various departments of some of our huge modern industries might, nevertheless, be common employees, and the -employer, or as they called him in England, -the "" master,"" was exempted from all lia""bility on the ground of his employees implied acceptance of all the risks of the inwho sat down to read Mr Knibbs' statis-dustry. -ploye"" had to accept all the risks. -the sense of responsibility develop. In a 880 the Employers Liability Act was passed, which modified to some extent the old rule, but did not substantially alter the law. What it did was to hold that where, for example, the negligence of a superintendent caused an injury to a workman, he should be regarded for all purposes as the employer or master, and his negligence would be assumed to be that of the master. It also laid it down that the doctrine of common employment would not be a defence to an action founded upon the supply by an employer of defective plant. But we must always remember that that Act did not create new causes of .action. What it did was to take out of the decision in Priestly v. Fowler five special -matters. It enacted that if a workman was injured as the result of obeying by-laws which had been framed, and to which he had to conform, a right of action would exist, notwithstanding the doctrine of common employment. I need not say any more on this aspect of the case, except that the Employers Liability Act of 1880 effected very limited modifications of that doctrine. It qualified the five instances in which that Liability Act of 1880, which has been doctrine was not to apply, by declaring that even though negligence of a certain kind existed on the part of an employer, the employ6 was still not to have a remedy. In other words, it laid down that if certain facts existed they would be regarded in the light of contributory negligence on the part of the employ^. It was held that injury could not occur to the individual who was willing to be injured. In other words, if a man knowing of a risk accepted that risk, or went into the region where it existed, he was presumed to have voluntarily accepted that risk. So that if a man continued to work a dangerous machine, knowing of the danger, he was held to have voluntarily accepted that risk. to the length of saying that if a man had read statistics relating to accidents in a mine, and afterwards went into that mine to work, he would have voluntarily accepted the risk of accident there? would go so far'as that. I do not suppose that two honourable members in this chamber tics, would draw the same conclusions from them as a matter of conviction. does not underrate the practical utility of Mr Knibbs' statistics? of our liability to draw wrong inferences from them. The Act of 1880 laid it down that where a workman had noted a defect in machinery which he operated, and continued to operate that machinery, he had voluntarily accepted that special risk. That Act, therefore, did not accomplish very much, though it did extend the principle that there are some risks connected with an industry which ought to be borne by the industry. resulted from it was that it educated the public to the inutility of such legislation. some instances it is fairly easy to prove negligence, and in such cases the workmen would have a remedy. In other cases the workmen, as the results of agreements drafted by that much maligned, when it should, rather be much extolled, body of men I refer to solicitors -ca n obtain compensation without the necessity of appealing to a Court.

They may not apply in respect to liability to Commonwealth servants or officers, because it may be held that their application would be an infringement of the internal administration of Federal Departments. I merely suggest that possibility, because we have not yet heard from the Government why this Bill should have been brought in. point certain. right; only I have not heard anything to show clearly-thoug h it may be capable of being shown-that the Commonwealth, in respect of its servants, is outside the common law, and outside the purview of State Acts in this matter.

From that point of view it is very proper to remove all doubts. What the Bill does, I assume-havin g looked through the schedule-is to give compensation in all cases where an accident has occurred to a workman in the course of his employment, and to throw on the employer-whic h in this instance is the Commonwealth-the obligation, if he wants to protect himself, of inthrough the English legislation as well as suring against such accidents..

But the Imperial Act extends to almost all classes of employment and injury. It is only when a man is temporarily injured-say , for less than a week-that he is not supposed to be covered by the Act. tions in the English Act. now very few restrictions. Such limitations cannot apply in this case, because we are dealing only with Commonwealth employees. There must, however, be some limitations. I see that one is that a workman entitled to compensation must have been employed at a salary not exceeding £ 5 0 0 a year. The measure covers any person employed at manual labour, clerical work, or otherwise. logical in that limitation. lation is never perfectly logical. We are all more or less pragmatists. In legislating we have to a large extent to live from hand to mouth, and to confine ourselves to the limitations of a certain period. It is probable that legislation of this kind cannot be applicable to the whole service. I wish the Prime Minister were always notperfectly logical in these matters. He might have been less logical in regard to the maternity allowance, when he proposed to extend the benefits of the legislation to all cases, although probably only 5 per cent, The Prime Minister did say, as will need it. Now, however, he properly comes back to political expediency, and presents us with a measure which applies only to a limited number of people. honourable member on the principle of compensation. I think the idea of compensation, apart from the awarding of damages, is a new one. through our Seamen's Compensation Act. Persons affected under the Bill are to be compensated apart from whether there has or has not been negligence. But there is a provision that where an accident has ocThe public curred owing to the serious or wilful misconduct of an employ6 there shall be a qualification as to the liability of the Commonwealth. I think that Imperial decisions go to the length of saying that that cannot arise in any case falling short of attempted suicide. The wilful default must be of such a character that the person has practically attempted suicide before he can be denied compensation. laid down that principle in a decision not long ago. decision some fifteen years ago, when the South Australian Bill was introduced.",29,Commonwealth Workmen S Compensation Bill Second Reading

However, I was glad to hear, as I always am, the speech of the honourable member for Angas. very much to say about this Bill at this stage, which seems to be one for consideration in Committee. really contained in the schedules. In that respect it reminds me very much of a Local Government Bill which was introduced by Sir George Reid and came to nought. It was a skeleton Bill. One suggestion after another was made to put in a provision, and the reply always was, "" I will put it in the code."" This Bill, it seems to me, is in the schedules. emphasized the fact on half-a-dozen occasions that this is a Bill for compensation, and not an insurance proposition. If it is a Bill for compensation, it strikes me that its title ought to be altered a little, in order to make it read sensibly. Probably the draftsman has followed the phraseology in the titles of similar Bills elsewhere, and, therefore, it will be regarded as sacrilege, I suppose, to criticise it in any degree. But it does strike me as being a bit comical to compensate, for instance, a workman who has been killed. How we are going to do that I do not pretend to know. What is meant, of course, is that we are going to compensate those whom the deceased workman has unfortunately left behind him. It is a Bill relating to compensation to workmen. The title appears to be defective in some way or other, since what is meant is that, in consequence of a workman losing his life, and to whom, therefore, compensation cannot be paid, it is intended to compensate those who are left behind. the title to include compensation in respect of people who are killed and people who are injured? title of that sort would be better. but no better. be better. Ido not quite see how we can compensate a man for having killed him, either accidentally or otherwise. I think that the Bill is long overdue. If it will only do away with those anxious harrowing moments which occur at the end of almost every session, when persons who have been injured in the Public Service come to have their claims adjudicated upon by the House in a rough-and-ready manner, resulting oftentimes, I am afraid, in the most meagre justice being done to them, and sometimes in very little justice at all being done-if the Bill will only do away I have not with this experience, through which every Government has had to go in each session of It is this Parliament, it will have accomplished a good purpose.

168,Mr Joseph Cook,"I know that is a Workers' Compensation Act in this State. about Acts, but about facts; and I know that, so far back as the memory of any one of us ean go, on the railways and in Government employment of every kind, it has been the custom to compensate on the lines laid down in this Bill the dependents of men who have lost their lives and men who have received injuries whilst in Government employment. I know that twenty years ago I interviewed the late Mr Eddy, in Sydney, and got ^400 for a widow whose husband had met his death in connection with the railways of New South Wales. fluence to get the money. plication for compensation, just as anybody will have to do under this Bill. That is not altered in any degree. Therefore the Bill is merely crystallizing what has been an minable unless matters are referred to the immemorial custom in connection with Government employment The only step farther that it goes is perhaps in the modification of the principle of contributory negligencea factor which has always led to much discussion, and sometimes to substantial injustice being done to the sufferers the liability, and the extent of that liaby these injuries. The Bill goes a step further. It does not obliterate the element of contributory negligence as the German legislation does. It is not as favorable to the workman as is the German legislation, which, without reservation of any kind, lays down the principle that an industry shall carry all its own risks. Under the German law, the workman is not asked to contribute towards a fund for providing compensation for accidents. He must contribute towards the making of provision against sickness, unemployment, and old age, but not towards making provision against accident. In respect of accidents, the obligation is wholly on the employer; and there is no reservation regarding misconduct, ignorance, or any action on the part of the workman which may .have contributed to the accident. Whatever contributory causes he may have been responsible for, the workman receives his compensation, which is paid by the employer, and the German legislation relates to both private and public employment. I wish I could believe, with the honourable member for Angas, that there .will be little litigation under the Bill. There will be a great deal of litigation-that is, unless arbitration i's not regarded as litigation. The arbitration will be almost continuous should our Public Service grow, and employment under Government increase as it has done. There are three parties to whom an injured man,, or those dependent on him, may look for compensation should accident occur: the Commonwealth-the ultimate employer inall cases-the contractor doing the work for the Commonwealth, and any outsider who may have caused the accident. The liability of these three parties will be a cause of arbitration from the very beginning, though, I suppose, in all cases, the Commonwealth will have to pay the to use your incompensation that is awarded. It is provided that the Commonwealth may recover from any contractor that it employs, that: is, may require him to indemnify it for compensation that it may have to pay. I am afraid that arbitration will be interCounty Court Judges, as provided for. This may lead to direct appeals to the Courts in all cases as being the safest and easiest way of getting matters settled. It is appalling to think of the subjects for arbitration which will arise. There is first bility, of each of the parties I have referred to. Another subject for arbitration is the amount of compensation to be paid. Then it must be determined who are dependents. The Bill deals with dependents of all kinds, and part dependents, but makes no reference to adopted children. It sometimes happens that a child is adopted and educated, and becomes the mainstay of the household in which he has been reared. Should his death occur, those who have adopted him are placed in the same circumstances as real parents on the death of a son. In my opinion, no distinction should be made between the case of an adopted child and that of a child. I do not know whether in this matter the Bill is following lines which have been laid down in other legislation, but, in my view, those who have adopted a child who has become their support should, in the event of his death, be in the same position as real parents. I see endless vistas of arbitration. It will not matter to the arbitrator, because he is to be paid out of Consolidated Revenue. The Bill provides 'for medical arbitration, too, in the",32,Commonwealth Workmen S Compensation Bill Second Reading

172,Mr Joseph Cook,"I made an apcase of disputes about the value of certificates. It is evidently thought that some men who have got on to the sick-pay list will not be eager to return to work. A man will be paid 30s. a week for his temporary ailment, and if he is a member of a lodge or two besides, it may happen that he will be paid as much, and in some cases a little more, for being sick as for being well. .Evidently the Government are contemplating some trouble arising in this connection, because they prolater on, in the same schedule, it is disvide for the production of a medical certificate, in addition to that provided by the man himself, and in cases where there is a dispute betwen those two doctors, the question is referred to a medical referee to arbitrate as to the relative value of the certificates. medical reference as to the extent of the incapacity. public interest. pointing out that where there is a difference of opinion by the doctors, a third doctor is called upon by the Government to decide. At every stage there are arbitration proceedings; and I fancy a great deal of trouble will be caused by the provision that there may be a review of the payments at any time on application of either the Government or the workman. In the military regulations, to which the honthis Bill, tbey cannot get anything out of orable member for Bendigo will refer later on injuries are divided, roughly, into ; four classifications-permanen t disablement, three-fourths disablement, half disablement, and quarter disablement. In this rough way is crystallized the different degrees of injury that may be received in the performance of duties; and it occurs to me that this kind of thing must lead to almost endless arbitration, if not litigation. Then there is provision for commuting *he weekly payments to a lump sum. -such a sum as will provide an annuity equal to three-fourths of the weekly payments ; and, on the whole, I think that is a wise provision. It means that a man who is permanently disabled, may, if he so desires, be paid a lump sum with which he may set himself up in some business suited to his disabled condition. But the extent and value of the commutation is to be the subject of arbitration. failing agreement. How would the honourable member settle the matter? it, 1 think, in a very much better way. ThenI see that a lawyer may appear in any of the arbitration proceedings; the provision is that either the workman or the Government may be represented by anybody, including, therefore, lawyers; but tinctly provided that a solicitor or agent shall not be. entitled to recover any costs, in respect to proceedings in arbitration under the Bill. I do not know how the lawyers will like this provison. Lawyers often do a great deal of work for nothing; Then, again, there is a and I believe there is as much patriotism amongst them as in any other section of the community, if one may judge from their activity and self-sacrifice in their efforts to shape much of our legislation. So far, however, I have not heard one word of thanks from this Government, who have received more benefit in this way, and for nothing, than any Government that I have been acquainted with. There is no doubt about the patriotism of the lawyers; and it seems to me, in the absence of any explanation, that, under this Bill, they are being pretty hardly dealt with. The lawyers may, therefore, make up their minds that, while they may appear under an award when it has been secured. legal remedy. ever, there is nothing to prevent a lawyer having a"" private arrangement with the claimant; and I cannot see why this provision finds a place in the Bill.

199,Mr Joseph Cook,"I am speakinganother authority which I suggest in preference, to deal with these matters, and give injured workmen the measure of compensation which is due to those who suffer in the service of the Commonwealth). I say "" good luck "" to this Bill. I believe it will bring comfort to many an anxious heart. I know well, from long experience, the anxieties of those who, as the result of acciin which he was employed. I do not know dents, lose their bread-winners, or have them seriously injured. If the measure will only relieve to some extent the anxiety due to the occurrence of serious accidents to workmen, it will serve a good purpose, and as such I have only words of commendation for it. hail with delight the introduction of this Bill. For a number of years I took an active part in the endeavour to have an Employers' Liability Bill passed by the New South Wales Parliament. I had the pleasure, also, of coming here from Sydney at the invitation of a number of trade unionists and others connected with the Melbourne Trades Hall to urge upon the Victorian people the advisability of passing a similar measure. The honourable member for Parramatta has endeavoured to make this Bill an object of ridicule, but he has never shown the inclination at any time to assist any previous Government to introduce a Bill of the kind. I could never understand why the Government, as an employer of labour, should not be placed in exactly the same position as a private employer of labour. A private employer is liable for accidents to his workmen. I do not know what the other States have done in the matter, but in New South Wales we have a Workmen's Compensation Act. In that State an employer of labour, for his own security, insures himself against the results of accidents to his workmen. As an employer of labour I have done so, but I am sorry to have learned that the insurance companies surround the matter with so many obstacles and technicalities that it is hard to know whether injured workmen will get anything or not. One of my workmen injured himself a fortnight ago, and I discovered that he can draw nothing for a fortnight after the date of theaccident. I was under the impression that he would receive compensation from the date of the accident. I shall support the Bill with great pleasure, because I feel confident that the obstacles suggested in the way of its operation by the honourable member for Parramatta were purely imaginary. If it be found that the measure does not effectively carry out its purpose, it can be very readily amended. The honourable member for Parramatta took exception to the provision for a medical referee, and also to the provision for arbitration, but it is easy to understand that there might be a dispute between an applicant for compensation and the Department any better way to settle such a dispute than by arbitration. It is possible that a claim may be made which is not a just one, and the Government, in the interests of the public, should, in such a case, obtain a medical certificate. Surely the honourable member for Parramatta will not oppose the Bill on such grounds. I could not understand his objections. I can quite believe that measures of this kind are novelties to honourable members opposite, but they are not novel to honourable members on this side, who have endeavoured for many years to get such measures passed, and to have the Government placed in the position in which they will be placed under this Bill. In the short period during which I have been a member of this House accidents have occurred to employees in the Public Works Branch of the Home Affairs Department, and in the Defence Department, and there has been no redress except at the will or pleasure of the Ministerial head of the Department concerned. In one case, a young fellow was injured for life as the result of an accident in connection with our Naval Forces. He found that he had no legal redress; but, with the assistance of a couple of members of the Cabinet, I was able to bring his case under the notice of the responsible Minister, who secured for him an appointment as watch-man, or something of the sort, in the employment of the Government. Although this young fellow was injured for life, he had no legal redress. I am afraid that he will not be able to occupy the post very long, and that his wife will have to support him, as well as their family of three or four children. A measure of this kind ought to be hailed with delight. 'We should be glad to know that, henceforth, any servant of the Commonwealth who is injured while on duty will be able to secure redress. I feared, at first, that honourable members opposite would speak of the Bill as "" another political trick,"" but so far nosuch cry has been raised. This is a measure which should secure for the Government the support of every public servant, for no one in the service of the",35,Commonwealth Workmen S Compensation Bill Second Reading
200,Mr West (East Sydney) [5.45],"1Commonwealth knows when it may be necessary for him to avail himself of its provisions. cism the honourable member for East SydThe Commonwealth should be in a position to grant compensation to a person injured while in its employ, just as a private employer is liable under Workmen's Compensation Acts to compensate any person who meets with an accident while working for him. It is not many years since the law was such that if , as the result of the collapse of a scaffold, a person walking along the street were injured or killed, the contractor would be liable to pay damages, although the workman engaged on the scaffold when it collapsed could secure no redress, notwithstanding that the contractor himself might have been guilty of great carelessness. That is a state of affairs that ought not to have been tolerated. Whilst the people had no voice in the framing of the laws of the country, they could not remedy it ; but now that they have, measures -such as that now before us are more likely to be placed on the statute-book. The advantage of a measure of this kind is not so much that it will enable compensation to >be obtained as that it will cause greater iprecautions to be taken for the public 'safety. pocket will be affected by any carelessness on his part, he will take care to see that ttiis machinery and appliances generally are .such as will reasonably insure safety; and we may be sure that this Bill will also -make Government officers careful to take .all reasonable precautions against accident. -I am pleased to have the opportunity of -supporting this measure. If there is in it anything that does not exactly carry out the will of the Parliament, we shall be free to amend it as soon as that defect is dis-covered. We cannot hope to pass a perfect Bill of any kind. It is only in the administration of a law that its weaknesses are discovered; it is only in its every-day -operation that we learn whether or not it carries out the intention of the Legislature. 'This is a Bill that ought to have been -passed years ago, and I hope that it will -speedily become law. The honourable member for East Sydney -has hardly done himself justice in his references to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Those who have been associated with the honourable member for Parramatta will freely admit, whether they differ politically from him or not, that every measure -devised for the well-being of the workman -and his family has commanded his sympathy and active support. Whatever critiney may indulge in is not likely to affect his political reputation or personal character. The honourable member caa show that he has done more than have many others to secure practical assistance for those who are likely to be injured while following their ordinary avocations. Coming now to the Bill itself, I may say that its underlying principle is not new to the Opposition, and that I am delighted to support it. The matter which it covers first came under my attention about the year 1904, when an officer of the Postmaster-General's Department was injured by a falling telegraph pole. widowed mother, who was dependent upon him for her support, did not receive a penny by way of compensation. It was discovered that a reduction was actually being made from the wages coming to him in order to cover funeral expenses. Turner! not then Treasurer. I believe that the present Treasurer, on taking office, cancelled the order that that deduction should be made from the wages falling due to the man, but there was no provision for compensation. Later on, I was a member of a Government that had to face the same problem. The honourable member for Eden Monaro then held office as Postmaster General, and after discussing the matter with his colleagues, issued, on 13th May, 1907, an instruction in which he approved that provision should be made on the Estimates of his Department for the payment of compensation(a) To the .widow and (or) to the children under age dependent upon an official of 'the Department who, through circumstances over which he has no control, is killed in the ordinary performance of his official duties; and (4) To any official who, under circumstances similar to those mentioned in "" (a)"" above, is so injured as to be rendered incapable of further service. The maximum payment was fixed at ,£500. Our desire was to place this principle upon a definite basis. We have hitherto had to resort to the passing of special Acts of Parliament to provide for compensation few injured officers of the Commonwealth. In 1908 we passed an Act making a series of grants, amounting altogether to .£2,438, to various persons. The largest grant was to",36,Commonwealth Workmen S Compensation Bill Second Reading

Mr J. H . CATTS -Was any provision made for temporary disablement? by the Postmaster-General at that time provided for the payment of compensation in cases of permanent disablement. Mr J. H .

I pointed out that a large number of men were then employed by the Government at Yass-Canberra, and that in a short time it would be necessary to engage some hundreds of workmen in connection with the construction of the transcontinental railway. I urged, therefore, that some provision should be made to meet cases in which injury might be sustained by these individuals. On that occasion I saidThere ought to be some cheap method of quickly deciding the responsibility, and provision made for dependence to receive almost immediate relief. eases. much better to have a definite system under which this compensation should be paid as a right, and not have to be applied for, it may be, through a Parliamentary representative, or some other person. whether we have the necessary power? have the constitutional power to give compensation to our own workmen. of the kind, remembering the Seamen's Compensation Act. still have definite and decided power.

Again, on the 18th December last, I pressed the matter of passing a Workmen's Commonwealth Compensation Act forward. The Commonwealth was then about to launch out upon large works. We had in contemplation the appointment of some hundreds of men in Western Australia,, in addition to which workmenwere employed at Yass-Canberra, and numbers were about to be employed in our clothing and harness factories. All of this meant the employment of men in more or less dangerous occupations, and it seemed right therefore that they should be placed in the same position as that which they would occupy if they were in the employ of private individuals. The time, therefore, was getting ripe for the passing of the necessary Statute providing for compensation, instead of resting on an Executive minute. On the 18th December, 1911, I statedMen should get compensation speedily, and' that compensation should be based on a fixedand liberal scale adequate to the injuries sustained, and sufficient to meet the cases of dependents who are entitled to support. In reply, the Prime Minister saidI am entirely in favour of the contention of"" the honourable member for Darling Downs that we ought to have an Act dealing with all thesecases, but that Act must be on a different basis' from ordinary Workmen's Compensation Acts. I am glad that this Bill is not on a different basis, but that it is exactly on the basis of the Acts which have been found to work so well in other parts of Australia. Mr J. H .

227,Mr Groom,"Personally , I should remaining uncompensated when workmen have been injured in the course of their employment. Such statesmen have striven, in Australia and the United Kingdom, to accomplish reforms in this direction; and there are honourable members on both sides of this House who for years have strenuously advocated every measure having for its object the awarding of adequate compensation. By the old common law a master was bound to take reasonable precautions to insure the safety of his servants, and was rendered liable for any injury sustained by such servant when the injury was brought about by the personal failure of the master in his duty. But the three limitations upon that rule, which tended to deprive a workman of his right to compensation, have been enumerated by a recent writer. law. Judge-made law does not help us very much. It cannot fairly be said that the Judges have been lacking, in sympathy for the rights of poor people. The history of the British Judiciary is one of which we have every right to be proud on account of the independence of judgment and the defence of the rights and liberties of the people which that history discloses. the law against the working people. member is quite wrong in that. There were three limitations placed upon the common law. The first was the doctrine of common employment; that is to say, the doctrine that the master was not liable when the injury to a workman was caused by the negligence of a fellow workman in the course of common employment. The second limitation was that expressed in the phrase volenti ought to look back with a sense of gratificanon fit injuria; that is to say that the master was not liable if the servant knew of the danger which caused the injury, because he was supposed to accept such danger as one of the risks ordinarily incident to the employment. The third limitation was the doctrine of contributory negligence, where the accident was brought about more by the servant's negligence than by the fault of the master. Modifications of that common law doctrine have from time to time been introduced, beginning in England in 1880, when the doctrine of common employment was altered. The Employers Liability Act of that year provided that a workman, or, in case of his being killed, his representatives, should have the same light of compensation and remedies against the employer as if the workman had not been a workman of, nor in the service of, the employer, nor engaged in his work. This right of compensation was defined to arise in five cases:-(1 ) By reason of any defect in the conditions of the ways, works, machinery, or plant connected with or used in the business of the employer; (2) by reason of the negligence of any person in the service of the employer who has superintendence intrusted to him whilst in the exercise of such superintendence; (3) by reason of the negligence of any person in the service of the employer to whose orders and directions the workman at the time of the injury was bound to conform, and did conform, where such injury resulted from his having so conformed; (4) by reason of the act or omission of any person in the service of the employer, done or made in obedience to the rules or by-laws of the employer, or in obedience to particular instructions given by any person delegated with the authority of the employer in that behalf; and (5) by reason of the negligence of any person in the service of the employer who has the charge or control of any signal, points, locomotive engine, or train upon a railway. This Act brought about a considerable reform at the time, and extended considerably the liability of employers. It gave many men compensation which they could not have obtained before. But, like all other reforms, it did not accomplish everything. The world will go on for centuries trying experiments affecting reforms, endeavouring to remedy evils, and discovering the inconveniences arising from its efforts. Though the Act of 1880 did not accomplish all that was desired, we ought not to blame its authors for its failures, but tion to what was then done. It is our duty now to carry on the reform, to find out the evils which have to be cured in our time, and to remedy them as best we can. Many accidents did not come within the provisions of the 1880 Act. Its defects have been stated by a learned author as follows:In the first place, the employer was able to evade the responsibility by employing a sup-contractor. Further, the phraseology of the law was found to be provocative of much litigation. It was not as clearly drafted as it might have been.. Then no limit was placed on litigious",39,Commonwealth Workmen S Compensation Bill Second Reading

232,Mr Groom,"I think the honorableproceedings or their costs. Then, again, most of the common law defences were left -open to the employer, including-(i ) The servant having undertaken risk; and (2) -contributory negligence. Again, workmen -could contract themselves out of the Act, and finally the definition of "" workman"" in the Act was too restricted. defects were found to exist, and Parliaments under different regimes faced the problem and tried to improve the position of workmen. Accordingly, in 1893, in the House of Commons, an amending Bill was introduced, and it is in that year that we find laid down for the first time in the Old Country the fundamental principle which we are to-day asked to enact in this Bill. this amendment was moved by the Right Hon. Joseph ChamberlainNo amendment of the law relating to employers' liability will be final or satisfactory faults instead of finding out the faults of which does not provide compensation to workmen for all injuries sustained in the ordinary course of their employment, and not caused by their own acts or defaults. A discussion took place, and the amendment was withdrawn. Secretary then, I think. it was the Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain who first evolved the principle, and, of course, we must do justice to him. water before that -and I speak as one who has had some Bill. It became the first Act. think, that it is the first recorded statement of the principle of workmen's compensation. The Prime Minister, however, is right in saying that it was known to a great many persons what the defects of the old law were, and we all felt that there should be some remedy; but let us give credit to the Right Hon. Joseph Chamberlain for being the first to advocate the principle in the Legislature. In 1897, a Compensation Bill was passed, and then, for the first time, a liability was cast upon an individual to pay compensation for personal injuries which were not the result of any negligence, or any other wrongful act or default on the part of himself or his servants, that is, persons for whom he was responsible. effect, the employer was made compulsorily insurer of the accidents which happened to his workmen. This Act, of course, was found defective, and it came up for revision. It was a great advance, however. I think that it brought some millions under the Act. good, and the mere fact that it laid the foundation, and brought out its own defects, shows that it was worth enacting. In 1906, the Imperial Parliament passed a law remedying the evils that arose out of the Act, and laid the foundation of the legislation which is being adopted, I am glad to say, in most civilized communities to-day. Victoria yet, to its everlasting disgrace. be adopted, but if we look after our own others, we shall have quite enough to do. WhatI am expressing to-day is gratification that we, at last, are passing a measure which I have advocated continuously, because I believe that it embodies a right and just principle, which I think will be found in operation to be very successful. I wish to make a short reference to some remarks that fell from the honourable member for Hindmarsh. If he will only look through the recent decisions of the House of Lords and the Divisional Courts in the Old Country on the interpretation of this Act practical experience of the working of the Queensland law-h e will find that the whole trend of interpretation is in favour of the workmen. of Lords gave their decision. passed. am glad to say, under the old Act, that view was taken.

Mr J. H . CATTS -That is not a general Workmen's Compensation Act. The New South Wales Railway Commissioners have passed a regulation providing that workmen who were injured by accidents which were not due to their own negligence should receive full pay during the period of their incapacity, and half pay in those cases in which the accidents had been contributed to by the negligence of the workmen injured. Difficulties arose, howeyer, because the Department sometimes took the view that the accident had been contributed to by the negligence and want of care of the person injured, while the latter claimed that it was not due to his fault, and the decision of the Chief Commissioner was final and without appeal. Consequently, the effort was made to give the regulation the force of law by having it incorporated in an industrial award, and it has been incorporated in the Railway Quarry award. Now when there is any difference of opinion, the matter may be brought before a Court for judicial decision upon evidence. There should be a similar provision in this Bill. Although the schedule follows the lines of other legislation, I feel sure that the provision to which I have called attention cannot be defended, and I ask the Prime Minister to take the matter into his consideration, so that during the Committee stage an amendment may be made, incorporating in the measure, with his approval, and the general consent of honourable members on this side, the suggestion I have put before the House. The principles of legal reform embodied in the Bill have been adequately dealt with by the honourable members for Angas and Darling Downs, and I shall not attempt to cover the ground they have traversed. When the Bill becomes law, the only defence which the Commonwealth Government can offer to a claim to compensation made by an employee"" will be that the accident was due to his "" serious and wilful misconduct,"" a stereotyped phrase taken from other legislation, the old defence of contributory negligence and other technical defences now open to private employers and to the Commonwealth being waived. I wish to draw attention to the fact that, alwhich will afford ample room for argument. though the Bill applies to the 34,000 or more persons in the Civil Service of the Commonwealth, and therefore will be a very useful measure, it will not apply to the members of our Naval and Military Forces.

263,Sir John Quick,"Perhaps the pro-The Government are to be congratulated on the introduction of this Bill, but it is a matter for regret that a measure of the kind was not passed by a previous Parliament. The necessity for such a Bill is in proportion to the number of employees of the Commonwealth, and, considering the number in the Postal Department alone, it is rather surprising that no attempt has before been made to pass it. It is.not proposed to do anything alarming or novel, because there is nothing original in the measure, which is on the lines of up-to-date legislation. The Bill may be described as one of a liberal character, seeing that hitherto the maximum compensation in the case of fatal accidents has been only £300, while now we are providing for a maximum payment of £500. This shows that the Government and the Crown Law Department have looked carefully into the matter, and have copied legislation which is common all over the civilized world. In the British Empire, at any rate, a State without legislation of this character must expect to be regarded as almost barbarous. I am informed that in Victoria there is no Act of the kind; and, if that be so, I can only say that the men of that State ought to be ashamed of ^themselves. It is perfectly ridiculous for the people of Victoria to talk about their industries and their wealth, when they have arrived at no up-to-date method of making compensation to workmen a charge on the community. torian Employers Liability Act. lute fraud and farce, and was never intended to be anything else. long a public man that I have ceased to believe in the honesty of men who promote such legislation as the Employers Liability Act. On the part of those men there is loo much "" tongue in the cheek "" ; too much giving with one hand and taking away with the other, and too much offering possibilities to a poor man and then giving him nothing but a lawsuit. The men who have got anything under the Employers Liability Act could be counted on the fingers of both hands. It is too much to ask us to believe the promoters of such legislation to be honest, when we know it to be a sham and a fraud. It is not pleasant to say such things, but they are true. This legislation indicates a very interesting phase in judicial decisions; and a little consideration in this connection will throw some light on modern history. Under the old common law a workman was entitled to compensa-tion; and in the early days, when actions were brought, they were always successful. One is not altogether surprised to find, at any rate in the Old Country, a feeling that there is a great deal more in the common law than in Statute law. In the common law there seems to be some principle of justice and equity that is not, I am sorry to say, to be found in Statute law. As manufactures increased, and factories got into full swing, it was discovered in America, in 1837, that, under what was called the doctrine of common employment, a workman could not claim any compensation from his employer. I never knew anything doubtful from a legal point of view that has not come from America; and of this we have had pretty solid demonstration in the last few years. The workers of the Empire and of the world are indebted to the American Courts for the discovery of this # wonderful ""doctrine of common employment."" This decision afforded"" a splendid opportunity to the Judges of taking sides and of throwing the whole of the cost of the suffering arising from the increased manufacturing production of the world on the poor working men. The prospects opened up by the American decision were so alluring that the English Judges in the forties adopted the same decision. To the honour of the Scotch Judges, be it said, they absolutely refused to admit this doctrine of common employment, and it was only on a case of appeal from a Scotch Court that the House of Lords decided, as recently as 1870, that the doctrine of common employment was the law of the Empire. The honourable member for Darling Downs told us about the attempts of certain geniuses, in 1880, to amend the law; but those who made them did so with their tongues in their cheeks. It is too great a demand to make upon my credulity to ask me to believe that such men honestly considered that they were going to do something for the benefit of the working people of England. I am too old-fashioned, also, to believe that educated and trained lawyers did not know what they were about. It was shadow legislationa great many clauses in an enactment, each contradicting the other. The only result of such legislation is litigation, and, in litigation, it is the man with the money who wins. There",43,Commonwealth Workmen S Compensation Bill Second Reading

268,Mr Archibald,"I have been sois a very simple rule by which to measure the greatness of any public man. We have to ask ourselves whether he devoted his energies and talents to the betterment of the conditions of the"" people, or spent his life in retarding the betterment of the people. Though we may be too near the events in the career of the Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain to form a proper ""estimate of him, it must be said to the honour of that distinguished man that it is to him we are indebted for the laying down of the principle of compensation to workmen in England. Those of us who know something of the demand for legislation of this character amongst working people are aware that when such legislation was first proposed it was said that a workman would break his leg for the purpose of getting compensation. That was the sort of statement we heard year in and year out in reference to legislation of this character. It is a comparatively easy matter in the Federal Parliament for a strong Minister, with a following behind him, to carry legislation for 4 the benefit of the people, but the man who could engineer through the British House of Commons and House of Lords a measure revolutionizing previous legislation on a subfit to workmen, and it should be popularly ject of this kind has established his right to be regarded as a strong man. nagivation law which he was successful in passing a year or two previously, and the law to which I refer stand out on the English statute-book as monuments of the legislative achievement of the Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain, who must be admitted to be one of our most distinguished countrymen. admitted that the measure which he introduced did not go so far as he would like, but the English law has since been amended, and is now up to date. principle laid down in the Act passed by Mr Chamberlain in 1897 is the basic principle of legislation of this kind. I know that in South Australia the late Right Honourable C. C. Kingston was successful in carrying a measure which was almost idenlain. It was passed by the South Australian Parliament with some modifications. Honourable members will not be surprised to hear that, because they would not expect any measure of a liberal character to run the gauntlet of a State Legislative Council in Australia. site do not seem to realize that distinction between the State Parliament and the Federal Parliament. We know that, although Mr Archibald. an able man may desire to do some good during his career in one of the State Parliaments, he finds his efforts often nullified by the State Legislative Council. There were several defects in the earlier legislation on this subject. It was applied to injuries occurring in factories, on wharfs, in coal mines, and engineering works, and many thousands of workmen suffered injuries for which they could get no compensation, even under such a liberal measure as that to which I have referred. It is a curious fact, which struck me some years ago, that the whole of the magistrates and Judges in England, in interpreting Mr Chamberlain's Act, did so always in the interests of the employer, and never in the interests of the suffering workmen. honourable member think that that is quite a fair statement to make? of fact. I remind the honourable member that when an appeal in a certain case came before the House of Lords, they gave a celebrated decision, in which they said that the principle of the Act was to give a beneand liberally interpreted in the interests of The workmen. After that decision the various Judges felt bound to follow suit, because the House of Lords is the highest Court of Appeal in the Empire. I propose now to make a remark which will probably horrity some of my honourable friends on this side, but I should have no difficulty in citing quite a number of cases to justify my contention. The right honourable gentleman I say that we get more equity, justice, and sound law from the Privy Council of the House of Lords than from any other tribunal in the Empire, and I say further that it is the cheapest tribunal in the EmThe pire to approach. It is often said that we are living under laws passed by the Parliament of the country; but such a statement is very wide of the mark. We are really living under Judge-made laws, and, what is more, the unwritten rule of interpretation adopted by the judicial Bench is that they should never interpret any reform in the law against vested interests, established practice, or the recognised principles of the law as hitherto laid down. It is not until Parliament has, by repeated legislation, made known its intention in the clearest possible manner that it is possible Honourable members oppoto get what I may describe as a popular decision, or, in other words, a decision such as would be given by any man of average",44,Commonwealth Workmen S Compensation Bill Second Reading

271,Mr Archibald,"It is a statementintelligence after he had carefully considered the whole question on which a decision was sought. No doubt the Opposition will say that this is an extravagant statement, but I can prove every word of it. I defy any one to disprove the statement that the doctrine of common employment is a Judge-made law, and that the whole of the judicial Bench and the magistracy in England at first interpreted the Chamberlain Act against the workers. To the honour of the House of Lords be it said that, when an appeal was made to it, the Law Lords decided that that Act was for the benefit of the people, and that it should be interpreted from that stand-point. In that case the House of Lords gave a snub to the lower Courts. I have no desire to deal with contemporary history, but I appeal to honourable members who, like myself, have a fairly good memory, to say whether it is not true that the judicial Bench have always interpreted the law from the standpoint that vested interests, inherited prejupensation Act as originally passed in South dices, and everything as it exists to-day must be protected. The Bench is a conservative body, and the Judges say in effect, "" You must not go too fast; you must go slowly."" That the judicial Bench takes up that attitude is clearly shown in connection with the history of legislation of this not entitled to claim compensation, inascharacter. defect in the Chamberlain Act, although I have no desire to say one word in unfriendly criticism of. its distinguished author. I 1 fully appreciate the enormous difficulties with which he was beset in passing such legislation. The difficulties of public men here are as nothing compared with those which public men in the Old Country have to face in passing legislation of this characlegislation ever passed; that it is an outrage ter. Under the Chamberlain Act it was possible only to recover compensation where injury was sustained as the result of an accident on the employer's premises-in other words, in or about a factory, wharf, engine-room, or workshop. In the South Australian Act, which was piloted through ston, that defect was repeated, but it has been remedied in the latest amendment of the Imperial Statute. It also provided that a man should be entitled to recover compensation only to the extent of 50 per cent, of his average weekly earnings. Under such a provision, men who in the course of a week were employed by several different persons or firms were very unhappily situated. It hit the waterside workers of Australia very hard. These men are employed one day by a certain shipping company, another day by a totally different company, and perhaps on the following day by a stevedoring company; so that 50 per cent, of their average weekly earnings in the employ of any one man or firm would amount to only a few shillings. I undertook an amendment of the South Australian law to get rid of this trouble, and, with the assistance of one or two of my legal friends, succeeded in carrying an amendment through the South Australian Parliament. Under the amending, Act we assumed that the average weekly earnings of this class of worker was ^ 2 per week, and in estimating the average weekly earnings it had to be assumed that a man was entitled to j£i per week, irrespective of the number of persons by whom he might have been employed during that week. That principle applied to other workmen employed in the same way by different firms. Under the Chamberlain Act and the Workmen's ComAustralia, a man who was injured whilst in the workshop or factory of his employer was entitled to compensation, but if he were sent by his employer to carry out certain work on the premises of a client, and met with injury whilst doing that work, he was I propose now to refer to a much as when the accident occurred he was not in his employer's factory. To get over that difficulty, we provided under the South Australian amending Act that an employ^ who had to travel about in this way should, so to speak, carry his master's factory on his back. I believe that the South Australian Judges have declared that that amending Act is the most disgraceful piece of on legal phraseology. An Act of Parliament must, above all things, look nice, and be perfect in construction. With some persons the question of whether or not the people will be benefited by it is quite a secondary consideration. As long as an Act of Parliament is artistic it is all that is desirable. The South Australian Judges said the Act to which I referred spoilt the look of the law; but the fact remains that, under it, those who are entitled to relief are able to secure it. The defect in tbe Chamberlain Act could not be avoided, but it could, and should, have been avoided by us. I think that the Bill now before us embodies all the improvements of the latest legislation on the subject, but it needs to be carefully examined. The defects of previous legislation have",45,Commonwealth Workmen S Compensation Bill Second Reading
272,The State Parliament By The Late Mr King,"been in regard to casual employment or employment extending over short periods. A man who has been in the employ of the Commonwealth for a week, a fortnight, or perhaps a month, is just as liable to meet with an accident as is a man who has been in that employment from the inception of Federation. The honourable member for East Sydney has just reminded me that the Bill does not provide for any payment to a workman during the first week that he is incapacitated as the result of an accident. But, nevertheless, it is a copy of all the Statutes dealing with this matter. I would also point out that the same practice is followed by all friendly and benefit societies. I do not know whether there is any reason for it, but I am inclined to think that there is. Perhaps, an amendment might with advantage be introduced to provide that where a workman as the result of an accident is incapacitated for three or four weeks, he shall receive compensation for the whole term. But where be is laid aside for only eight or nine days, the -position may be somewhat different. A man who is disabled from following his employment for three weeks or longer should be paid for the full term. teresting to obtain the number of fatal accidents that occur in Australia. of them. Surely it would be wise for our statisticians to collect that information. Why should we be compelled to argue in the dark ? In England it is possible to obtain statistics relating to fatal accidents, and to accidents of almost every description. It would be interesting to learn the loss of life which is sustained in our industrial war. I venture to say that in the Motherland more lives are sacrificed in developing its productive resources than would suffice to cover a good many of its large battlefields. Seeing that the liability of an employer to pay compensation to a worker who may be injured in his employ, can be transferred to an insurance company, there is just a possibility that a spirit of carelessness may be engendered on the part of employers. I do not say that this is so in respect of the Commonwealth Government, or indeed of any State Government. The legislation of South Australia in this connection is fairly up-to-date, but that of Victoria is a disgrace to civilization. I understand that in recent years there has been an improvement effected in New South W'ales legislation, whilst Queensland has no reason to reproach herself that her laws in this regard are not up-todate. But we cannot be too careful in insisting that an inquiry shall be held into all cases of fatal accident. It is all very well to grant compensation to the dependents who are left behind, but that does not restore to them the life which has been lost. Legislation of this character evidences that a more humane spirit pervades the community to-day than existed in the days of our forefathers. It is certainly remarkable that it never occurred to our predecessors to make such a calamity as the loss of the bread-winner a charge upon the general community. When we talk of our boasted civilization it is just as well for us to look on the other side of the picture. As a great employer of labour, the Commonwealth cannot afford to delay the passing of a Bill of this character for a single day. I was very pleased to hear the eulogy bestowed upon the House of Lords by the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I do not quite know the party to which he would belong if he were in British politics. The Labour party would not want him, nor would the Irish Nationalists. The advanced Liberals would not have him, so that probably he would be obliged to join the Conservative wing. for Hindmarsh spoke of a Court, not of a party. Council of the House of Lords is just as well as does the honourable member for Hindmarsh. I do not think he should have attacked the judicial Benches at Home merely because, upon appeal, some decisions have not been upheld by the Privy Council. I think he would probably find that in a great many cases the judgment went the other way.

The term used has completely changed, and the change expresses, in a very marked manner, the difference in attigested as being wise for the protection of tude towards workmen who meet with injuries in the course of their employment. 1 have had many years' experience of accistrain which may come from an accident dent funds, and know their working well. As a matter of fact, in New South Wales some records that 1 had personally kept, together with facts secured from the Newcastle district, constituted the only data which the actuaries had to work upon when the Mines Accidents Relief Bill was passed by the Parliament of that State. That fact emphasizes a point referred to by the honourable member for Hindmarsh, namely, the lack of statistical information in Ausmember, for Darling Downs quoted. My tralia relating to industrial questions and definition of an accident shortly put was problems. WhilstI was secretary of the Amalgamated Miners' Association, I kept records of accidents. I may tell honourable members that in one mine 47 per cent, of the persons employed were injured every six months. In another mine, working in a similar alluvial lead, the accidents were kept down to 12 or 13 per cent. I claim that the majority of the accidents that occur are preventable, and can easily be traced to their causes. In only a small number of cases is the employee himself to blame. negligence on the part of men. Even those working in the most dangerous of callings become somewhat inured to risk, and will occasionally act recklessly. But that does not relieve the employer of responsibility. sure. What we need in connection with all In the case of the Commonwealth, the employer, when carrying out public works, will have to see to it that men are put in charge who will insist that workmen shall be careful, and that the conditions are such that accidents will not be likely to occur. Accidents cannot, perhaps, be got rid of entirely, but they can be reduced to an astonishing minimum. The case I cited Ts an illustration of what can nexion with the calling with which I was be done in regard to mining. The record which I, as secretary, posted up, with full particulars, was looked at, and the manager took a pride in endeavouring to reduce the number of accidents to a minimum. they were driving and rushing the men. They were of the commercial type, looking out for profits, and not caring about what happened to the workmen who produced the profits. In regard to mining disasters, it is shocking what a degree of Ur. S±cnc*. carelessness there has been. Many amendments of the law have been made. Why? To compel employers to observe certain regulations which experience had suglife and limb. Tlie honourable member for Darling Downs has suggested that the may be counted as an injury. an accident. such idea, i have had a very long experience, and the definition of ""accident"" adopted by the Amalgamated. Miners' Association was one which I drafted nearly thirty years ago, and I think prior to the decision of the judge, whom the honourable this"" An accident is something which occurs more or less suddenly, and which could not be foreseen or prevented by the person to whom it occurs."" That is the definition which is taken as a guide in the payment of benefits in the Miners' Association.

After the speech of the honourable member for North Sydney, possibly some honourable member may raise mat old argument in opposition to the meathis kind of legislation is effective machinery for having accidents properly reported, so that inquiries can be held as to their causes. My object in making these remarks is mainly to impress upon honourable members a point which I do not think has been dwelt upon. It is based upon my studies of this subject, extending over very many years, especially in conassociated, and. also my examination of the records of industrial accidents and the deaths which resulted therefrom. The point is that if we make employers responsible, there should be some machinery In the other mines, however, for putting a degree of responsibility upon those who. are over the men. With the provision of this machinery, there always follows an immense decrease in the number of claims. It exercises a large educational influence upon the employers and the managers in every line of industry.",48,Commonwealth Workmen S Compensation Bill Second Reading

It should be made an offence not to report an accident. culties has been to get accidents promptly reported. We have found that we could get this done only by the withholding of benefits. The records now available are nothing like complete. Some industries are much more dangerous than others, and therefore the percentage of accidents varies in different industries, accidents being fewest among clerks in offices. As for accidents or sickness due to overwork, I would say that we should not allow overtime to be worked if that could Be avoided. I am averse to the idea of compensating for injury resulting from too long hours, and too much work, because the hours of labour should not be too long. I understand that the Prime Minister has agreed not to make any deduction when incapacity results from an accident. By the societies to which workmen contribute so that they may have sick or accident pay compensation is given from the date that the incapacity commences, and many decent firms pay full time to employees who are away from work because of sickness or accident.' The Commonwealth should not be less liberal. The better the treatment given to our public servants the better the Service will be, and the better the results which will be obtained from it. I am pleased that this Government propose to add this fresh piece of humanitarian legislation to the statute book. The measure will have a great educational effect, and thus will tend to minimize accident. will both learn to be more careful. When complete records are kept, I hope that overseers under whom more than a certain percentage of accidents occur will be regarded as unfit for their positions. In my experience accidents are traceable more often to the carelessness or unfitness of the overseers than to the negligence of the men themselves. The rush and tear under which many operations are conducted, and the use of faulty material, in the long run do no one any good, not even those who are trying to effect savings by cheap and hurried work. Big accidents in mines have often been due to sheer bad management. I say that from my personal knowledge. Parliament must do all it can to prevent accidents. It is a disgrace to the Parliaments of the States that they have neglected this subject so much. It shows that their members have not at heart the welfare of the wage-earners who produce the wealth of the country. Accidents resulting in injury, or loss of life, not only bring suffering and One of our diffihardship into many homes, but also cause economic loss to the community. Some countries keep very interesting statistics, showing the loss of time through sickness, in various industries, in some of which it is very high. The aim of modern legislation is to minimize this economic loss by the regulation of industry by factory and mining laws, and by the education of the community. Experience shows that the accidents are more numerous with new men, men who have not got used to the work to be done. The aim of the community should be to preserve the health and well-being of the workers, and thus to prevent economic loss. There are men of great skill whose places are hard to fill, and when they are laid aside loss is suffered, first by their families and their employers, and ultimately by the community; but these losses are largely preventable, and will be minimized by the education of the public and the collection of reliable statistics. All employers and all workmen should be responsible for furnishing reports of accidents in which they are concerned. This will enable records to be kept which will show the effect of legislation like that under discussion. I Heartily welcome this excellent measure, and I am glad to hear members of the Opposition speak in favour of it, though that is only what I expected.

I regret very much to find that, because one honourable member on this side happens to place his finger on what he regards as an obvious defect in the Bill, the incident should be at once seized on by honourable members opposite as an excuse for' charging honourable members on this side with opposing the Bill. Apparently nothing annoys honourable members opposite more than to find that honourable members on this side do not oppose measures of the kind. As a matter of fact, in regard to humanitarian measures, the initiative has been taken by the Liberal party, as was shown long before the Labour party came into office. Unfortunately, when honourable members on this side were in office, they had not the funds which the present Government have at their command; and it is a remarkable fact that the Government have been in office for three years before the by degrees, under the directions given by introduction of this Bill which they now bring forward on the eve of an election. question! merely mention this fact because an attempt has been made to misrepresent the honourable member for North Sydney, who simply pointed out that, as the Bill involves a burden on the whole of the taxpayers, every member of the community should have equal treatment in regard to employment in the Public Service. The suggestion for such a measure as this came from tbe Opposition side in a recent debate. There are at present something like 20,000 employees in the Public Service who are outside the jurisdiction of the Public Service Commissioner, and directly under the supervision and direction of Ministers. In regard to these employees, Ministerial patronage can be largely exercised, and the honourable member for North Sydney simply reminded us that, only quite recently, the Government, through some of the Ministerial heads of Departments, had issued orders that none but unionists were to be employed when available, and that, when men had to be discharged, ""non-unionists were to be the first discharged. As reported in Hansard, 1911, page 634, the honourable member for Ballarat asked the Prime MinisterWhether1. He will define the classes of Government consideration as taxpayers will be rigidly employee's within which members of unions will excluded. I am in full accord with the henceforward be given priority of appointment over all who are not unionists. To this the Prime Minister replied orable member connect this with the question before the Chair? referring to the defect in the Bill which the honourable member for North Sydney pointed out, namely, that while all taxpayers, whether unionists or non-unionists, had to contribute to this insurance, all had not equal opportunities for employment. To the question of the honourable member for Ballarat the Prime Minister repliedOther qualifications being equal, preference will be given in all cases. This shows that the honourable member for North Sydney was perfectly right in assuming that all taxpayers were not going to be treated alike under the Bill-that this was practically a measure which the Government intended should be for the benefit of unionists only. There is no doubt that, the Ministerial heads of Departments, non-unionists will be entirely excluded from the Public Service. I , for one, contend that the honourable member for North Sydney is quite right in insisting that no such conditions should attach to employment by the Commonwealth. If this measure is to prove one of equity and justice, we should insist upon equality of opportunity for employment, and see that preference is not given to one section of the community to the exclusion of all others. member confine himself to the question before the Chair? honourable member for Darling was allowed to roam "" all over the place "" just now. member for Darling, or any other honourable member, "" roamed all over the place,"" he was wrong, and I was wrong in allowing him to do so. The honourable member himself rriust not repeat that wrong-doing. thought the honourable member was wandering beyond the scope of the Bill.

The Honorary Minister is one who is always complaining because the Opposition will not vote against measures of this kind-because the Opposition will not give Government supporters platform material to enable them to pose as the only great saviours of mankind at the expense of those on this side. Honourable members opposite know that the ground is cut from under their feet by this lack of opposition. Tbe explanation, however, is that honourable members on this side have always been the initiators of such legislation-hav e always believed in humanitarian principles. Honourable members opposite have no right to claim that they, and they alone, are the "" pure merinoes "" of humanitarianism. and they cannot substantiate such a claini. The records of the party to which we belong show that, humanitarianism has been the keynote of Liberalism ever since Liberalism has existed. Honourable members opposite, who look vainly for opposition to measures of this kind from this side, should remember that fact, and they should not be so ready to twist any statement suggesting that such a measure can be improved as an evidence of hostility to its principle. That is a dog that will not fight. When the honourable member for North Svdney venturer! to point out what he considered a defect in the Bill, they at once attempted to fasten upon him the stigma of hostilitv to the principle of the measure, although he was at the time pleading for an extension of the principle. I agree with the honourable member, and with the honourable mpmber for Bendigo. that the Naval and Military servants of the Commonwealth should not have been excluded from the provisions of this Bill. compensation to them if ""they suffer from accidents in tbe course of their employment. is no such provision in the Bill. On the contrary, they are expresslv cut out. A reference is made in the Bill to public servants, whether employed at manual labour, clerical work, or otherwise, and the members of the Naval and Military Forces should, in my opinion, be included in the expression "" otherwise."" I am sorry that they should have been expressly excluded from the provisions of the Bill. pressly included in other legislation. be said of some other members of the Public Service that they are expressly provided for in other legislation, but there is no provision in that legislation for compensation for injury in the employment of the public in the manner provided for in this Bill. I hope that before the Bill finally passes Ministers will change their minds on this point, and will agree that what is wise, just, and humanitarian in the interests of ordinary public servants shall be considered equally so in the interests of those who are serving the Commonwealth no less effectually in the defence of the Empire. Their services are really the highest that could be rendered to the whole of the communitv in the protection of our vital interests, to protect us from invasion, and possibly from an evil which might render a measure, of this kind utterly abortive, by taking away the authority of our own Parliament, and substituting for it another authority under another flag. I was sorrv to hear the honourable member for Hindmarsh, in an otherwise admirable speech, make what I consider an entirely uncalled for aspersion upon the integrity of British and Australian Justices. History and experience show that British Courts of justice are the purest in the world. British justice has become a household word throughout the civilized world. It is a great tribute to British justice that western nations that are becoming Europeanized in their habits and customs are taking British jurisprudence as the pattern on which to mould their own judicial systems. I think the honourable member for Hindmarsh might very well have omitted his aspersion upon British and Australian Judges. It would appear that in the minds of certain honourable members the Justices of the High Court and superior Courts of Australia are always associated with the Conservative element in the community, and there is an assumption that they are always against the working classes. I do not think that that is borne out by our experience of them.

He merely said, as was stated earlier in the afternoon by the honourable member for Angas, in his interesting speech, that the development of social justice was exceedingly slow, and that it was a matter for congratulation that, at least, it was sure. 1 do not propose to follow the lines of the honourable member for Angas, who gave us what I might call a very interesting lecture on this subject. Indeed, I almost felt myself back again in the less congenial atmosphere of the lecture-room when I heard him developing the doctrine of common employment, volenti non fit injuria and so forth. It is worth remarking that this Workman's Compensation Bill, upon which I heartily congratulate the Government, represents a very interesting and important evolution of thought, and the improved attitude of men towards their fellowmen in the industrial world.

Another phase is that class of legislation which very rightly limits the power of the workman to put himself in a position where he may be exploited by those to whom has been given the power1 do not say always the will-to exploit him. We pass on very tardily to that stage where we saw placed upon the Imperial statute book the Employers Liability Act-a n Act which, unfortunately, as has been pointed out during this debate, was hedged about with so many difficulties and technicalities, and was limited in so many ways, as to render it, in a great measure, useless for the purpose for which it was designed. Then, so far as Victoria is concerned, we come to the painful series of efforts which have been made by the State Parliament to place upon the statute-book a Workmen's Compensation Act. have been told in this Chamber to-day that this is not a party question. I have no. desire to make it a party question, in so far as to suggest that any member of the Opposition is opposed to the principle of the Bill. when I say that if it is not a party question here, it has been throughout its long history a class questiona class warfare in which we have always had on the potent side those who have endeavoured, not only to assert their rights, but to maintain them to the disadvantage of those whom they employ. It is to the discredit of this State, which is the most important and picturesque State in the Unionloveth he chasteneth, and although I love this State, I must chastise it, for in this respect it is one of the most backward in the Union. the most backward communities in the world. a Labour party in power in the Old Country, the Parliament of Great Britain has, at least, passed a measure on these lines, and has thus set an example which Victoria ought long ago to have followed. I wish to refer, with the indulgence of the House, to the position in this State to-day, because, although, I believe, there is at present a measure before the State Parliament, we do not know what will be its, perhaps, unThat is the happy fate before it is finally dealt with. I wish to refer to the existing position as to the liability of an employer to his employee"" in respect of compensation or damages. It is very shortly summed up in the Victorian Employers and Employes Act of 1890. I ask the House to note the circumstances under which an employee, under the Victorian law, may obtain compensation for accidents suffered in carrying out the work of his employer, and to note the limitations and the restrictions that are placed on that right. It is provided thatWhere, after the commencement of this Act, personal injury is caused to a workman1. By reason of any defect in the state or condition of the ways, works, machinery, or plant connected with or used in the business of the employer; or 2. By reason of the negligence of any person in the service of the employer who has any superintendence intrusted to him, whilst in the Honourable members exercise of such superintendence j or 3. By reason of the negligence of any person in the service of the employer to whose orders or directions the workman, at the time of the injury, was bound to conform, and did conform, where such injury resulted from his having so conformed; or 4. By reason of the act or omission of any I do not say more than the truth person in the service of the employer, done or made in obedience to the rules or by-laws of the employer, or in obedience to particular instructions given by any person delegated witli the authority of the employer in that behalf; or 5reason of the negligence of any peTson in the service of the employer who has the charge or control of any signal points locomotive engine or train upon a railwaythe workman, or, in case the injury results in death, the legal personal representatives of the workman, and any persons entitled in case of death, shall have the same right of compensation and remedies against the employer as if the workman had not been a workman of, nor in the service of the employer, nor engaged in his work. I do not expect honourable members to follow the legal significance of those words. It is sufficient to say that it is our bitter experience in Victoria that almost every line of those sub-sections is fraught with difficulties and filled with dangerous pitfalls to the workman who tries, under them, to prosecute a claim in the Courts. They are, moreover, subject to these limitationsA workman shajl not be entitled, under this part of this Act, to any right of compensation or remedy against the employer in any of the following cases (that is to say) :1. Under sub-section 1 of the last preceding section, unless the defect therein mentioned arose from, or had not been discovered or remedied owing to the negligence of the employer,",54,Commonwealth Workmen S Compensation Bill Second Reading

360,Mr Brennan,"Although there is not-r of seme person in the service of the employer, and intrusted by him with the duty of seeing that tbe ways, works, machinery, or plant were in proper condilion. An employee"" may be injured while carrying out the work of his employer, but he cannot recover compensation where the defect in the machinery or plant had not been discovered owing to the negligence of the employer or an employg. AgainUnder sub-section 4 of the last preceding sectice. tion, unless the injuries resulted fio m some impropriety or drfect in the rules, by-laws, or instructions therein mentioned a very difficult matter to prove, and, finallyin any case where the workman knew of the defect or negligence which -caused his injury, and failed within a reasonable time to give, or cause to be given, information thereof. Thus a workman may know of a defect, and, because he fails to give information of it, he loses his right to sue. That is a fairly common occurrence. who knows of a defect abstains from making any complaint, because he recognises that it will probably result in his dismissal. The Bill has my hearty approval, because it is admeasure which is designed to grant compensation to injured workmen free from those legal difficulties and pitfalls of which we have had experience under Victorian legislation, and notably in respect of the provision for giving notice. The Bill under consideration is exceedingly liberal in that regard. The provision in respect of giving notice under the Victorian law readsAn action for the recovery under this part of this Act of compensation for an injury shall not be maintainable unless notice in writing that injury has been sustained is given within three months, and tbe action -is commenced within sis months from the occurrence of the accident causing the injury, or, in case of death, within twelve months from the time of death. vided always that, in case of death, the want of such notice shall be no bar to the maintenance of such action if the Judge shall be of opinion that there was reasonable excuse for want of such notice. In my view, it is wrong to embody in a Statute an arbitrary provision as to notice, which absolutely bars the possibility of a person recovering compensation unless he gives notice within the prescribed time. Many cases have been lost through an informal notice or allowing that limited time to pass by-notabl y under the Railways Act. In the case of our Local Government Acts, [176] the notice is very much shorter. Although in. this Bill provision is made for giving notice, a very wise discretion is allowed so as to make it almost impossible for any person injured to lose his right merely because he has not given formal notice in duetime. of technicalities to defeat the ends of jus' den of proof will have to be thrown, not on the workmen, but on somebody else. I do not wholly agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh when he says that the Courts decide against the interests of the workers. We have to bear in mind that the measures upon which our Courts adjudicate are nearly always passed in an atmosphere of party politics. When our Judges come to determine the rights of individuals, they are necessarily bound by A workman the strict letter of the law. I hope' I shall never advocate that they shall go outside the strict letter of the law except in cases where, as in our Conciliation and Arbitration Act, they are empowered to do so. thinks that Parliament is more to blame than are our-Judges? able member has put the matter more succinctly than I could have done. 1 did not like to put it so bluntly. Where compensation under a Bill of this description is payable, subject to conditions and exceptions, the danger is always presentseeing that the nature of accidents varies so much-that some accidents may fall outside its provisions. That is one of the reasons why so many of these cases fail when they come up for determination by Prothe Courts. Any other remarks which I may have to make upon the Bill will be reserved for its Committee stage. 1 congratulate the Government upon its introduction. Whatever pious desires other Ministries may have had in respect 'to its sub-""ject-matter, it will .stand to the credit of the Government that in this Bill they have crystallized their own views, and have placed the measure upon our statute-book.
