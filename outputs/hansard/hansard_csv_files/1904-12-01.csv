From ten minutes to two hours, according to the nature and complexity of the specifications. 2. Three hundred and fifty-five. 3. A monthly Gazette is already issued, containing all the information mentioned in this question, with the exception of the rulings and decisions. To publish the Commissioner's rulings in regard to each application would not only create a large amount of extra work, but would be the means of making public many matters which concern the Crown and the inventor alone, and which may ultimately be used to the detriment of the inventor. The Crown undertakes to preserve inviolate the secrets of the inventor, and any disclosure by it of the result of the examination of a provisional specification, and ruling connected therewith, would destroy the whole object and intention of the Legislature. The propriety of publishing all decisions of general public interest, W h e n is the Postand which do not disclose inventors' secrets, will be considered. The practice of the Patent Office can be gathered from Statutory Rules, 1904, No. 70. It is intended to issue a weekly Gazette as soon as possible. The trouble ORDER OF BUSINESS.

I trust that in fairness to honourable members who have private business on the notice-paper, the Government proposal will be rejected^ Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) I think the action of the Prime Minister is scarcely warranted at this stage, especially in view of the importance of the business which is on the notice-paper for consideration today. with a matter which I regard as of the utmost importance, namely, the introduction of Chinese into .South Africa. out before?

I would ask whether the motion is not one affecting certain private members' business on the notice paper for to-dav, and nothing else? under discussion relates to the order of business, and as the business on the notice paper for to-day includes the motion standing in the name of the honourable and learned member for Bailarat, relating to preferential trade, and also the Manufactures Encouragement B ill , the question before the Chair distinctly concerns.the order in which those matters should be discussed. Sir WILLIAM LYNE phasize the point raised by the honourable member for Kennedy to the effect that the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is not a Government measure. private measure. The Prime Minister desires to postpone private members' business to-day, and yet to-morrow he proposes to afford the honourable member for Eden Monaro an opportunity of proceeding with the Manufactures Encouragement B ill . He has also intimated that Tuesday next will be devoted to a discussion of the question of Preferential Trade, which will be initiated upon a motion by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat. I should like to know what chance the Manufactures ""Encouragement Bill has of receiving fair consideration if it is to be finally dealt with to-morrow? It has absolutely no chance whatever. We all recognise that even if the debate upon it in Committee is very limited, its consideration must occupy at least two or three days. The leader of the Government himself admits that the discussion of the question of Preferential Trade-if it is to be pushed to a divisionwould absorb quite a month. What is the meaning of all these statements? viously, they mean that neither of the subjects to which I have referred will be finally disposed of. The action of the right honourable gentleman is prompted by a desire to delay the consideration of certain business which appears upon the notice-paper. He has no intention whatever of finally dealing before the prorogation of Parliament with either of the two important matters mentioned. Prime Minister gave notice of this motion last evening I assumed that his intention was to devote to the consideration of Government business, the time which is usually I must rise to a point of allotted to private members, and in view of I do not mind this discussion, exthe general desire to get into recess, I felt disposed to support him. It now appears, however, that he proposes to' rob private members generally of the few hours in the remainder of the session, which could be devoted to a consideration of their business, and, at the same time,/to set'apart two days to enable two Government supporters to bring forward matters in which they are specially interested. It seems to me that such a proposal cannot be in any way justified. Why should certain honourable members be afforded privileges which are denied to others? Had the Prime Minister proposed to take the time which is ordinarily I desire to emallotted to private members' business, and devote it to the transaction of Government! business, I should have raised no objection. What a farce it is to talk about setting toI t is distinctly a morrow apart for the consideration of the Manufactures Encouragement B ill , with a view to finally passing that measure! The Prime Minister knows very well that there is no prospect whatever of its being finally dealt with to-morrow. about for three years. the Prime Minister is not hopeful that it will be put through all its stages to-morrow. Further, the right honourable gentleman proposes to devote only one day to the consideration of Preferential Trade, which is an Empire question. devoting one day to its consideration. I merely stated that the motion dealing with it would be submitted upon Tuesday next. disposed of that day Obgentleman proposes to take away the time which should be devoted to the consideration of other private members' business, in order to confer a favour upon the honourable and learned member for Ballarat, and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro.

It is essential to the good government of this country that every honourable member should have a chance of voicing his opinion upon Preferential Trade now, rather than wait until after Parliament re-assembles next year.

The private members' business set down for consideration today is not of a very important character; but that, of course, is a matter of opinion. The Prime Minister pointed out that it would be more desirable to proceed with the consideration of business such as the Manufactures Encouragement B ill , which might be productive of some good result, than to discuss mere abstract questions. I admit that that is open to argument, but I regret -to find that there are honourable members in this House who disagree with my contention that it is better that we should attempt to pass measures, from which we can obtain some tangible result, than to devote time to the discussion of abstract questions. At the close of a session., there is, as a rule, a certain degree of consideration extended to a Government. Honourable members usually defer the consideration of mere abstract motions until proposals likely to produce some result have been dealt with. In making the statement as to the time to be given to private members' business, I do not think that the Prime Minister intended to suggest that he would merely set apart to-morrow for the consideration of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. said. consideration of the Bill would be resumed to-morrow, but I certainly did not say that In I, would set apart only the one day for its consideration. Those words were put into my mouth. Sir WILLIAM LYNE No . the Prime Minister expressed the hope that honourable members would see that as we I have very were apparently approaching the close of the session, it was desirable to forego the consideration of notices of motion set down for to-day, none of which could lead to any very important result. He said that if we adopted that course we should be able to conclude the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill this evening, and that to-morrow we should be able to deal with the question of Preferential Trade or the Manufactures Encouragement B ill . I have no desire to discuss Preferential Trade further than to say that I am a supI underporter of it ; but there can be no question that we can pass the Manufactures Encouragement Bill this session if honourable time that would in ordinary members really desire to see it carried into law. to-morrow. phase of the question will not be considered to-morrow. Why did not the honourable member interject in this impatient way when others were attacking me? attack the honourable member. honourable member must occasionally suffer from deafness. We have been told that it is all very well to allow the Government to go into recess and come in with the rising tide next session. But so far as the people are concerned, it is immaterial who is on the top of the tide. Is not the passing of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill of more consequence than is any question as to fhe leadership of the House? able member take that Bill out of the hands of the honourable member for Hume? already threshed out that matter.

I do not know that the honourable member has anyheaven-born right to take charge of such a measure. whatever to do with the motion before the Chair. to be led away by interjections suggested by others, who would show to better advantage if they were prepared to make them themselves. It is interesting to observe certain honorablte members making bullets, and getting others to fire them.

I hope I do not misunderstand the Prime Minister. I take it that he considers we should have reasonable time to discuss the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. We know, of course, that if honourable members are determined to block the passing of that Bill merely because a private member happens to have charge of it, and thai the right honourable member for East Sydney is the leader of the Government, -they can do so. If that is the spirit which animates them, it is certainly desirably that we should have a dissolution rather than a prorogation. Those who, like me, are earnestly in favour of the Manufactures Encouragement B ill , will appeal to the Prime Minister not to withdraw his motion. does not facilitate the consideration of the business of which he is in charge by blocking another honourable member. blocking? is preventing others from proceeding with private business on the notice-paper. have private business set down for consideration to-day may proceed with it if they are anxious to ""do so. I should not have objected to the withdrawal of the motion had I not been attacked by the Opposition. No honourable member may attack me with impunity. I am quite prepared to answer in this House and out of it for any action I have taken. There is no reason why the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill should be delayed. If we postponed private members' business set down for consideration to-day, we should have an opportunity to deal with that measure as -well as the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. Honoijable members have publicly pledged themselves to abide by the decision of the House on the subject of bonuses, and therefore, they should take the opinion of the majority as soon as possible, in order that we may know what is to be done, and not continue to gull the people by pretending to do what we do not intend to do.

We have been sitting for nearly ten months, and 1 think that the honourable member for Moira rightly complains of the great length of our sessions. Something will have to be done with a strong hand to shorten the duration of our sessions. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie told the honourable member for Moira that 'he could leave Parliament if he did not care to attend our long sittings. I would suggest that there is another alternative, namely, that honourable members may remain in parliamentary life and still be able to give some time to their private business. I think that one of the most urgent reforms we require is the curtailment of the length of our sessions. were shown in this direction, we should do better work, and more of it. But honourable members opposite are not ptepared to do what is customary towards the close of the session. They refuse to give the Government the sole control of the time of the House. So far as I am aware, that courtesy has never previously been refused to any Government by any Pailiament in the Commonwealth. I admit that the members of the Opposition subscribe to none of the ordinary customs of parliamentary government. They are establishing precedents of a most objectionable character, and I appeal to them to allow the Government to. devote the time which still remains to us during the current session to the consideration of important public business. amusing to honourable members upon this side of the House to be called upon to listen to gratuitous lectures by the honourable member for Parramatta. that the question before the Chair is not one relating to lectures by private members. It is a proposal that Government business shall take precedence of private members' business this afternoon. and I merely desired to make incidental reference to the honourable member for Parramatta. He has taken a strictly partisan view of this question. If the Government honestly desired to devote this afternoon to the consideration of the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill , I should raise no objection to their action. As a matter of fact, however, the course which they propose to adopt is prompted only by a wish to placate one or two of their supporters by enabling them to discuss subjects in which they are interested, notwithstanding that those discussions must be barren of results, so f ar as the present session is concerned. I venture to say that no precedent can be found for handing over to the control of a private member such a measure as the Manufactures Encouragement Bill. The honourable member for Parramatta knows perfectly well that to exhaustively discuss the question of Preferential Trade would occupy a very considerable time. I recognise that the period which is ordinarily allotted to private members on Thursday afternoon has almost passed. That fact may be attributed to the speech delivered by the honourable member for Moira, who If a strong determination is always anxious to dictate to the Opposition. In his remarks this afternoon that honourable member again hinted-jus t as did the honourable member for Parramatta-that the Prime Minister will have to exhibit more backbone in the conduct of public business. I wish to remind those honourable members of the fact that the members of the Opposition possess some rights. We are expected to discharge the duties which attach to a responsible Opposition. The attitude we have adopted this afternoon is not prompted by a desire to delay the passing of the Manufactures Encouragement B ill, but by a wish to see equality of treatment extended to every honourable member. Eveni f the Manufactures Encouragement Bill were finally dealt with to-morrow, it could not be put into operation unless the Government were prepared to guarantee that the money necessary for that purpose will be forthcoming.

Motion, by leave, withdrawn. I move That an humble Address be presented To His Majesty as follows :MAV IT PLEASE YOUR MAJESTY : We, Your Majesty's dutifu l and loyal subjects, the members of the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth of Australia in Parliament assembled, desire most earnestly in our name and on behalt of the people whom we represent, to express our unswerving loyalty and devotion to Your Majesty's person and Government. We have observed, with feelings of profound satisfaction, the evidence afforded by the recent speeches from the Throne, and debates thereon in the House of Lords and Commons of the United Kingdom, and also from Your Most Gracious Majesty's recent visits to Ireland, of a sincere desire on all sides to usher in a new era of lasting peace -and goodwill in Ireland, and this House congratulates the mother country on the just and equitable legislation recently passed on the land and education questions, and hopes for an early and lasting settlement of the troublesome problem of the government of Ireland, which has taxed the powers of British statesmen for so long. Enjoying and appreciating, as we do, the blessings of self-government here, we would humbly express the hope that a just measure of Home Rule will be granted to the people of Ireland. We would point out that land purchase was half of the proposed settlement of Ireland's difficulties in 1881, and that recently Your Majesty's advisers saw fit to pass a liberal measure of land purchase, thus removing the great hindrance to Home Rule. We desire to point to our own experience, and to emphasize the blessings which accrue to this Commonwealth from the Federal system of Home Rule, under which our people live, and the benefits in which the people of"" Australia, with their fellow citizens and subjects of the Dominion of Canada, rejoice. This extended experience which Your Most Gracious Majesty's subjects have had of the inestimable benefits resulting from self government being bestowed on the Australian States and Commonwealth, only intensifies their desire to affirm through their representatives in Parliament the sentiment that nothing could give more solidarity to the Empire over which Your Most Gracious Majesty rules than a liberal measure of Federal Home Rule being granted to the people of Ireland. It is scarcely fair to expect me to deal with this subject in the brief period at my disI f I am assured that posal, and consequently I think that the House might grant me its indulgence by allowing me to continue my remarks upon He does. a future occasion. this motion-the object of it-is His Most Gracious Majesty the King. I do not wish to approach so exalted a ruler in any way as a matter of form, but rather from genuine and sincere feeling, which will be shared by those who are most interested in this question, namely, the Irish people. That they entertain a profound respect and reverence for H is Majesty the King has been demonstrated again and again. Upon the other hand, His Majesty has shown his high appreciation of the Irish character. I may be told that it is not desirable that we should discuss Imperial politics, because our action may provoke interference by the Imperial authorities with Australian politics. ties have already interfered in Australianmatters. tion raised to a proposal to approach the Imperial Parliament, even through the person of His Majesty. But I would point out that a precedent has already been established in that connection. Australia was called upon to interfere in a matter of I m perial concern in connection with the recent South African Avar. Upon that occasion we did our best to assist the British Government. I attribute to these who were enthusiastically in favour of that war only the very best intentions. Surely, if a dependency of Great Britain may interfere with Imperial politics, to make war, to spread desolation and carnage in any part of His Majesty's dominions, it is our inalienable right to interfere, with a view of making peace, and spreading 1 good-will and happiness throughout the land. That is the object I have in view in submitting this motion. Australians will certainly throw more enthusiasm into a proposal of this kind than they could be expected to display in supporting any pro-, position to make war. This is a message of peace; it is a proposal to make a reality of a union which exists only onpaper. It is a proposal to bring about a union of hearts, and that being so, I feel that if we have ever shown any enthusiasm for the welfare of the Empire in relation",25,Provisional Patent Application S

It makes for righteousness, peace, and goodwill in His Majesty's dominions. Ireland hold a contrary opinion. minority prepared to oppose any proposal. Sometimes it is large, and sometimes small. large one. that in this case the minority is something like one in twenty-eight. The only province of Ireland in which there is any opposition to Home Rule, is that of Ulster. But, even in Protestant Ulster, something like 80 or 90 per cent, of the people believe in the principle. majority of members returned by that so called anti-Irish province are in favour of Home Rule, proves that its population must consist of a very large percentage of persons who are in favour of the principle. In the southern parts of Ireland the people are unanimously in favour of it, so that the minority is a miserable _ one, utterly unworthy of consideration. may say that it is a miserable one, but he will find that it is fairly active. stitute it lack in numbers they generally make up in noise. discover that, so far as their activity is concerned, they cannot be spoken of as a miserable minority. is a very 'fair representative of the class for which he speaks. This opposition reminds me of one of those little insects that make a noise by the river side, while the big stream flows steadily on. Ever since I have known anything about politics, the people of Ireland have spoken with one voice, and with great fervour, in favour of Home Rule. There can be no mistake as to its being a thoroughly democratic proposal. If the people of Scotland/ had asked for Home Rule with the same unanimity as have the people of Ireland, their prayer would have been granted long ago. Coming more closely to the terms of my motion, I would remind the House that the demand for Home Rule is now being received with a better spirit by the people of England. That better feeling has been largely due to the action of His Majesty the King, who, within the last two years, paid a most successful visit to Ireland. This was the first Royal visit almost since the time of George IV . , and it seems to me that it ushered in a new-era, in which a better feeling is likely to arise between the people of Ireland and the rest of the Empire. His Majesty's visit has demonstrated beyond doubt that the people of Ireland are at In this case, it is a very heart most loyal and enthusiastic. The suspicion caused by class and party feeling I was about to say in the old country has alone been responsible for anything in the shape of doubt as to the loyalty of Ireland. Loyalty is often a term applied to a kind of affection for the reigning monarch, but in its truer sense it has to do with devotion to law. In that respect I claim that there is no The fact that the vast reproach upon the people of Ireland. A nation has a right to protest against bad laws, and to resort to constitutional means of righting them, and I contend that the loyalty of Ireland is loyalty in the best and highest sense. Loyalty is' shown to the King as the head and embodiment of the law. But the devotion of the people of Ireland to the law itself, in the abstract, has never been doubted. If we turn to the records of crime, we find that the Irish are perhaps the most law-abiding people in the world. There is no other country where serious crimes are less prevalent, and even in the matter of political crimes, which in many cases have been manufactured, Ireland bears favorable comparison with Australia, which has a very good record. As Mr Gladstone pointed out in his great Home Rule speech, from 1832 to the passing of the Reform Bill there was no Crimes Act in force, with the result that there was no crime. After that, however, Crimes Acts were continuously in operation. There was special legislation for the suppression of crime, and, in consequence, it increased. We have to face the great historical fact that coercion by special legislation invariably produces crime, whereas ordinary laws either suppress or keep it under control. That has been the history of Ireland. Coercion Bills have bred crime. I belong to a people who are perhaps the most law-abiding in the world. They are reputed to keep the Sabbath Day, and everything else on which they can lay their hands, but as the result of special legislation passed in connection with the Crofters-legislatio n similar to that applied to Ireland-crim e became rampant among",26,Homerule For Ireland

I paid my income tax. we gained was responsibility for costs. the honourable member for Maranoa has paid his income tax, and I hope that all honourable members will do so. which two honourable members, acting on behalf of all the members of this House, took upon themselves the responsibility of appealing against the judgment of the Victorian Court. In stating the decision of the High Court, the Chief Justice of Australia said, amongst other thingsAccording to the Constitution, the salary of the seriously interfered with. If the ConstituGovernor-General might not be altered, and if the tion is at fault in' that regard, we can hardly Federal Parliament attempted to impose an inblame the High Court for interpreting it, come tax of 2s. on it, the effective salary would be reduced by 10 per cent., whether deducted or ourselves for acting under it. first or collected afterwards. That is a self-evident fact. If the Constitution is at fault, I do not think either the High Court or this Parliament should be blamed. The fact remains that if income tax is levied upon salaries fixed by the Constitution, they are reduced by the amount of the tax, and consequently there is an invasion of the Constitution whenever such a tax is levied. that the tax under considerationwas in substance, if valid, both a tax on the income of the appellants and a diminution of that income. The next question was whether such an the honourable member, although competent imposition or diminution made by the authority to speak on so many subjects, is competent of the State would, if valid, fetter, control, or to act as the Speaker of this House. If interfere with the free exercise of the legislative or executive power of the Commonwealth. The Court held that that question seemed to to bow to his ruling and to that of the supply its own answer. That answer is honourable member. I do not, however, revery obvious. If the States have the power gard these quotations as irrelevant. to tax Federal officers, they have the power to seriously interfere with the agencies and instrumentalities of the Commonwealth. We know that the States would not so interfere intentionally, but their desire is that merely informing honourable members as to all Federal officers shall-as in equity we the reasons for the decision of the Court, all admit they should-be subject to the so that they may be fully seized of the facts same taxation as the rest of the community. before dealing with the question at issue.

As representative of all j Federal agencies, resist the Federal authority within its borders. That was one I hope that my of the reasons of fhe High Court for upholding the appeal. As the Chief Justice further pointed outIn the case of the Commonwealth, the argument for the destruction of uniformity of compensation had especial force, when it was remembered lhat the income taxes in the several States were unequal in their incidence. In order, therefore, lo give effect to the provisions of the Federal laws regulating the salaries of officers, it would be necessary to make special provisions for adjusting their incomes when transferred. I am glad to hear that State taxation of Federal salaries was open to two objections-(1 ) In effect, it diminished the recompense allotted by the Commonwealth to its officers, and so interfered with its agencies; and (2) it interfered with the freedom of action of the Commonwealth in the transfer of its officers The case was one in from State to State, except at the risk of doing them an injustice, only to be remedied by the appropriation of Federal revenue for the purpose. The second point made by the Court is that, owing to the fact that the income taxation levied by the States is not uniform, the freedom of the Commonwealth to transfer its servants from one State to another is very with the motion? with the motion, which affirms the desirability of passing a short Bill to impose a Federal income tax, to apply to all persons in the Commonwealth who, by the decision of the High Court, escaj>e the payment of State income tax. question the judgment of the High Court.

A number of honourable members felt that any tax of thaL character which might be payable by them was legitimately due to the State to which they belong. Privately I made strong representations to the Victorian GovernmentI regret to say without availthat any levy should be limited to the Federal representatives of Victoria. was that incident which first provoked the feeling antagonistic to this tax. next place the attempt to collect taxation upon fhe salaries representatives in itself raised a constitutional attempt extended to salaries payable to the whole of -the representatives of the Commonwealth, it raised a veryserious question, of which, so far, no adequate appreciation has been evidenced in the columns of the press. aware, it has not been observed that the [REPRESENTATIVES.] Federal Agencies. very principle at stake in the endeavour to levy income tax upon the salaries payable to Federal officers is identical with that involved in the effort made in this Parliament to control the public servants of the States. It is the In conclusion, I should like to same principle inverted. I am aware .hat there are honourable members who maintain that the express language of the Constitution separates the case of the public serWe may all do that, vants of the States from any general prindeal of ciple. But, putting that technical contention upon one side, every one will admit that the Federal principle, that the spheres of action of the Commonwealth and the States should be preserved distinct-as was laid down by Chief Justice Marshall-the principle which forbade the Commonwealth to tax the servants of the Slates equally forbade the States to tax the servants of the Commonwealth. Consequently, we find thai critics outside, who were violently in favour of that principle when the question of interference with the public servants of ths States was involved, denounce it most severely when it is applied to Federal servants. When the question at issue' was whether the Federation could impose any burden upon the States, they were strong in their determination to stand by the Constitution, but when the question involved is whether the States can impose burdens upon Commonwealth officers, they adopt an opposite attitude. I maintain that if they accept the one application of the principle they must accept the other. Under the feeling which was generated in consequence of the attempt to tax representatives outside of Victoria, it was thought necessary that two members of this Parliament, on behalf of all the public servants of theCommonwealthwhether in the Legislature or elsewhere, for we are all public servants-shoul d be selected as defendants in order that test cases might be submitted to the Court. As ItI was Attorney-General at the time, I could not refuse to allow myself to be nominated In the as one of the defendants, although, as a matter of fact , I have always, under protest, 1 of Victorian paid income tax to Victoria.

By the decision of the High Court we have demonstrated our rights as citizens of the Commonwealth, and it now remains for us as citizens of the States to do our duties to the States to which we belong. Mr G. B. EDWARD S (South Sydney). I believe that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat has correctly laid down the constitutional position. I felt from the first that the decision of the High Court was the only possible one; but the solution which the honourable and learned member has suggested is to my mind impracticable. Although we have established a sound constitutional principle, we are face to face with the fact that it has given rise to a feeling of injustice among the citizens of the several States. I shall not occupy the time of the House by dealing with t'his matter, as I might have done earlier in the session; but I should best express my view of what is the only solution of the difficulty by movingThat all the words after the word "" Commonwealth,"" line 6, be left out. I think that the only solution of the difficulty is that the Federal Parliament should collect the income tax. My experience is that such a tax is fraught with great evils, more particularly in the smaller States. Taxation of this kind would be far better in the hands of the Commonwealth than in the hands of a State. In the little island State of Tasmania several attempts were made to impose an income tax, but they had to be abandoned, because of the inquisitorial nature of such a tax when applied to a small community. Even in New South Wales, the tax has given rise to trouble, owing to the fact that it leads to the undue disclosure of private business matters. MrM c LEAN (Gippsland-Minister of Trade and Customs) I may mention for the information of the House that this question has been considered on several occasions by the Cabinet. We are f u l ly impressed with the desirableness of the public servants of the Commonwealth bearing their fair share of the responsibilities of citizenship ; but I can assure honourable members that it is extremely difficult to determine the It must be best method of giving effect to our wishes. There are constitutional difficulties in the way, and we have also to face difficulties in regard to distribution, as well as the fact for the that there is no uniform income tax in operaJustice demands that tion. The Government, however, are determined to devise the best means possible, and as soon as they arrive at what they believe to be a fair solution of the difficulty, they will submit their proposals to Parliament. If we are unable to deal with the matter before the close of the'session, that need not necessarily prevent Parliament from making any future legislation retrospective, so .that no one shall be able to escape any portion of a charge that can be legitimately levied upon him. journed.

I would point out, in the first place, that a combination such as is alleged to exist in the tobacco industry is not necessarily improper. During the past nine months we have heard in this Chamber an enthusiastic advocacy of combinations of workmen and employees generally, and if such combinations be justifiable, surely combinations of employers and manufacturers are also justifiable. Combination is hurtf u l only when it uses power and influence for unworthy ends, such as to gain profit by increasing prices and lowering the quality of the article it sells, by reducing wages, or by harassing the public, or interfering with the public health and comfort in other ways. Before we should be asked to take the tobacco industry under Government control, some more substantial reasons must be given than the alleged fact that a combination is now controlling that industry. The fact",35,State Taxation Of Federa L Agencies

329,Mr Robinson (Wannon),"It hasthat certain persons in the tobacco trade have come to an understanding as to the prices at which they shall sell tobacco is not in itself a sufficient reason why the Commonwealth should take over the manufacture, importation, and sale of that article in Australia. I believe in the Government control of railways, waterworks, and other public services in regard to which, from the nature of things, competition cannot exist, and should therefore be under the control of the State. the production and manufacture of articles of food, clothing, and consumption generally, does not exclude competition, and therefore Government control is unnecessary and undesirable except in the last resort. The manufacture and sale of tobacco is not prima facie a subject for Government enterprise, because tobacco being an article which can be readily produced, imported, and sold, the industry gives scope for competition, and is primarily a subject for private enterprise. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, and another representative of Western Australia, have quoted the example of the Republic of France in support of their contention that the Commonwealth should take control of the tobacco industry, but an investigation of the facts gives very strong reasons why we should not follow that example. French tobacco is notoriously the worse in the world, and English and American travellers on the Continent invariably take their own supplies of tobacco with them, to avoid having to smoke such a filthy and dirty compound. In support of what I have said about the character of French tobacco, let me quote from a book called The Soverane Herb, a history of tobacco, by W. A. Penn, published in 1901, in which, on pages 202 and 203, he saysCigarette factories are situated at Paris, Bordeaux, Marseilles, Mortaix, Nancy, Nantes, and Toulon, The tobacco, which has been aptly described as consisting of scorched linen flavoured with assafcetida and glue, is very coarsely cut, more so than for the pipe in England, and is very dark. The resultant cigarette is indescribably horrible. English smokers fail to recognise it as tobacco. Yet of these cigarettes France smokes some 300,000 millions a year; in any form but that of the cigarette it would be intolerable. An Englishman will face unmoved the armies of France or the howlings of her mobs, but from the cigarette he flies apace. In the Paris Figaro, a year ago, "" Nestor"" recounted his success with this horrible weapon. ""There are still too many Englishmen in Monte Carlo. Still, during my trip I had the pleasure of making one old Englishman's life a misery to him by smoking him out, with my strong French cigarettes, from the railway compartment in which he sat with me. He ' l e f t the carriage half asphyxiated at Lyons, and I felt that Fashoda was, at any rate, partially avenged. Childish, no doubt, but one must do what one can."" Childish it was not, most certainly; France has no more terrible weapon than her cigarette. I will quote next from a paper called The Traveller, wherein it is stated thatOne of the greatest grievances of a traveller is to be deprived of his favourite brand of cigar'ette. A few years ago Foreign Governments But were very unreasonable on this point. Wherever you went you had to be content with the oroductioiis of the national regio-somethin g b'ack and strong-, which spluttered with saltpetre as you smoked. At last the French Government has admitted Egyptian cigarettes. Tobacco, a monthly journal published at Liverpool, says on the same subjectAs is well known, the products of the State monopoly of France, with the exception of its higher priced cigarettes and smoking tobaccos, are hopelessly inferior. French cigars of domestic manufacture are the worse in Europe-thos e of Italy alone excepted. The truth appears to be that tobacco manufacture in France has gotten into a rut, and there is not a man in the Republic who is strong enough to pull it out. For so rich a country as France, its Stale monopoly in tobacco is but a poor revenue producer. I would remind honourable members that in Italy, as well as in France, the manufacture of tobacco is a State monopoly. So much for the quality of the article manufactured under State control. Let me now give honourable members the reasons why the manufacture of tobacco was made a State monopoly in France. Louis XIV . , about the year 1674, was the first to establish a tobacco monopoly in France, but when the first free Parliament, which the French had had for about 200 years met, it at once abolished that monopoly, it was so seized of. its defects. The monopoly was re-established in 1810 by Napoleon Bonaparte, purely for political reasons. As honourable members know, he was the author of that bureaucratic system of Government which is carried to a further extent in France than anywhere else in the world, and under which as much power as possible is concentrated in the hands of the Ministry of the day. All who vend tobacco in France have to obtain licences from the Minister of the Interior, who has thus placed in his hands a patronage which is used for political purposes, with similar results to those which flow from the "" spoils to the victors "" system of the United States of America -the friends of the Government are those who are most likely to obtain licences, just as in America the friends of the successful political party are those most likely to obtain billets. Australia. In Victoria we have, time and again, seen a distinct pandering to one section of Government employees. That would be aggravated if another large body of workmen were placed under Government control. -regard to the granting of licences of every description? . industry were made a Commonwealth monopoly, every person engaged in the manufacture of tobacco, and in the wholesale and retail houses which now manage the tobaccotrade, would become a Government employee, which would put an amount of patronage into the hands of the Government of the day which I think would be harmful to the public interest. honourable member for saying that in France the monopoly was established for political purposes ? France by Napoleon, whose desire was to obtain as firm a grip as possible on every detail of administration, and to centralize, as much power as possible in the Government. Probably, he also desired to obtain revenue. But what weighed more with him than any other consideration, as a study of his life and character will show, was his desire for unlimited power. I wish now to discuss the proposal of the honourable member from the point of view of the States. We have just had a debate on the effect of the decision of the High Court in regard to the non-liability of Federal officers for income tax taxation, and the injury thereby caused to the States. We are required by the Constitution to return at least three-fourths of the Customs and excise revenue collected until 1911. If the control of the importation and manufacture of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes is taken over by the Commonwealth, the revenue collected upon those articles would not be returnable to the States, but ,would be entirely at the disposal of the Commonwealth Government. Thus great injury would be done to the States. In order to enable honourable members to appreciate the great importance of this industry, I would point out that tobacco, next to stimulants, is the most prolific item in the Tariff. furnished at my request by the Collector of Customs in Victoria, I find that in 1903 the revenue collected from the duties upon tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes imported and manufactured in the Commonwealth It might apply here. amounted to £1,370,000. In New South Wales£ 5 9 5 , 0 0 0 was collected ; in Victoria, £ 4 0 0 , 0 0 0 ; in Queensland, £1.28,000; in South Australia, £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 ; in Western Australia. £ 1 3 0 , 0 0 0 ; and in Tasmania, £ 3 0 , 0 0 0 . I have given only the round figures. If three-fourths of this revenue were diverted to the Commonwealth, the States finances would be seriously depleted. Therefore, from this point of view alone the proposal should be very carefully considered. special guardian of State rights? as much attention to them as does the honourable member. The proposed Government control of the tobacco industry would involve an amendment of the Constitution, because we have no power at present which would enable us to enter upon the manufactures of tobacco. I would remind the honourable member for Kalgoorlie of the opinion given by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat when he occupied the position of Attorney-General in the Barton Administration, in connection with the proposed establishment of ironworks by the Commonwealth At page 184 of the report of the Royal Commission upon the Bonuses for Manufactures B ill , the following letter appears: Commonwealth of Australia. Attorney-General's Department, Melbourne, 18th July, 1903. Dear Mr Kingston, You ask for my opinion, for the information of the Bonus Commission, as to the powers, if any, of the Commonwealth to establish ironworks. In my opinion no such power is included in the express g if t of legislative powers to the Federal' Parliament. The trade and commerce power, vast though it is, does not appear to extend to production and manufacture-whic h are not commerce. Commerce only begins where production and manufacture end. See Kidd v. Pearson, 128 US. 1, 20. Moreover, the fact that the trade and commerce power is limited to external and Interstate trade and commerce indicates that the power which the States undoubtedly possess to undertake Government industries witnin their own limits is not shared by the Commonwealth under this sub-section.

The implied powers of legislation remain to b° determined, but include (under sub-section 3g -oi section 51) matters "" incidental"" to the exerthe reasons which have been advanced by cise of the express powers. Tlie manufacture of iron may be incidental to the execution of many such powers, e.g., defence or the construction of railways. The Commonwealth might clearly undertake the manufacture of any goods for its own use; a i d probably i i it did so, and it were incidentally advantageous to the interests of the economical working of the undertaking that it should also manufacture for other consumers, such manufacture would also come within its implied powers. Except as above, it does not appear that any power to establish and conduct manufactures can be implied from the Constitution. Yours faithfully , (Sgd.) ALFRED DEAKIN. If that is a sound opinion, it would apply with all the greater force to the present proposal. Under no conditions could the tobacco industry be regarded as having any relation to our defences, except in the sense that tobacco such as that manufactured in France may be used as a weapon of offence. The view taken by the honourable and learned member for Ballarat is sustained by some of the leading barristers in Melbourne and Sydney. An eminent KC. in Melbourne, and a gentleman who is second to none in Australia as a constitutional authority, declare that no power is conferred upon us by the Constitution to enter upon the manufacture of tobacco. and learned member for Wannon think that the tobacco combine are interfering with trade and commerce between the States, when they insist that goods supplied in one State shall not be exported to any other State? the combine a little later on. In view of the fact that an amendment of the Constitution would be required, and that the Commonwealth control of the tobacco industry would involve a dislocation of the finances of the States, I contend that only the gravest reasons would justify the Federal Government in taking over the industry. Government interference in the industry might be justified upon some grounds, but the grave step of' taking over the whole and sole control of the manufacture and-importation of tobacco could only be justified in an extreme case. on any ground. gravest reasons would warrant us in taking such a step. It is interesting to note Senator Pearce and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. They allege that there is a monopoly in existence, which exercises almost complete control over the manufacture and importation of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes; that the monopoly has resulted in the closing of factories, the reduction of the number of hands employed, and the lowering of wages; that the combine will not permit retailers to start in business without their .consent, that they dictate the prices at which their manufactured articles shall be bought and sold, that they prevent the retailers from buying from any other firm but Kronheimer and Co., and that alt this tends to increase prices to the consumers. It is also claimed by those honourable members that the Federal Government by taking over the industry could make a profit, in addition to the revenue derived from the existing duties, of £ 6 7 3 , 0 0 0 , according to Senator Pearce, and £628,000, according to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. That is to say, ' that the Commonwealth Government could from this industry extract a revenue of about £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 annually. Finally, they say that this lovely plum of £2,000,00 0 per annum could be secured by the expenditure of £1,000,000. No doubt many of us have principles, but if we thought that by expending £ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 we could secure ,£2,000,000 per annum, we should drop most of our principles, and reach out for the £2,000,000. I think I can show, however, that each and every one of the statements I have enumerated is either a gross exaggeration or utterly baseless, that the estimates of the revenue the Government would secure are ludicrous, and that the estimate of the cost of nationalizing the industry is absolutely puerile. In the first place, it is alleged that the tobacco industry is controlled by the combine. I have gone into this matter, in considerable detail, and I shall be in a position to show that the firm of Kronheimer and Co., which, so to speak, is the very head and front of this offending, does not represent all the manufacturers of tobacco, cigars, and cigarettes in Australia.",38,Government Manufacture

Cigar manfactuiers-Sniders and Abrahams, Melbourne; De Beer ancl Feries, Screen and Moss, T. Bamewall, G. A. Carter. This Mr Carter has been giving some most extraordinary statistics to the Select Committee. I am very strongly of opinion that he is at the bottom of all this fuss. He supplied honourable members of the Labour Party with a pamphlet advocating the nationalization of the tobacco industry, and his attitude at the present stage is well worth noting. Years ago, in Victoria, we had what were called £ 5 licences for the manufacture of pigars. Mr Carter, with the assistance of some members of the Labour Party., established himself as a manufacturer, and he prospered, waxed fat, and kicked. Then he came to the conclusion that all cigar manufacturers should be charged a licence-fee of £ 5 0 he then being in a position to paythat amount. Now he goes a length further, and proposes that the Government shall take control of the manufacture and sale of tobacco. The other manufacturers of cigars included in the list from which I was reading are :J. Roberts and many others in Melbourne; in Sydney-Hirsclunan , S. Levy and others, as well as firms in Adelaide and Fremantle. Cigarette manufacturers-Sniders and Abrahams, De Beer and Feries, Louis Coen, and other small makers in Melbourne and elsewhere.

When I read the statements which have been made in .this Parliament, I put a number of questions to the persons who are alleged to be guilty of these crimes. I went further, and drew up a list of about fifty queries,, in which I sought information upon each point that had been raised, informing thf: individuals to whom I refer that I would expect their statements to be verified on oath before a Select Committee or a Royal Commission. able and learned member submit his inquiries ? who has been in the tobacco trade all his life. which I have obtained can be placed before the Select Committee which is inquiring into this matter, and can be verified upon oath. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie can-if he chooses-submi t my statements, which will be contained in Hansard, to that body, and call evidence to rebut them. As regards the import market, I find that the following brands of tobacco are not controlled in any shape or form by the alleged combine :-Taddy's , Copes, Ardath Tobacco Co., Craven, Gallagher, Watson and McGill, Zimmer and Co., also Tuckett and Son, and others.

If necessary, those books can be produced. quoted by the honourable and learned member do not agree with the statement made by Mr Jacobs? 'ber loses sight of the fact that I am referring to the average wages paid to women and girls in the States Tobacco Company's Melbourne cigar factory in 1904. It has been alleged that the monopoly has discharged Iiands and reduced employment. The only statement made in support of that assertion is that a certain commercial traveller was dismissed. It does one good to see honourable members of the Labour Party practically shedding tears over the position of commercial travellers. I should like, now, to put before the Committee a comparison of the hands employed in the factories of the British Australasian Tobacco Company in Melbourne and Sydney, as well as the Melbourne cigar factory of the States ToI n 1902 they employed 825 hands; in 1903, 848; and in 1904, 1,103. * fairness to n the honourable member who has submitted this motion, I should deduct from the last named total the number of persons who have : lost their employment as the result of the closing of the National Company's cigar factory in Melbourne. Fifty-eight persons lost their employment in that way, leaving a total of 1,045 hands employed in these factories in 1904, or a.i increase of 197 as compared with the honourable and the number employed in 1903. These figures show that the statements that have been imade as to the combine having reduced employment are as absolutely baseless as is the charge that it has reduced wages. As a I could give the matter of fact, the wages paid in the tobacco trade of Australia are higher than those prevailing in Europe or America. It has been alleged that the firm of Kronheimer Limited has boycotted retailers. No evidence has been submitted in support of that assertion, and I am assured that it is without foundation. Although those who make such an assertion have the protection of a Select Committee, they have not seen fit to submit evidence in support of it to that body. When one gives a moment's consideration to the facts of the case, he recognises that it is highly improbable thatanything of the kind exists. Kronheimer Limited supply retailers to only a limited extent. The bulk of their trade is done with wholesale houses, who are naturallyglad to sell to any one. The more customers they can obtain the better they are pleased. It has also been said that an attempt has been made to fix a minimum price. In dealing with that point, there are one or ' two considerations which we must bear in mind. No attempt has been made to prevent those engaged in the retail trade from obtaining as large a profit as they can from the sale of their goods. But honourable members' who reside in the suburbs of Melbourne know that in a number of trades competition has been so keen that tradesmen have been forced, in self defence, to agree as to the prices at which they shall sell their goods. In the grocery trade, for instance, prices have been cut so fine that many men have been forced into the Insolvency Court.

Whether that course of action be justifiable or not, the combine is in no way responsible for it. I have known grocers and other tradesmen to keep a stiff upper lip in the face of cut-throat competition, and then go undeT, and in these circircumstances, I feel that there is a good deal to justify the making of an agreement to sell goods at a certain price in order that the retailers may make as much as they can. That course is followed in all the ordinary walks of life. Whether a man belongs to a trade union or any other body, he usually agrees not to sell his labour under a certain price. A further allegation has been made that, as the result of the combine, the price of goods has been increased to the consumer. In reality, there has been no general increase. It is true that there has been a trifling increase in one or two cases, and a trifling decrease in others; but nothing more. For example, the price of "" Yankee Doodle"" tobacco in Sydney has been slightly increased, but that has been due to peculiarly local conditions. the vast majority of lines, the price to the consumer remains absolutely untouched. I shall not have time to deal with all my notes; but I desire to briefly discuss the alleged profit which, according to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, would he secured by a State tobacco monopoly.

He submitted a statement to me, and I then demanded a f u l l and complete answer to forty or fifty queries which I put to him, telling him at the same time, that I desired to be placed in possession of facts which could not be gainsaid.

372,Upon Which Mr Mccay Had Moved,"was reported last night, I was referring to the fact that the Prime Minister has frequently stated that he fully appreciates the good which has been done by trade unionism, and that if he were an artisan or a workman he would become a member of a trade union. Notwithstanding these declarations, however, he is now asking us to pass into law a measure which, if not materially amended, will, in my opinion, strike one of the most serious blows at trade unionism which it has ever received. Right back from the earliest history, as the workers emerged from slavedom, through serfdom, to their present position, trade unions and organizations have Been forced to secure reforms by political action. It is the trade organizations which have been behind every political reform brought before the public. They have kept reforms to the front until public opinion has been focussed upon them, and legislators have taken them up, and have supported the necessary legislation with all their strength. Long before there was trade unionism in Australia the trade unions played an important part in political reform in England. A few years ago, after the industrial struggles of 189T, the workers of this country were advised by the members of Parliament, the Judges, and other men in high positions in the States, to abandon the old barbarous method of striking, and to seek to obtain by constitutional means the redress of their grievances. down by all the authorities that when an member must not discuss this subject. amendment is before the Committee the discussion must be confined to it .

The effect of tee, upon which a general discussion is the advice given in 1891 is shown by the being allowed, is there anything affecting representation of the Labour Party in, not the political purposes of trade unions. only this Parliament, but every one of the States Parliaments. Now, however, we are asked to pass a measure which will take away the political rights of the trade unionists, and subject them to boycotting throughout Australia. in Tasmania, South Australia, Western Australia, or Queensland now ? the masters, have practised the boycott, as the honourable member knows. vancy of the interjections.

It is also proposed to deprive, trade .unionists of their right to engage in politics.

I am not going into a long discussion of the subject, but I wish to show that the Bill, if passed as it stands, will take away rights which trade unionists at present enjoy, by preventing them from applying for preference if they have spent as much as it would cost to print a poster announcing the holding of a political meeting. That will do them considerable injury.

If once this Bill Is passed the whole of the trade unions will become subject to it whether they like I understand that it or not, and I am appealing to honourable members to divest the Bill, as far as possible, of its objectionable features, in order that it may be made acceptable to those who are most directly affected by it. I wish to say a word or two with .regard to the statements made by representatives of the employers' associations and others who are opposed to .the aims and objects of the Labour Party, to the effect that all the financial difficulties under which we are The amendment now labouring in Australia are due to the socialistic legislation which has been passed in the States and Commonwealth Parliaments. I can hardly conceive that honourable members believe that there is any truth in such statements. I appeal to the honourable member for Grampians, whether our present condition is not due to the very heavy losses which have been inflicted upon the community by the disastrous droughts of .the last few years. I find that, during the last ten years, the number of sheep in four States of the Commonwealth has been reduced from 102,000,000 to 61,000,000. If we assess the value of these sheep at the very low rate of 5s. per head per annum, we shall If , however, it is prosee at once that we have been sustaining a loss of £15,000,000 per annum for some years past. During the same period, our herds of cattle have been reduced from 11,000,000 to 5,000,000; if we estimate the value of these cattle at £ 2 per headit will be seen that we have sustained a loss of £.12,000,000 in that direction. We have also to consider the losses incurred by those who are engaged in the dairying industry, and in agriculture generally. Many of the wheat-growers in the State which I represent have cropped their land for seven years in succession, and have taken off very little more than enough grain for I seed. I cannot understand how, in the face ofall these facts, honourable members, and others, can say that socialistic legislation is at the bottom of all our troubles. Eveni f our legislation had proceeded along the lines which honourable members opposite most strongly advocate, we should have been no better off than we are at present. It is contemptible that such utterly unwarranted stateJOHN FORREST -They have got ments should be made in order to prejudice the minds of the public against a measure which is conceived in the interests not only of unionists, but of employers and the general public.

There is a very general feeling throughout the country that in view of the heavy losses and the hardflicted upon the community during the last ships that have been incurred, we should avoid doing anything that would tend to destroy public confidence, or to prevent the free investment of capital. If we do anything that will injuriously affect the credit of the country, our recovery will be retarded. It was stated last night that the farmers and pastoralists were not so much exercised in their minds as some people represented with regard to the probable effects of legislation of this kind. I should like to read a telegram which has been addressed to myself ancl to the Chairman, and which shows that it is feared that the proposed legislation will operate against the common good. The telegram reads as follows :Avoca, ist December, 1904. Messrs. Skene and Salmon, House of Representatives, Melbourne.

Comparing these returns with the statistics published in the Australian Handbook, I find that whereas in New South Wales, those engaged in professions or in attending upon professional callings number 41,000, the domestic servants total 72,000, the commercial classes 121,000, and the industrial workers 146,000. Honourable more women than men are employed in the factories and clothing of Victoria. nected with professions number the domestic servants 66,000. the commercial classes 109,000, and the industrial workers 145,000. From these figures it will be seen that the domestic servants stand third upon the list of workers in Great Britain, and fourth upon the list in these States. In the primary industries I find that there are 173,000 engaged in New South Wales, and 161,000 in Victoria. If the agricultural workers are to be denied the benefits which would be derived under this Bill, how can any honourable member go before his constituents and justify his attitude in differentiating beMr ^Maloneytween one class and another? Is it not almost akin to that harsh word "" hypocrisy "" for this Parliament, after having conIf the people could exerferred upon all adults the right to vote in vogue in for the return of representatives to frame they would sweep their laws, to declare that this Bill shall which exist not apply either to the third most numerous How many domestic servants calling in Australia, or to those emin our midst?

I give my meed of refer to Mulhall-I find that praise to the Senate for its action in connection with this B ill . It is the most democratic and gborious second chamber speaking the English language to day. I: care little whether the Bill be carried These or rejected, but I care much for the stigma The domestic servants of injustice which will attach to us if we carry it without these amendments. In 1881, I care also for the myriads of people outside who wil suffer injustice but that of the at our hands. I claim that the vast majority of Australians would-if the opporand of domestic servants tunity were afforded them-d o justice to It will thus be seen their fellow men and women. I venture their posito prophecy that if the Bill be returned to upon the list. In 1891 the the Senate, and if as the result of that workers _ had further deChamber's insistence upon its amendments, a double dissolution ensues, the country will support the members of the Opposition.

I have made my proIn other words, they were still test as vigorously as possible, and with all respect to those whose opinions differ from my own.

I believe that but for party considerations, there is not one honourable member opposite who would vote for the whole Bill. It mav not be in accordance with the -irules of this Parliament, but I am satislied that if we could bring the two Houses -of the Parliament together to decide without debate whether we should have the Bill as amended by the Senate, or as we sent it up to another place, we should arrive at a -decision which would certainly be in the best interests of the Commonwealth. -When this question was under our consideration on a previous occasion, I opposed the extension of the B ill to domestic servants.

I do not believe that any sane man would say that his home constituted .an "" industrv,'' and as I hold that-domestic servants cannot be said to be engaged in an ""industry, "" within the meaning of the Constitution, I feel that we cannot extend the provisions of this Bill to them. For the reason that I have stated, however, I shall support the amendment made by another place. propose to discuss this question at length, -for the probabilities are that we shall have a repetition of the vote which has just been given. I desire, however, to protest against the exclusion of so important a section of the community as are the agricultural labourers and domestic servants. I presume that the Government are in -earnest in tlieir desire to pass this measure. It is a Bill which, according to its title, is designed to prevent strikes and locks-out, -and to secure the settlement of industrial -disputes by means of a Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Through the agency of the Court, employers and emploves will be bought together, and any industrial dispute arising between them will be peacefully -settled. In this way it is hoped tb prevent the recurrence of the disastrous -strikes which we have experienced in Australia, with all the inconvenience, loss and With this high ideal before' us, we are asked to exclude a large section, of the community. The honourable member for Melbourne has quoted very telling figures from Mulhall and Coghlan, with reference to the number of agricultural labourers and domestic servants in England and Australia, and I think that the facts that he has placed before us are worthy of serious consideration. The Government invite the Committee to exclude those engaged in all branches of farming, as well as in domestic service, from the operation of this measure. We are now legislating for the whole Commonwealth, and I should like to know why these industries should be excluded, while others which are closely allied to them are not. It has not been clearly shown why the Bill should not be made applicable to those engaged in every calling. I can quite understand the attitude taken up by the representatives of At the same time, I have no Victoria, in view of the fact that all attempts to extend the factory legislation of the State to those engaged in farming have been strenuously resisted. But in New South Wales the position is wholly different. A State Conciliation and Arbitration Act is in operation there; and is applicable to those engaged in agricultural pursuits, as well as in shearing, and many other industries. It is quite possible, therefore, that the farmers of that State may be brought under an award of the State Court. That is a point which is worthy of attention. The products of the farmers of New South Wales have to compete with those of this State; and if they are brought under the operation of the State conciliation and arbitration law, the producers there may be placed at a disadvantage. Why should we not extend this Bill, which is expected to do so much in the direction of bringing about better industrial conditions, to all persons engaged in farming pursuits throughout the Commonwealth ? It has been contended that it is unlikely that disputes will arise among those engaged in the agricultural industry, or in domestic service. If we make provision for them in this B ill , and no disputes occur, the Act will remain inoperative, so far as they are concerned;, but if , .on the other hand, any trouble arises, we shall be prepared to cope with it. We should not legislate for a class; our legislation, as far as possible, should be applicable to the whole of the people of the Commonwealth.

490,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"I do nothands or domestic servants be excluded from participating in the benefits of a measure of this kind? For these reasons I shall support the amendment. I trust that better counsels will prevail, and that honourable members opposite will withdraw their opposition to the amendment. fully discussed. given my reasons for supporting the amendments made by the Senate. I am a farmer, and as a representative of a farmingconstituency, wish to explain why I consider that agricultural labourers should not be exempted from the B ill . In my constituency, many farmers are engaged in the .dual industry of wool raising and wheat production, upon a very large scale. Within the last few years large areas of land in my electorate, which were previously used solely for grazing purposes, have been put under the plough and devoted to wheat production. We have the same employers engaged in both branches of the industry, and they have to find a market for their produce, not in the Commonwealth, but beyond it. the needs of the old world. parts of New South Wales we have men working as shearers and as farm labourers, during different portions of the year, for the same employers. If the amendment is not agreed to we shall tell these people that, as growers of wool and meat they may come under the provisions of the measure, but as agriculturists they cannot enjoy its benefits, be.cause the agricultural industry is outside its scope. Though, as pastoralists, they may settle their disputes with their employees by conciliation and arbitration, if , as agriculturists, they have disputes with their employees, they must revert to the old barbarous methods of strikes and locks-out. Buti f the measure can give efficient protection to .those engaged in one branch of rural production-and that is claimed by the Government-it is, in my opinion, capable of giving equally efficient protection to the branch which they propose to exclude. On the other hand, if it is incapable of serving the agricultural interest, it is equally incapable -of serving the grazing interest. In my State, both agricultural and pastoral interests come under the State Arbitration Act. That measure provides for the control of agricultural disputes equally with grazing disputes; but if the Federal legislation, which deals, not with disputes confined to any one State, but with disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State, is so lop-sided as to apply only to grazing disputes, an injury may be done to the agriculturists of New South Wales through the spreading of a dispute to that State from another State, for which there will be no remedy. If this is to be a good and beneficial piece of legislation, it should apply tc* every industry, and to every person engaged in that industry, male or female. Every such person should have a right to regard it as a means for obtaining redress for industrial grievances. Therefore, I protest against the proposal of the Government to apply it only to certain industries, and to thus make it a piece of class legislation. Question-That the amendment be disagreed to-put .

If they had been here they would have known that we transgressed that beauteous principle of British law on several occasions, and yet the heavens have not fallen, and there still seems to be some respect for the powers that be. In both the Customs and Excise Acts we provided distinctly that, except in regard to indictable offences, the onus of proof should lie upon the defendant. in all cases a party to the dispute? cases under this Bill parties to the dispute? We can sec now that some honourable members are beginning to discover that there is some ground for objection to this particular clause, that, even according to their own admission, it has a two-edged effect. In view of the fact I have stated, that in two other statutes this Parliament has provided that the onus of proof shall be upon the defendant, except, of course, in cases involving serious offences which are indictable, it doss seem to me that the objection urged by honourable members carries no weight when put forwardin regard to this particular case. people advocate the adoption of the same principle in connection with the licensing 'laws. bean adopted in connection with gaming and other laws, under which the defendant is required to show that he was in a certain place for a good purpose, the police being relieved of the responsibility of showing that he was there for an improper purpose. Presuming that a union is asking for preference, my proposal does not relieve it of the necessity of making out a good case before the Court. The only proposition I put forward is that if the Court is satisfied that preference is justifiable, the applicant union will still have to run the gauntlet of the majority of those engaged in the industry-if that majority takes sufficient interest in the matter to disclose itself.

As so much effort has been expended in an effort to make it appear that the principle of compulsory arbitration is inseparably associated with preference to unionists, I should like to read the wprds of the author of the New South Wales Arbitration Act, from which a great deal in this Bill has been copied;. He is a man of gieat distinction, and is acknowledged to bo perhaps the leading authority in Australia upon a measure of this character. As is well known, the New South Wales Arbitration Act was passed under the auspices of the Attorney-General of the day, Mr B. R. Wise, a gentleman who is not altogether unknown to honourable members. AVe all recognise that any statement which he makes upon questions of fact or intention can foe implicitly accepted throughout Australia, and therefore I ask honourable members to implicitly accept the statements which he made in the Legislative Council on the 31st October, 1900, when moving the second reading of this Bill. I quote his words, because they bear upon the particular matter referred to -by my honourable friends. always accept his statements? gentleman wishes us to accept them. whose utterances the element of irony occasionally enters. But I hope that honourable members opposite will accept the statements made by Mr Wise, which are reported in the New South Wales Hansard, page 4547. HesaidHowever, the Hill provides that before any combination of workmen can be registered as an industrial union, they must previously form themselves info a trade union. That is what is stated in this Bill. that does not matter. Bill, no body of men can form themselves into an organization apart from a trade union. I suggested as a solution of the whole of the troubles we have experienced in connection with this clause, that the trade unions should form organizations solely for the purposes of this Bill. My honourable friends, however, declared that they could not accept that solution, and I hope that 'they will allow me to continue the quotation, because it is in the nature of an assurance to a House of Parliament which was asked to pass a similar Bill. Mr Wise continuedIt has been thought that this provision necessitates that every workman in the Colony shall become a trade unionist. I desire in the most emphatic terms of which I am capable to repudiate that suggestion. It is neither the purpose of the Act, nor is there, I believe, a single clause in it which can be fairly considered or reasonably imagined to have the result of compelling any person who is not a member of a union lo join one. in that Bill unabridged. in any Bill, how can any one urge that a man who is not a member of a trade union is not compelled to join one ? I admit that in the sense of tyranny, he is not compelled to do so. He is at liberty to stand back and to see members of certain trade unions pass before him, and obtain any employment that may be offering. I say that if we make a distinction between unionists and non-unionists who are engaged in the same trade if we provide that a man shall obtain a preference if he joins a union, but that he shall be shut out from employment if he does not-w e apply to him the most cruel compulsion in the world. It is true that we do not touch him in his views of abstract questions. We do not affect his religious or political convictions; but we touch him upon the point which is vital to every indi-",59,Pairs

I do not find fault with Mr Wise for entertaining that view, but I know how I should exercise my opinion if I occupied a similar position. He continued-bu t it is a disputable point which I do not wish to touch-ther e is nothing in this Bill which either expressly or by implication will make it more difficult for the non-unionist to earn a living. That is the statement of the honourable and learned Attorney-General of New ""South1 Wales upon these very preference provisions. Can it be urged that the amendment submitted by the leader of the Opposition will not make it more difficult for a non-unionist to earn his living? gentleman say that it will ? if one body of men is privileged in its oppor tunities of employment. One of the grandest principles of advanced democracy is equality of opportunity. There is no equality of opportunity, however, if the Legislature surrounds men with preferences in their struggles for a subsistence. should oppose preference, even if a majority of those engaged in the industry affected approve of the granting of it. In the interests of the beneficent objects of this legislation, honourable members upon this side of the House have made concessions. I consider that I have made a very serious concession, and so have other 'honourable members. We have conceded the principle of preference, with the qualification, not that a majority of trade unionists shall claim it, because we leave' all non-unionists free to express their wish that a preference shall be extended to unions to which they do not belong; but the test which we apply is that amajority of those engaged in any industry which would be affected by an award of the Court must first approve of the granting of that preference. Mr Wise continuesI can assure honourable members that if their ingenuity should be able to detect anything which can even remotely have that effect, I shall be prepared to have it eliminated from the B ill . That is the sort of talk which was indulged in when the New South Wales Arbitration Bill was passed into law. I venture to say that not one of my honourable friends opposite would make use of similar language. honourable member was not. He is far too straightforward to make such a statement. Why is this question of preference made such a life and death issue? Is it because it means nothing ? Is it because it will have no industrial operation or effect-that it will not help one man as against another? Is it because it will not help the member of a trade union as against the man who, in the exercise of his rights as a democrat, -independently refuses to join a union? as we are. excuse me for talking in a way which is not common at a pleasant Sunday afternoon meeting. I hope he wil] allow me to express my own views in the frankest ancl most straightforward fashion. That is a right which is still left to honourable members. My honourable friends opposite, rightly or wrongly, believe that preference is a great advantage for the trade unionists whom they represent. they would be at a disadvantage. thing. I am coming to that point. tion to my honourable friends of the Opposition. Supposing that an employer desiring to engage twenty men had a right to differentiate in the ranks of trade unionists, would he not be vigorously criticized if ke happened to differentiate between a man who had been very active in his factory of which my honourable friends complain.

The honourable member wishes to remove the safeguard. ber say that the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland does not take it away ? easy for the outsiders ? easy for them as the right honourable gentleman said it would be for the other side. my question; the honourable member is now indulging in mere speculation. The fact remains that this principle was accepted in the interests of the magnificent objects of the B ill , which are recognised by the great majority of the people of Australia. The principle of preference was accepted, as many other things have been accepted, subject to the principle of some sort of majority rule. member is correct in saying ""some sort"" of majority rule.

Are we to leave the Courti n such a position that it will have no indication from the Legislature of the principle It is the same point. upon which this discretion should be exercised? The value of the amendment moved by the honourable and learned member for Corinella when the B ill was before us on a previous occasion is that it gives the Court a clear indication of the rules upon which I do not object to any preits discretion should be exercised. We must remember that it will not be a Courti n which every statement must be proved according to the dry precision of ordinary Courts of law, whose decisions are liable to be upset. This will be a Court of equity of the freest kind. It will be absolutely free from the technicalities of a Court of I object to the conlaw. facts. and learned member will allow me to make myself heard. This Court will not be asked, as an ordinary Court of law is asked, topronounce opinions on questions of law. It is not asked to be satisfied in the driest legal sense that an application for a pre-r ference is supported by a majority of those affected. If , in the opinion of the Court, a majority of those affected in the industry are in favour of the preference, it w ill know what it may do, and will be able to do it . We are asked by the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bland,, to adopt an extraordinary course. It is remarkable that my honourable friend should be prepared to seriously submit such a proposition if he allows the principle of COOK It makes it just as majority rule at all. The amendment has one advantage.

Let us take a dispute before the Arbitration Court, between a large employer, or a corporation of employers, and a large body of trade unionists. trade unionists apply to the Court for a preference in their branch of industry over all the other workers in Australia.

I consider them to be men who are -entitled to the protection of the laws of the land, and to some show of justice. made to put the onus of proof upon disor1 ganized workers, who are scattered throughout Australia, instead of on the organized trade unionists. Why should the onus of proof be thrown on men who ask only for equal opportunities to earn their living? What has the country come to? Have we sunk so low that when we get to the very bed-rock necessity of a human being, to live in decency, the onus of proof that he is entitled to do so is thrown on him, and he is required to prove what is, in form, an affirmative, though practically a negative? The effect of the proposal of the honourable member for Bland would be that the moment an application for preference was made by a union, the duty would be cast upon the Judge-thoug h my friends would like'him to take no concern on that point-to consider whether there was a majority. In form, there is an admission of the principle which we desire to enforce, but by a cruel twist of the clause the burden of proof is taken from the shoulders of the strong and put on the shoulders of the defenceless.

Do my honourable friends say that? They have suddenly become so timid that they point to the bell-wether, and desire him to speak for them. Honourable members who, upon other occasions, fearlessly express their own democratic convictions, when I now put a question to them, point to my amiable and moderate friend the leader of the Opposition. Coming back again to the amendment itself, which admits that the Court must have regard to the question of majority,. I say that the proposal that some persons residing in scattered localities, thousands of miles apart, are to come into Court and prove that they represent a majority, is one of the most extraordinary ways of testing such a question of which we could conceive. That is my view. Now let us test this provision by applying it to the case of the trade unions which this Bill was specially designed to meet. I think that we can in this way .show whether our amendment is unreasonable or not. You cannot test a novel experience of this kind where everything is in the dark by precise examples. All you can do is to regard the existing industrial facts throughout Australia in order to judge what kind of dispute will in afl probability be submitted to this high tribunal.
