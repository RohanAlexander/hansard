The honourable member for Mackellar suggested that he had been informed by some person that another persona fourth person-ha d made a statement reflecting upon the honourable member for East Sydney and relating to a matter that had been inquired into some years previously by a royal commission at which the honourable member for East Sydney had given sworn evidence. Will the Prime Minister, in, the interests of the House, investigate the substance of the suggestions of the honourable member for Mackellar which have no weight whatever and cannot be so regarded? However, in view of the wide publicity given to theBe statements because they were made in this House, will the right honourable gentleman, after be has perused the papers relating to the matter, ascertain whether steps can be taken to vindicate the honourable member for East Sydney, or to give him an opportunity to vindicate himself? opportunity of studying the statements made in the House as mentioned in the right honourable member's question, but I propose to do so soon. I shall then be in a position to form an opinion about what the procedure should then be. I think that I should say that I am not very devoted to the idea of royal commissions about statements made 'in this House, because the last time the honourable member for East Sydney made an allegation in the chamber, and Mr Curtin appointed a royal commission to investigate the matter, the honourable member for East Sydney, so far from supporting his allegation, claimed that he could not be called upon to give evidence about it. However, I agree that the whole matter is an important one, and one that should be considered with care and a sense of justice. For example, in connection with these matters that were raised, I have gleaned from newspapers-bu t from no other source-tba t my colleague, the Minister for Trade and Customs, who is a man of high reputation, has been named, is about to be named or may be named in a royal commission to be set up by Mr Cahill, Nobody has told me this although I am the head of the Government in which Senator O'Sullivan serves.

In the following week they were precipitately and thoroughly withdrawn because the aUeged investigator found that he had been barking up the wrong tree.

He realizesI am sure that he has it in mind-that while the much publicized reduction of taxes in Canada, which I am sure must be very comforting to all concerned, amounted to, I believe 11 per cent., the reduction which we made in the then existing taxes last year was the equivalent of 9 per cent. ber was not present during the last budget debate in this Parliament.

If , as the Minister claims, the gentleman concerned did not retire on account of ill health, but, on the contrary, is in good health, can the right honourable gentleman offer any information why the Sydney Morning Herald should have denied his statement about the good health of the gentleman concerned and insists that he had been retired on account of ill health ? Is it true that his retirement was occasioned by the fact that the gentleman in question was relieved of his post on the newspaper because of the fulsome praise he was giving to the Minister for External Affairs, which did not suit the policy of the newspaper ? me that he had not retired from the Sydney Morning Herald for reasons of iii health. newspaper say that he did. son concerned is the best judge of the reason why he retired from the newspaper.

The Department of Air has advised tlie trainee, and the Minister for Air has aho informed me, that the department does not hold itself responsible to recompense him in any way for the destruction of his clothing. Will the Prime Minister take this matter up with the three services with a view to ensuring that men who are called up for service and whose clothing is destroyed by fire through no fault of their own, will receive adequate compensation for their loss? will answer the question. the position described by the honourable member for Port Adelaide in the first part of his question, and ascertain whether or not the recruit, or national service trainee to whom he has referred, had to go to Ballarat from South Australia in his own clothes. With regard to damage by fire, the position is that think that the peithe Commonwealth does not accept responsibility if fire damage to the clothing of an individual occurs otherwise thaji in the course of duty, or as a result of liis being required to take his personal clothing to the place when he is on duty.

Will the Minister take this factor into consideration and press on will all possible speed with the construction of the station at Albany? priority does not affect this matter. A decision has been made to provide a national broadcasting station for Albany, but difficulty is involved in determining the most suitable site for it. This is a more complex task than was the case at Canberra. being made at Albany at present, and I believe that it is almost completed. The work of erecting the station will be proceeded with as soon as possible after I receive the report of the engineers who are making the survey. I point out also that Albany, as "" the honourable member knows, is one of the places in Western Australia which have been chosen for the issue of commercial broadcasting licences. AlthoughI have held a commercial licence available for .Albany for about twelve months, local residents have not yet come together .and decided that they can take it up. I have requested specifically that the holders of the licence be local residents instead of city interests. I understand that residents are now forming a company, but it has not heen possible to issue the commercial licence yet. Minister for Air aware of the discontent that exists amongst servicemen stationed at Manus Island, and the wives and relatives of such servicemen in Australia, because the mail service to the island is restricted to one delivery weekly? As it is claimed that the mail service to the island operated thrice weekly during the war, will the Minister investigate the matter with the object of providing an improved service and giving satisfaction to the men concerned and their families ? member's question is based upon a misright to administer these houses. Howunderstanding of the facts. There is a ever., the buildings include prefabricated twice-weekly mail service to Manus houses for which the rental has been fixed Island at present. M.. JEAN LETOURNEAU. for External Affairs a question in relation to his .recent announcement that M . Jean Letourneau, the Minister of State of the French Government in charge of relations with the Associated States of Indo-China, will visit Australia next month as a guest of the Commonwealth. In view of the growing importance to Australia of South-East Asian affairs and the increasing interest taken in those affairs in this Parliament, will the Minister endeavour to ensure that the distinguished visitor shall be invited to Canberra at a time A survey is when the Parliament is in session so that honourable members, particularly members of. the Foreign Affairs Committee, may have the opportunity to meet him? gramme of the distinguished French Minister, M . Letourneau, is now being drawn up in consultation with the French Ambassador. I hope very much that the programme will result in M . Letourneau having at least two days in Canberra. He will meet the Prime Minister and other members of the Government, and I hope that arrangements will be made to enable him to meet also as many members of all parties in this House as possible. I shall certainly bear the honourable member's request in mind and endeavour to arrange for M . Letourneau's programme to be extended so as to permit at least the members of the Foreign Affairs Committee to meet him. I understand that this will be the first visit to Australia by a French Minister of State, and I hope and believe that M . Letourneau will be given the warmest possible welcome by all parties represented in this Parliament.

The persons concerned in the West Cessnock area, where those homes are, and which is in my electorate, are anxious to obtain will the Minister consider adopting the a decision on the matter, but up to date they have had no satisfaction. In view of the urgency of the matter can the Minister say whether he has received any further advice from the New South Wales Minister for Housing? lionorable member knows, I visited that area myself, and I understand that negotiations have been undertaken with New South Wales in relation to the administration of the houses. I am not aware of the stage the negotiations have reached, but I sliall make inquiries about raised is an interesting one, and I shall the matter and advise the honourable member. from certain local manufacturers regarding inadequate supplies of ingot copper, and a reported surplus of that commodity at Mount Morgan, will the Minister for Supply arrange for an early investigation to be made into the overall copper supply position in Australia? was not aware that a shortage of ingot copper exists in any particular area. My knowledge of the matter leads me to suppose that there is at present a surplus of Government is in the electorate of a copper production in Australia. The matter that the honourable member has raised also concerns the Minister for National Development, and we have been having discussions about it. I tbink that the Minister for Defence Production is also interested in it. I undertake that the three Ministers concerned, and probably some others, will discuss the matter and see what can be done in the direction indicated by the honourable member. for Social Services aware that mauy Australian men are deprived of the benefits of age and invalid pensions because their wives earn just sufficient to make tbem ineligible for such pensions. Those men pensions, but also medical, hospital and pharmaceutical benefits as well as many other State benefits. In view of the extreme difficulties these people are experiencing same attitude to applicants for age and invalid pensions as is adopted towards applicants for sickness benefits; that is, that the male breadwinner of the family is not debarred from his own particular benefit by the income of his wife ? point out that a requirement for the issue of an invalid pension is that the person concerned shall be incapacitated to the extent of So per cent. That has always been, more or less, the law of the land. The point that the honourable member has give it consideration.

If the Minister is aware of that fact, will he advise the House why the information has been wrongly presented in the book to which I have referred, and whether he will correct the error in the interests of the people who may receive the book? the people of Australia, there is only one pharmaceutical benefits scheme in this country. It is the scheme that is iu uniAustralian Broadcasting Commission that versal operation now. At the present time, under that scheme, every doctor in Australia is prescribing and every chemist in Australia is dispensing life-saving drugs. The scheme that was evolved previously did not work. There were never more than 155 doctors prescribing under it. I think that the highest sum ever expended under it in any one year was a sum between £100,000 and £200,000. That rate of expenditure was declining rapidly. The scheme was a futile "" wash-out"". THE PARLIAMENT. is being given to the report of the Australian Broadcasting Commission that recommended a curtailment of broadcasts of the proceedings of the Parliament, will the Postmaster-General give full attention to the need to re-establish in the public mind the prestige of the Parliament, which appears to have declined as a result of the continuous broadcasting of our proceedings and the use on many occasions of the broadcasting facilities as a vehicle for the dissemination of perparticularly interested in parliamentary nicious propaganda rather than intelligent debate ? able member must not reflect upon the House. of the nature of broadcasts from the Parliament, the time to be allotted to such broadcasts and kindred matters is not the prerogative either of the Australian Broadcasting Commission or of myself. Those matters are considered by a joint parliamentary committee, which consists of members of all parties. I think that you, Mr Speaker, are the chairman of that body. Dpubtless, the committee will give consideration to the views upon parliamentary broadcasts that have been expressed by the Australian BroadcastingCommission, and will come to a decision upon them. master-General tbink it wise that an important part of the broadcasting services of the nation should be subordinated to the needs, real or imaginary, of this Parliament ? Does the' Minister subscribe to the view put forward by the at least two transmission lines in each State are essential for the presentation of a balanced national programme and that while the proceedings of the Parliament are being broadcast, one line in each State is taken up for the parliamentary broadcasts during the best listening times each day, which means that a balanced national programme cannot be maintained while the Parliament is in session? Will the Minister examine my proposal that control of the broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings should be transferred to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, including authority to decide how often and how much of the proceedings should be broadcast? that, after several years of experience of broadcasting the proceedings of the Parliament, a review should be made of the best way of presenting the service to the public. The more appropriate authority to determine such a matter is the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Committee. The fact that, while the Parliament is on the air, listeners who are not debates are denied the programmes which would otherwise be broadcast to them, must be carefully considered. I cannot conceive that there is any likelihood that authority over the broadcasting of the proceedings of the Parliament will he transferred to the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Mr J. R.

Would it be possible for the Commonwealth to hold a meeting with the States to discuss the very bad quality of the. bread that is supplied throughout Australia? advertisement carries an announcement that either a vitamin or some otlier substance is added to bread in order to enrich it. Is that addition necessary because the quality of flour has deteriorated? Is it related to the report of an agricultural scientist, who told us in the Sydney Morning Herald the other week that Australian flour is lacking in protein content by 9 per cent. ? If that be so, what can we do about it? The bread that is available in my electorate is the horror of the housewife. She puts it in the crock for the week-end, and it has a purple beard by Monday. able gentleman is getting outside the scope of a question. growth on the bread. Is it a fact that the quality of flour has deteriorated owing to the practice of not blending hard milling, wheats with soft milling wheats? Bread is an important food, and its quality is the concern of the medical fraternity as well as. of consumers. Will the Minister do his best to deal with this important subject, and see whether we can get a good, directed to the Postmaster-General.

The consumption within Australia of primary products and manufactured products is essentially a matter for State administration and State legislation. Standards in respect of bread,, milk and other commodities are specified in the pure foods legislation of the various States. I do not deny that the point raised by the honourable member has substance, but it is outside the legislative and administrative jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. The State parliaments could prescribe higher standards for bread. Within the administrative authority of the Australian Wheat Board, provision is made for flour mills to procure, entirely on their own initiative, higher types of wheat by paying a very small premium for them. In fact, that is commonly done. ThereEvery bread fore, I suggest that the honourable member might first ask the question of the New South Wales Government. Minister for Health is supplementary to that of the honourable member for Parkes. Bread is more important now in the diet of Australians than it used to be because of the high cost of meat, fruit and other foods. Isi t a fact that Australian bread, in appearance, flavour and nutritional value does not compare favourably with bread manufactured in the United Kingdom and continental countries? Even though this matter may be outside the jurisdiction of the Parliament, will the Minister call for a report on it, and if Australian bread is as I have indicated will he inform the Parliament accordingly ? information obtained about the quality of bread in various countries and let the honorable member know the result of my inquiries. commission on television, and the obli-",18,Healthand Medical Services

The principal alteration of the law contemplated in these measures is designed to make sure, by expressed definition, that control of pearl fisheries and fisheries generally in Australian waters shall extend to waters surrounding the territories of Australia and beyond their territorial limits. That point was discussed when the House dehated the earlier legislation. Honourable members on this side of the chamber then pointed out that there was danger that governments might take too narrow a view of the constitutional power in relation to the regulation of fisheries in Australian waters beyond the territorial limits. My conception of Australian I lay on waters beyond the territorial limits is that they include not merely the waters of the States of Australia and extending beyond the 3-mile limits of those States, but also to places such as the Northern Territory, which is an integral portion of tbe Commonwealth.

84,(By Mr Erio J. Harrison ) A Glance At The Map Should Be Sufficient,"those waters may be outside the territorial limits of either the territory of New Guinea or the State of Queensland. I believe that a broad, comprehensive view of the power would be taken by the courts in these days, when the status of Australia as a nation in the world, with special responsibilities in the Pacific, is recognized. The proposed amendment simply power, and makes it clear that the fisheries which can be and will be regulated under this legislation will extend to waters beyond the territorial limits of all the territories as well as of the States which comprise the Commonwealth of Australia. That provision means that fisheries beyond the territorial limits which can be regulated under this legislation include fisheries outside the territorial limits of the northernmost islands of the trust territory of New Guinea and the Admiralty Islands. A power of a very wide and comprehensive kind is actually exercised now by virtue of our present legislation, which the constitution permits, and every Australian court would recognize. The international position is linked very closely with that matter. I pointed out last year, when the Fisheries Bill 1952 and'the Pearl Fisheries Bill 1952 were under consideration, that it is extremely important that, parallel with this legislation that gives power to regulate and license fisheries, we should make sure that the fishing expeditions from other countries, particularly should be regulated by national agreement. In my opinion, one of the weaknesses of the Peace Treaty with Japan was the fact Japan merely undertook to negotiate with Australia on this matter, and to consider the kind of agreement that should be made. I do not think that the protection that Australia has under the treaty is equivalent to the protection upon which Canada successfully insisted, in relation to Canadian fisheries beyond the territorial limits of Canada. The United States of America secured similar protection. considered the Fisheries Bill 1952 and the Pearl Fisheries Bill 1952 last year, this matter was in the air, but now it has become important, because we know from the press that pearling fleets are Dr. Evatt. about to leave Japan with the object of fishing in waters quite close to Darwin and Melville Island. Japanese fishing expeditions have also been operating off the northern Admiralty Islands in waters that are really Australian waters and covered by this legislation. I emphasize to the Minister how important it is that, parallel with this declares the constitutional constitutional legislative power which we are exercising, the government should bring to finality an agreement with the Japanese Government so that Japanese fishing expeditions will not come into Australian waters except under a system of complete regulation. We must avoid a situation that occurred in World War IL , when many Japanese fishermen had to be interned, and General MacArthur ordered that they should not be permitted to return to Japan, because they possessed such a thorough knowledge of every nook and cranny of the coastline of the Northern Territory, Queensland and the islands to the north of Australia. The Opposition agrees with this bill, but points out that its provisions will be useless unless they are accompanied by a successful attempt on the part of the Government to regulate the series of expeditions which the Japanese aTe making into our waters. It would be unthinkable that Australian fishermen would be allowed to fish in waters so far north as Japan, which is thousands of miles from this country, yet Japanese -fishermen come into Australian waters. Japan, The Peace Treaty with Japan contemplates, at any rate, a firm agreement between Japan and Australia about the rights of Japanese fishermen in our waters. The matter of the important Antarctic fisheries also arises. I have no knowledge of the latest reports, but Japanese whaling expeditions for years after the conclusion of World War II . failed to conform to the regulations for the conservation of whales. When we signatory to the International Whaling Agreement ? that its nationals were entitled to fish in Australian waters right up to the three mile limit. The Constitution clearly",22,Honourable Members N O

86,Dr. Evatt,"Japan always assertedgives us the power to prevent such operations beyond territorial limits, and the modern doctrine of international law has developed until it is fairly well recognized that nations have every right to protect their own fishing industries and security, and expand their sphere by regulation and control beyond the three mile limit. It is of supreme importance that an agreement be reached with Japan on these matters as soon as possible. It appears that the Japanese will not make au agreement, and that Japanese expeditions will continue to come south to exercise their rights, as was the case before 1941 when war with Japan broke out. The Opposition agrees to this legislation, but considers that it is essential to make it clear that the statutory power defining the limits of this regulation under the Fisheries Bill 1953 and the Pearl Fisheries Bill 1953 is commensurate with and equal to the constitutional power. This power is vast, but tbe Government must ensure that it is exercised. I do not mean that the power should be exercised aggressively, but it should be used for the protection of our own fisheries in the north, and for the security of Australia. I asked the Minister for Commerce and pertinent questions on the matters now under consideration when the Fisheries Bill 1952 and the Pearl Fisheries Bill 1952 were before the House last year. The purpose of the legislation now under discussion is to make clear the jurisdiction of the Australian Government with respect to the three mile limit. The Minister, in his second-reading speech on this bill, made the following statement:The Act operates in wators outside territorial limits. However, some doubt has been felt whether the act, as framed, is in suffican have no serious objection to these ciently wide terms to cover waters outside the bills, but this debate provides us with an territorial limits. All of us are concerned with that point. I want to help the Government because this is a sticky business which is of great importance to Australia. We should be informed clearly at the earliest possible moment of our rights and authority in relation to the policing of waters adjacent to our shores. 19] The Japanese have had access to Australian waters-, for many years. Japanese divers have been predominant in the pearling industry, and Japanese vessels have scoured the coastline of northern Western Australia and the Northern Territory. This matter cannot be cleared up too quickly because the Japanese, in their small boats, are able, not only to traverse the coast, but also to go considerable distances inland along creeks during high tides, and thus their crews are able to consort with the aborigines and gain a lot of information about Australia which we consider they are not entitled to gain. Every effort should be made to prevent this from happening. The Minister has not explained the situation sufficiently. I am sure that he and oflieers of his department must have had long discussions about the probable effects of the two measures that we are considering, which are not wholly self-explanatory. Therefore, I ask him to supply the House with additional information when he makes his speech in reply at the close of this debate. This is a delicate matter to discuss thoroughly but, in view of the danger to Australia that arises from the activities of Japanese pearl-fishing fleets, I hope that earnest consideration will be given to my remarks. Having listened carefully to the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, who has a wide knowledge of international affairs, I am convinced that the right honourable gentleman is not happy about the present situation. I shall wait with interest to learn whether the Minister believes that the two measures that we are discussing will provide Australia with the security to which it is entitled. [3.34] -Lik e other members of the Opposition who have spoken, I believe that we opportunity to discuss a number of important matters that are involved. First, honourable members should realize that Australia, unlike some other countries, has not yet concluded an agreement on fishing with the Japanese Government. I do not know whether this is due to laxity on the part of the Australian Government, or whether the",23,Honourable Members N O

89,Mr Nelson (Northern Territory),"Government has attempted to reach an agreement with the Japanese Government and has failed. Minister for Commerce and Agrithe House all available information on this point when he closes the second reading debate. Japanese pearling fleets are already moving southward from their home bases, and an agreement should have been reached between the two governments before they even contemplated setting sail. Those fleets are coming to the pearling beds adjacent to our northern coastline near Melville Island and Darwin. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has already reviewed the legal constitutional position of Australia in this There is no coastal patrol of any descripmatter. I repeat that the Australian Government and the Japanese Government should have concluded an agreement in relation to pearl fishing before the Japanese fleets left their bases. Now there appears to be little hope that such an agreement can be made before the vessels begin their operations in Australian waters. The people of the Northern Territory are gravely concerned about this matter because they have had previous experience of the operations of Japanese pearling fleets in Australian territorial waters, pardeplorable. It is quite incapable of ticularly during the years immediately prior to ""World War II. They have been most unfortunate in their dealings with the Japanese. should be given to three aspects of the actiof going out on patrol, but they are kept vities of the Japanese in Australian waters. The first aspect relates to our security. It is too late now to worry about any knowledge that the Japanese may acquire of our northern coastline, because the damage has been done already. They know more than we do about that coastline. Therefore, it would be of no use for us to say at this stage that steps should be taken to prevent them from learning anything more about it. However, ' other security considerations are involved. Considerable development has taken place in northern Australia, and we should take this fact into consideration. Another important aspect of the reappearance of Japanese fishing fleets affects the natives who inhabit the area adjacent to our northern coastline. Here again we have unhappy recollections of Sfr. Nelson. former occasions when the Japanese operated in that region. We know that the The native peoples invariably suffered from any contacts that they had with the Japanese. Many atrocities were perpetrated by Japanese crews in northern Australia. Native women were enticed on board Japanese vessels and were prevented from leaving them. We do not want to hear of such abuses again, and we do not want the tribal customs of the natives to be interfered with. The difliculties of policing our coastline and the adjacent waters are readily apparent. We can forbid Japanese fishing crews to land on our shores, but it will be easy for them to do so if they wish. tion along our northern coastline. We had such a patrol formerly, but the Government, in its wisdom, saw fit to order a cessation of its activities. I do' not know why it did so. Our coastline for 2,000 or 3,000 miles westward from Torres Strait to a point past Broome is entirely unprotected at present. As I have said, we once had a coastal patrol operating in these waters but it is not now operating. There is also no aerial patrol operating in the area. We know that the state of our Air Eorce at Darwin is patrolling the north, even if it wanted to do so, but I shall not go into that matter at length. I think that we have only Earnest consideration two aircraft at Darwin that are capable there for air-sea rescue work only. It is time that the Government took some action to see that an adequate patrol is reintroduced in the north to protect not only our security interests and the interests of the natives, but also the national interest in the pearl beds themselves. We are quite capable of working our own pearl beds for our own advantage. It is wrong to say that we cannot operate them without the assistance of Japanese pearlers. That fallacy has been exploded, although some master pearlers in the north are willing to use Japanese divers because the Japanese are prepared to take risks that the ordinary Australian native diver is not prepared to take, attempt to keep it alive. It is admitted that the Japanese diver wins more pearl shell because of the risks",24,Honourable Members N O
90,Culture ( Mr Mcewen) Should Give,"that he takes, but I do not think that we should encourage that sort of thing. Whatever the Government intends to do about the regulation of the operations of Japanese pearlers in our north, our interests in our own fishing beds should be protected, and any wealth that can be derived from them should be available to Australia and Australians alone. the Minister for Commerce and Agriculthe Opposition's attitude to these two bills, which are being taken in conjunction because the subjects of fishing and pearlshell fishing are allied, as it was outlined by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). Our attitude is that while we agree in principle with the bills we have grave misgivings about the future of this country is sufficiently safeguarded, both in relation to the aspect of the development of our fisheries and our pearl-shell industry and the aspect of defence that is involved in these deceptively simple measures. In the first place the Leader of the Opposition pointed out that the Constitution gives us very wide powers in regard to fishing within what are looselytermed our territorial waters. also pointed out that the whole international trend, disclosed at a series of conferences that have taken place since the formation of the United Nations, is that nations which have a proprietary interest in the fishing fields off their coasts the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), extend the limits of their sovereignty to include the areas in which fishing is profitable. We have, within the purview of our Constitution, every right and power to follow suit, and I beg the House to consider that more mature nations than Australia, in point of time, that have dealt with the fisheries problem, have insisted on their rights in regard to fishing grounds. The Canadians insisted on their rights in regard to salmon and the Eussians insisted, in the most punitive terms, on their rights in regard to Japanese fishing in Kamchatkan waters and off the north of Hokkaido, and in relation to fisheries elsewhere. The point appears to be that, despite conventions to control international fishing activities, we have not been able to get the Japanese to admit that the whole of the Pacific Ocean is not an open poaching ground. I understand that we have no patrol vessel to deal with infringements by the Japanese on our fishing rights. Such failures to protect our interests are part of the story of Japanese poaching. I mention whaling to illustrate the actions of the Japanese. After the war, because of the difficulties that Japan had in feeding its population, the Japanese were permitted to equip and despatch whaling expeditions to the Antarctic. The result was that numerous whale carcasses were destroyed, the International Whaling Convention was overthrown, and there was an absolute riot of whale-catching by the J apanese. Many years ago the Americans were forced to take effective action against seal-poaching by the Japanese off the Californian coast. The story is the same in all particulars in respect of Japanese fishing activities off the coasts of other nations, including Australia. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, these fishing fleets drift thousands of miles from Japan right down to our northern approaches in search of fish and pearl shell. I think that we have been childishly unaware of the implications of the He position in regard to our pearlshell industry. Before the Japanese bombing attack on Darwin every newspaper in the land screamed out the story of Japanese infiltration in the Northern Territory, as the honourable member for who is a resident of the territory and is well aware of the position, has said many times in this House. Interlocked with the trading problems dealt with by the bills is the matter of our national protection and I think that this should be well considered. There are also other problems involved in the issue. One of them is in relation to the isolated areas in which the Japanese move on our fishing and pearling resources will be made. T° indicate that the leopard does not change his spots, and that the arrogance of the Japanese has not abated since the war, I quote the following extract from a newspaper report that emanated from Tokyo:A fleet of more than 20 small Japanese ships is reported to be preparing to sail on March 15 for a pearl-fishing expedition to the Arafura Sea.",25,Honourable Members N O
91,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [3.43],I beg,26,Honourable Members N O
92,Ture ( Mr Mcewen) To Appreciate Fully,"Tlie Arafur a .Sea lies immediately north of Australia. A Japanese Foreign Office spokesman ( Mr Mitsuo Tanaka) said yesterday that Japan would not hesitate to send the expedition, since Australia is well ahead of other nations slie was within her rights in exploiting all resources on the high seas. Mr Tanaka also said, according to the report, that the departure of the expedition might be delayed, but he felt that although Japan was ready to discuss the situation it must demand its right to fish in the open seas of .the world. Because of its teeming millions of population and the desire to get fish to feed them, Japan has continually encroached on the legitimate preserves of other nations. I do not think that this subject needs to befloggedto death in this Parliament, but there are some precautions that we should take. I should be prone to accept the conclusions of the honourable member for the Northern Territory, who knows so much about this matter, and the views of the honourable member for Kalfroorlie ( Mr Johnson), who also knows a great deal about the Northern Territory and also about the pearling industry at Broome. It all boils down to the simple proposition of whether we have protected ourselves and taken advantage of the rights and powers that are available to us under our Constitution and in the accepted principles of international law, to see that in certain areas the wealth available in and under the sea in the way of trochus shell, beche-de-mer and so on, is made available to the nation adjacent to the fields, which is Australia, or whether we have foolishly let a great opportunity slip through our fingers. Much may be said about the skill of the Japanese as pearl divers, but I have learned from my reading and also from conversation with the honourable member for the Northern Territory that natives are being trained in the Northern Territory now for that very work. If we have lost the initiative in Broome and the adjacent areas to a great degree there are other parts of the western and northern coast of Australia where we should see that we protect our rights. ""We should ensure that we do not lose the initiative at Thursday Island and other beds that are not yet fully dredged of the precious mother of pearl. These places Mr Haylen. should be protected for the Australian community. It is just a case of hard business against a very hard protagonist. in regard to adherence to agreements reached at international conventions, but the Japanese have a very bad record as poachers. I am not embarking on a hate campaign against them. Sooner or later we shall have to accept their presence around us and with us, but for the time being let us be conscious of the facts of the position and take every advantage of the legal and natural justice of our claims in relation to fisheries. We must ensureI am certain that it could be done without drastic amendments to the bills-first , that the waters under which lie the profitable products covered by these measures are safeguarded as an asset to the Australian community; and secondly, that the fleets of sampans that come southwards will work, not as poachers, but in accordance with the conventions. I do not know how the Government could enforce the implementation of its decisions when it has not even a ferry boat in those waters. The first thing to do is to get some sort of patrol system operating in the north again. If we do not do so, we shall again be asking little Japanese skippers, who perhaps are officers of the Japanese naval reserve, to chart our coasts. A thrust southwards by the Japanese may be made again. Erom the commercial and international aspects, there would be justice in a claim for the control by us of pearl shell and trochus even up to within 50 miles of our coasts. We do not know the extent of our pearl shell and trochus assets yet, but let us preserve them for this developing nation. I commend to the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition. The right honourable gentleman has said that we must watch the position warily. The measures may give rise to hazards which the Government should keep closely under observation. We must maintain the security of Australia; we must preserve our commercial rights; and we must deal with a former opponent fairly in this business, not sentimentally, and in a manner that would result in us being done in the eye in the future as in the past. -honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Nelson), who speaks with considerable knowledge of this subject, referred to security, native welfare and our national interest in the pearling industry. Those are important matters, which should receive the attention of the Government. It is strange that no agreement bas yet been reached with the Japanese Government in connection with the activities to which these measures relate. We have entered into agreements with other countries, but Japan, a nation that is of vital concern to us in this connection, has not been called upon to sign an agreement. The effect of Japanese pearling activities upon the security of this country is a matter that vitally affects all Australians. Prior to the outbreak of World War LI., Japanese pearlers in our coastal waters obtained valuable information that was used to the detriment of. our countrymen during the war. We appear to have left ourselves open to a recurrence of that state of affairs. In the absence of adequate safeguards, Japanese pearlers might again take advantage of their operations in Australian waters. The security aspect of the matter has been stressed by fhe honourable member for the Northern Territory, quite rightly, because, when all has been said and done, the Northern Territoiy and Western Australia will be most affected by the operations of Japanese pearlers. I should like the Minister for -Commerce and Agriculthat adequate safeguards -will be provided in this connection, and to explain why no agreement has yet been concluded with the Japanese. Our national interest in the pearling industry cannot be overlooked. That industry could be a great advantage to this country. The wealth of our northern waters should be reaped by us, rather than by the pearl fishers of other nations, especially of Japan. I believe that we -rushed too hurriedly into the signing of the Japanese peace treaty, and it may be that, under this legislation, we shall grant prematurely to the Japanese certain rights that could ""well be delayed for :a considerable time. I do not wish to perpetuate old hatreds, but many of us believe, that, at any rate for a certain period, Japan should be called upon to do -penance for many ' of the crimes that it committed against us. Under this measure, we may be rushing to do certain things that could well be left for a considerable time. I view with a certain degree of concern the readiness of members of this Government and of somrother people to rush into agreements or arrangements with the Japanese people, without having taken full and adequate precautions to protect Australian interests. The general tenor of the speeches delivered on these biU.3 by honourable members on this side of the House is that we must ensure that Australian interests will be protected adequately, first, under the amendments proposed by the measures, and secondly, under any agreement entered into with Japan. The Government has an obligation to provide effective safeguards for security reasons for the protection of the pearling industry and to give practical support to the proposals that have been .advanced by tlie honourable member for the Northern Territory, the honourable membeifor Kalgoorlie ( Mr Johnson) and other honourable gentlemen on this side of the chamber who have a close knowledge of the various factors involved in tliis matter. I hope that the Minister will take those comments into consideration. I believe that the points that have been raised are important, and that they should be considered carefullv by the Government before finality is reached upon any agreement with the Japanese, particularly in relation to pearling operations in Australian waters. considering these measures, it is important to realize that they, and the two principal acts, are not directed specifically at Japan, but are designed to deal with a problem that may arise from time to time in connection with the operations of nationals of countries other than Australia. It so happens that, in the past, the people of other nations who ha-va engaged in pearl fishing and other type3 of fishing in Australian coastal waters have been, in the main, of Japanese racial extraction. Therefore, it is assumed by",26,Honourable Members N O

95,Mr Pollaed (Lalor) [3.5s],"I nsome people that this legislation is specifically directed at the Japanese people. More important still, there is in the minds of the Australian people, very naturally, the thought that perhaps this Government and its predecessor have not acted as strictly in conformity with the necessities of this problem as they should have done. The two principal acts, which were enacted last year, provided a set of safeguards and a set of rules and regulations to be observed by the nationals oi any country that operated in Australian territorial waters, or even in Australian extra-territorial waters. there is still a feeling that, in the main, they are directed at the Japanese people. That is very natural. The Australian people remember that during the last conflict, people of the Japanese race inflicted frightful atrocities upon Australian troops and Allied troops. One has to ask: 'Will that always be a racial characteristic of the Japanese? In passing, let me mention that, whilst the tendency of the great mass of the Australian people is to say that it will always be a racial characteristic of the Japanese people, my attention was directed recently to a very admirable article published in one of the Melbourne newspapers. In that article Dr. C. E. Bean, the distinguished Australian war historian, stated that the bestial characteristics so shockingly exhibited by the Japanese during the last war are not exclusive to any people on this earth, and probably would not again appear in the J apanese. We view, these measures from that viewpoint. directed to policing and preserving Australia's fishery wealth in territorial waters for the Australian people to the degree that they are entitled to it. The bills are also directed to ensure that any people who chose to fish or exploit Australian fisheries or pearling grounds shall do so under conditions laid down by the Australian Parliament. Government should ensure that the conditions under which our fishing areas may be exploited shall be rigidly observed by the nationals who enter those waters, and also by our own nationals in respect of labour and certain other conditions. It is also desirable to ensure that this Mr Pollard. Government shall be enabled to put its own regulations into force. The Government should also ensure at the earliest possible time, in view of past neglect by all Australian governments and of the fact that Japanese expeditions are already on the way to certain fishing grounds, that some agreement is entered into between the Japanese Government and the Australian Government in regard to operations in our coastal waters. It is very rarely that I commend a government of an opposing political Nevertheless, party, but I commend this Government for having proposed amendments to the legislation to ensure that the measures that were enacted last year shall be used more effectively. During the committee stages of the bill I should like the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr McEwen) to explain why it is necessary that a pearl-shell diver shall be licensed while the trochus or beche-de-mer operator is not so required. I do not know why a distinction has been drawn between these two kinds of divers or swimmers. Together with my colleagues. I support the measure.

The purpose of these measures is to enable the proper supervision of the shell fish and the swimming fish in waters adjacent to the Australian mainland and our territories. I should not think of offering a contrary view upon law to that of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), but I do not think that he fully conveyed to the layman what he had in his mind when he was giving an opinion about this legislation. He said that the Constitution empowers the Commonwealth to legislate in respect of certain remote waters. That is quite true. The Parliament is given power under the Constitution to legislate to the three mile territorial limit, and constitutional power is not required to enable the Parliament to legislate in respect of an Australian iu a foreign country. However, any such legislation would not inherently confer upon us the power to enforce such laws. That is the point that the right honourable gentleman did not bring out clearly. The Constitution gives us an unquestioned right to legislate in respect of Australian citizens, but in order that our legislation shall have any validity in remote waters over Australian and other nationals it must be designed in conformity with international law as well as Australian law. All this is preliminary to the negotiais no such element in this legislation. The tion of an agreement, first with Japan, and perhaps later with other nations. It would be untenable for Australia to seek to persuade the Japanese to limit, purely by voluntary agreement, their activities in waters in respect of which we have not taken power to limit the activities of our own nationals. Therefore, this legislation is the first step to ensure that we shall have a sound basis for negotiations with the Japanese by first ensuring that we shall have certain power over our own nationals and, to the degree that international law permits, over the nationals of other countries. It is regrettable that, this kind of control over the waters almost every honourable member opposite who has spoken on these measures, excluding the honourable member for Lalor( Mr encroachments upon our mainland.

However, other honourable members of the Opposition raised the matter of fear and hatred of the Japanese, and created a wrong atmosphere in this House of the Australian Parliament. If we are to live iu peace with our neighbours, we must impress upon them that we have no need to fear or hate any country, and we must indicate in good faith that we hope to reach understandings with the other peoples of the world which will enable us to live together in harmony. There has been too much talk by honourable members opposite about wars that have their origin in trade. On behalf of the Government, I want to make it crystal clear that there legislation is intended solely to lay a foundation for the proper conservation of shell fish and swimming fish in the Australian waters, whether territorial or beyond territorial limits. It is an historical fact that although the Australian Constitution has empowered the Australian Government to legislate in respect of such matters as this for 50 years, no government has done so. It has remained for the present Government, probably belatedly, to be the first Australian government to initiate legislation to empower the Commonwealth to exercise contiguous to our mainland and territories.

A clause, of the treaty specifically provides that a. signatory power may call upon Japan, to negotiate an agreement in relation to the matter.

We do not desire to adopt an attitude of dominance in this matter. We invited the Japanese to come to Canberra.

In asking the Japanese to come to Canberra, we have not adopted the attitude of a victor placing his heel on the neck, of a defeated enemy. We have no desire to perpetuate anatmosphere of enmity towards the He took no steps, before that Japanese. I hope that the Australian people will not regard our attitude as betraying the softness of a "" sucker ""'. This legislation was introduced because the legal advisers of the Government informed us that our legislation agreements had should be made more watertight. The principal amendments in the bill are designed to that end. The bill contains other subsidiary amendments. The honourable member for Lalor has asked why there should be a difference in the licensing of what; may be termed a "" dress "" diver and a "" skin"" diver. Originally, provision was made for the licensing of persons engaged in diving for pearl shell, beche-de-mer, and. other sea products referred to in general terms in the legislation,, but: we apparently overlooked the fact that: Australian natives and Australian nationals are engaged in skin diving in. shallow waters along our coasts to collect beche-de-mer.

The Treasurer ( Sir Arthu r Fadden), in his second-reading speech, indicated to the Parliament that it was essential that the provision of that amount of money should be approved by the Parliament if the liabilities of the Government in respect of war pensions were to be met. It is regrettable that the right honourable gentleman did not state that the Government intended to appropriate a larger sum than £37,000,000 for this purpose. A close examination of the appropriations for war and other pensions clearly indicates that, during the last few years, war pensioners have been placed in a position of substantial disability as compared with other sections of the community. The wages of workers are varied by the Commonwealth Arbitration Oourt to meet variations of the cost of living. The salaries and allowances of members of parliament have moved upwards as inflation increased. Business people, as their costs increase, pass on increased charges to the public. In some instances, bond holders have received higher rates of interest on their investments. All of this movement has taken place in order to meet the galloping inflation that has been a feature of the economic lif e of A u s t r a l i a since this Government took office in 1949. Of all the people in the community, war pensioners have been severely handicapped because insufficient appropriations have been made by the Parliament to cover their needs. When the Treasurer read his brief second-reading speech he itemized the war pensions appropriations that have been made during the last four years. The right honourable gentleman blandly in formed us that the figures were a3 follows:.£ 194950 .. .. .. .22,023,000 195051 .. .. .. 27,532,000 -1951-52 . . .. .. 35,506,000 1952-53 (estimated) . -35,879,000 At first glance, one would he inclined to say, "" D u r in g the last four years the Menzies Government, which has been responsible for protecting the economic",31,Honourable Members N O

The honourable member must address the Chair. propaganda disseminated by honourable members opposite about war pensions when I was a member of a government. If the present Government had acted in accordance with the precedent established by Mr Curtin in 1943, and bad appointed an all-party committee of this Parliament to consider anomalies in the administration and payment of war pensions, the current appropriation for war pensions would be very much larger than it £37,000,000 as a very generous appropriation for war pensions. What are the facts? When the Chifley Government was in office the basic wage had begun to rise slightly. In August, 1949, it was £6 7s. In October, 1949, it rose above that amount by a few shillings. The basic wage at present is £11 l is . a week. That extraordinary increase in a little more than three years is due to the fact that in the intervening period the costs of commodities that constitute the basic needs of life of every human being, but particularly persons on the lower ranges of income including war pensioners, has risen substantially. No doubt Government supporters will claim that the increase of the appropriation for war pensions from £22,000,000 in 1949 to £37,000,000 this year is a generous gesture to the recipients. Such a submission will not satisfy me. The increase of the appropriation is not .so generous, proportionately, as is the increase of the basic wage granted under arbitration court awards. In truth, the war pension has not kept pace proportionately with the increase of the basic wage since 1949.

127,Mr Pollard,"My complaint is tbatyour decision, Mr Speaker, but I sbould like to point out that the need for a larger appropriation for war pensions is accentuated by the fact that the total number of war pensioners in 1949 was 289,771, whereas it was approximately 354,000 in 1951. Therefore, on two counts, the appropriation is inadequate. Those counts are, first, that the shocking inflationary conditions have reduced the value of the war pension in relation to the basic wage, and, secondly, that the number of war pensioners has increased by approximately 64,000 between the 30th June, 1949, and the 30th June, 1951. The Opposition supports the bill enthusiastically, but expresses its grave regret that the amount of the appropriation is so completely inadequate. I also regret that the forms of the House debar me from discussing pension rates, or from moving that the amount of the appropriation be increased. The Opposition supports the bill support the bill after all the complaints that the honourable member has made about it? were to oppose the bill successfully, the Government might resign, and the payment of pensions would be unduly delayed. I emphasize the Opposition's view that the pension should be increased so that the amount may reflect increases granted to persons who work under arbitration court awards. People who are able to demand high prices from the consuming public determine their own standard of iiving. But the standard of living of the war pensioner is determined by the Government. Let this section of the community be given comparative justice. My criticism of this bill has been fair. allow a discussion on rates of pension. It is most regrettable that the Government has not seen fit to appoint an all-party committee on repatriation, as the Curtin Labour Government did, in order to remove this subject from the sphere of party politics. Had such a committee been appointed, some formula might have been evolved, in the light of experience gained since 1943, which would have enabled recipients of war pensions to enjoy the higher standard of living to which they are undoubtedly entitled. -Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [4.36] -The honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) said that he did not pose as a mathematician. I accept his estimate of his own ability, and shall not argue that point with him, because I am firmly convinced, after having listened to his speech, that he has not done himself an injustice. When the honourable gentleman was in his heyday as Minister for Commerce and Agriculture in the Chifley Labour Government in 1949, the appropriation for war pensions was £21,000,000. The appropriation proposed in this bill is £37,000,000. That is an increase of approximately 60 per cent.

I agree with the honourable member for St. George( Mr Graham) that a government looks upon these matters differently from an opposition. No doubt he was correct in saying that the Labour party, when it was in power, saw good reasons why it could not accede to the requests that were made by the Opposition of that time for an increase of the total appropriation for war pensions. But that fact does not in any way invalidate our present arguments. In fact, it strengthens to ex-servicemen for injuries that they our case because, if the present Government parties realized in 1948-49 that the total appropriation for war pensions was insufficient, they must realize now, in the incapable of earning almost normal light of the figures that have been produced, that the present provision for war pensions is woefully insufficient. Therefore, I hope that our case will be carefully considered by the Government. The Opposition cannot hope to influence the Government to increase the amount of the proposed appropriation, but the facts ought to be put in the hands of supporters of the Government, so many of whom are ex-servicemen, to be used as a potent weapon with which to compel it to increase the sum to an amount reasonably in accord with the minimum standard established by the Labour Government for war pensioners, a standard which, according to statements made by members of the present Government parties, was not adequate even then and which has since, owing to its serious decline, inflicted severe hardship and suffering on pensioners. I was not a member of this House in annually. Doubtless it has been influenced 1948-49, and therefore I am not in a by the increase of the cost of living, but position to comment on the decisions that it has had regard for the fact that many it made at that time. However, it seems thousands of war pensioners are not comto be apparent that the Opposition in pletely dependent upon their pensions. 1948-49, like the present Opposition, Of 220,000 war pensioners, 190,000 are made political capital with its tongue in able to earn a livelihood. That reduces its cheek. I realize, Mr Speaker, that the number of pensioners who are the debate has wandered away from the dependent on their pension income to Bill 1953. terms of the bill hut, as a powerful argument has been presented with considerable histrionic ability in order to indicate that the cost of living should be related to the proposed appropriation for war pensions, it is only fair and just that I should state the factors that govern departmental decisions in these matters. The great weakness of the argument in relation to the cost of living is that a vast number of the war pensioners for whom the Government proposes to appropriate a sum of £37,000,000 do not depend entirely upon their pensions. In fact, 170,000 base-rate pensioners earn normal award wages. It is not true to say that these pensioners are dependent upon their pensions for the maintenance of their lives. The fact is that the base-rate war pension is a form of compensation made available sustained in time of war and which, though they are of a nature deserving of a pension, do not render the pensioners livelihoods. Should a pensioner's injuries render him incapable of earning a normal livelihood, he may have himself classified as a totally and permanently incapacitated ex-serviceman. vious speakers, the honourable member is departing from the subject of the bill. Mr Speaker. My sole reason for having done so is to answer the charge that has been made by honourable members opposite. The important fact is that totally and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen, who depend entirely upon their pensions for the maintenance of life, have been granted pension increases that are much greater than those made available to other base-rate pensioners. The Government has increased war pension payments until its commitments in this field have been raised from a total of £22,000,000 annually to £36,000,000",36,Arthur Eadden

I support the remarks that have been made by other Government supporters, and in particular I stress the importance of the views of ex-servicemen's organizations to which the ""Vice-President of tbe Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) has referred. These organizations do not want the rate of war pension to be related to the basic wage, because such an association would lead to variations of the pension both upward and downward, with the result that, in times of depression and low standards of living, when the recipients would need their pensions most, the rate would be at its lowest level.

Whatever tlie political colour of a government may 'be the number of men who, in Bheir old age, find themselves suffering from disabilities that they believe to be war-caused increases by thousands every year. Those men consider that they are justly entitled to pensions in respect of disabilities that they believe to have resulted from war service. The money to increase war pensions should be found somehow because every one of the 6,000 or 8,000 applicants who have been refused war pensions has a genuine belief that his complaint arose from, war service. able gentleman is now trying to to open up the subject of entitlement to pension. I was about to put was that the amount of £37,000,000 to be appropriated for war pensions this year is not sufficient to provide for men who have been denied entitlement to war pensions, but who genuinely believe that they 'are entitled to them. The real test is not whether the Government is expending more on war pensions this year than it did last year, or than some other government did in the past. The allocation should guarantee to ex-servicemen the pensions to which they believe they are justly entitled. There is room for greater understanding on the part of the people who have the job of 'determining how this money shall be expended. I know that a great political argument can be based on a comparison of the proposed expenditure on war pensions of £37,000,000 this year with the sum of £18,000,000 expended for that purpose in one recent year, but the point is whether the amount proposed for expenditure this year will do the job that should be done. Every honourable member who is honest would admit that he knows of cases of men who are morally entitled to war pensions but have been refused them. When I consider a bill of this kind my thoughts turn to those men. Let us, particularly for the sake of ex-servicemen of World WarI . , inject some flexibility into the methods by which eligibility for war pension is decided. If a man is prepared to risk his life in the defence of his country, when he returns from the war he should be given those things 'to which he is justly entitled as a result of any disability from which he suffers due to his war service. I know that claims for pensions are dealt with on the grounds of physical incapacity, physical inconvenience and the like. One group of pensioners will receive no extra payment as a result of the operation of this measure. For that reason alone, I say that the proposed appropriation is insufficient. I ask honourable members to bear in mind that 180,000 disabled ex-servicemen are still working, although they should be relieved from the necessity to do so. Many of them have another two or three years to go before they will become entitled even to the "" burnt-out"" pension. Surely every honourable member knows of ex-servicemen who will not be assisted by this proposed appropriation. The Opposition says that, the proposal is inadequate, not in order to gain political advantage but because it realizes that there are thousands of returned servicemen who are entitled to a little more assistance than could be given to them from this sum of £37,000,000. honourable members desire that justice shall be done to people who receive war pensions. A comparison has been made of the £22,000,000 that was appropriated for this purpose during the last year of office of the Chifley Government, and this proposed appropriation pf £37,000,000. If we bear in mind the decrease of the value of money since 1948 and the increase of the number of people who are entitled to participate in the benefits of appropriations of this kind, we must all be satisfied in our minds that the justice that we believe should be done to war pensioners will not be achieved under this measure. The value of money to-day is only a half of what it was in 1948. On that basis, the appropriation should be at least £44,000,000. In addition, the report of the Director of Eepatriation has indicated that 65,000 more people are entitled to participate in benefits of this kind. Therefore, if we want to do .justice to war pensioners, we should make the appropriation £58,000,000. The members of the Opposition"" will support the bill, because we do not want to delay the grant of this benefit, meagre",39,Arthur Eadden

188,Mr Costa (Banks) [5.17],"Allas it is, to war pensioners, but we complain about tbe inadequacy of tbe proposed appropriation. I appeal to tbe Government to bear in mind tbe figures that I bave cited, and I urge it to try to treat war pensioners more justly when other bills of this kind are introduced. honourable member for Banks( Mr Costa) referred to the treatment of ex-servicemen by the Chifley Government in 1948. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr apprehension. He mixed two kinds of Haylen) will recall that he, as a returned serviceman, was most dissatisfied with the degree of consideration that was given by that Government to the proposal in relation to pensions that was advanced then by ex-servicemen's organizations. The appropriation that was made in 1948 was not sufficient to enable pensions to be paid at the rate that ex-servicemen's organizations considered to be adequate. I know that the honourable member for Parkes put up a great fight within his own party for an increase of the appropriation, which was positively niggardly. Ex-servicemen's organizations were only some of the organizations that combined in 1949 to ensure that the Chifley Government should be put out of office, in the hope that its successor would treat ex-servicemen more favourably. The honourable member for Blaxland( Mr E. James Harrison) read a newspaper report of a statement made by the Sydney branch of the returned servicemen's league, if there be such a branch, to all ex-servicemen's organizations, with the the effect that pensions should be related to the basic wageI remind the House that the federal executive of the returned servicemen's league has always been adamant that pension rates shall not be tied to the basic wage. The Sydney branch of the returned servicemen's league, if there be such a branch, was not competent to make a statement of that kind to the press, because the constitution of the league provides that no branch shall make a press statement. The statement to which the honourable gentlemen referred may have expressed the view of a branch of the league, but certainly it did not express the overall view of the league, or of any other' ex-servicemen's organization of which I have knowledge. I have a considerable knowledge of the opinions of all ex-servicemen's organizations in this country, with the exception of the Australian Legion of Ex-Servicemen and Women, an organization in which I am not particularly interested. The honourable member for Blaxland said also that a number of ex-servicemen were obliged to continue to work because their rates of pension were not sufficient to cater for their requirements. The honourable gentleman was under a mispensions This proposed appropriation is in respect, not of service pensions but of war pensions. War pensions are paid to ex-servicemen to compensate them for a disability, and the rate of payment is based upon the limitation that the disability imposes upon earning capacity. The war pension is not intended to be a payment that will enable an ex-serviceman to live without working, if he has no other source of income. If an ex-serviceman has a certain degree of incapacity, he becomes entitled to the pension payable to a totally and temporarily disabled man or to a totally and permanently disabled man. Therefore, the point made by the honourable member for Blaxland was not applicable to this case. I consider that the proposed appropriation is based upon a fair computation of the rates of pension and the number of recipients, and that it will be sufficient to meet the present requirements of pensioners. Contrary to the statement by the honourable member for Blaxland, exception, perhaps, of the Australian Legion of Ex-Servicemen and Women applaud whole-heartedly the repatriation measures that have been introduced by this Government. AlthoughI move constantly in returned servicemen's circles. I have not heard any criticism of the pensions for which provision has been made by this Government. able member must' deal with the bill. statement made by the honourable member for Blaxland. The proposed appropriation of £37,000.000 will be sufficient to meet the requirements of ex-servicemen. I consider that the suggestion of honourable members opposite that it be increased is only a political gesture.",40,Arthur Eadden

Having supported the previous Australian Government in England, and Labour Government's policy on immigration, which has been continued by the present Government, I regret that it is now necessary for me to advocate an alteration of that policy. Last year the Labour party fully considered the. matter of immigration, and the general feeling among members of tbe party was that we should restrict immigration to those who are nominated by persons already resident in Australia who guarantee employment and housing to the new arrivals, and the wives and families of immigrants who are already established in Australia. Although such a modification of our policy will restrict the flow of immigrants. I believe that under our present economic conditions it is necessary. Apart from a few Italians who have caused disturbances, the immigrants who have most criticized our policy are British tradesmen. To illustrate that submission I desire to mention the experience of a Scottish-born friend of mine who, with his wife, visited Scotland last year. He is a good Australian, but visited his homeland for the same reasons that most of us like to return home. While he was in Scotland he sent me a copy of a newspaper printed and. distributed in the town where he was residing. That newspaper published a trenchant criticism of the Australian immigration system, and the article was likely to interfere with the flow of immigrants and injure the good name of Australia. That would indicate that there are many people in the United Kingdom who, although having the welfare of Australia at heart, are willing to criticize our immigration system.

I had been an immigrant, they would have led. me to believe that I would be able to get a home, of my own in Australia within a reasonable time, and be able to live under similar conditions to those which I had left.. The Minister for Immigration recently indicated that British immigrants would be able to leave their hostels for homes of their own after about twelve months, and that European immigrants would be housed after about two years. However, about eight or nine months ago I visited an immigrant hostel in my own electorate and spoke toa British tradesman and his wife. He had served in the British Navy, and was an excellent type of citizen. His wife was the kind of woman we need in Australia.. He brought his wife and three children out because he wasunder the impression that he could get work at his own trade, which was carriage building. He applied for work at Islington, in South. Australia, and was told that there was no demand for men of his trade in Australia. After endeavouring for some time to get a job commensurate with his skill, he finally had to take a labouring position with Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand Limited. They told rae that they had expected to get their own home,, and that they certainly did not wish to live the communal hostel life that they were forced to endure. They complained about the food served to them at the hostel, and, although it would have suited me; doubtless the way it was served and the general' living conditions were objectionable to people who had not had to live iu that fashion in their homeland.

Those cottages could have been, sold if people had had about £750 to put down as a deposit, although in some cases only £250 was required as deposit on a. house costing £2,750. Immigrants could not afford to buy thoie houses. The practice adoj>ted at the immigrant hostel at Gepp's Cross, in the Sturt district of South Australia, should be followed all over the Commonwealth. The State housing, trust has taken over the administration and control of the hostel and installed electric stoves in the flats, thus enabling the immigrants to do their own cooking, and to prepare meals that are to their liking. Some months ago the immigrants at Gepp's Cross asked me to visit the hostel and to examine the conditions undei' whicii -they were living. After making an inspection T realized at once that they woulcl not be satisfied until provision had been made to enable them to look after themselves.

It is regrettableto se"" constant references in the newspapers to demonstrations made by dissatisfied immigrants. These demonstrations will do nothing to further the immigration scheme and the evils that give rise to them should be remedied.

They are I do not want to weary honourable members by reading the whole of the report. I merely point out that one of the immigrants concerned stated that he had had only one month'swork in three since he arrived' in Australia. The men were assured of three months' f r u it picking at Mildura but they are apprehensive about the future. A similar position exists in South Australia. About twoor three weeks ago a tra-inload of immigrants left Adelaide for Eenniark to engage in fruit picking there. Although they were happy to undertake the work, they were worried about their future after the fruitpicking season had ended, particularly about the threat of unemployment during the winter months. Fearsof that kind have been expressed by immigrants in all Eecently,, at the Prison Gate Brigade Home, in Adelaide, disgruntled immigrants were involved in a nasty disturbance.. The. immigrants asked that they be given an. assurance of continuous work or be sent, back to the countries from, which they came. A balanced, programme of immigration necessitates the makingof proper arrangements, not. only for the employment, temporaryhousing and assimilation, of immigrants ontheir arrival in Australia, but alsotheprovision of suitable permanent housing accommodation for them. They should not be expected to compete with Australian citizens in. the limited housing market now available. able member's time hasexpired. am intensely interested in the subject of immigration. I have asked several questions in this House in an endeavour to relieve the hardships imposed upon immigrants who work in the coal mining areas of New South Wales but I have not been able to elicit any information from the Government. I am concerned principally about the position of British immigrant coal-miners employed in my electorate who are housed in Nissenhuts which were originally used 1 in Great Britain for the Bevan boys who were conscripted to work the coal mines there. I have previously described of the igloo type, and are constructed of iron which malces them entirely unsuited to Australian climatic conditions. Most of the huts are leaking badly. Complaints about them have come principally from British immigrant miners in the Cessnock, Belmont and Kurri Kurri areas who are playing a very important part in increasing coal production. For these huts the unfortunate men are charged a rental of £2 15s. a. week, plus 10s. a week for furniture which consists of a. small table, two single beds and an ice chest! In an endeavour to have their grievances rectified the men have held numerous meetings which have been, attended not only by myself but also by representatives of the miners federation. When the Minister acting for the MinisStates of the Commonwealth. ter for the Interior( Sir Philip McBride) visited the Cessnock area on one occasion he was shocked by the conditions under which the men were living: He reported the matter to the Minister for Immigration, who in turn passed it on to the Department of the Interior, which has since conducted negotiations with the New South Wales Government with, a view to remedying the defects in the huts.

The honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Dean), who has interested himself in this matter has been more successful in obtaining information about it than I have. Obviously, the honourable member is given information so that when it is published in the press and in association with the name of the honourable member the people will infer that "" Old Rowley"" is not doing his job. I appeal to the Government and to honourable members opposite generally to play the game. As honourable members are aware until I became a member of this Parliament I was a coal-miner. When I was working in the mines petty stoppages of work were always taking place for one reason or another. Since British immigrants have been employed in the mines, petty stoppages have been almost eliminated. The British miners, who have done a splendid job for Australia, sbould not be penalized by having to pay exorbitant rent for accommodation in huts which I have described as nothing more than exaggerated tanks. The Government has erected a number of prefabricated houses in the mining areas which it has offered to miners at the exorbitant rent of £3 19s. 6d. a week. They are still unoccupied. I understand that the Government is now prepared to hand over these houses to the State Government. I asked a question on that subject this morning, but I could obtain no information about it.

Opposition) General( Mr Anthony), in his second reading speech, gave a glowing account of this bill, but, in the end, he was forced to headway since the fighting ended in 1945, admit that it was merely an interim measure that would provide statutory authority for the establishment of television services in Australia. I propose to show that the bill could have been described more aptly in this way: "" A bill to pretend to do something definite about television after years of delay on the part of this Government"". Whilst pretending to set up a dual system, sucb as we have in broadcasting, the Minister has taken arbitrary powers which could lead to the creation of a dangerous monopoly for one or two groups which he favoured. That is the effect of the bill. The Minister may, in his graciousness, allow the Australian Broadcasting Commission to operate a television programme, or authorize a person or company to operate television services. The bill contains a series of bare, unrelated powers which are not connected with any plan except the statement made by the Minister in his second-reading speech. There has never been anything like this bill in this Parliament. In the mechanics of television, we are lagging behind other countries, because this Government has never been able to make up its mind. It has permitted itself to be influenced, and, indeed, is still being influenced, by pressure groups of various kinds. Television is the will-o'the-wisp. From time to time there is a little show of activity-no t too much, but a little-the n the subject is again pigeonholed. I assert that the Government, in introducing this measure, is not genuine. It hopes to gain a party political advantage by pretending to do something. Therefore the bill is a sham. Television is not a new discovery. It is 50 years old in Great Britain. The British Broadcasting Corporation started on television in 1932, and adopted the present 405-line standard for regular programmes in 1937. The war set television back for equipment reasons, because in dealing with television we are dealing with one of the most important defence industries, which is now broadly described as electronics and which played such a [8.0] -The Postmastervital part in the winning of the war, particularly in connection with radar.

202,Dr. Evatt (Barton,"Leade r of theand is now a major industry in the United States of America. It is in operation in Canada, France, Italy, West Germany, Holland, Sweden, Norway and many of the countries of South America. What has been done in Australia? A broad scheme-no t a final one, because television was still in the experimental stage-wa s laid down by the Chifley Government, but the present Government has simply talked, and is still talking, about television, ancl has not clone anything to give the people a service. This bill will not take us a step nearer televimemorandum to the Postmaster-General sion. The Chifley Government authorized the establishment of television, and appointed the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to deal with the matter. A senior technical oflicer of the Postmasterhave gone ahead; but it failed to go General's Department, who is now a member of the board, was sent round the world to investigate television systems, and report on the standards that should be adojited here. The Chifley Government determined specifications after an exhaustive examination of the services in operation in the United Kingdom and the United States of America, and it was decided to introduce what is known technically as the 625-line standard as against the 525-line used in America and the 405-line in Britain. I can only form a judgment on the basis of reports and my own reading on the subject, but I think that the scheme, had it been adopted, could have placed Australia in the lead on the technical side. The Postmaster-General in the Chifley Government called for tenders as long ago as the l l t h August, 1948, and they closed on the 20th January, 1949, for the immediate establishment of television stations in the six capital cities. Had they been established, they would have given services to 60 per cent, of the people. It was then estimated that the service would be in operation by January, 1951. Eleven Australian and overseas manufacturers submitted tenders to supply and install the equipment. Additional information had then to be obtained. The Government was about to accept the tenders when one of the firms issued a writ claiming that the acceptance of the tender would be unlawful. That action caused a major delay. The board ancl the Postmaster-General's Department submitted further recommendations for the acceptance of tenders covering the six capital cities, and the matter was held in abeyance pending the general election in 1949. The present Government announced that it proposed to permit privately owned stations to operate television services. The Government asked the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to submit a report on the way in which stations should be licensed, and the board submitted a in February, 1950, indicating alternative ways of carrying out its policy. That occurred nearly three years ago. If the Government had had a plan, it could ahead. On the 27th June, 1950, the Postmaster-General announced that, instead of carrying out the Labour Government's plan for the commencement of television services in the six capital cities, there would be, in the beginning, only one stationa national television station-in Sydney. He also indicated that the Government was prepared to grant one commercial television licence for Sydney, one for Melbourne and "" in any other capital city where it felt that the applicant's capacity to provide the service justifies the issue of a licence"". What an expression! The Government would give a licence to a commercial enterprise if everything was all right. The statement was completely vague. The Government announced those as what it called "" firm decisions "", and promised then that television would be in operation in Australia within the next two years. In the meantime other countries were going ahead with the establishment of their services. More delays occurred in Australia. The Government promised to introduce a bill dealing with television in 1950. Nearly three years later, it introduces this bill, which the Postmaster-General has described as an "" interim step"". The Government also decided in 1950 that the tenders submitted in 1948 were out of date, and, accordingly, new specifications were framed on the 7th September, 1950, for a single television station in Sydney. Once again, manufacturers were involved in considerable expense and researcii work; but nothing has since been done. The tenders are again out of date. If tbe Crovernment ever did decide to go ahead with the matter, tenders would be called for a third time, and the old routine would have to be gone through. The truth is that the Government has stalled on these matters, and has involved manufacturers, .local and overseas, who have submitted tenders', in considerable expense. They were asked to submit firm tenders, and they did so. In view of the alterations of price levels since that time, because every body knows that prices haye skyrocketted in the interval, all those tenders are no guide at all to present-day expenses. The next step in the tortuous history of this matter was taken when the Tele vision Advisory Committee was appointed in December, 1950. The chairman of that committee was the chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, Mr the bill, the Minister could give.a monoBoyer, and the members were the chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, Mr Fanning, and the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, Mr Chippindall. The committee recommended that a special mission on television be sent abroad to study what was happening overseas. It was only another excuse for delay, as Mr Fanning and the chief technical officer of the board had already beeu overseas for that very purpose. There were no representatives on that important mission of any interests other than the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Postmaster-General's Department, and the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The members of the mission were away for five months, and, according to an announcement made at the time, returned to Australia in May, 1951, with all the latest technical information. Meanwhile, the tenders were still in the pigeon holes, and dust was .accumulating on them. An active campaign of propaganda vision stations which, in its opinion, can then began to develop. The next thing bc effectively established and operated, we heard of television was the visit of having regard to the financial and ecothe Postmaster-General to 'South Africa. nomic considerations involved and the Actually, that journey was not associated availability of suitable programmes. with television. another important mission relating to mission could report that it considered civil announced -subsequently that he would station, at any rate for an 'experimental Dr. Evatt. extend his travels and study television on behalf of the Government. He had the opportunity to do so, and on his return to Australia said that he ""had all the answers"", and did not want any more inquiries. He submitted his views to Cabinet, but was overruled. He opposed the idea of a royal commission to investigate television, but the Government appointed a royal commission for that purpose. Why has the Government introduced this bill? I have already given my description of it, and I do not propose to discuss its provisions. Obviously it simply gives to the Minister a power under which he may grant a monopoly to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, if he so wishes, by not granting any other licences for the operation of television services. I am speaking now of the bare legal power. Under the provisions of poly to any commercial station. No plan is involved in it. The Government is really frightened that it will offend some one. It thinks that if it issues a licence to one interest it will offend another interest. So it will! The Government is afraid that even the national television service will alienate some supporters. Tlierefore it has appointed a royal commission to inquire into television, but it has not asked the commission to submit its report within any specified time. It need not make its report for twelve months, eighteen months, or two years. Some kind of policy should be laid down on these matters. I do not offer any personal criticisms of the members of the royal commission. I point out that the terms of reference have not been made wide enough to meet the present situation. I need give only one example to prove this to the satisfaction of any fair-minded person. The commission is asked, first, to report on the number of national and commercial teleHe was engaged on Under that term of reference, the comaviation. However, it was that there should be only one television period of a number of years. How can we, in tbe circumstances, proceed to discuss this bill, wbich gives the Postmasterknow. General unlimited power to grant as many licences as he wishes? Np member of the royal commission has a knowledge of tbe technical aspects of television except perhaps the chairman of the broadcasting control board. He -is not a technician in the sense that he is a scientist, but he has been a member of the board for some time. The third member of the broadcasting control board,. Mr Ogilvy, resigned from his position at least two years ago and his place has not yet been filled. All the proceedings of the board since, then bave been null and void, because the statute provides for a membership of three. The Government has treated this matter with extraordinary casualness. The Postmaster-General was asked a question in the House today about the vacancy caused by Mr Ogilvy's resignation, and he replied that the Government was considering the matter. It has been considering the matter for a couple of years now! It seems to me at first glance that everything that has been done by that board since Mr Ogilvy resigned-no t that it has done very much-represent s just so much wasted effort. That is how broadcasting in Australia is being administered under this Government. There is to be nobody with judicial exhas been appointed chairman is a properience on the royal commission. Somebody like, the former Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir John Latham,, a completely independent man able to assess evidence,, should have been appointed to it. Such a member would have been extremely helpful. I do not criticize the chairman who has been selected, Professor Paton, but the fact is that he lacks the qualifications and experiof Melbourne. He has been appointed to ence of a competent jurist. Certainly the membership of the commission does not include anybody with knowledge of the practical aspect of the entertainment industry, and television must be regarded to some, degree as an entertainment although not: entirely so. If it were merely an entertainment,, of course, it would not, be worth having. It. must provide something more than entertainment. None of the Government's appointees has been associated with the. operation .of a television station anywhere as. far as I able gentleman want the experts to be appointed to the commission, or does he want them to be called to give evidence before it? that people could write to the commission to make suggestions, and I imagine, therefore, that they will not be called as witnesses to give evidence. Thus, the task of the commission will not be entirely that of assessing evidence, and it would be advisable to include in its membership somebody who has knowledge of the technical aspects of television. The Church of England Primate, Dr. Mowll, recently had this to say about televisionTelevision is undoubtedly tlie most powerful force in determining thc outlook and standards ofchildren that has appeared in the last century. Surely the churches have a completely detached view of this matter. They have no commercial interests to serve, and one might reasonably have expected them to be represented on the commission. In fact, I made a public statement to that effect recently onbehalf of the LabouT party. The membership of the commission will not include an educationist, because the distinguished professor who fessor of law, but is not in the ordinary sense an expert in the specialized technical field of education. of the University of Melbourne. am not criticizing him, because I realize that he is a very able professor of law as well as Vice-Chancellor of the University administer a certain aspect of the university's work, but he does not pretend to be an authority in the specialized field of education. The membership of the commission does not include any representation of industry, on behalf of either management or the trade unions. The membership consists, so far as I can judge, of a representative of each State. Most of the members are' supporters of the present Government.",45,Television Bill 1953 Second Reading

206,Dr. Evatt,"I am aware of that. ISir PHIL IP McBJBIDIS -That is wrong. There may be exceptions, hut the comments that have been made by some of them suggest that they are supporters of the Government. That does not disqualify them from serving on the commission, but the Government should have achieved a balance instead of heavily loading the commission in its own favour. There should be representation of the other side of politics as well. If the purpose of the inquiry is to make sure that we shall avoid mistakes that have been made in other countries, there would have been merit in bringing experts to Australia from overseas. I have in mind men like Sir Ernest Eisk, who is one of the greatest television experts in the world. However, the commission consists of only one representative of each State. Apart from the chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, the members will have to acquire the basic knowledge essential to an understanding of television. The appointment to the cornmission of the chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board is open to grave question because one of the directives to the commission is that it shall approve standards which the board must obey. The result of the Government's decision is that the report of the commission will consist of the combined opinions of six members. How much time those members will be able to devote to the affairs of the commission is a matter of considerable doubt. The chairman has an assignment in London next May, and he must prepare for that. Therefore, there will be delay. The commission should be required to make its report witliin a specified period of time. Its terms of reference are a condemnation of thc Government, because they cover the ground that the Government tried to cover in its pronouncement of policy in 1950. Will the Government give an undertaking that it will accept the findings of the commission, even if they run counter to the views of the Postmaster-General? If not, what purpose will the commission serve? Such a measure of confidence should be reposed in it by the Government if it is to make some definite contribution to the future of the television industry in Australia. The bill lacks a plan. It does not specify the conditions under which television may be conducted in Australia. It states no principle. Under its terms, we could have a commercial monopoly or a government monopoly. The Minister appears to suppose, if his second-reading speech is a reliable guide, that the alternative to a government monopoly conducted by a statutory corporation like the Australian Broadcasting Commission is a completely commercial undertaking. That is not so. An illustration, which is not far-fetched, immediately springs to my mind. The Government might decide to give a television broadcasting licence to one of the great churches because of tbe effect of television on the people from the point of view of education and moral guidance. The granting of such a licence would be a guarantee that the programmes broadcast under its authority would be properly conducted. Nobody would call that a commercial venture, even though the church conducting the television station might have to make charges for advertising. I have cited this hypothetical case only for the purpose of emphasizing my point that it is wrong to imagine that, in the absence of a government corporation like the Australian Broadcasting Commission, there must be some completely commercial organization operating solely for profit. The bill contains no policy. It merely specifies legal powers under which either monopoly television or competitive television may be given the signal to go ahead. It will not promote the development of television in Australia in any way, and it does not satisfy any of the questions that arise in our minds when we consider the granting of television licences. It leaves the whole matter entirely in the air and leads to no conclusion. It contains no statement that will bind the Government. Let us consider one point of detail that must be dealt with sooner or later. Who will operate the government stations if television licences are made available for such stations? The bill refers to an authorized body"". But what will be the authorized body? Is it to be a political instrument of the Government?",48,Television Bill 1953 Second Reading
207,Dr. Evatt,"That is my opinion.Under the terms of the bill, the Postmaster-General will be able to make his own terms and conditions. He will be given an open cheque. Clause 4, which refers to the granting of licences for commercial television stations, confers the widest possible arbitrary powers upon the Minister. The provisions in relation to the granting of licences for such an enormously important service should specify definite conditions. Why should not the terms be laid down in the bill? A special authority should be established to deal with the granting of licences. This matter is too important to be made the subject of absolute unfettered ministerial discretion. How long will a television broadcasting licence endure? There is no specification in the bill. There is no provision to govern the number of licences that may be issued to one organization. It will be possible for the Minister to grant a monopoly to one organization of private stations or to a single group of interests. There is no limit to the number of stations that may be operated under the control of one organization. There is no provision for the payment of licence-fees, either by viewers or by television broadcasters. If there are to be no such charges, the fact should be disclosed. But nothing is disclosed in the bill. There is no plan in it. The Postmaster-General merely asks the Parliament to grant to him, through this measure, complete autocratic powers to impose his own terms and conditions in relation to television. The Parliament should not grant such powers to him at this stage. It should be asked to consider a clear, specific and fully disclosed plan. In fact, a refusal by the Parliament to pass the bill would not delay television in any way. Neither will the passage of the measure accelerate its establishment and development. It' is still possible for the Government t'o accept time by the Australian Broadcasting a tender from those that were submitted originally. Furthermore, it could call for additional tenders if it wished to do so. Either the royal commission is unnecessary or the bill is premature. This attempt by the Government to have an independent inouiry into the number of licences that should be issued is incompatible with its pretence that licences may be issued under the terms of this bill as the Postmaster-General thinks fit. The findings of the royal commission, if they are worthwhile and based on evidence, should be the basis of legislation passed by this Parliament. The findings of the commission must be either accepted or rejected by the Government. But that should not end the matter. They should tben be considered by the Parliament. Either the inquiry by the royal commission .should be abandoned, or this bill should be withdrawn. The Government cannot have it both ways. The bill appears to be one of a. series of delaying tactics employed by the Government because it cannot make up its mind. The majority of the Government's supporters in this House are sceptical of the measure. The experimental stage of television in Australia has been too long delayed. The plan to establish experimental stations in the six State capital cities has been abandoned, although it would have been implemented if the Chifley Government had not been defeated and would have given a practical start to television in Australia. This bill should be subject to safeguards. It should include watertight provisions against the use of television in the political field by the government of the day. We have had some experience of the political use of normal broadcasting during the last couple of years under the regime of this Government. Government supporters may laugh, but it is a fact that, since the present Government has been in power, it has been very diflicult for the Labour party to obtain the right to reply over national stations to statements on political matters that have been made over the same stations by representatives of the Government. gentleman is given more broadcasting Commission than anybody else. The Minister is becoming too self-conscious. National station broadcasts every Sunday night are full of statements by the honourable gentleman, not always consistent with one another. He has been granted ten times as much broadcasting time over national stations as has been granted to any other Minister or member of this Parliament.

He concludedWhen all these questions have been examined, prudence could well demand the introduction of television in Australia on au experimental basis only. I offer no opinion on these questions. I merely submit that wider the most favorable conditions there will be a good deal of trial and error-expensiv e error-in television. The question is, what should be done with a bill of this character? Consideration of it by this House cannot be adequate at a time when the Government has established a royal commission before which all the experts w i ll be invited to give evidence. We should have the benefit, not so much of the report that w ill be made by the commission, but of the evidence given to the commission on which the report w ill be based. That makes common issues before the royal commission overlap w i th the issues that we have to determine here. It is of no use to have an act of Parliament that says that the Minister may grant to any one he chooses a licence to conduct television. If it is not intended that that authority be exercised, then the giving of it to the Minister is completely misleading. It amounts to a pretence. I move That all words after ""That"" be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following words:-""thi s House declines to proceed with the second reading until the matters contained in or arising from the bill are impartially investigated and a report thereon furnished to the House and that, for such purpose, the terms of the Royal Commission on Television issued on the l l t h February should if necessary be extended, its personnel increased to secure broader and more effective representation, and the evidence and thc report made available to the House not later than l l t h May, 1953 "". « That w ill give three months for the comvery painfu l speech.

The next point in the amendment states that the personnel of the commission should be increased to secure broader and more effective representation. On sense, because the very behalf of the Opposition I made a statement about the representation of technical experts on the actual royal commission, and representatives of the churches and of industry, and I have made similar comments in the course of this debate. Those are matters which should precede a decision by the House.

How different his speech would have been had he not been subjected to that embarrassment, because it is noteexample of a man who, by contortion, worthy that the right honourable gentleman made no reference to the principles contained in the bill. He moved an amendment which, like Gilbert's "" flowers in this instance has been rather successthat bloom in the spring"", has nothing to do with the case. When the right honourable gentleman began his speech he used some words with which I propose to deal, because I think that before we get down to an examination of principles, we should expose the right honourable gentleman in all the hypocrisy he has used in dealing with this matter. He said that this bill pretended to do something. What has the right honourable gentleman been doing since he made his statement to the press to which I have referred? He has been pretending! He pretended throughout the 40 minutes of his speech to-night. One could not call him the "" Young Pretender "", but he is certainly the "" Great Pretender "". He said that we had yielded to pressure groups. Here is a man who aspires to become Prime Minister of this country in due course, who says, "" I believe in dual licensing with regard to television "" and then yields to the pressure of his deputy leader, and of the president of the Labour party and finally, to-day, meets his final humiliation from his own caucus.

219,Mr Eeic J. Haeeison,"Forgiv edepart. So, when the Leader of the Opposition talks about building monopolies, he talks with his tongue in his cheek, because there could be no greater monopoly than the socialization of television or of broadcasting, which is the main .plank of the policy of the party that he leads. The Leader of the Opposition will adopt any stratagem to curry political favour. He will even defy his own party. He has a record for doing so. He has done so, not only in connection with television, but also in connection with the Communist legislation. He defended the Communists in the courts of this country, and his own party took him to tasks for doing so. I point to these matters in passing the highlights of that history. The because it is as well to examine the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony), upon points of history that the right honorhis return to this country from overseas, able gentleman conveniently forgot to made a statement in which he outlined mention when he was dealing with this the Government's policy. That policy is subject. He poses now as a moderate, and that there shall be national and commerpresents his party as a kind of whitecial stations. It has been published to washed socialist party.

On the 24th November, honourable member for Eremantle ( Mr the honourable member for Melbourne, who Beazley). But the important point is is, as I have said, the Deputy Leader of that, although the Labour party has in the Opposition and the custodian of the dulged in some kind of a white-washing socialist plans of the Labour party, made process in regard to its policy, it has a characteristic statement to the press. never rescinded the socialization plank We heard what he said about Transto which every member on the other side Australia of the House, before he faces the electors, National Airways Proprietary Limited. is pledged to give effect. I have tried to He said that, when the Labour party show that, although there are some people was returned to power, it .would tear up within the party who are staunch upthe agreements that had been made with holders of Labour's principles, the leader those organizations. of the party is prepared, like the successNovember he stated that the next Labour ful captain of a windjammer, to trim government would promptly cancel all his sails to any wind that blows. The television licences issued by the Menzies leopard cannot change his spots. The Government. He went on to sayright honourable gentleman cannot change his blots-and he has many-in regard to the handling of the political situation lation to allow a private enterprise to debauch from Labour's point of view. Now, as a crowning indignity, caucus Labour party made television a government has dumped him. It has forced him to monopoly and it w ill keep it that way, even come into this House and swallow his if greedy interests think they can change the words. Caucus has told him that there situation to their own advantage. is a junta, greater than the elected repreHonorable members on both sides of the sentatives of the people, which decides the House will acknowledge that that is an policy of the Labour party. Caucus has indication of the dictatorial attitude that blindly accepted its decision and disevery socialist adopts in dealing with the ciplined its leader. He has come into this people. The honourable gentleman, in House in a most embarrassed state, and characteristic fashion, said that when has endeavoured to convince the people, Labour was in office it would force the by moving an amendment of this nature, that he considers the bill is not necessary. That was not what he said when he made his statement to the press. He has come into the House in an endeavour to save his face. At the direction of his party, he has eaten the leek. He has my sympathy. I am sorry for tbe right honourable gentleman, but he must remember that he has brought this upon himself. I have pointed out that this is only one of a series of embarrassments that the Leader of the Opposition has had to put up with. What is the history of this matter? I said that I would endeavour to give the House some of Airlines and Australian On the 24th Labour will oppose tbe passage of all legistho minds of grown-ups and children in the way American television companies do. The people to listen to the programmes that it wanted them to listen to and to look at the programmes that, it wanted them to look at. He. said, in. effect, "" When we have the. opportunity to exercise those powers, by George, we shall do so. If you, the Government, dare to give to the people of Australia the right to choose their own radio and television programmes, we shall destroy that freedom when we are returned to power "". The Leader of the Opposition, this great jurist, this learned gentleman steeped, in the law, who seeks to express the fairness that comes naturally to him as a result of his long association with the law, revolted at that statement by his deputy. He forgot that he was leader of the socialist party. He thought that he was still on. the High Court Bench, dispensing justice and fairness.. He thought that he was still the custodian of the freedom of the people. How disillusioned he must be to-day! On the 25th November, the day after his deputy had spoken, he made a statement. He did not wait for two or three days to go by. He did not wait to consult his party. He was exalted by a desire to preserve the liberties of the people and to give them a free choice, as was his wont when he was on the High Court bench. Without thinking, recking little, he saidAustralia will probably rely upon a dual system in which the Australian people will own a service and commercial stations will also do so. This will be along the lines of the present broadcasting system. The right honourable gentleman, as a great champion of the liberty and freedom of the people, said, "" Those are the things that I shall do "". But his deputy said, "" You may be the leader of the party, but there is a junta behind us that is greater than you, and which has no need to face the electors. It has laid down our policy, and that is the policy to which you must give effect"". So the right honourable gentleman forgot the freedoms of the people, he forgot justice and he forgot the rights of the poor man. He sought his own political advantage, and he said, "" I am sorry. I am prepared to do what you want me to do, provided you will let me be leader of the party. That is what I want. I am not concerned to stand for principles Mr Erio J. Harrison. when my position, is at stake. To me, the position is much more important than principles "".. The honourable member for Melbourne went to. a formerPostmaster-General', Senator Cameron-, and said, "" Look here, Cammy, old boy, we cannot let the leader get away with this, because he is wrecking-the party. Be a good boy and come in with me. We will break this fellow down "". That is what happened. Senator Cameron came in, supported the honourable member for Melbourne and administered a rebuke to the Leader of the Opposition. That was followed by a very sharp rebuke from Mr Eeece, the federal president of the Australian Labour party-the federal president of the body that decides the policy of the Labour party. The Leader of the Opposition was being steam-rollered. He was being brought into line-not . reluctantly, I admit, because if he had not.done so he would, have ceased to be the leader of his party. Mr Eeece saidI t has generally been accepted that Labour is opposed to the exploitation of television by commercial interests. That was an. understatement. That policy was enunciated in a bill that was sponsored by the Chifley Government. The whole thing was cut and dried, and there was no getting away from it. I say, with great respect, that it was only the political ignorance of the Leader of the Opposition that got him into this trouble. Although he was Attorney-General in the Chifley Government, and although he was the person who drafted legislation that put the policy of the Labour party upon this matter beyond reasonable doubt, apparently he forgot that legislation. Or did he think that his own personal interests were of. far greater importance than were the interests of the party that he represented? Honourable members can decide whether they believe that the right honourable gentleman, who was responsible for the drafting of the legislation to which I have referred and is steeped in the. law, forgot so important a matter. Everybody knows that, despite the Blackburn declaration and the subsequent watering down of that declaration, the policy of the Labour party is still socialization, as it was when it sought to socialize the banking system of this country. The Labour party is still a socialist party and is still wedded' to tbe principles of socialism. shamed its own leader in this House and before the country. So strong is the socialist feeling in the Labour party outside this House that it is prepared to revile anybody who dares to dispute tbose principles, and it has even reviled its own leader. reviled by the people at the recent general elections in New South Wales. gest that the previous Labour Government was reviled by the people when it sought to introduce the socialization of banking in this country. The people will not easily forget that socialization is still was the present Leader of the Opthe policy of the Labour party. The electors will feel a certain amount of satisfaction in remembering, after the debate on this bill has concluded, that the Leader of the Opposition, that moderate gentleman who has declared that he will not take any socialistic steps against any organization unless it adversely affects the people generally, is still a member of the Labour party, ancl that whatever action that he may take in the future will be decided by a junta behind the party. The right honourable gentleman may go out to the people and mouth his promises and cajole and mislead them, but when a bill is presented to the Parliament by a future Labour government he will not be the man to make the ultimate decisions. always remember that. The honourable member for Melbourne has made his position perfectly clear, and he would not be Deputy Leader of the Opposition unless he subscribed to the socialist policy of the Labour party. In order to put that statement beyond reasonable doubt, let me saythat when a colleague of his in the last Labour Ministry said in 1945 that he would not allow people to own their own homes because he would not make little capitalists out of them, the honoT'able member for Melbourne said, in effect, "" I am and always have been anticapitalist "". the honourable member for Melbourne says sary, to centres where work was available. "" Hear, hear!"", but it is well that all Dio] these facts should be remembered by the people because the honourable member for It bas embarrassed and Melbourne is a practical and unashamed socialist. In 1948, Senator Cameron, who was then Postmaster-General-and I ask honourable members to take careful note of this matter, because it fits into the socialist pattern-sough t to take complete control of the Australian Broadcasting Commission system. Drunk with power, he considered that it was impossible that the people should not accept the Labour Government's promises at their face value. Consequently, he described a measure that he brought down as one which would give the Minister almost dictatorial powers. Let us consider who drew up that measure. It position. Who supported the measure and who gave the Minister dictatorial powers? Almost all the honourable members who sit on the Opposition benches gave him those powers. In other words, the Opposition advocates that listeners to broadcast programmes or viewers of television should listen to or view only what a socialist government would allow them to. The Opposition would allow the public no choice. The people would be required to look at what the socialist party wanted them to look at, and to listen to what the socialist party wanted them to listen toand, by George, they would like it ! If they did not that would be just too bad, because the Minister would have dictaThe people should torial powers and would ensure that if the people did not bow to his wishes they would get nothing else. Contrast that Labour policy with the policy of the Menzies Government, that every citizen should have the right to choose his own programme. It is essential we should not be a regimented community, and that our people should still be able to exercise their free choice. This itch to control influenced the Labour party when Mr Chifley sought to direct people to work in such a way that no person would have had the right to choose his own business or employment. On a certain occasion he said that people would have no right to live in their own homes continuously, they would be trans-",53,Television Bill 1953 Second Reading

The Opposition would evengo so far as to nationalize Bob Dyer and Jack Davey. the Vice-President of the Executive Council. able member for Watson( Mr Curtin). advantages and disadvantages of television, and its effects on children and adolescents, have been considered by the Government. I have seen television in England and America and I know the pitfalls that must be avoided. The public has discussed these matters at great length, and consequently the Government has, rightfully and deliberately, refrained from laying down conditions under which television will be conducted until the views of the people have been heard. Hence the Government set up a royal commission to investigate the whole matter. The Leader of the Opposition apparently would have added two church representatives to the members of the royal commission because if he had put one church representative on the commission he would have had to add a second. not. He would also have added employers and trade union' representatives and experts. We would have had a royal privates. Half the community would have been on the royal commission. The tribunal set up by the Government will take evidence from all interests. WhatI have said must make it abundantly clear to. commercial radio stations throughout the country that tlieir position is now just as precarious as was the position of the banks when the socialists sought to nationalize banking. In the light of what has happened through the Labour party humbling their leader by force majeure, they should take notice of the signs of the times. They should notice that the Labour party, feeling an upward surge of elation because of State election victories, is again advocating its socialist principles to the detriment of all those interests which stand for freedom in this country. am glad that I was here before the Vice President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) began to speak, because otherwise I would not have known the nature of the bill being debated by the House. So many subjects and personalities have been thrown into the debate by the Minister that the Opposition has been given the impression that he believed he was being televised for the amusement of those who could not be amused by any other means. His unfortunate display to-day is not in keeping with the high office that he holds, and it is not to his credit that he should have delivered a futile diatribe on a completely serious matter. He has acted like a person who has something to hide, and he has chosen rather to rant than to face the rational charges made by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt).

237,"The Opposition Would Say, Mr Andrews (Darebin) [9.10]","Icliarges, and has discussed everything but the bill before the House. Eather than follow that unworthy example I propose to discuss the measure now before honourable members. The Postmaster General( Mr Anthony) said that we all agreed that television should be made available to the Australian people. Indeed, clause 3 of the bill sets out that the Postmaster-General may make television stations available. As the Leader of the Opposition said, the bill does not indicate when this clause shall have effect. In other words, there is nothing specific as to time in the measure. The Vice-President of the Executive Council has made no reply to that charge. I do not accept thc premises of the Postmaster-General, and I suggest that after the House has heard my reasons for saying that it will agree that they are good ones. Not only has the Postmaster General left open the date upon which this legislation shall come into operation but he has also failed to indicate how much further it will widen the disparity between the city and country amenities, a matter that is of such great significance at present. Perhaps he could reply to those charges later. In any event, I do not agree that television services should be introduced immediately. Let us ask whether the present is an acceptable time to introduce a great service such as television. The Postmaster General said that there was merely a difference of opinion about detail. What he means by "" detail"" is quite vague. "" Detail"" may be some matters upon which the Leader of the Opposition has already touched-that is whether there are to be national stations only or a. dual system. The Government has a majority in the House but recent State elections have indicated that it certainly has not the confidence of the people. There has been ample illustration of that fact. The Government has a very doubtful moral right to introduce a measure of this kind into the Parliament at present. When it is about to hand over office to another governinent it is pretending that it is about to establish a principle which will have far-reaching effects on the economy of Australia. That, however, is quite a minor point compared with another question of detail that must be cleared up. I refer to the state of our economy. I pause to repeat the question I asked earlier: Is this a suitable time for the introduction of television in Australia? To that question there can be but one emphatic answer. In answering it I could not be more emphatic than was the Minister for National Development ( Mr Casey) in October, 1950, when, by analogy, he spoke of our "" muscle "" and "" f a t "" categories in constructional work. The right honourable gentleman will remember that he then described television as "" f a t "" and called upon us, to use his own words, "" to concentrate on providing muscle ""-h e described muscle as the construction of basic materials and "" to cut out all this nonsense about ' f a t ' "" . speech. right honourable gentleman. However, he had no sooner given that advice to the House than he went on to say that we must introduce the "" f a t "" in small quantities, implying that a little bit of "" f a t "" might then be introduced. That was the most illogical portion of his speech. The first part of his speech was sound, but the advice he subsequently tendered was completely illogical. would do well to quote the whole speech. able gentleman wishes me to do so, I should be prepared to quote from it extensively in order to prove the truth of what I have said. He cannot claim that our economy has improved since he made the statement. If I remember aright, only a few weeks ago the basic wage was raised by another ls. a week, so that the inflation that already existed when the right honourable gentleman made the statement still goes on. The Government, in taking this step, notwithstanding the excellent advice given by the Minister for National Development in the speech to which I have referred, has placed its members, particularly the Minister for National Development, in a very peculiar position. To speak of the cultural value of education by television, when the States are starved for school buildings and teachers-the very means by which",57,Television Bill 1953 Second Reading

241,Mr Andeews,"If the right honorpeople can be made sufficiently literate to understand tbe value of or to use television intelligently-to indulge in an orgy of spending for entertainment while urgent hospital building is at a complete standstill, and to advocate the provision of amusement "" f a t "" while our economy is such that we cannot raise a necessary loan, is to cast this Government in the role of Nero. It is simply fiddling while the House of the Commonwealth is being brought almost to a state of destruction. The Government might very well look into that aspect of television. After Ministers have heard a number of Opposition speakers discuss this bill in terms of the economic position of Australia they will be prepared to give a very attentive ear t'o the amendment proposed by the Leader of the Opposition. To establish television in Australia is a microwave relay system. If the Capital to talk in terms of millions of pounds. It is immaterial to our economy whether those millions of pounds are provided by the Government or by private enterprise. That which is urgently required will be set back because of the action taken by the Government in providing amusement "" f a t "" about which we have heard so much. Industries which are in serious need of all the basic materials will be retarded as the result of this venture in television. Let me give one illustration of that. The writer of an article published in Teleview in December, 1950, states that on a site at Gore HiU selected for the Sydney station, a 500-ft. mast was to be erected, and that, because of space limitations, the mast would be a self-supporting structure with a base of about 50 feet square and using about 150 tons of steel. As honourable members well know, steel is one of the commodities that is very iirgently needed for public works of all descriptions, and a mast is but a small item in the huge works that will be involved in the construction of television stations. I have been led to believe that Mr Arthur Warner and his son, Mr Graham Warner, the directors of Electronic Industries Limited, made a proposition to the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) to establish television in Australia and that the company was prepared to build three stations and connect radio relays which would Mr Andrews. cost many millions of pounds. The company indicated that it was prepared to raise the necessary money by public subscription, but that if difficulties arose as the result of the operation of the capital issues control the company had the necessary funds to finance the construction of the stations. The September, 1952, issue of Teleview states that the company was tossing television guided bombshells at the Government as fast as they could be turned out. The company placed before the Government a far-reaching scheme which, in the opinion of the Prime Minister, represented "" an entirely new approach to the television problem "". The scheme itself was a simple one. Electronic Industries Limited offered to build television stations in all capitals immediately and link them with Issues Board stood in the way, Electronic Industries Limited had the cash necessary to erect stations in the three largest capital cities. As a final master stroke Warners offered to hand over the network to the Government at cost price for a national service, thus overcoming objections from many sources to the introduction of a commercial system. That seems to have been a most remarkable proposition to come from private enterprise because television would undoubtedly become a government monopoly; but these people had so much confidence that they felt that they could submit their scheme to the Prime Minister with a reasonable chance of having it accepted. Thus, television would take millions from our economy, and vital materials urgently needed to meet our immediate needs would be diverted to "" f a t "" in the form of amusement. There can be no justification for the immediate introduction of television. Our overall economy is obviously No. 1 priority. I have been informed somewhat authoritatively that television links between Sydney and Melbourne will cost up to £7,000,000. I have also been informed that, for a similar amount of money, approximately 600 additional telephone channels could be provided between those two cities. Less than 100 channels are now available. I do not think that any one would have difficulty in deciding which of the two represents a "" muscle "" service and which represents a "" f a t "" service. for the Government to provide television Does not all this prove rather conclusively services for people in rural areas. The that an inquiry, particularly an economic breach between city and country will be inquiry, should precede the introduction still further widened. People will como of such a measure as that now before from the country to the cities so that us? That is precisely the proposition they may enjoy the benefit of this new placed before the House by the Leader type of amusement. The effect of the of the Opposition. Whichever way we introduction of television on our economy look at the matter, television will greatly is a most important consideration. Whilst affect our economy and no scheme of this I contend that this country cannot afford kind should be brought before the House to indulge widely in television at the preuntil it has been made the subject of a sent time, it is still less able to afford to proper economic inquiry.

It is not often that such a simple measure as the Television Bill 1953 introduces a subject so complex and full of difficulties, Leader of the Opposition, about the and even dangers or gives rise to so much deliberate misunderstanding on the part of the Opposition. After all, the bill is simple enough. First, it merely authorizes the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony) to make available television stations for operation by the Australian Broadcasting Commission or some other approved authority. Second, it makes possible the licensing of commercially-supported television stations. Third, it restates the authority of the Australian Broadcastit proposes to authorize private enterprise ing Control Board as set out in the Broadto enter the television field.

With the one exception of permitting the introduction of commerciallysupported television, all the other matters otherwise. The measure merely removes should not worry the Opposition one bit, because members of the Labour party tell us that they believe in a government monopoly, and furthermore, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board is their own creature. Therefore, Opposition members are really complaining that this bill constitutes a re-statement of Liberal faith in this particular matter. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. await the report of the royal commission Evatt) has said that this bill confers on on television which the Government has the Minister the right to create a monoseen fit to appoint. poly in television.

If it is right and proper for members of the Opposition to voice their political faith in such a destructive way that they destroy the confidence of investors in industry, surely they are on very poor ground in attempting to deny us the right to express our political faith .through the medium of this bill. The only departure that it makes from the present situation is that the Government to grant license immediately, or in the near future, for the operation of television, commercially or the prohibitions of section 103 of the Broadcasting Act of 1942, which provided that the Minister should not grant licenses for television, frequency modulation or facsimile except on the rccommeddations of the Standing Committee on Broadcasting.

In my opinion, the clamour about the delay in the introduction of television which has arisen from those wlio for various reasons, desire to get in through the early doors of television, is ill-advised and most unfortunate. We have two examples of the sort of things into which we may easily blunder if we hurry the introduction of television. The first is the statement of the Leader of the Opposition who said that years ago the Chifley Government wanted to establish a television station in each of the television and the programmes are limited six capital cities. The right honourable gentleman mentioned that plans were made for that development and he stated in another part of his speech that Great Britain for years had 405-line television. Had Australia introduced television iu accordance with the proposal of the Labour Government years ago, the system would have been the 405-line. In the meantime, increased technical knowledge of the subject has led to what will undoubtedly be adopted by the world, namely, 605-line picture definition. So, had the Labour Government proceeded with its plans years ago, Australia would now have a. frozen system with outmoded technical standards. Therefore, we have gained something from the delay. While members of the Labour party to the general public.

Our particular problem Advertismg revenues available in this is based oh the population, and the dispocountry, or, for that matter, in any other sition of the population. We must also country, must bear a definite relation to examine the financial resources of the the market for the advertised products country available to support television. and services. The amount of money Thc Leader of the Opposition has done available from advertising allocations me the honour to quote certain published in Australia is not unlimited, and material which I contributed to a Sydney it will not be increased with the mere newspaper in which I asked certain questions. I think that they are quite reasonable, and I hope they will be examined by the royal commission. I asked whether non-commercial television can sustain itself from licence-fees, and whether the commercial television industry can see hope or reasonable expectations of sufficient revenue to maintain a four hours' service daily with programmes of a good standard. The matter of resources must be examined most carefully. In Great Britain, the British Broadcasting Corporation has control, of to four hours a day. The British Broadcasting Corporation considers that the period of four hours constitutes the limit of useful programme material available to it each day. We do not overlook the fact that Great Britain is probably the home of theatrical talent. Thc United States of America, with equal resources of talent, has an average of about twelve hours' television per station each day, but not all the material is of the same standard as that presented by the British Broadcasting Corporation. Therefore, we should ask ourselves how many hours of reasonable programme material can Australia provide from its talent resources, what standards can be maintained, and at what cost the programmes can be made available All these matters lead to a most imporemergence of an additional advertising medium. It is quite probable that the introduction of commercial television will call for the withdrawal from other media of certain advertising revenue. I cannot help feeling that one of the advertising media that will feel the draught, if television on a commercial scale gets under waj-, must be the present commercial broadcasting system. -It is quite evident that we shall not be able to maintain many commercial television stations, and it is also evident, on the technical facts alone, that the country areas will not have a television service for a long time. Frankly, I should hesitate to introduce a new system too early, when the vast majority of the Australian people will get nothing from the new medium, and less from the medium on which they now depend as heavily as the Vice President of the Executive Council( Mr a. new inquiry next year. I confess that Eric Beyond all these questions lie many technical questions that the roya.l commission will have to answer. Most people do not' seem to realize that the heart and core of this problem is in the technical aspects of television. I should like to know what television channels are to be made available for use in Australia. Will they be grouped, or widely separated on the frequency spectrum? If they are to be widely separated, we shall raise for ourselves technical and economic problems in relation to the manufacture of television receivers. It is an interesting fact that many experts in the commercial broadcasting field have said, that they have already chosen sites for television stations. The receiving aerial for a television set must be highly directive in order to be effective and, unless all our transmitting stations are grouped within a reasonable radius, we shall lose the entire directive effect of our receiving aerials. These considerations are not immediately apparent to those who look upon television as merely another branch of the electronic art, but they will have a vital effect on the service that Australia will enjoy. The Leader of the Opposition has quoted my statement that, when we have considered all these aspects of televisionprogrammes, cost, and technical problems -we may well decide that all we can embark upon in Australia for the time heing Ur. Fairhall. is some limited form of experimental television. I repeat that statement now. This will answer the objection by tlie Opposition that the Government is rushing into television before it knows where it wants to go. It has appointed an organization which, I hope and trust, will tell us where we ought to put our feet for safety iu this relatively uncharted field. I do not believe that anybody in Australia knows all the facts about all the aspects of television that I have mentioned. Therefore, I believe that the royal commission is essential. I hope that the Government acted sincerely when it appointed the commission and that this body will make a genuine attempt to solve the problems of the new industry and to lay the foundations for future legislation. If television is to be dealt with in a slipshod manner on this occasion, we shall not he able to conduct J. Harrison) has indicated. I was concerned when I read statements made by the chairman of the royal commission. Professor Paton is reported, first, to have said that the commission is not a royal commission in the true sense of the term but is merely a committee set up to take evidence and' to advise the Government. That statement has resulted in understandable confusion in a very important section of the electronics industry. The subject of patents may have to be considered, as the Leader of the Opposition has pointed out. Should that question come before the royal commission, it will be necessary for the commission to be empowered to take evidence from witnesses on subpoena and to command the production of documents. Therefore, it is important to know wliether this body is merely a committee or whether, in fact, it is a true royal commission endowed with all the powers of a royal commission. I hope that the Government will take the earliest opportunity to clarify this point. mission. that assurance. Perhaps the Minister will repeat it to Professor Paton. The professor has said also that he wants to do a quick job. I should be much happier if he had said that he wanted to do a thorough job, because despatch and efficiency do not necessarily go together.",61,Television Bill 1953 Second Reading

246,Mr Fairhall,"I am glad to hearI reject the suggestion by the Opposition that a miserable time limit should be imposed on the work of the royal commission, and I am gravely concerned to learn that the chairman proposes to go abroad in May. This will lead inevitably to a situation in which the work of the commission will be curtailed, tbere will be unnecessary delays, or else it will have to continue its work in the absence of the chairman, which would be an entirely unsatisfactory situation. Having noted that the chairman has already said that the commission will carry on despite the unavoidable absence of one of its members, it appears to me that he has arranged for it to continue with with its work while he is overseas. This gives rise to doubt concerning the reliance that we shall be able to place on the findings of the commission. I make no bones of my view that the Government would have been wise not to appoint Professor Paton under these conditions, or that Professor Paton would have been wise to reject the appointment. Another ground for lack of confidence in the comniission is the fact that no technical man has been appointed to it. I have thc support of MrH . E. Beaver, the president of the Australian Eederation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations, who has said that he doubts whether the royal commission members can carry out their terms of reference because none of them have any technical knowledge. In his opinion, the crux of the entire matter centres on the technical side of television. I concur in that view. I do not believe that it will be possible for thc declaration. Apparently the right honorcommission to interpret properly much of the technical evidence that will be given before it. It is true that it will be able to obtain technical advice, but surely the senior technical body in this country, the Institute of Radio Engineers, would have been well pleased to submit a panel of members from whom the Government might have chosen a technical man for appointment to tlie commission! It seems also that the Government has succumbed again to the wretched f ormula of balanced State representation. The time has come when we may reasonably expect to be able to find a group of good Australians who are prepared to set aside parochial interests and give their services and talents to Australia for the solution of a national problem. It may be true that balanced representation of the States will pacify some small minds, but we need the best brains to examine what may be one of the most complex problems that we shall have to deal with for the next few years. Notwithstanding all these deficiencies, I believe that the establishment of the royal commission was the only step that a responsible government could have taken. It is evident that, whatever findings may be reached by the commission, a black cloud will continue to hang over the future of television in Australia, if only for the reason that the Leader of the Opposition and his deputy, the honourable member for Melbourne, are not pulling on the same rope. I recall a minority report of the Gibson broadcasting committee in 1942, in whicli, with other members of the parliamentary committee of that day, the honourable member for Melbourne made the following declaration:We have signed the above report and desire to state in a in pi iii eat ion of our views that we believe that the whole of the broadcasting system should be nationalized. The platform of the L«bour party to which we subscribe contains a plank to that effect. At least, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council has pointed out, the honourable gentleman has the virtue of being consistent. He believes in the platform of his party. I wonder whether the Leader of the Opposition, who finds himself obliged not to subscribe to this policy, has in fact signed the party's able gentleman wants to lead television into that dual system which operates so satisfactorily in the field of radio broadcasting to-day. He has even gone so far as to raise some constitutional difficulties against the establishment of a television monopoly. It seems to me that some obligation rests on the right honourable gentleman to begin a campaign, private though it may be, to alter the platform of the Labour party and throw out the socialization objective. It is not astonishing, in view of this confusion of opinion within the Labour party, that its federal president, Mr Reece, finds himself dancing round the ring like a referee trying to order the contestants to their corners and scared to step out for fear that they will resume hostilities. I was interested to hear from the Vice President of the Executive Council that the position has been finally resolved within the Labour party and that a decision has been given against the Leader of the Opposition, who has been publicly disciplined, and in favour of the honourable member for Melbourne, who has his eye not only on the Labour party's policy but also on the seat which the Leader of the Opposition hopes to occupy on this side of the House at some future time. I am happy to support the bill. 1 believe that, notwithstanding any opposition to television that may arise in Australia, we cannot honestly lay claim to being a progressive industrial country ancl, at the same time, deny the application of its modern scientific principles. Nevertheless it is wise to proceed carefully. As I have said, I offer no firm opinions on any of the problems involved in the development of television. I leave these matters to the royal commission and trust that it will do a thorough job in placing the new industry on sound foundations for the future benefit of Australia. further the debate on this bill proceeds, the clearer it appears that the approach of the leaders of the Australian Labour party to it is eminently sound and logical. The Opposition has suggested that the royal commission should report upon all aspects of television before the Parliament makes a decision. I have listened very attentively to the reasons that have been given by Government supporters for the introduction of the bill and they appear to me to be most inconclusive. In fact, the bill itself is premature and stands condemned in the words that were spoken by the Postmaster-General( Mr tion. I cannot understand the GovernAnthony) in his second-reading speech last week. When the Postmaster-General first introduced the bill, he said that it had been introduced by the Government for the purpose of asking Parliament to endorse the general principles on which it should develop television in Australia. It proposed to adhere to the princ-inles which had been applied to successfully to sound broadcasting. According to the Postmaster-General, all that this bill proposes to do is to reaffirm a principle. I am at a loss to understand why that principle should be reaffirmed at this juncture because the Postmaster-General addedAfter the report of tlie royal commission has been considered, the Governinent will make definite plans for the introduction of both national and commercial services and will bring down a more comprehensive measure so as to give Parliament tlie opportunity to debate detailed proposals for its establishment and regulation of tliose son-ices. Seeing that the Government proposes to have a full-dress debate on this matter after the royal commission has given its findings, 1 um at a loss to understand why we are having what I might term this first instalment. Obviously, it is not necessary, because the Government will be influenced to a great extent by the findings of the royal commission. So far, despite the perorations and rantings of the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison), I have been unable to discover a legitimate reason for the introduction of the bill. Obv : ously the Government is trying to gain some political advantage from it, but, the speeches that have been delivered in support, of the measure will do nothing tn achieve tliat end. Thc Government has not advanced any sound reason for the bill. The Postmaster-General said that the royal commission would inquire into the conditions under which the Australian television service would be conducted, and he gave details of six aspects of television that the royal commission woulcl investigate. As the royal commission is to bp asked to bring to light all the different aspects of television about which the Government is not clear, the terms of reference obviously are not wide enough. The amendment proposes to remedy that posiments opposition to it, because television will bave such a profound influence upon the daily life of the Australian people that we should make every endeavour to sift all the evidence so that we may develop a system as nearly perfect as possible. The most contentious question relating to television at the moment is not included in the commission's terms of reference.",63,Television Bill 1953 Second Reading
247,Mr Bird (Batman) [9.55],"Th eThat is the question of dual control. Why has not the royal commission been asked to take evidence upon the necessity or otherwise of dual control? The amendment that has been proposed by the Opposition would provide for that. The royal commission sbould also call evidence from people in all walks of lif e so that points of view that may not be evident can be brought to the notice of the Government. This royal commission should have extended terms of reference so that a f u l l and open inquiry w ill be possible. If the Government agreed to that course, evidence should be submitted as to how commercial television has operated in the United States of America. The royal commission should have information upon the operation of television on a commercial basis. The Government has in t imated that the television scheme that it proposes to inaugurate w ill be half on a commercial basis, and before we embark upon it we should learn as much as possible of the experience in the United States of America, where private control of television has had f u l l sway. The Government has refused to do that. If the royal commission took evidence on tha effects of commercial television upon the minds of the people of the United States of America, it would be informed of the desperate effort that has. been made by sponsors to cut the costs of the television programmes. plaints have been published in daily newspapers about the standards of the commercial television broadcasts in the United States of America. We should sift that evidence before we reach a conclusion here. But the Government has reached important conclusions without taking evidence through the royal commission at all. The royal commission should consider the effect that television w ill have upon the future pattern of Australian life, and particularly upon the children and young people. It should also be asked to examine whether Australia, with its underdeveloped primary and basic industries, can afford at present to devote a sizeable slice of the national income to television. I shall not express an opinion on that point one way or another, because I have not sumcient evidence at my disposal, but the matter is one of great significance. If the royal commission could take more complete evidence, a decision would be reached that would meet with the approval of the Australian people. Because of the cost involved, honourable members on the Government side have asked themselves whether the Government should introduce television at this time. According to press reports, the honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett) strongly criticized the Government's proposal. He is reported to have saidTelevision was a luxury Australia could not afford. The idea was to reduce taxation but television would tend to increase it. . . . Once started television costs would run into millions. Kevenue from television licences would nowhere near cover the costs. . . . How many families would be able to afford more than £100 to buy a television receiving set. . . . The Postmaster-General would be better employed trying to provide telephones for the thousands of people on waiting lists. They are the thoughts of an influential private member on the Government side. Probably there are other honourable members among his colleagues who think along similar lines. The honourable member for Paterson( Mr Fairhall) expressed the opinion a few minutes ago that there are several aspects of the royal commission about which he is not pleased, and said amongst other things that there ought to be a thorough investigation into all aspects of television. He considers that Comsuch an outcome cannot be expected from the royal commission as at present constituted. It can be seen, therefore, that even Governnient supporters themselves are not entirely happy with the Government's proposals. In view of that fact, what would be lost by the Government's acceptance of that amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, which is designed to throw the whole matter open for wide discussion, and increase the membership of the royal commission to enable a close examination to be made of the opinions of all the experts and of competent witnesses in all walks of life? Taking all these facts into consideration I am at a loss to understand the necessity for the bill itself. In my opinion the Government is guilty of undue and unecessary haste. I do not know whether the royal commission as at present constituted will take into considei'ation, although it certainly would under the Opposition's proposals, the high capital and operating costs involved in television. As far as I can gather the coverage of television in Australia will be limited, for many years, to metropolitan areas and their environs because of those high costs. The honourable member for Paterson himself said so. To maintain existing wireless programmes at existing standards in country areas, while television is operating in the cities, will prove extremely costly, because advertisers will not continue to huy time on ordinary wireless programmes in the country at the rate at which they now buy it, but will use the television networks in the cities as their main advertising medium. Consequently we shall have complaints from country listeners about the lower standards of the radio programmes that will be supplied to them as a result of the overshadowing of ordinary wireless transmission by television. Broadcasting stations in country areas cannot be expected to run at a loss in order to maintain existing standards if their advertising revenue declines to any great degree. That is only one of the important aspects of the introduction of television. Has the Government considered that aspect? It would certainly be considered if the Opposition's proposals were accepted. This matter is of vital interest to country radio listeners and I should be interested to hear the views on it of members of the Australian Country party among the Government's supporters. I turn now to the expense of establishing and operating television. I agree with the honourable member for Darebin( Mr Andrews) that the expense of establishing television in this country at the present time when all sorts of national projects are being stultified through lack of money is a matter of vital concern. Vital works projects in my electorate and in the Darebin electorate, including hospitals, are being abandoned through lack of funds. The construction of one public hospital in my electorate had to be abandoned when the work had reached ground level because of lack of money, and the hospital committee has no idea when further money will be made availmatter without taking expert advice on it. Mr Bird. able in order to enable the work to proceed. It is a national scandal when thickly populated districts like Preston and Northcote in Melbourne cannot get sufficient money to build an important hospital at a time when the Government proposes to expend millions of pounds on television, without having had a comprehensive investigation made of the whole matter. Television requires new capital equipment for transmission and for home reception, which is altogether different from the equipment at present used for wireless broadcasting. In addition to the high capital cost for equipment and the provision of elaborate studios, the cost of the programmes themselves is astronomical compared with the cost of radio programmes. An army of workers is necessary behind the scenes in order to make a television broadcast possible. An official of the British Broadcasting Commission has stated that the cost of running a television programme is ten times as high as the cost of running a radio programme. Why cannot the Government have a comprehensive examination made of those aspects, instead of a limited examination which is to be carried out by a commission under limited terms of reference ? It costs the British Broadcasting Commission more than £2,000,000 a year to provide 30 hours of television a week. Its transmission consists of the same programmes broadcast over five stations each with an effective radius of 50 miles. There are 106 television stations in the United States, where the operating costs are 113,000,000 dollars a year. It is generally expected that Australian television stations will operate for only four liours daily, but it will cost more to provide such a television service in the eastern coastal belt of Australia, with its great distances, than television programmes now cost in Great Britain. The reason is that expensive relay equipment will be necessary to cover the great distances involved. Relayed television requires stupendous expenditure on equipment. Eveni n the small area of England the financial burden is heavy, and in Australia it will be infinitely more. The Government is rushing into this If wo accept the premise, as I think most of the television authorities in Australia do, that we shall limit television broadcasting to four hours a day, existing radio programmes will still be necessary outside of those four hours, not only in the country areas, which will have no television, but also in tbe city areas. Country people will desire their present radio services to continue and therefore very heavy financial commitments will be required to maintain present programme standards. I hope that the royal commission will give close consideration to the questiou of who is to finance television services. Irrespective of whether we have dual control or public ownership, the community will have to pay in the long run. A publicly owned system will befinancedby listener's licence-fees. For the listener's licence-fees to cover the cost of transmission they would have to be so high that no government would be game to impose them, and therefore it would be necessary to finance publicly owned television partly from revenue or loans. A privately owned television system would be paid for by increased prices for goods advertised on television programmes, but the manufacturers of goods would meet the cost of television sponsored programmes by raising the price of the goods to the conasked to inquire into the effect upon the sumer. Television could lead to a reduction of tbe price of commodities only if the advertisements resulted in an increase of the sale of thc goods advertised, but the smallness of the Australian market and the high cost of television advertising would rule out that possibility. It is idle, tlierefore, to think that the public will not have to pay for commercially operated television. The plain unvarnished fact which has to be recognized by this Parliament is that we shall not be saving money by establishing a dual system. Television will have to be paid for by the man in the street whoever runs it, and from that point of view it does not matter what system is adopted. The mere fact of having commercial television stations will not mean, as some people think, that television viewers wiil get something for nothing, because that is far from the truth. Only by extending the terms of reference of the royal commission, will it be possible to sift thoroughly all the aspects of this problem. It is clear that regardless of the form in which television is launched in this country, its introduction will place a crushing financial burden upon the community. The only section that would gain from its immediate introduction would be the electronic industries. Perhaps, as the honourable member for Darebin has suggested, those interests have brought pressure to bear upon the Government and have succeeded in pursuading it to introduce this measure so hastily. Television can be introduced into Australia at an early date only at the expense of other projects. Despite the forced optimism that the Government supporters invariably exhibit whenever its economic policy is criticized, our economic future is uncertain and unpredictable. Not only governments but aiso private enterprise aro experiencing difficulty in raising sufficient funds to finance urgent projects. In such circumstances, the Government should have sufficient prudence to refer all aspects of this problem to a royal commission for investigation. The Govornment has acted precipitately in introducing this measure. As the Leader of the Opposition has urged, the royal commission should be community of television programmes of flic type that are now televised by commercial stations in the United States of America. Undoubtedly, we could derive much benefit from an investigation along those lines, particularly as the Government is determined to adopt the dual system. Responsible educational, cultural and religious bodies have expressed grave concern about possible developments in this phase of television. Reports from the United States of America reveal the level to which some commercial stations in that country are prepared to descend in order to increase, the popularity of their programmes. The chairman of the American Government's instrumentality for controlling the allocation of wave lengths, licensing of stations and general broadcasting policy in an address which he delivered last year to the National Association of Radio and Television Broadcasters criticized the failure of American television to make any positive offering in the fields of religion, agriculture and primary and adult education. He stated that the average station devoted 72 per cent, of its total time to entertainment but only .9 per cent, to religious matter. Eminent authorities in many and .2 per cent, to agricultural programmes. He also said that the average station devoted only 3 per cent, of its time to programmes of an educational type and 3 per cent, to discussions. Revelations about the standard of entertainment programmes televised by many American stations makes one l if t one's eyebrows. Recently, a visitor to the United States of America made a survey of programmes purveyed by television stations in Los Angeles and revealed that viewers of such programmes in one week, between 6 p.m. and 9 p.m., were able to see as well as bear 91 murders, seven stage-coach robberies, ten thefts, four burglaries, two cases of arson, two gaolbreaks, two suicides, three kidnappings and one case of blackmail, whilst cases of assault and battery that were televised within the same hours were too numerous to mention. I should like to know whether the terms of reference of the royal commission that this Government has appointed will enable it to investigate this aspect of television programmes that are provided by commercial stations in the United States of America. It is the duty of the Parliament to ensure that the public shall be protected from programmes of that type which appeal to the baser human instincts. Before the Government finally decides to permit the introduction of television on a dual basis it should be guided by the findings of the royal commission with respect to the effect of television programmes generally upon children. It should not tolerate the introduction of any system that would permit the undermining of the moral and intellectual health of the community. Such safeguards are essential, particularly for the protection of the younger generation. The royal commission, in order to inform itself fully upon such aspects of television should be enabled to investigate the system that is now operating in the United States of America. As an educational medium, television stand why their differences of opinion will strongly influence, for good or for have arisen. When the Leader of the Mr Bird. bad, the habits and tastes of our future citizens. It will help to mould or mar the character of our people. The social advantages and disadvantages of television should be fully considered before the Government reaches finality in this countries have expressed grave concern about the social effects of television. Eor instance, the New York Times, in a leading article, had this to sayTelevision is influencing the social and economic habits of the nation to a degree unparalleled since the advent of the automobile. It is having its effect on the way the nation passes its leisure time-ho w it feels and acts about politics and Government, how much it reads, how it rears its children and how it charts its cultural future. This country has never experienced anything quite like it. Having regard to the immense influence that television exerts upon the community the Government should, as the Leader of the Opposition has suggested, widen the terms of reference of the royal commission in order to enable it to investigate all aspects of the problem. member's time has expired. the irony of fate, this bill, which relates to television, a matter closely related to radio broadcasting, is being discussed in, so to speak, radio silence. While the Parliament is confused by the utterances of the Opposition, the listening public has not been given an opportunity to suffer the same confusion. \ Quorum formed.""] Having listened to the speeches of the Leader oif the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and other members of the Opposition, I am still uncertain about what they really mean. Do they, as their speeches appear to indicate, desire that television in this country shall be killed and buried, and that we shall not have it at all? That has been the tenor of their speeches. They have not had one good word to say for television. If that be their attitude, they will encounter great difficulty .if they try to reverse it and to introduce the type of television services that they obviously desire. They want television in the form of a government monopoly. I can under-",65,Television Bill 1953 Second Reading

250,Mr Failes (Lawson) [10.25],"B yOpposition and his deputy cannot agree upon this matter, it is most difficult for their followers to reach agreement. Some members of the Opposition have criticized the Government for its delay in introducing television services. Leader of the Opposition said that when we took office there was a proposal to establish a number of television stations, that we proposed to reduce the number to one and that we did not matter. He said, in a doleful voice, that after three years, all that we had done was to introduce this bill. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Bird) criticized us for undue haste. He said that we were rushing ahead too fast. The honourable member for Darebin( Mr simple bill, which purports to do nothing Andrews) said he believed there should be a long delay in this matter and that we should not hurry, because many problems were associated with it. Where does the Opposition stand? The Leader of the Opposition criticized the Government for its delay in introducing television and said that we were not hurrying as we should do, but some of his supporters criticized us for undue haste and for trying to push ahead with something which they said was fraught with evil, gave rise to all kinds of problems, and probably was not in the best interests of the adults or the children of Australia. The Leader of the Opposition said that television, which commenced about twenty years ago, had made some progress, and then had been held up by the war. It is well known that the greatest advances that have been made in electronics were made during the last war. A feature of war is that it, stimulates scientific progress to a greater degree than does peace. It is unfortunate that very often we have to wait until war occurs before big advances in scientific fields can be made. After World WarI . , it was recognized that, during the four and a half years of that war, medical science made greater progress than had been made during the previous period of-fifteen or twenty years. Much the same can be said of the progress of television or electronics during the last war. The Leader of the Opposition said that television was necessary for defence, and that it. was essential for our technicians to be trained in electronics so that they could be well equipped to assist in the defence of this country. The honourable member for Darebin said that we should send our technicians overseas for training. Onr.e The again, there is a conflict of opinion among the members of the Opposition about the advantages of television and the manner in which television should be applied. Throughout the speeches that have been delivered on this bill by mcmdo anything more about the bers of the Opposition, that conflict has been apparent. The fact of the matter is that the Opposition wants television on its own terms. It wants television as a socialized governnient monopoly, and in no other way. Therefore, it believes that this more than give the Minister the right to appoint commercial television stations, has to be knocked at all costs and in any way possible. The measure contains the usual definitions to clarify the text later on. In clause 3, it is proposed that the Postmaster-General shall be empowered to make television stations available for the transmission of television programmes provided by an authorized authority. In 1948, the Chifley Government introduced a bill to amend the Australian Broadcasting Act, but it was very careful that the bill should go only a part of the distance. It went so far as to refer to "" television stations and facsimile stations, and services of a like kind"". It was designed to ensure that those services should be provided by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, that the technical equipment and operation of such stations would be in accordance with certain standards, and that adequate and comprehensive programmes would be provided by the stations to serve the best interests of the general public. Tbe measure did not go so far as to give the Minister the right to grant a licence to any commercial station to provide television programmes or facsimile programmes. That is tbe reason why this bill has been introduced. This measure is designed to give the Minister the right, subject to regulations made under the Australian Broadcasting Act, to grant to a person a licence for a commercial television station upon such conditions and in such form as he determines. The Opposition has not voiced its real complaint about this bill which is, of course, that the Postmaster-General will be empowered to grant licences to commercial television stations. Honourable members opposite, in their mock fight against the measure, pretend to be opposed to the introduction of television into Australia because of economic reasons and the danger that television broadcasts will constitute to the minds of the people of this country. How absurd it is for the Opposition to say, "" ""We oppose this bill because the Government has appointed a royal commission to investigate television, and the Government should wait until that commission has made its report before permitting the establishment of commercial television stations"". How absurd it is to say, ""We are opposed to the bill because we do not approve of the personnel of the royal commission. There are only six members instead of about two dozen"". Obviously, if the Govermnent were to accede to the request of the Leader of the Onnosition that the royal commission should include also a technician, a representative of the churches, a representative of industrialists, and so on, the royal commission would be so cumbersome that it would be unable to function reasonably and to assess rapidly the. evident! 1 that will be placed before it. Let us consider for a moment the proposal that the royal commission should include a technician. I must confess that I do not agree with my colleague, the honourable member for Paterson( Mr commissioners are quite adequate. Mr Fairhall), in this regard. In any investigation of this kind, technicians are liable to be biased because of their specialized knowledge. Is there any reason why Mr given in relation to advertising and news Osborne, who is chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, and is accustomed to dealing with technical problems, should not be capable of giving adequate consideration technical information is placed before thc royal commission? I see no reason at all why a special technician should be appointed to the royal commission. Indeed, I see considerable danger in any such proposal because of the unintentional bias that all technicians seem to have in the direction of their own inclination. It is well known that a person Mr Failes. . who seeks legal advice can easily obtain entirely contradictory opinions from eminent legal authorities. The same may be said of technicians. Generally speaking, technicians develop their own -individual lines of thought and, as the honourable member for Paterson has pointed out, technical conceptions of the development of television may be quite different from those of the layman. It is true that television is allied to broadcasting, but it has a totally different significance. The Leader of thc Opposition has suggested also that a representative of the churches should be appointed to the royal commission. Does he suggest that the present members of the royal commission are not capable of bringing Christian views to bear upon the matters that they will be called upon to consider? Does he believe that Mrs. Mary Foxton, who is president of the Western Australian Countiy Women's League, is not capable of deciding whether certain aspects of television are suitable for the child mind ? I believe that all members of the royal commission are capable of exercising intelligent judgment on the evidence that will bo placed before them. The honourable member for Darebin( Mr Andrews) claimed that there should be an economist on tbe royal commission. Surely Mr f\. S. Young, who is a chartered accountant, is fully qualified to sum up whatever accounting evidence is placed before the commission. Bearing, in mind the terms of reference, I believe that the qualifications of the existing Colin Bednall, for instance, is managing editor of the Br*°bane Courier-Mail, and is fully compete. '< to assess evidence services. The Honourable R. C. Wilson is a highly respected pastoralist and is eminently suited to be a member of the commission. I believe, therefore, that to whatever the personnel of the commission is beyond criticism. The terms of reference of the commission are as follows:To inquire into and report upon(a) the number of national and commercial television stations which can effectively be established and operated having regard to the financial and economic considerations involved and the availability of suitable programmes; (fi) tlie ureas which might be served by television stations and thc stages by which they should be established ; (c) tlie conditions which should apply to the establishment of television stations; (dl the standards to be observed in the programmes of national and commercial television stations to ensure that we should do better to devote our the best use of television broad'easting in the public interest; (e) any conditions which may be considered desirable to apply to the television broadcasting of(i) political and controversial matter and issues; (ii) religious services and other religious matter; (iii) advertisements; (/) the conditions, if any, which should be imposed with respect to periods of broadcasting of television programmes. 11 is so much humbug to say that the present royal commission w ill not be capable of dealing with those matters and should be enlarged. Whilst the Leader of the Opposition has complained that the Government has delayed too long in this matter, and some members of his flock are criticizing the Government for having rushed in with undue speed, the right honourable gentleman is now proposing that further delay should take place. The purpose of this bill is not to introduce television to this country but to empower the Minister to issue television licences to commercial stations. Tbe Leader of the Opposition proposes that this action should be delayed. He proposes further that the royal commission should be instructed to make its report by the l l t h May next. Allowingf o r the regular Easter break, which I am sure even the Leader of the Opposition would not deny to the royal commission, there would be only about a month's working time for the investigation. How could any one possibly expect the commission to visit a l l the capitals of the Oommonwealth, take and consider lengthy evidence, and issue its report by the l l t h May? It is the height of impudence to suggest to the Parliament that the amendment should be taken seriously. There is only one reasonable and logical course to follow, and that is to agree to the Government's proposal contained in this b i ll that the Minister should be authorized to issue licences to commercial television stations I rise to bring to the notice of the Television services in this country should not be confined to one channel, but should be provided in much the same manner as the present broadcasting services are provided. We have been told that it is economically impossible for Australia to introduce television, that the cost of equipping stations is unreasonable and energies to other matters. I admit that I have a lot of regard for that view. It is reasonable that if the Government is to spend money, it should spend it on these matters close at hand such as installing more telephone lines. I speak as a person who resides in one of the outer parts of the Commonwealth, and I know the disabilities of people in the country. They certainly believe that it would be better for them, and probably for a l l Australians, if they could have the amenities which have been denied to them for many years. If the bill is not agreed to it w ill leave the whole provision of television services in the lap of the Government, and the Government w ill then have to provide television services out of Government funds. Therefore, it is reasonable, logical, and right to give the Minister the power to grant licences to commercial stations and so take that burden at least off the public revenues. I wholeheartedly support the bill. Debate (on motion by MrO ' CONNOH ) adjourned. BILL 1953. B ill returned fro m the Senate without amendment. BILL 1953.

253,Mr Fitzgerald ( P H I L L I P ) [10.43].,"number of patients at tbe repatriation general bospital at Concord. I bave received statements from a number of tbe patients, and as the case could not be put better by myself, I propose to inform the House of the contents of those statements. The essence of the complaint is that there is no choice of dermatologist at the hospital, irrespective of the likes or dislikes or the confidence or lack of confidence of the patients. One specialist is in complete charge of all skin patients in this hospital. That state of affairs has existed for a number of years, and is not attributable to any particular Government. However, I consider that something might be clone about the matter, in view of the protests made by the patients at that hospital. The dermatologist in charge is a man of high qualifications ancl great ability, but we suggest that in view of all the circumstances the unfortunate sufferers from skin complaints should be assisted. The case as set out by the patients is as follows:One of the main bones of contention is the fact that there is no choice of dermatologists irrespective of one's likes or dislikes, confidences or lack of confidences, one specialist is in complete charge of all skin patients who enter this hospital. As four dermatologists see patients at the Grace Buildingi t seems strange that only one of them visits Yaralla. It is the general opinion of the patients here that there should be a choice of specialists in the skin ward. The skin specialist visits the skin ward once a week, for a period of two h.ours. During that short time he js expected to prescribe treatment for 38 ward patients, and up to 30 out-patients (tliat number being prescnt on 10th February, 1953), the latter group having prior right to his services. It is the exception rather than the rule when he manages to see ten ward patients. It is not unknown for a patient who is not responding to treatment to go for five weeks without aid from the specialist. A ward doctor, who apparently should spend approximately half his time in the skin ward, appears to have little or no power. He is unable to change treatments without the specialist's authorization, even though this may mean that a patient may be receiving the wrong treatment for a week or more. It is littl e wonder that the patients generally see him but once a week, and that ward doctors hecome dispirited and stay for short periods only in this ward. . It is virtually discuss his condition with the specialist, and it is useless discussing doctor. Mr Fitzgerald. patient is to receive treatment without inquiry, even though the patient may know from previous experience that the treatment is detrimental to him. On one occasion recently a patient suggested that a change of treatment might bc advantageous; the specialist ordered his discharge. However, two senior doctors declared his unfitness for such a discharge, ancl had him removed to anotlier ward, out of the jurisdiction of the dermatological specialist. It is of little use complaining to the Medical Superintendent, for hc has admitted to a skin patient that hc has no authority over the visiting skin specialist, who is in complete charge of the skin patients. It seems strange that, in a democratic country, there is no body within the hospital which has the necessary authority to hear impartially legitimate complaints, and, if necessary, to remove the causes for complaint. Therefore it is no wonder that dermatological patients feel that they are being criminally neglected by repatriation and the medical profession. llany of thc patients at present in ward 31 (the skin ward) are acknowledged chronic cases (one having suffered from dermatitis for 30 years), yet not one has been classed as T..P.T. How long must a person have this disease befoie he is classed as incurable? Wc would respectfully submit tliat the following reforms would not only reduce the average length of stay in hospital for tbe majority of patients, and wonld increase the percentage of cures, but would drastically reduce thc cost per patient, a cost which is being borne by Australian taxpayers:(«-) A t least four dermatological specialists regularly visit the ward. thus permitting patients a choice of specialists; {li) a permanent dermatologist bp appointed to the ward, able to change treatments until the specialist concerned sees the patient again; (c) a board of medical practitioners he empanelled to hear legitimate complaints, and actively deal with them; (</) Chronic skin cases to be classed as T.P.I. We wish it to be known that we havo no complaint regarding the nursing staff at the hospital. Nursing sisters, dressing orderlies and nursing aids are alike in their efforts to .sive us as much ease and comfort as possible, and it seems a great pity that their efforts are not matched by the medical profession. This is a human plea on behalf of more than twenty of the patients of the particular ward under consideration, and I appeal to the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) to bring the matter to the notice of impossible for a patient to the appropriate Minister. There is no it with the ward reason why this complaint should be The specialist's attitude is that the brushed aside, as other complaints have been, by saying that tbe matter is under the complete control of the repatriation officials. The complaints that I have set before the House are well founded, and I believe that the Government should take the action that I have requested. I desire to refer to a paper that I read on Australia Day at the Summer School of the Australian Institute of Political Science, tbe subject being "" Australia and the Migrant"" . the honourable member does not intend to go over that again. profit to every honourable member of this House. During that speech I made a strong criticism of various bodies of pro-' fessional people in this country which have not co-operated with the Department of Immigration to help to assimilate European immigrants who hold academic degrees. against engineers, and quite a number of other groups. The Institution of Engineers, Australia, which has its head office in Sydney, has written to in f o rm me that I did not state the position in relation to professional engineers fairly , and that I did not correctly outline the attitude of the institution in the matter of according professional status to new Australians with engineering qualifications. The secretary of the institution has stated that I must be unaware of the earnest endeavours of the institution to assist immigrants by evaluating their qualifications and co-operating with the Department of Immigration and the Department of Labour and National Service to place them in positions where they may follow their profession. The letter stated that a foreign qualifications advisory sub-committee, composed of six European new Australians with high degrees in physics and mathematics, had been formed to assist the board of examiners. That board was established to assist in examining all immigrants who sought recognition of their European degrees in Australia. I am pleased to be able to say that I accept the institution's comment as completely factual, and I am sorry if I misrepresented its position in any way before the Australian people. The institution is certainly doing a worthwhile job by helping the present Ministerf o r Immigration ( MrH o l t ) and the department to assimilate many new Australians. When I was Ministerf or Immigration in the previous Labour Government, no such co-operation, if my memory serves me right, was forthcoming, but during the last three years the institution has certainly thrown its f u l l weight behind the generally accepted policy on i m migration that has been pursued in I hope that Australia. I am glad that the in stitution is doing so, and I congratulate its members on the success I could do so, with that they have achieved to date. I only regret that other bodies of professional people in Australia have not been as co-operative as the Institute of Engineers, Australia. I make this statement because I want to keep the record straight. I do not want the officers and members of the institution My criticism was directed to think that I have allowed any misrepresentation to lie any longer than was doctors, dentists, lawyers, necessary to bring the matter to the attention of this House. wish to bring to the notice of the House certain facts in relation to the Commonwealth workshops in Hale-street, Botany. On the 15th February, the Sunday Sun and Guardian published the following article:Government property disappears. Car engines listed as missing stockAuditors reveal workshop losses. Inquiry by police. Auditors' inquiries have shown shortage of hundreds of items from stores at the Commonwealth workshops, Hale-street, Botany Thousands of pounds worth of car engines, parts, metals and materials have been written off as missing stock. Supply Minister Beale yesterday promised police action on receipt of proof of the allegations. . . . Hale-street workshops fitter Vic Whitham, of Anniversary-street, Botany, has furnished the Sunday Sun with a statutory declaration. Many other allegations and comments were then made. On the 17th February, the Sydney Sun published the following report:30 DISMISSALS FROM WORKSHOP.

257,Mr Curtin (Watson) [10.57],"1theft tn falsifying records, drunkenness and insubordination, Supply Minister Beale revealed to-day. Subsequently representatives of tbe employees of the. Commonwealtb workshops iii Hale-street, Botany, waited on me and requested me to place tbe true facts before tbe House. Tbey claim that tbe employees are being stigmatized by inaccurate statements made by tbe Minister for Supply( Mr Beale). Tbe deputation informed me that, during the term of office of the present ill-fated Government, there have been dismissed from those workshops one supervisor, for pilfering; one garage assistant, for pilfering; one mechanic, for forging a doctor's certificate; and one man for drunkenness; and that six men have been retrenched because of shortage of work. I have been supplied with the names of the men who have been dismissed. The delegation stated that if the Minister for Supply knew of any more dismissals from those workshops he should table the names of tbe men dismissed. When men are retrenched they are given a certificate of service. The stigma that ""has been caused by the Minister's statements remains on the retrenched men, because when they present their certificate to the foreman or personnel oflicer at another establishment where they seek employ ment, they are unceremoniously passed out as soon as that officer finds that they have been retrenched from the Commonwealth workshops at Botany. I am greatly perturbed about this aspect of the matter and I consider that, in the interests of the men concerned, the Minister should make a full public statement on the matter. I understand that a departmental inquiry has been ordered. Any one who has worked in a government department knows that a departmental adopts a hush-hush policy, in order to cover up inefficiency, and its reports are usually favorable to the officer in charge. The men are not satisfied to leave the matter to a departmental inquiry. They liave asked, justifiably, for a public inquiry to be made into the charges of the Ministers. Failing a public inquiry, the Minister should make a full statement on the matter. The Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison) will agree, I am sure, that the Mr Curtin. statements of the Minister for Supply concerning good, honest men who are earning their living should be corrected, because the stigma that now rests on them cannot easily be erased. Although supporters of the Government have preached almost daily about the necessity to increase production, statements such as those that have been made by the Minister for Supply only incite men to strike. The following report was published in the Sydney Morning Herald of the 18th FebruaryThe Minister for Supply, Mr Howard Beale, said to-day that a Commonwealtli official was rc-organizing Commouwealth workshops. . . . In view of the result of the re-organizing and rationalizing of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited and Trans-Australia Airlines, the men suspect that the officer who is re-organizing the Commonwealth workshops at Botany for the Minister is collecting all necessary data for the sale of those workshops to private enterprise. I believe that they have some grounds for their suspicions. Jn common justice to the men concerned, the Minister for Supply should make a public statement as soon as possible, giving the names of the 30 men that he claims have been dismissed since he has been in office, and the reasons for their dismissal. If the statements made by the Minister are proved to bo untrue, they demand that he make a public apology. I trust that the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Eric J. Harrison), who is in charge of the House, will sec the justice of the claims of these men, many of whom are the inquiry fathers of big families. The Minister laughs at tlie notion that honest working men are the fathers of big families. I inform him that there are many big families in Botany, which is a working class suburb. The residents of Botany are good, honest citizens, who are always prepared to do their bit. I appeal to the Minister hot to treat this matter with levity. Some of the employees at the. government workshops in Botany are the fathers of soldiers who are fighting in Korea. The stigma that has been placed ou the fathers of many of our Korean veterans will remain so long as the Ministerf o r Supply is silent on this matter. All we ask is that the Minister's statements published in the newspapers be refuted. If the Minister has made a mistake, he should be big enough to admit it . -Vice-President of the Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) r i l . ? ] courteous on my part to say to those honourable members who have raised matters for the consideration of Ministers who are not present in the House, that I shall see that their representations are brought to the notice of the appropriate Minister. Tho honourable member for Phillip( Mr Fitzgerald) spoke of matters associated with repatriation. I seem to recognizethem as hardy annuals. I am sure that the Minister for Repatriation (Senator Cooper) is fully aware of the facts concerning thosematters, but in case he is not, I shall see that the remarks of the honourable member are brought to his notice. The honorahle member for Watson( Mr Curtin) has referred to an article published in the press about the government workshops in Botany. Thp honourable member says that he has received a request from a deputation representative of the men concerned that a public inquiry be held in place of the proposed departmental inquiry. I do not intend to comment on the extravagant statements made hy the honourable member. They eould be shorn from the general contest of his remarks, but those of his utterances which were relevant to the matter w ill be conveyed to the Minister for Supply Question resolved in the affirmative. The following paper was presented :Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act-Regulations-Statutory Rules 1968, No. 11. House adjourned at II.S p.ni. The following answer to a quesiion wax circulated:the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr. Duthie) asked the following question:As the Prime Minister is aware, Tasmania's sea passenger traffic and much of its perishable freight cargoes are at the mercy of the Bass Strait steamer Taroona, which is often taken off the run for overhaul and repairs. Alternain 'repZy-It is only tive shipping is ncver made available. In view of this and thc growth of population in Tasmania, will the Government give consideration to the building by the Australian Shipbuilding Board of a faster passenger vessel for the run across Bass Strait, especially having regard to the Government's slated policy of promoting competition on the ground that it is good for trade and business? The Minister for Shipping and Transport has furnished the following reply:The Bass Strait passenger vessel Taroona, like all other vessels, has to undertake surveys and overhauls at specified times to meet the requirements of the Navigation Act and Lloyd's surveyors. In the past when the vessel ""has been laid up both Tasmanian steamers and the Commouwealth have endeavoured to secure either by purchase or charter a substitute vessel. It has' been found, however, that ships of a suitable type are not retidily available. Jn 1951, during Taroona'v. lay-up period, the Commonwealth Government subsidized a round trip voyage by M.V. Wanganella, the cost of which to the Commonwealth was £7,000. In the 1952 period negotiations had reached an advanced stage for the service to be maintained by Ormistm, but that vessel became involved in the margins dispute on the Galvin award and was prevented from, providing a substitute serviee. At the beginning of this year discussions took place between the Department of Shipping and Transport and Tasmanian Steamers Limited in the course of which the company intimated it had arranged for Taroona to undergo a running survey which, with the exception of a few days necessary to open up thc main engines, would obviate the need for thc vessel to be laid up during 1D53.",74,Canberra Monday
