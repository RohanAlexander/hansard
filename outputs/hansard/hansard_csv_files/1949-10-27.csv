As the list -of 'Government business indicates that the .period of two hours will be greatly exceeded, will the Prime Minister provide an opportunity for the House to discuss the motion standing in my name relative to a gift of food to the United Kingdom, when 'Government business has been concluded? Mr 'CHIFLEY -The answer to the right honourable gentleman's question is "" No "". The House will adjourn to-day, and this Eighteenth Parliament wiil be dissolved' on Monday. Honourable members had an unrestricted opportunity in the general budget debate to raise any matters that they desired to raise. The first part of the notice of motion standing in the right honourable gentleman's name asks the Parliament to recommend to the Government that a gift of £10,'000,000 worth of food be made to the British people to obviate the necessity of reducing the British food ration. The honourable member for Balaclava and other honourable members have discussed that matter on a number of occasions, and the Government has stated its views on the subject. The second part of the right honourable gentleman's motion is designed to influence the Parliament to recommend to the Government that an approach be made to all the governments of the British Empire with a view to calling a conference of the leaders of all parties to devise means of securing the mobilization and equitable distribution of the resources of the British approved ? Empire in order to restore prosperity in Great Britain at the earliest possible moment. It is physically impracticable at the moment to call the kind of conference that the right honourable gentleman has suggested. I should have been glad, in normal circumstances, to provide an opportunity for a debate on that motion, but many honourable members desire to return to their constituencies. The Government proposes to ask the House to deal with the Liquid Fuel (Rationing) Bill 1949, the Coal Industry (Tasmania) Bill 1949, the National Health Service Bill 1949, and the Sugar Agreement Bill 1949, and when consideration of those measures has been completed the House will adjourn. PISH. ask you, Mr Deputy Speaker, -whether you saw an article in the Sydney Sun, of the 26th October, headed in .bold black type, ""Politicians eat illegal fish, say anglers"". The article goes on to .say that fish caught illegally in the vicinity of the Burrinjuck Dam were taken to Parliament House, Canberra, every week. It is further stated that the fish were taken by dynamiting pools in streams that feed the dam. Can you say, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether the statement is 'correct? Have you any comment to make on it? Clark) -The statement published in the newspaper is a figment of some one's imagination. I understand that all the fish served in the refreshment rooms at Parliament House come from salt water and are of very good quality at that. Civil Aviation state the number of aircraft owned by Qantas Empire Airways Limited? Is it a fact, as reported in the press, that a site at the corner of Hunter and Elizabeth streets, Sydney, was bought yesterday for £85,000, and that an eleven-story building is to be erected there to house the head-quarters staff of Qantas Empire Airways Limited? Is this high expenditure justified, and under what item in the Estimates was it oifhand the number of aircraft owned by Qantas Empire Airways, but I shall try to get the information. Perhaps it will be supplied in some of the answers circulated to-day to a number of questions asked earlier in the session. It is true that, for some time, negotiations have been going on with the idea of purchasing a site on which to erect a building to accommodate the staff of Qantas Empire Airways Limited which at present occupy space in a number of buildings. I do not know whether the honourable member suggests that it is desirable to have the staff scattered so as to cause disorganization and extra expense.

I did not see it, because I had no hand or part in making the arrangements for the function, but, at one side of There is no disposition on the part of some that biblical scroll, there was a small Union Jack and, on the other side, there was an Australian red ensign. The honourable member did not criticize the fact that the Australian red ensign was covered. He directed his attention to the Onion Jack. I put up the biggest flag that I could find. It was the Australian flag. That was the important thing to do. It was also the right thing to do. The Union Jack is an integral part of the Australian flag.

If so, will the Minister inform the House whether any steps have been taken to alleviate that shortage by the appointment of suitably qualified persons from among the new Australians who are being brought to this country under the scheme for the resettlement of displaced persons from Europe? needs of the medical services in PapuaNew Guinea. The honourable member's qiiestion relates to a subject which has been referred to by honourable members on both sides of the House for some time past, which is, the necessity to use the services of new Australians to the greatest possible degree in conformity with their attainments, aptitudes and qualifications. But in order that persons with medical degrees from European universities, who are nationals of countries with which Australia has no reciprocal agreement for the recognition of such degrees, may practise, it is necessary that they should become registered under State laws. State' authorities to grant such recognition, but this Parliament has powers under the Australian Constitution to register such medical practitioners in territories of the Commonwealth such as Papua-New Guinea, the Australian Capita] Territory, the Northern Territory, and Norfolk Island. The Department of Immigration has received requests from the Department of External Territories for the services of a number of doctors. Dr. Gunther, who is chief of the medical services in Papua-New Guinea, has been in consultation with officers of my department about this matter. I think that about 40 doctors amongst the new Australians have been examined, and Gunther. Those who have had medical experience in Europe and who have satisfied Dr. Gunther's requirements are to go to Papua-New Guinea as soon as possible. They number six and will be registered as medical practitioners in Papua New-Guinea and will attend to the needs of the natives of the territory. The Minister for External Territories has been most anxious that the health of the natives should not suffer. The Government has tried in England, Australia and in fact everywhere, to get doctors to go to Papua-New Guinea, but has met with no success. It is hoped that ultimately all of the 40 individuals whom I have mentioned will be appointed to practise in New Guinea. I believe that such appointments will have some influence upon the attitude of the British Medical Association and the State medical boards on the question of affording recognition to university degrees in medicine and other branches of science held by these new Australians.

There has been a tendency to continue in the post-war era the preferential treatment that was extended to some companies during the war, perhaps inevitably. I am not prepared to stand for that. I am sure that the board has endeavoured to do what is right and the matter that has been raised by the honourable member for Indi, but the position is rather difficult. There is a great demand by tanners for hides and skins. I am anxious that each company shall get a fair proportion of the materials that are available.

Last year, a situation arose similar to that which he described a few moments ago, and it appeared that it would be impossible to move the sugar from certain ports on time.

I am now in a position to make a statement on the matter. In October, 1947, following recommendations from the Joint Dairy Industry Advisory Committee, which comprises representatives of the industry and officers of Commonwealth departments, the Government announced its decision to guarantee a price to the dairying industry on the total production of butter, cheese and processed milk products for a period of five years from the 1st April, 1947. It also announced that it had accepted 2s. per lb. for commercial butter at factory door as tbe recognized cost of production as from that date, and considered that that return would be subject to variation up or down in accordance with demonstrated movements in costs, after review each year during the five-year period.

The Government at the same time maintained the rate of subsidy ou locally consumed butter and cheese. Without the subsidy, those prices would necessarily have been higher by 6d. per lb. for butter and 3d. per lb. for cheese. The review of costs undertaken in April and June of this year, revealed that a further increase of the basic return to the dairy-farmer of 2^ lb. for commercial butter was warranted, which would bring the overall return to the dairy-farmer at factory door to 2s. 4-Jd. per lb. for commercial butter. That figure was accepted by the Commonwealth and, with an additional £d. per lb. in respect of manufacturing costs, formed the basis of an approach to the British Ministry of Food for an increase of the price of export butter and cheese under the terms of the contract between the two governments as from the 1st July, in respect of the contract year 1949-50. In the light of the committee's findings, the Government was of the opinion that higher pries should be fixed for butter and cheese consumed locally, and in June last, it referred the matter to the State Prices Ministers. The Government informed them that it was prepared to continue the subsidy at the existing rates of 6d. per lb. for butter and 3d. per lb. for cheese. At those rates, tbe cost of the subsidy was estimated at £5,000,000 per annum. The State Prices Ministers have not yet approved of the higher local prices for butter and cheese. To give the States additional time to consider the present findings of the Joint Dairy Industry Advisory Committee and for an approach to secure an undertaking that the State Prices Ministers will give due consideration to the future findings of that body, the Government will pay to dairy-farmers by way of additional subsidy the increase of established production costs at the rate of 2-J per ib. for commercial butter from the 1st July to the 31st December. In the absence of such an understanding with the States, the Government feels Mr Pollard. that it would be futile for the committee to continue to function. The Government That recommendation was would then be obliged to re-examine the position in the light of the circumstances obtaining. The Government further decided that the increase of the manufacturing costs of butter and cheese for local consumption was a matter for adjustment between manufacturers and' the State Prices Ministers . concerned. Arrangements are being made for a retrospective subsidy payment in respect of the latest increase of production costs to be made to dairy-farmers at the earliest possible moment. It is estimated that the amount involved will be approximately £1,250,000. Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) has just announced that the Government, on the eve of the election, is going to honour an undertaking which was given a long time ago to the dairying industry. The Government gave a clear and unequivocal undertaking to the industry that it would assure dairy farmers a price for their butter fat that would cover the cost of production as determined by a committee of investigation. Since May last the Government has been in possession of the most recent recommendations of the committee, but instead of honouring its obligations it has attempted to evade them, and to transfer the responsibility to the State governments, by asking them to authorize an increase of the price of butter so that the cost might be borne by the consumers. In that way, the Commonwealth would be able to evade any financial responsibility for the pledge it has given. Had the States done as requested, the effect would have been to increase the cost of living and of production, and to contribute to the general inflationary tendency in Australia. Members of the Opposition are glad that the Government, impelled, no doubt, by the approach of the general election, has at last been brought to honour its positive and unequivocal promise, and that, on the eve of the elections, it proposes to disburse certain moneys to the dairy-farmers, as it proposes also to disburse moneys held by it on behalf of the wool producers.

51,Mr Mcewen (Indi),"by leave--Th e10th DecemberI make no predictionswill see that the next inquiry into the cost of production in the dairying industry is conducted on a different basis from the last one, and that it will bear a closer relation to the accepted standard of living in Australia. For instance, the committee made its findings on the assumption that a margin of only 25s. a week above the basic wage should be allowed to a dairy farmer managing' his own property; and that a dairy-farmer, his family and his employees should work a 56-hour week. If they worked more hours in a week they were to be compensated only at the normal hourly rate, not at time and a half, or double time, as is done in all other industries. I make this statement to draw attention to the following three points:-First, that the Government has attempted to evade the financial responsibilities arising from its promise; secondly, that it has finally faced its responsibilities only on the eve of an election; and, thirdly^ that the Government accepts for the dairying industry a working week of 56 hours, when it sent counsel to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court to advocate a 40-hour week for all other industries. a statement on the same subject. Leave not granted. BILL 1949. Debate resumed from the 26th October (vide page 2097), on motion by Mr that Great Britain should be in pawn That the bill be now read a second time. Last night, the Prime Minister( Mr is due largely to the fact that payments Chifley) attempted to explain why the rationing of petrol should be re-introduced in Australia. He dealt with the subject generally and specifically. He referred to Great Britain's difficulties, and pointed out that Great Britain had suffered severe losses during the war. He then added that there was an Empire dollar pool upon which Australia drew for the purchase of petrol. He did not say, however, that the Australian Government had been told by the Government of the United Kingdom to see that we balanced our dollar trade with the United States of America; and that we had been buying too much from that country, and selling too little to it. I wish to make it clear, that, if there is a shortage of petrol in Australia to-day-and there is, because the bowsers are drying up-the reason is that the Government has cut off petrol supplies by refusing to allow more than a specified quantity to be imported. The Prime Minister attempted to confuse the issue by allowing it to be assumed that the fault lay with the'States. As a matter of fact, the States are only agents for the distribution of petrol, and they have been placed in a difficult position. It is true that Great Britain is passing through difficult times. The British people should not have to fight a second battle of Great Britain, this time an economic battle. The Dominions have failed Great Britain by not participating in an Empire scheme designed to solve the Empire's economic problems. The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) attended an economic conference in London, but we have heard nothing about the results. The reason, of course, is that the results were negative. A plan should long since have been adopted for funding Britain's debts to various countries, including the United States of America. Had that been done, Britain would not now be on the road to bankruptcy, as some authorities claim it is. The socialist government in Great Britain has neglected its trust, and has let the country down. It is ridiculous to Egypt, a country which Great Britain saved more than once during the war. The dissipation of Great Britain's reserves to Egypt and to India were convertible into dollars, and those countries insisted upon receiving payment in dollars. That situation has now been altered, but much damage was done.

Edmund Burke, whose profound ideas are still accepted, saidGovernment is a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants.

I believe that the position can be got over. I do not think any one w ill deny that French petrol is available. Nothing that the Prime Minister has said refutes that, but, because it is 3d. a gallon dearer than other petrol, probably because of the long distance it has to be transported, the right honourable gentleman says that it cannot come into the country. In effect, he has said, "" We cannot subsidize p e t r o l "" . Minister of this great dominion should I agree that the Government could not subsidize one shipment of petrol, but the remedy lies in its own hands. There is a heavy duty on petrol. Some of the proceeds from that duty are used for the development of roads. That is a good thing. The federal aid roads scheme, which has been in operation for about twenty years and was instituted by the Bruce-Page Government, has done a great deal to develop roads, but there is sufficient of the revenue from the petrol tax left after the requirements of the federal aid roads agreement have been satisfied to enable the difficulty of the dearer price of French petrol to be easily overcome.

64,Mr White,"That is a very greatwho have their eyes on this country. ""We have to rely on the rest of the Empire and on the United States. There has undoubtedly been some creditable development in Australia in a century and a half. Statistics on the importation of petrol show the progress of motor transport, which has played and is now playing a most important part in our development. In the last year before the war we imported 333,000,000 gallons. In 1947, after nobody doubts that fact now; but for a years of petrol rationing, we imported 397,000,000 gallons, and in 1948 we imported 407,000,000 gallons. Now, at the end of 1949, the Government lays down that we shall only be permitted to import 440,000,000 gallons, and damn the consequences! It does not matter to the Government who suffers. There is no reason why private motorists should not have the petrol they require. What about the requirements of medical men and of commercial motor transport? If honourable members on the Government side of the House think that commercial motor transport does not matter, let me remind them that the number of commercial motor vehicles in Australia increased by over 200,000 between 1938 and this year, compared with an increase of only 100,000 in the number of private motor vehicles. The people who operate commercial motor vehicles will find their industry and employment placed in jeopardy by the Government's proposals. As honourable members know, many service stations refuse to supply petrol to travellers so that men driving transport waggons on the roads run the risk of finding their vehicles immobilized in transit. I consider that it is well to have a quantity of petrol earmarked for defence, but the Government's refusal to consider making 50,000,000 gallons that it has stored away for defence purposes conflicts, with the statements of the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) that there will not be a war for many years and with exaggerated statements about our readiness for defence. Last night the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) said that Australia was in a great state of unreadiness in 1941, and he also mentioned the shortage of petrol. The Leader of the Australian Country Mr White. party ( Mr Fadden) is to be commended for his stand on this issue of petrol, and last night he answered the Government's statements completely when he said that a government formed by the present Oj>position parties sent petrol to Great Britain in 1941 to help that country in its dire need. The Leader of the Australian Country party has said that petrol can be obtained, and I think that long time the Prime Minister attacked him and tried to put him in the wrong. I know that in 1941 there was never any shortage of petrol for the Air Force training that we carried out in co-operation with other Empire countries. The Prime Minister from time to time has blamed Great Britain's troubles for our j>resent petrol position, but he knows that there are ways out of the present position. He knows that it is possible to buy petrol from the sterling areas. He also knows that an increase in the price of petrol will create hardship for Aus-. tralians. He would sooner do that than make a tax concession. There is a great deal of misunderstanding about this petrol issue. Many people believe that either the Government of ' Victoria or the Government of New South Wales is in some measure to blame for the present position. That is not so. The ultimate basic reason for that position is the cutting off of imports by the Prime Minister. I do not know on whose calculations he worked, or whether they were the calculations of a bureaucrat or a member of the Labour party caucus, but he has taken the responsibility of bringing this trouble upon us. He has attempted to create the impression that the States are responsible for the shortage so that his Government can take action to release petrol immediately available a part of the before the general election and enable Ministers to issue propaganda to the effect that the Labour party in its federal sphere was able to make petrol available to the people. publication of the Minister for Information, who has just interjected. I do not know whether it is printed at public expense or not, but the Minister should be ashamed of some of the misleading",21,Dedman
65,Mr Calwell,"Hear, hear!",22,Dedman
66,Mr White,"I have seen the lateststatements that appear in it. In that publication, the Minister confirms the fact that the Government intends to say that the Labour party enabled tbe people to get petrol. In fact, however, it is only tbe Australian Government and no other government which controls the importation of petrol, because it has sole control of customs matters under the Constitution. The Prime Minister has decided, perhaps aided and abetted by some of the minor despots around him, that Australia shall receive only a certain quantity of petrol. Just as be cut out subsidies after the defeat of the prices referendum and so caused prices to increase, so he also said on this occasion, in effect, "" We shall cut off petrol and put State governments in difficulties. Many people will blame the State governments and when we make petrol available nt the last minute we shall get the credit"". There is an old saying that "" You can fool some of the people all oi the time and all of the people some of the time, but that you cannot fool all of the people all of the time"". The Prime Minister has been adopting such tactics for some years. It is clever work to take up,a piqued attitude and act the despot, and put the blame for difficulties on somebody else, but I think that on this present occasion, because petrol is a commodity so important to the life of the community, the people will see through the Prime Minister's scheme. The people are tired of the policy of the socialists who are doctrinaire politicians. The socialist policy is socialism of the means of production, distribution and exchange. That, policy refers among other things to the distribution of petrol. The Government intends to own and control all that it can own and control, but I think that this time the people will think that the socialists, with their policy of meddle and muddle have misruled us for too long. In a few hours the Eighteenth Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia will end and the various political parties will go to the hustings. All kinds of distortions about this Government's alleged achievement have already been issued. Every Minister has published some sort of blurb extolling his department's activities. The booklet issued by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway) contains many statistics that are open to challenge. The facts relating to this subject may be very seriously misconstrued by many people because of the propaganda which the Government sends out at the expense of the public andnot, as it should be, at the expense of the Australian Labour party. The people are very long-suffering and tolerant, and, above all, are sportsmanlike in their attitude. They will decide that this Labour Government, which does not really represent the people, because its members are mere delegates of outside bodies instead of being true representatives of the people, as we are, has occupied the treasury bench for much too long a time. -Order! The honourable member must deal with the bill. one of the many that will bring about the downfall of this Government. The people who will soon be given an opportunity to express their views will sweep these muddlers and meddlers from the treasury bench. amble of this bill is as gloomy as is the Apocalypse. It reflects the Government's outlook on this petrol problem. The Government has made no attempt to relieve the petrol supply position. Its sole aim has been to see that rationing of petrol is restored. Any one who arrived in Canberra during the last three months who was able to indicate ways and means of finding all the petrol requirements of this country without rationing would have been looked upon as public enemy No. 1. The Government predicted chaos, and so ehaos had to be. The Prime Minister's attitude is one of "" I told you so"". Of course, he has been sitting on a full hand. He has control of the issue of import licences. He regulates the entry of petrol into this country. Merely by deferring a decision, vital sources of supply can be lost. We have had all kinds of explanations made of tbe causes of the present, position. We have been told all about the alleged drain on dollars. But only a small fraction of our petrol comes from dollar countries. So, if the problem is one of meeting dividends for petrol companies owned in the United States of America,",22,Dedman
67,Mr Acting Deputy Speaker.,,23,Dedman
68,Mr White,The petrol issue will be,23,Dedman
69,Mr Lang (Reid) [11.51],"The prewhy not say so? We still have not been told how much would be necessary, in dollars, to meet all our petrol requirements. We can find money for international relief, for our legations abroad, for the world bank, and for all kinds of unnecessary dollar expenditure; but we cannot have more dollars for petrol. That is why this bill has been introduced. The Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) is never more stubborn than when the High Court tells him that something which he has done is unconstitutional. That has happened in the case of petrol rationing. It has also happened in the case of the Melbourne City Council and in the case of the doctors. Now, in order to prove that the High Court was wrong, and that the right honourable gentleman was right, we have this artificially created chaos of the 1 past month. When the Government forces this bill through the Parliament petrol is expected to flow again into the bowsers. It is proposed to give to motorists sufficient petrol ration tickets to last until the plenty of suppliers who are eager 31st January next. This Government will then have another look at the position. It will decide whether the motorists have been suffering enough. It will decide whether or not it should again reduce the ration. If it carries out its declared policy, it will have to do so. The Prime Minister has stated time after time that for the year ending the 31st May, 1950, he will not permit the companies to sell more than440,000,000 gallons, plus the adjustment due to the coal strike. After allowing for government use, the amount available for civilian consumption will be reduced to 433,000,000 gallons. But, accordingto Government figures, during the four months period from June to September the companies have oversold a total of 34,000,000 gallons. The Government is working on the assumption that from October to the 31st January next consumption will be at the rate of 433,000,000 gallons. The new ration tickets which will be issued' on the 15th November will be on that basis. So that, on the 31st January next, with only four months to go there will still be 34,000,000 gallons to be made up. The only way in which it could be made up would be to reduce civilian consumption by 8,500,000 gallons a month. That would involve a 25 per cent, cut in the ration. It would Mr Lang. mean the end of all private motorist usage. The Government should tell us now what it proposes to do about those 34,000,000 gallons. Doe3 it propose to allow an increase over the 433,000,000 gallons, or does it propose to stick to its original announcement ? If it is returned to power, what does it propose to do after the 31st January next?' The public is entitled to know. This bill should not be necessary. There are two ways in which to tackle the problem. The first is to l if t all restrictions upon import licences and let traders operate on the basis of competitive trade. We have seen the results of a little healthy competion in the last few days. Despite obstruction by the Government, one company succeeded in finding new sources of petrol supplies. We still have large export surpluses, and they should be sufficient to supply all our needs. There should be to do business with us on the basis that this is a very solvent nation in a world in which many nations are insolvent. It is not for the Government to erect new trade barriers. The Government's job should be to remove such barriers. It should encourage traders to obtain petrol from wherever it is available. The oil companies fully understand the technique of international trade. That is their job. It is not the Government's job. We are depending too much upon the Bank of England. It astounds me that men who for twenty years have been emphatic that the Bank of England strangled this country in tbe early 1930's are now anxious to hand over to it the complete control of this country. The Prime Minister tells us that he is waiting on the Bank of England before he can tell the prices commissioners how much should be charged for petrol. He waits on the Bank of England to tell him how many dollars he may expend upon petrol. He waits upon the Bank of England to tell him how many gallons of petrol he may issue import licences for during the coming year. Never before has any government of this country been kept in such close confinement by tbe Bank of England. Yet, we have huge assets lodged with the bank that may never be redeemed. All we need is a token payment in the form of petrol without which this country cannot function in a modern economy. Instead of falling back upon the frustrations and regimentations of rationing, the Government should have taken positive steps to deal with the position. In I do not propose to probe those stories stead of waiting for Ampol to do a job, it should have invited all companies to do their utmost to find petrol. It should have lifted restrictions upon import licences. Had it done so, this country would have been as well off as are Italy, Japan and Germany, which lost the war but apparently won the petrol peace. In addition, the Government should have taken urgent positive steps to make Australia independent of all outside oil suppliers and oil cartels. It has not done so. Had it done so, there would have been no need for the measure that is now before the House. The most urgent task of the Government is to discover and develop, within territories under Australian control, suffiBritish Government .owns a half share. cient oil to meet our immediate needs. Without petrol, this nation will become a backward nation. No expense and no effort should be spared to ensure that Australia Although we are pouring out millions of pounds upon other projects, last year the Government spent only £49,000 upon developmental work in relation to mineral resources. Our position in relation to petroleum development is an alarming one. We spent a lot of money on Newnes, but practically nothing is being spent upon the far more urgent problems of flow oil and hydrogenation. The truth is that most of the potential oil-bearing areas are now under the control of foreign oil companies. Geological surveys have satisfied the experts that oil does exist in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was to several structures in Australian territories. Large sums of money have been expended by overseas companies, but the results are shrouded in secrecy. We have been told that, in recent test drillings, oil in formation has been discovered in Papua, but we do not know the extent of the strikes. We must be satisfied that these overseas interests are willing and anxious to develop any fields under their control, and also that they would work a concession, the working of which might be a vital economic necessity for this country, even if it did not provide results that were competitive with the results to be obtained from concessions in other parts of the world. The history of oil search in this country is full of strange coincidences and mysterious mishaps, but at this stage. The duty of this Parliament is to satisfy itself that the Government is taking every possible step to develop our resources. We shall not get very far on the £49,000 a year that the Government proposes to spend. The Prime Minister, in reply to a question that I asked recently, expressed his grave concern about the terms of the oil agreement with the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited. That agreement was signed in 1920. It is high time that it was jettisoned. The Commonwealth holds one more share than 50 per cent, of the total issued capital. The rest of the shares are owned by the AngloIranian Oil Company, of which the It was formerly known as the Anglo Persian Oil Company. According to the Prime Minister, the Commonwealth has no say in the control of the Commonbecomes self-supporting. wealth Oil Refineries Limited. The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company appoints four directors and the Commonwealth appoints three directors. This is the company that was established in the first instance to finance and develop Australia's own fuel oil resources! Under the oil agreement, the Commonwealth was to supply to the company for refining indigenous oil up to a maximum of 200,000 tons a year, as it became available, from within the Commonwealth or from any territory under Commonwealth control. Until local oil became available, supply the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited with such crude material as it needed, up to but not exceeding 200,000 tons a year. So, it is not in the interests of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company for Australia to develop its' own petroleum deposits. It would lose a market of 200,000 tons a year for its Iranian product, and would become merely a refining company, instead of being the supplier of the crude oil and having a half interest in the refined product. The Oil Agreement Act 1920 provided that the oil must be carried in Anglo-Persian freighters, which were owned by a subsidiary company, and the terms of that freight have never been disclosed. Article 14 (&) of the agreement provided not only for the refund of any customs duty paid by the company but also for a guarantee of protection in the form of duty, if needed. Why should a company in .that favoured position be anxious to promote the development of independent oil supplies by this country? The largest oil concessions in Papua are in the hands of the Australasian Petroleum Company Limited, in which the shareholding interests are the Shell Oil Company of Australia Limited, the Vacuum Oil Company Limited, which is cue of the Standard Oil group of America, the Oriomo Company, a subsidiary of Oil Search Limited, which is another subsidiary of the Vacuum Oil Company Limited, and the D'Arcy Oil Company, a subsidiary of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. William Knox D'Arcy, an Australian, made the original discovery of oil in Persia, and obtained the concession from the Shah. Those foreign oil companies hold concessions which total some 20,000 square miles in Papua. Oil was produced in Papua as far back as 1914, when shallow wells were drilled to a depth of 200 feet on the Vi-lulla River. The oil produced in those tests was actually used in launches. The field was being worked by Dr. Wade when the Anglo-Persian Oil Company took over. That was the end of the operations. The same interests have now retuVned to the same area. There have been many discoveries of oil seepages in Papua. Geologists say that there are suitable oil structures in the area, and the director of the Bureau of Mineral Resurveys have been favorable, but the foreign oil companies constantly intrude. What the Prime Minister has said about the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited should be a sufficient incentive for the Government to call for a complete investigation. Australian companies which have invested their money in the search for oil in that area appear to have run into all kinds of obstructions. Considerable evidence has been shown to me which should receive impartial and thorough investigation. The men in charge had the Irish est qualifications. One was a topographical Mr Lang. surveyor for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and he conducted the original survey. The foreign concerns were given concessions of thousands of square miles, but his company obtained a concession of only 75 square miles. It had also to contend with all kinds of obstructions from the Commonwealth Oil Advisory Committee. The company alleges that its employees were moved from an area in which they had found live oil at 500 feet. The foreign companies are not in the. same position as the Australian companies. They have to assess the possibility of an area in relation to the yields from other areas, and have to justify themselves on a purely, competitive price basis. They are also governed by world output. If there is an abundance of petrol to be obtained from existing fields, why should they spend millions of pounds in developing new fields? This Government is in an entirely different position. It must develop petrol supplies, even if they are non-economic in comparison with other sources of supplies. It is not a matter of world parity, or Gulf oil prices. We must have enough to enable us to keep transport moving and to serve defence purposes. Therefore, the search for oil should be in the hands, not of foreign interests, but of Australian interests. The Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited is not at present a satisfactory vehicle for government action. That position should be cleared up quickly. We need' the best experts that Ave can obtain and we must make certain that they are completely independent of outside interests. We must pay salaries that will attract the best oil technologists. The sources receives a paltry £1,687 a year, the petroleum technologist £1,450 a year, and the chief geophysicist £1,020 a year. How can we expect men on unattractive salaries to direct a.great national project such as the search for oil ? It is a scandal. Some of these men are being paid less than many bricklayers and carpenters are earning. We should get the best, available oil technologists, supply test: equipment and get busy as quickly as possible. We must also be prepared to support any . Australian company which is equipped with the "" know-how "" of oil search. I ask the Government to give this problem immediate consideration. Several royal commissions and select committees have inquired into oil and oil production. What we need now is an intensive search and production drive. If we fail in this task, the consequences can be disastrous to' our national development. Dr. General and Minister for External Affairs) [12.18] -There will be general agreement with certain parts of the speech which the honourable member for Beid( Mr Lang) has made. The task of developing our natural resources, especially in connection with the matters affected by this bill, is most important. I think that everybody in Australia, irrespective of party political views, recognizes that the present Government, is embarking on national projects on a scale that no other government has attempted in the history of this country. However, I pass that aspect by, not because I differ from certain observations that the honourable member for Reid has made, but because it does not affect the immediate practical problem now confronting us. The honourable member's references to the control of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited were based on certain facts which are receiving the serious attention of the Government. It is an extraordinary thing that neither the Australian Government, although it is the largest shareholder in the enterprise, nor the British Government, which is also a shareholder, is able to exercise sufficient control. That is a matter which is, as I have said, engaging the attention of the Government. ' I have touched upon the constructive part of the speech of the honourable member for Reid, and with what he said on those points honourable members will be inclined to agree. However, the problem before the House at the moment is much graver and more urgent than the matters that he discussed. It involves our relations with other countries, and particularly our relations with Britain and the British Commonwealth. Some honourable members opposite, notably the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), are prepared, for the sake of what they regard as a political advantage, to injure our relations with Britain and the British Commonwealth. The situation in regard to tbe dollar shortage, of which petrol is an integral part, is quite simple. Let us consider the position of Australia as a separate and isolated community. For each of the three years immediately preceding the outbreak of war, Australia's with the United. States of America and Canada was 36,000,000 dollars. However, if honourable members think that that goes back to a time which is too remote, let us take the last three years, when Australia's dollar deficits with Canada and the United States of America were as follows:Dollars. 1940-4"" .. .. 56,000,000 194748 .. .. .. 104,000,000 19484.9 (estimated) .. 72,000,000 Thus, the aggregate deficit over three years has been 291,000,000 dollars. had a favorable trade balance with the United States of America? troops were in Australia, and spending dollars. Australia's average dollar deficit over the last three years has been more than 90,000,000 dollars. The Leader of the Australian. Country party ( Mr Fadden) has advised the Government to say, in effect: "" We are not interested in the dollar agreement with Great Britain. We are going to adopt an isolationist attitude "". If that policy were applied, Australia would be bereft of any chance to get dollars for the purchase of essential goods. We should be unable to buy petrol, or equipment either, which, as the honourable member for Reid rightly pointed out, is essential to the development of Australia. I mention that fact in order to show that Australia could, not afford to act independently of Britain and the British Commonwealth. Our dollar deficits have been financed by converting into dollars surplus sterling earned by trading with other parts of the world. Before the war, that was simple. The United Kingdom could convert as much, sterling into dollars as we required, -but now, because of the general dollar shortage in British Commonwealth countries, that is no longer possible. The limited dollar resources of Britain, and",23,Dedman

71,Dr. Evatt,"Only when Americanof British Commonwealth countries, with the exception of Canada, are held in one sterling area dollar pool. If that were not so, the position of Australia, acting independently of Great Britain, would be completely hopeless. This bill is based upon the agreements made by members of the British Commonwealth in regard to the use of dollars. In the preamble to the bill, it is asserted that there has been, and is, a considerable deficiency in the dollar currency becoming available to Australia for the purchase of essential imports. Does any one contradict that assertion? No contradiction is forthcoming from the Opposition. It is further asserted that the deficiency can be made good only by the co-operation of Australia with the United Kingdom and other British Commonwealth countries in sharing in the sterling area dollar pool. Does any. one dispute that? The preamble asserts further that the additional dollar currency required by Australia is supplied from the sterling area dollar pool by the United Kingdom in return for sterling, on the understanding that Australia continues to co-operate in conserving the dollar resources of the sterling area. That is a condition of our obtaining dollars from the pool. The possession of unconvertible balances does not of itself assure us of dollars. As the Prime Minister has pointed out, we are under a tremendous obligation to Britain and other countries in the sterling area for their co-operation by which Australia is able to obtain the dollars it needs. The fourth point made in the preamble to the bill is that, in view of the intensification of the shortage of dollar currency available to countries in the sterling area, the Government of the United Kingdom arranged a conference to review the dollar currency position. That conference was held in July last. It was not an unimportant conference, but a conference of British Commonwealth nations at the highest level, and it was attended by responsible Ministers. There were representatives British Government, and also of Canada. Although Canada is in the dollar area, it is also a member of the British Commonwealth, and the presence of its representatives at the conference Dr.. ISvat t, was useful, if not vital. Australia was represented by the Minister for Postwar Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman). Ceylon was also represented. Ceylon is a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and has an actual surplus of dollars because of its trade with dollar countries. However, Ceylon has shown an example that might well be followed by honourable members opposite, and is willing to put its surplus dollars into the pool for the benefit of other members of the British Commonwealth. Other countries represented at the conference were India, New Zealand, Pakistan, South Africa and Southern Rhodesia. What resulted from the conference is the agreement set out in the bill, which is that the value of imports from the dollar area in 1949-50 should be reduced by the member nations of the British Commonwealth to 75 per cent, of the value of imports from that area in the previous twelve months. The representatives of all of the member nations agreed to try to achieve comparable results. The Australian Government had no opposition from the Parliament when that agreement was made. It was never suggested that Australia should not be a party to sterling that bargain with Great Britain and the British Commonwealth. Some members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party declaim, occasionally, on the value of Empire co-operation. They say that it is essential for the maintenance of the status of Australia and that it is one of the basic factors in our international relations. That is true. Yet, when we make an agreement with the British Commonwealth they seek to repudiate it. Nothing said by the honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang), who, of course, has never suggested repudiation, goes counter to the agreement. It is completely without precedent in Australian history that it should be suggested that an agreement made by Australia with Great Britain and its sister dominions and the British Who were present at it? colonies should be repudiated. Yet, some of the honourable members opposite indicate that their attitude is, "" Tear up the agreement with the British Commonwealth and Great Britain. Never mind the bargain "". They want to buy petrol from overseas, but none of them has told us how we shall pay for it. The attitude of some honourable members opposite is, ""Hang our relations with Great Britain and the British Commonwealth"", notwithstanding their political, economic and kinship value. They have adopted that attitude in the hope of obtaining some momentarypolitical advantage. They misunderstand the mind of the people of Australia, as they did in 1943 during the war. Even then, the Leader of the Australian Country party made suggestions about doing away with restrictions. It is said that we should get rid of restrictions. But the members of the Government are not seeking to impose rationing because, we are enamoured of it! Honourable gentlemen opposite argue that we are trying to impose petrol rationing simply to put restrictions on the people. No more absurd or irresponsible suggestion could be made. The Government would not place restrictions on people if they could be avoided. We have to carry out our part of the bargain because our position in relation to dollar currency would be hopeless without the bargain. We get a reasonable supply of dollars. We could let every one scramble for the available petrol. There are two factors in the petrol situation. One is price and the second is availability. If petrol is too dear, rationing results, because only the wealthy can afford to buy it. I believe that many honourable gentlemen opposite would like to see that situation arise, and I have no doubt that certain business interests would prefer it. But, if one looks at the two factors, price and availability, one must realize that the only way in which petrol, which is in short supply, may be properly shared, is by a system of rationing. It is perfectly true that this is an emergency measure. One could not regard the situation as satisfactory if it were thought that it would continue indefinitely. The first point is that we must carry out our agreement with Great Britain and the rest of the British Commonwealth. If we are determined to carry it out, the only fair thing to do is to institute a system of rationing. A perfect illustration of the need for rationing is provided by tea, which is a necessity to every housewife in the country. Because of intervention by the Australian Government, the price of tea in Australia is 2s. 9d. per lb. cheaper than it would be without the subsidy and without rationing. Deputy Speaker. How is it possible for the Minister to relate tea to petrol? analogous. principle of debate is a comparison of methods. The Minister is not entitled to go into a long discussion on tea, but he is entitled to draw conclusions from the rationing of tea. another liquid, is not palatable to the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison). I am not going to go into details of the tea arrangement but, under it, tea is obtained fairly by the Australian people from one end of Australia to the other. If tea was not rationed and if the price were not controlled, the price would rise to unheard-of heights. Tea is essential to people and, without rationing and without the subsidy, the price would rise to at least 10s. per lb. Tea and petrol are analogous in. this connection. Ever since the High Court decided that the Australian Government had no' power to ration petrol, we have seen what private enterprise, plus the profit motive, havt,done. The position is chaotic, because there is no proper sharing of a commodity that is in short supply. The only way in which to deal justly with the position is by reverting to rationing. There -was no objection by the people of Australia to the rationing of petrol when it was rationed. There was no suggestion that rationing should be done away with. No speech was made by honourable gentlemen on the other side of the chamber in opposition to rationing. No suggestion was made that it should be ended. No questions were asked about it. honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) is against rationing altogether. able gentleman be fair. He said that no",27,Evatt Barton Attorney Average Dollar Deficit In Its Trade Relations

Consequently, petrol is in short supply and tbe only way in which the people may get a fair deal is by the reintroduction of rationing. The very word ""rationing"" connotes a fair distribution of goods that are scarce. If the views of honourable members opposite were given effect to there would be chaos. Only a few people in the community, and they would probably be those who do no essential work, would be able to get petrol without rationing. Honourable gentlemen cannot get away with such statements as appeared the other day in the press as having been made by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) and the Leader of the Australian Conntry party, that petrol rationing will go if they have the say. The statement was made expeetedly by the Leader of the Australian Country party, but unexpectedly by the Leader of the Opposition, that rationing would go. If rationing went, then our agreement with Great Britain would also go. If our agreement with Great Britain goes, then our dollar resources would not be available. There is a further aspect of this case that I should like the House to consider, because it goes even deeper than the matters that I have already dealt with. It has never been the practice, either in this country or in Britain, for political parties to adopt a partisan Rttitude in relation to the affairs of other members of the British Commonwealth. It is perfectly true that the citizens of British countries may have their opinions on these matters. But we have heard in this House in the last four or five weeks open attacks made by prominent Opposition party members, including the Leader of the Australian Country party and also by several members of the Liberal party, upon the British Government. In other words, according to those honourable members, our fundamental relationships with Britain are dependent not upon tbe permanent fact of kinship, but upon the accidental fact that a. particular political party is in power. That is one of Minister's lead, his complete franknessthe most serious things that have occurred in the history of the British Commonwealth. It is most disturbing that we should have attacks in the National Parliament of this country on particular members of the British Cabinet* I say that the British Government, under unspeakable difficulties, has steered the ship of State through perils of divers kinds, not only political, but also international and economic, and that it is deserving of our sympathy and assistance in all its tasks. We should understand that the people of Great Britain are supporting the actions that the British Government has taken in the national interests. I think that nearly 50 by-elections have been held in Great Britain in the last, four years and in not one instance have the people rejected the Government's; candidate for a seat that the Government: won at the last general election. I regard this particular problem of.' petrol as one that can be summed up. quite briefly: First of all, we must keepour agreement with Great Britain, orotherwise we embark upon a policy of repudiation of our arrangements.. Secondly, we must not break our agreement, because by doing so, we should: cause ruin to Australia, and would then: he in a position in which ""we should; have no dollar resources available tons. The 'whole idea of repudiationis foreign to this Government and to itsopinion of what is proper in these circumstances. Thirdly, if ""we determine that we must carry out our arrangements with Great Britain, how shall we deal with the problem of the shortage? Shall weallow a continuance of the scramble, confusion and chaos that are going on to-day through the absence of regulation by responsible governments, or shall we tryto govern the country in the interests of* the people? During the war, we had' exactly the same choice in relation to a vaster field than we are dealing withto-day. We told the people then that it was necessary to do certain things in theinterests of Australia and of the British Commonwealth, and the people supported' the Government, because they do not likegovernments that run away from responsibility. I say, in conclusion, that the Prime-",29,Evatt Barton Attorney Average Dollar Deficit In Its Trade Relations
79,Dr. Evatt,"We bave made an agreeto tlie House, his determination to keep the arrangement with Great Britain, and his continual care for the people of Australia in these matters, are all important factors that will win for him, and for the party that loyally ' supports him, the approval of the people of Australia on this duce a bill great issue at the forthcoming general elections. 8ittin.g suspended from IS.JtS to 2.15 p.m. order in attempting to discuss a matter the suspension of the sitting the Minister for External Affairs (Dr. Evatt) made some astonishing statements in criticism of the Opposition parties. As a former justice of the High Court, one would have expected the right honourable gentleman to have been fair and to have quoted correctly the statements that have been made by honourable members on this side of the House. The right honourable gentleman accused members of the Opposition parties of being willing to repudiate a solemn agreement with Great Britain, and of having said, ""Never mind the bargain "". I cannot recall any statement during this debate in which any honourable member on this side of the House suggested that we should repudiate any agreement with Great Britain. Rather have we gone to the other extreme. Evidently, in the eyes of the Government, the parties on this side areas. I hope to be able to demonstrate of the House have adopted the new role of anti-Britishers. Only a little while ago we were thumped by honourable members opposite for being pro-British, as though that were a great sin. I remind honourable members opposite that 75per cent, of the members of the Opposition parties are ex-servicemen who have made a real contribution towards the preservation of Great Britain. The accusation that we are anti-British is completely false. When, this morning, the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) endeavoured to introduce a bill which was designed to give greater aid to Great Britain Clark) -Order! The honourable member may not refer to that matter. only a passing reference to it, Mr Deputy Speaker. honourable member must limit his remarks to only a passing reference. That matter has been disposed of by the House. able member for Cowper wished to introThe Chair has already ruled that the honourable member will not be in that has already been disposed of by the House. External Affairs has also referred to the dollar shortage. Every one knows that there is a dollar shortage. The right honourable gentleman also said that Australia must draw on the Empire dollar pool for its dollar requirements and reimburse the pool with sterling. That statement also is correct. Surely, however, we can earn dollars in our own right and do not have to rely entirely on the dollar pool. We could earn and conserve dollars by increasing our exports to the dollar areas and by reducing the wastage of dollars in the United States of America which results from heavy and, perhaps, unnecessary government expenditure in that country. It has been said that Australia must obtain more of its requirements of petrol from non-dollar how that can be done. Ampol, that most maligned j Australian company, has already shown how it can be done. The shortage of petrol has caused great dislocation of our economy. In my electorate, as in many other parts of the country, shearing has been held up because of the petrol scarcity. As honourable members are aware shearing begins at different times in different areas. In some parts of my electorate shearing must commence immediately; but those farmers who refused to be panicked by statements of the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) and did not put aside stocks of petrol for that purpose are unable to commence shearing operations. Those remarks are true also cherry crop be carried on continuously at this time of the year, the crop will be seriously affected. Transport of all kinds has been dislocated by the petrol shortage.

86,Mr Howse,"The Minister forrun. This is but a small part of tbe dismal and depressing picture of tbe conditions that exist to-day because of the lack of petrol. What is the story of petrol rationing? Four years after the war had ended petrol was still being rationed in this country, notwithstanding the fact that it was the duty of the Government to do everything possible to l if t restriccable or ring his Australian office and get an tions on the use of petrol as soon as hostilities ceased. The Government continued to impose this restriction until its action was successfully challenged in the High Court. It is the first duty of the Government to find ways and means by which it can obviate the necessity for petrol rationing. We all agreed during the war that the rationing of petrol was inevitable, but since the war has ended the Government has shown no real determination to abolish petrol rationing. Members of the Government appear to derive much pleasure from the imposition of restrictions on the people. The prospect of the re-imposition of petrol rationing must give great joy to this Government of restrictions and shortages. too generous to believe that. the search for oil in this country? No real interest has been displayed by the Government in the search for oil, nor has the search been intensive. The managing director of Ampol has made a noteworthy statement on the subject of petrol which has appeared in the press on several occasions. By no' means can that statement be regarded as a wild attempt to impress newspaper readers. He saidThe French company which already had sidering an increase of the price of petrol contracted to supply 9,500,000 gallons had in Australia. It would be quite impractithe hacking of the Freucli Government . . . There is no doubt that Australia can get is imported from one source without enough petrol from sterling areas to avoid reducing the tax upon petrol that is imrationing. T h a t is the whole basis of our argument. I do not suggest that that should be He w e n t on to sayI understand that Australia needs between should be paid upon petrol from areas in 30,000,000 and 40,000,000 gallons extra to do away wit h rationing. ment of the position. managing director of Ampol continuedThe French petrol alone would account for relation to petrol. The Prime Minister 75 per cent, of that. Plenty of sterling petrol is available from European sources but you've got to be quick to buy it . Sometimes you have only 48 hours to decide whether you are going to buy. It's hopeless waiting for import licences to clinch the deal. He suggested that the Commonwealth should issue open licences for the importation of sterling petrol, and continuedThe man on the spot can find the petrol, immediate answer. But I understand that the Commonwealth Government wants evidence of availability through a cabled offer. By the time the Government grants the import licence some one else has bought the petrol. That clear and concise statement of the position was made by a man who should know what he is talking about. The Government should be able to grant import licences speedily. Petrol companies are unable to take advantage of supplies that may be offered unless they are in a position to snap them up on the spot. A company which shows that it is anxious to obtain petrol should not be hindered by the Government. I propose now to deal briefly with the possibility of an increase of the price of petrol. The Government believes that the importation of petrol from Prance would be uneconomic. The Prime Minister has indicated that such petrol would be so "" pricey "" that bringing it to Australia would not be worthwhile. It has been stated in the press that the British Government has agreed to an increase of the price of petrol sold in Great Britain by 2£d. a gallon. According to to-day's press, the Prices Commissioners are concable to reduce the tax upon petrol that ported from other sources, and done, but I do affirm that a subsidy which high costs are unavoidable. at its present price level, and also encourage oil companies to endeavour to obtain shown no business sense or ability in",31,Evatt Barton Attorney Average Dollar Deficit In Its Trade Relations

90,Mr Howse,"The statement by the additional supplies. The Government hasstated yesterday that last year France purchased from Australia £40,000,000 worth of goods more than we bought from France. He said that he made no apology for endeavouring to purchase goods from France, because the French must earn sterling and dollars. However, in spite of that declaration, the Government has made no real attempt to buy petrol from France. Another illustration of the Government's lack of business ability is that for a number of years it has allowed Australian wool to be sold by continental countries, at a discount, for dollars. The Government admittedly has protested to those countries, but has made no real attempt to stop the practice. able gentleman suggest that we should stop it? ments with those countries under which they would supply us with petrol in return for wool. if the continental countries refused to enter into such agreements? wool badly, they would enter into them. The abandonment of petrol rationing would mean that a large army of rationing officials could be more usefully employed. It would also mean that petrol racketeers and black marketeers would be forced out of business. Do not let us be hypocritical and pretend that they do not exist. Petrol rationing encourages racketeers to set up printing presses for the production' of forged petrol tickets. It makes honest men and women dishonest and forces them to break the law to obtain the petrol that they need. How many persons have borrowed petrol tickets from friends who have a few to spare? Doubtless a number of honourable members of this House have done so, although, technically, such a practice is illegal. Under petrol rationing, honest men and women have to act dishonestly to get a reasonable quantity of petrol. Many persons perjure themselves so that they may be enabled to carry on their business. They make a good story a little better. Those are the evils of rationthe consumption of petrol by Commoning. honest people may be normally, only by the abolition of petrol rationing. The Government has estimated that petrol imports would need to be increased by only 15 per cent, to avoid the necessity for petrol rationing. I point out that there has been no real chance to test the accuracy of that estimate, because unrationed petrol has not had a fair go. I should have thought that the Government would welcome the abolition of petrol rationing, because an increase of petrol imports by 15 per cent, would increase the national revenue by £2,000,000 a year. It has been said that there is equality of distribution of petrol. The average consumption of petrol in Canada for each vehicle is 726 gallons a year. In India it is 644 gallons a year, in South Africa, 612 gallons a year, and in New Zealand, 385 gallons a year. Australia is an "" also r a n be c a u s e the average annual consumption of petrol by each vehicle in this country is only 300 gallons. Becently the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) asked the Minister representing the Minister for Shipping and Fuel, upon notice, the following question:1. Whnt WHS the average monthly consumption of petrol by the Commonwealth Government and its departments from January to May, 1949, inclusive? ' 2. What has been the consumption in each of the months since? The months from January to May were months in which petrol rationing was in force. From June until the present time petrol has been unrationed. The Minister for Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley) supplied the following answer to the question:The average monthly consumption of petrol by the Commonwealth Government and its departments from January to May, 1949, was 091.877 gallons. Then the answer sets out the figures for each of the. months from January to May. It continuesThe consumption during June, July, August and September, 1949, was: June, 800,339 gallons; July. 942,740 gallons; August, 883,187 gallons; September, 802,159 gallons. That is a monthly average of 857,000 gallons. In order to he fair, I must point out that it is stated in the answer that They can be avoided, however wealth departments in recent months has",32,Evatt Barton Attorney Average Dollar Deficit In Its Trade Relations

94,Mr Howse,"If they wanted ourbeen abnormal, because of tbe coal strike, which affected consumption for the months of June, July and August. During those months hundreds of vehicles had to be sent long distances with mails that would normally have gone by rail. However, the fact is that under rationing the average monthly petrol consumption by Commonwealth departments was 691,877 gallons and, without rationing, it was 857,100 gallons. That is an increase of 165,000 gallons a month. In September, when the coal strike was not in progress and when petrol was scarce, Commonwealth departments used 802,159 gallons, or 110,000 gallons in excess of the average monthly consumption under rationing. To be fair, I have selected a month during which the national economy and transport services were not disrupted' by a coal strike, and that period provides a clear example of the effect of the Government's call to the nation to conserve petrol stocks. The attitude of the Government towards rationing is summed up in the last paragraph of the reply that the Minister for Shipping and Fuel gave to the questions that had been asked by the honourable member for Fawkner. The Minister statedEvery precaution is being taken to ensure that petrol is used only for essential transnot likely during the next five or ten port in Commonwealth vehicles. During rationing no user was left without petrol for essential transport and this applied find will able gentleman's optimism. He should apply, so far as supplies permit, to the Commonwealth Government as well as to other users. The Government did not give the abolition of petrol rationing a fair trial. The disruption of transport that was caused by the coal strike forced up the consumption of petrol. Road transport, which is always a heavy consumer of petrol, had to be increased in order to convey to cities and towns essential goods that could not be carried by the restricted railway services. ' Members of the Opposition have referred at considerable length to the fact that Italy, a former enemy country, does not ration the sales of petrol. It seems most unjust that the people of Italy are able to use as much petrol as they desire whilst the people of the so-called victorious countries are heavily rationed. According to press reports, the petrol situation in Germany is not acute. I am Mr Bowse. not able to vouch for the accuracy of those reports,, but I understand that tourists who visit Germany are permitted to draw 45 gallons of pe.trol a month. From what source does Italy obtain its supplies of petrol? Why has petrol rationing been abolished in that former enemy country? When I was in Italy last year, I noticed that the Italians had excellent modern cars, and that they do not stint themselves in that respect. Italy refines its requirements of motor spirit from crude oils, the bulk of which are obtained from the sterling area. mation to the honourable member? denied. arrangement could be made with Italy to supply refined spirit to the sterling area. That proposal seems logical and reasonable. Australia, after all, is a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and should be entitled to a better deal than a former enemy country is receiving. According to the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) an outbreak of war is years. That thought is most comforting, and I wish that I could share the honorbe better informed than I am, and should have all the information that is available about the position. orable gentleman acknowledges that. ment by using the. word "" should "". If the Government is so satisfied that war will not break out during the next five or ten years, it can release some of the defence stocks of petrol to tide over the present difficult period until Ampol is able to import petrol from other countries. That company has been relieving the Government of the responsibility to obtain additional supplies of petrol, and its initiative in that respect is an excellent example of the manner in which private enterprise is able to assist this country. Australia urgently requires petrol for the operation of its essential industries. Any honourable",33,Evatt Barton Attorney Average Dollar Deficit In Its Trade Relations

100,Mr Howsei Qualified That State,"member who travels long distances in the country districts realizes that essential users and primary producers are severely handicapped through the lack of adequate supplies of liquid fuel. A municipality in my electorate has been constantly in telephonic communication with me, stating that it is unable to carry on its essential services. Petrol is the life-blood of this country to the same degree as are steel and coal. Because the output of steel, is substantially less than the productive capacity of the steel works, Australia has been importing supplies of that metal. The Government has not ordered Australian users of steel to adjust their programmes to the local output. After considerable urging by the Opposition parties, the Government has even imported coal. Why, then, does it obstinately refuse to import additional petrol? I am happy to say that next year, the Liberal party-Australian Country party government will get additional petrol, because we realize that it is essential to the development of the country. Mr O'CONNOR (West Sydney) [2.41]. -The purpose of this bill is to ensure, so far as Commonwealth legislative power permits, a just and orderly sharing of liquid fuel amongst the people of A'ustralia while such fuel is in short supply, and for other purposes. The necessity for this legislation arose when the High Court of Australia declared invalid the National Security (Liquid Fuel) Regulations, under which the Commonwealth had been empowered to ration the sale of petrol in this country. The High Court gave its judgment last July, and the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), aware of the implications of the decision, immediately asked the Premiers of the six States to take prompt action to ensure the re-introduction of petrol rationing. Despite the Prime Minister's endeavours since July, some of the States have not yet acted in the matter. Their reluctance, or determination not to do so, has contributed in a measure to the present petrol crisis. More than two months ago, the Premier of Victoria, Mr Hollway, attended a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers that had been convened by the Prime Minister for the purpose of considering the re-introduction of petrol rationing. After having heard the Government's submissions, Mr Hollway gave an undertaking that Victoria would support any attempt that was made by the Commonwealth to reimpose rationing. Mr Hollway returned to Melbourne, and a cave led by the Minister for Housing, Mr Warner, promptly developed in bis Government. As the result of that obstruction, the Premier of Victoria has not yet fulfilled the promise that he gave to the Commonwealth. Some of the members of the Victorian Government are opposed to the re-introduction of. petrol rationing, not because they fail to realize the' necessity for controlling sales, but because they hope to gain a party political advantage from the existing shortage. Mr Warner admitted that he was interested in a company ""which claimed to be able to import ample supplies of petrol from Russia. Following that announcement, the Soviet Embassy in Canberra issued a statement to the effect that if Russia was in a position to export petrol to Australia, its representatives here would be aware of that fact. They emphatically repudiated Mr Warner's claim. Subsequent events proved conclusively that Mr Warner's statement had no foundation in fact, hut had been made for party political purposes. Russia is keeping its petrol supplies behind .the Iron Curtain. Next, we were told that Australia could obtain petrol from Poland, but time has proved that that claim was incorrect. Indeed, all the arguments that have been advanced about the availability of petrol in foreign countries for purchase by Australia have been proved wrong. The Government has been amply justified. The statements that, have been made with reckless abandon by almost every member of the Opposition do them very little credit. It is now generally recognized that petrol rationing is inevitable, and would have to be introduced no matter what government was in power. A majority of the people who have suffered during the period that petrol sales have been uncontrolled are waiting impatiently for the reimposition of rationing, ""which will enable the workers and members of the middle class to get some petrol, at any rate. Members of tbe Opposition have consistently argued that the lifting of government controls would cure our economic ills. Events have proved, however, that the lifting of controls has contributed nothing towards economic recovery; on the contrary, it has hindered national development. government control of tobacco was abandoned almost immediately the war ended, but the trade has established its own controls. The trade says who shall get tobacco and how much each consumer shall get, and has even, discussed the issuing of licences for the purchase of tobacco. Recent experience has proved that petrol rationing had the advantage of ensuring the equitable distribution of whatever petrol was available. When rationing was abolished, those who were fortunate enough to be able to buy in quantity did so, while other people went without. In the New South Wales Legislative Assembly yesterday, the Premier said that the oil companies had made available the ordinary quantity of petrol to distributors during the last month, but the distributors, who received the petrol, claimed that they had sold out their stocks. rately. This sophism that there is no I . have no hesitation in saying that some traders are holding on to stocks in the hope of benefiting from a rise of price. In spite of the claims of members of the commodities, chaos has resulted. When Opposition, the fact is that the dollar pool is limited, and if we spend more dollars on petrol, there will be less to spend on the purchase of other essential commodities. Among other industries, the motor industry itself would suffer. The Government must do the best-it can with the dollars available. Some honourable members opposite have urged that Australia should sell more wool to the United States of America. About twelve months ago, a bill was introduced into the Congress of the United States of America providing for the imposition of an increased duty on imported fine wool. The bill was vetoed by the President, but had it been passed, and had the duty been imposed, it would have further limited our sales of wool to the' United States of America. The fact is that our sales of wool to the United States of America are governed, not by our willingness to Sir. O'Connor. sell, but by the willingness of the United! States of America to buy. ing America from buying our wool. Mr O'CONNOR -That is so; in fact, we should like to sell more wool to the For example, United States of America. Much has been made of the fact that petrol is not rationed in some countries in the sterlingarea. An argument based on that fact is». mere sophism in that it does not convey the whole truth. Whilst there is no straight-out rationing of petrol in France, supplies are allocated in such a way that it is almost impossible for ordinary people to obtain petrol. It is distributed on a system of priorities, and those who have no priority have to pay one-third more for their petrol than those who have. It has also been claimed that' crude oil is being imported by Italy, a sterling country, and refined there. However, we have not been told how much oil is being imported and refined, or whether it is enough to supply the needs of the Italian people. If that information were at our disposal we should be in a position to assess the position more accupetrol rationing here or there, in the final analysis, conveys nothing. Whenever the Government has lifted controls over scarce controls operated every one was assured of getting his fair share. When controls are lifted and prices rise, the people with lots of money can buy all they want and those with little money go without. The Government cannot be blamed for having failed to import petrol. It never has done so. The importation of oil products is the prerogative of private enterprise. Had the Government imported oil products, honourable members opposite would have been the first to challenge it. If criticism for the failure to import oil products is to be levelled, it must be levelled against the oil companies. Much has been said about buying oil products from countries in the sterling areas. Many people interested in the dispute about petrol argue that additional supplies of petrol could be obtained for sterling. That argument was repudiated in the Melbourne Herald last night by Mr E. N . Avery, general",34,Evatt Barton Attorney Average Dollar Deficit In Its Trade Relations
101,Mrf Thompson,"We are not preventananager of the Shell Company of Aust r a l ia Limitedi n these termsMr Avery cites the example of Venezuela where sterling oil and dollar oil is produced in the same area-bu t by British-controlled and American-controlled companies respectively. Another example of the danger of assuming that a sterling area necessarily produces sterling oil is Bahrein, in the Persian Gulf. There, -oil is produced by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, which is registered in Canada, but which is wholly owned in the United States. Its product is, therefore, about 90 per cent, dollar oil. Mr Avery set out, not to state a case for rationing, but to try to reduce the public -confusion between geography and the sterling 6Joo on the one hand and the intricacies of oil company finance on the other. In the course of his article, however, he makes several assertions which show his company's disbelief in the prospect of Jarge increases in petrol supply for Australia . . . The Government has been criticized on account of Australia's lack of refining capacity. On that matter, Mr Avery saysThe crux of the situation is simply that there is not sufficient refining capacity in the world to supply the full need for finished petroleum products. Nearly all countries are short of their oil requirements, and the United States of America is now, in balance, a net importer of petroleum products. I think that answers claims by Opposition members that, if they are returned to power, they w ill abolish petrol rationing. New Zealand abolished petrol rationing and, in one week-end alone, in Auckland, no fewer than 475 motor cars and motor lorries were stranded because of lack of petrol. impose rationing. Other countries that abolished rationing had similar experiences. As a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, we have agreed to reduce our dollar expenditure in order to help the United Kingdom. Every other British country has entered the agreement. We are carrying out the agreement. We should be remiss if we did not accept our share of the responsib i l it y to restore the fortunes of the British -Commonwealth of Nations, especially the United Kingdom. It was a sorry day indeed when petrol rationing ended. The decision of the H i g h Court may have been good law, but it was bad economics. The people would rather have rationing than be left to the tender mercies of the suppliers. Rationing ensures eqiiity. The people who need petrol may get it . As the result of the scarcity of dollars petrol rationing is an economic necessity. It w ill restore sanity and justice to a country where insanity and injustice in the matter of petrol are rampant. The controversy about petrol supplies appears to have reached a stage at which the Opposition says that more petrol can and should be obtained, and the Government says that it is unable to obtain more petrol. The Government appears at the moment to be very anxious that more petrol shall not enter the country at this stage. The whole matter has taken a highly political turn. If any private company can now obtain large quantities of petrol, or even such a quantity as the Ampol company has acquired, that fact would j u s t if y very fully the arguments advanced by the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden). If private companies were now able to obtain more petrol than the Government has stated can be obtained, the Government would be placed in a very awkward position. It is because of that fact that this matter has become so highly political. I believe that if a man has informatio n about a national matter of this character he should disclose it . I also believe that this Labour Government is not at all anxious at this stage that more petrol shall be obtained by any private company. able member think that? simply that, if a private company were to obtain more petrol, the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) and other honourable members on the Government side who have spoken during this debate would be proved very definitely to have been in the wrong, and the facts and figures advanced by honourable members on this side of the House would be f u l l y justified. The Leader of the Australian Country party stated some time ago that petrol could be secured from non-dollar areas and cited facts and figures in support of his statements, the truth of which has been proved by the consignment that Ampol has secured from France and by the fact that that company has prospects",36,Evatt Barton Attorney Average Dollar Deficit In Its Trade Relations

104,Mr Turnbull,"The reason isof obtaining more supplies from that source in the near future. When the Prime Minister was asked whether he knew about Ampol's negotiations to obtain petrol he said, "" Of course I knew. I signed the import licence."". But that is all he did know about it. WhatI want to know is, if the Government knew that Ampol was able to obtain such petrol, why have its representatives overseas, who are costing this country not only pounds, but also dollars, not done something about obtaining such petrol? honourable gentleman believed in private enterprise. private enterprise. I also believe that private enterprise in this country is the main source from which the money that is expended on our overseas representation is derived, and that our overseas representatives should do some work towards overcoming the grave petrol shortage from which this country now suffers. The whole matter has become so political that when an honourable member on this side of the House asks a question about it his words are given a meaning different from that intended. Even the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) are guilty of having done that to me. The Prime Minister twisted a question of mine, but I shall not go into that matter at length, because I made it the subject of a short speech on an adjournment motion last week. The Attorney-General said this morning that nobody had complained about petrol rationing when it was in operation, and that everybody had been satisfied until tbe High Court of Australia, had failed to uphold the Government's contention in regard to its powers. When I interjected, ""Yes, people have complained about it "" , the right honourable gentleman twisted the import of my remark by saying, "" I take it that the honourable member is against rationing"". He went on to say that no member of this House had suggested, during the period of petrol rationing, that it should be abolished and that people in the country had not complained about it. That statement could be taken as having been made either in ignorance or as an untruth. I believe that the Attorney General quite honestly believed it to be true, but was ignorant of what had been going on in this country because he has been abroad for most of the last three years. Other honourable members also have said that nobody in this House complained about petrol rationing. I have only to find in Hansard one speech complaining about petrol rationing to show that it is not true to say that nobody at all has complained. I do not even need to refer to Hansard to satisfy myself about that, because I attend the sittings of this House every day and have heard many such speeches. On the 27 th February, 1947, the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) asked the following question:Is the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Shipping aware that there is a widespread feeling in Australia that the time has arrived for the abolition of petrol rationing? Has consideration been given to this matter recently? If so, what are the prospects of petrol rationing being discontinued at an early date? In his reply the Minister for Defence( Mr Dedman) said in effect that there was no prospect of rationing being discontinued. Of course, that completely negatives the statement made this morning by the Attorney-General, who is second in Cabinet rank in the present Government, when I reminded him that he was on the wrong track and all he could do was to try to twist what I had said and so gain, even from me, a backbencher, a paltry party political advantage. This matter has reached the stage when the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General try to twist questions by honourable members who seek information. Those right honourable gentlemen would not take such a course if this whole matter did not have them on the run. In my opinion petrol rationing is just another control that the Government has been loath to relinquish. Although honourable members on the Government side have said that during the rationing period' petrol was not in short supply in Australia the preamble to this bill states that its purpose isTo ensure, so far as Commonwealth Legislative Power permits, a just and orderly Sharing of Liquid Fuel amongst the People of Australia while such Fuel is in short supply, and for other purposes.",37,Evatt Barton Attorney Average Dollar Deficit In Its Trade Relations

Less than a month ago the Ministerf o r Transport ( Mr Ward) used in this House the following words of which I took a written note:When the war was on the Government could have done almost anything and would not have been challenged, but once the danger was over all sorts of challenges had a chance of success. petrol the cost of which has a dollar conThe guiding principle of this Government is more and more control, and while it is in power petrol w ill continue to be rationed. Some time ago the honourable member for Perth( Mr Burke) said in a question to the Prime MinisterI have received representations from the building industry congress and the hardware merchants in Perth explaining that the limited petrol ration does not permit them to take delivery of materials required for the housing programme in that State. The honourable member is a responsible member of this Parliament for whom I have a very high regard, and he would not ask the Prime Minister a question based on such information unless there was a sound reason for it . Opposition has suggested that petrol rationing be abolished and that supplies be increased, but of course the Government will do nothing about that because this matter has become so political. However, I think that it w ill not be very long before the people of Australia w ill have very definite proof that the Leader of the Australian Country party is absolutely right in his contention, and that more petrol w ill in fact be obtained. Much has been said about the dollar content of petrol costs. The Government is bringing into, the country many things that have a dollar content in their costs. Only yesterday the Prime Minister informed me that the Government was importing rails for railway construction from Prance. examine will discover that, through the operation of Marshall aid, the cost of these rails has a f a i r l y large dollar content. within that category. We have constantly complained that the Government imports goods from the United States of America There is really no which are not absolutely necessary. Some time ago I asked the Prime Minister why the allowance of petrol for each motor vehicle should be considerably less in Australia than in other Empire countries. The right honourable gentleman did not give me a straight-out answer. He merely said that the Government runs this country in its own way and that it is not concerned about what other countries do. The Attorney-General said this morning that if we obtain additional tent Australia will be ruined. gentleman did not say that. words as he uttered them. As a matter of fact I invariably write down the words of honourable members opposite when they say things which I think they should not say..' must indeed be a very busy man. ( Mr Lazzarini) -Order! The honourable member for Parramatta must cease interjecting. The users have received an average of 300 gallons for each motor vehicle in use in this country.

Many persons in my electorate who have purchased Ferguson tractors for use in the dried fruits areas complain that they are unable to obtain petrol with which to operate them. Honourable members opposite can well imagine the effect of the scarcity of petrol on the sales of British-made tractors. The petrol shortage has also had a serious effect on the sales of English motor cars in this country. Great Britain stands to lose more by the shortage of petrol in Australia resulting from the restrictions imposed by this Government than it could possibly lose if additional quantities of petrol involving dollar expenditure were permitted to be imported into this country. A reasonable flow of petrol in this country would enable our transport services to operate at the full peak of efficiency and would make possible a great production drive which would be of benefit not only to this country but also to the dying hours of the Eighteenth' the United Kingdom. The benefits that would flow from increased oil supplies in Australia would far outweigh any disadvantages that might accrue to the United Kingdom as the result of the importation into Australia of additional quantities of petrol involving the expenditure of dollars.

At an early stage, the Prime Minister said in this House, following the receipt of a cable from the United Kingdom, that petrol imports into the sterling area cost the sterling area more than 400,000,000 dollars a year. That was the only information that the United Kingdom Government, would permit the right honourable gentleman to give to the House at that time, but the figure that was given to Ministers at the London conference, of the dollar cost of petrol to the sterling area last year, was 600,000,000 dollars. cost of capital equipment. matter.

The Leader of the Australian Country party interjected to the effect that a considerable percentage of that cost was represented by the importation into the United Kingdom of capital equipment for refining crude oil into petrol. Actually, the dollar expenditure on that capital equipment amounted to less than 100,000,000 dollars of the 600,000,000 dollars.

Australian Country party has been interrupting me. The Minister should address himself to the Chair. If he will concentrate on his speech, he will do a lot better. dollar cost of petrol entering the sterling area is 600,000,000 dollars. It is true, as has been stated by members of the Opposition, that whilst there is a shortage Kembla. All those purchases may be of refined petrol and of refining capacity, ample supplies of crude oil are. available in various parts of the world. The United Kingdom Government is developing its own refineries, and refineries are being established in other non-dollar areas. Refiners in the United States of America, who see the prospect of losing some of their markets, are making a song about the amount of dollars that they will forgo when the new refineries in the non-dollar areas begin production. The American refiners assess the dollar cost of petrol that is coming into the sterling area, not at 600,000,000 dollars, but at as high as ,700,000,000 dollars per annum. When we take into account the fact that more than £200,000,000 sterling is being paid annually for petrol from the sterling area and that the total reserves of the whole sterling area amount at present to a little more than 300,000,000 dollars, which could be exhausted within, say, nine months, we should realize how important it is that the United Kingdom, Australia and every other member of the British Commonwealth of Nations shall do everything possible to prevent an undue expenditure of dollars on petrol or anything else. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Lang) and other honourable members have stated that the House has not been given information about the cost of Australia's purchases of petrol. I shall deal with that port them, and expects people to believe matter. The value of all the petroleum products that were imported by Australia last year was £50,000,000, cost, insurance, freight, and exchange, of which the dollar content was 45,000,000 dollars. In other words, Australia expended last year 45,000,000 dollars on petrol. As I shall show, we cannot obtain petrol from the sterling area, and the extra cost of importing sufficient petrol to avoid the need for rationing liquid fuel in this country would be 17,000,000 dollars. That amount of dollars would have to be provided either from the dollar and gold reserves of the sterling area or by diverting some of our present expenditure of dollars on motor car chassis, capital equipment for various industries, and equipment for the mechanization of coal mines and for the new strip mill for the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited at Port described as vital, and every honourable member knows that if we were to divert our dollar expenditure in the way that I have mentioned, unemployment would follow in a number of industries in this country. Two years ago we had to draw from the United Kingdom reserve of gold and dollars no less a sum than 164,000,000 dollars. Last year, we drew 70,000,000 dollars from that reserve. I do not know how many dollars we shall draw this year, but as we have to rely on that reserve to make up what we do not earn ourselves, it behoves us to do our utmost to conserve our expenditure of dollars. Having placed that general position before the House, I shall deal with a few of the arguments that have been advanced by honourable members opposite in this debate. The honourable member for Wentworth said that milk was being wasted at some place because petrol was not available to transport it to consumers. The honourable member did not adduce any evidence to support his statement. Indeed, he made only a bald statement, which was completely untrue. Government completely ignores the welfare of country people. ber for Wentworth makes the wildest statements without any evidence to supthem.

It would require 17,000,000 dollars to buy all the petrol necessary to avoid petrol rationing in Australia next year. There are two ways in which the Government could avoid the necessity for the introduction of this legislation. One would be to repudiate the solemn agreement entered into with the United Kingdom to save as many dollars as possible. The second way would be to divert dollars now used for the purchase of such goods as motor car chassis and capital equipment to finance the purchase of petrol. No member of this House and no reasonable person in the community would suggest that the Government should take either of those courses. If we repudiated the agreement with the United Kingdom, that country's already bad position would become so much the worse. By diverting our dollar expenditure from the purchase of goods that help to maintain the employment of a great many Australians at tbe present time to the purchase of more petrol, so that non-essential users should have all the petrol that they wish to have, we should harm our economy.

He merely rises in his place and says, "" I move that the amendment that has been circulated in my name be agreed to "" . If that is not an example of riding rough-shod over the rights and p r i v i leges of honourable members, I should like to know ' what is. I say to the Minister that even if he proposes to hold the Opposition and the forms of this Parliament in such contemptuous disregard, he should at least, in justice to the people of Australia, who are suffering the disabilities caused by lack of petrol, show the general public some consideration. It appears to me that he has no consideration for the people, because if I had not risen in my place to find out what these amendments are about, the people of Australia would have been held in as much contemptuous disregard as that in which the Minister holds both the Opposition and the privi leges of the members of this Parliament.

By this amendment it is proposed to ex1 tend the power to make regulations so as to cover matters necessary or convenient for carrying out or giving effect to the bill. The clause already covers matters incidental to the rationing of liquid fuel, but it does not cover specifically matters necessary or convenient in connection with other provisions of the bill, such as those in clause 11 which empower the court to issue injunctions. -The clause reads(1.) The Governor General may make regulations, not inconsistent with this act, with respect to(c) matters incidental to the matters specified in this sub-section, or incidental to the exercise of the power to make such regulations, inciudin the prevention of unjust advantage to individuals by the hoarding of stocks of liquid fuel (whether occurring before or after the commencement of this Act). The Minister proposes to amend subclause (1.) by adding the following word and paragraph:; and (d) matters necessary or convenient to be prescribed for carrying out or giving effect to this Act. It seems to me that this amendment is entirely unnecessary, in view of the fact that this Government can procure all the petrol it requires for the servicing of essential industries and the needs of the people. As we shall prove conclusively at a later stage, this is all so much beating of the air. It is useless for the Minister, at this late stage, to introduce amendments of this character in order to tighten up weaknesses that have been discovered in the original legislation.

This amendment is closely connected with the amendment that was agreed to a few moments ago which deals w it h appeals to Supreme Courts against the suspension or amendment dealt with these appeals in and Western Australia to which rationing w ill extend under the Commonwealth act. In the remaining States of Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania, petrol rationing, although conducted Commonwealth depend on State law.

It also empowers the New South Wales, Queensland Minister to revoke such a suspension. The effect of the amendment w ill be that these powers w ill not be exercised except after consultation between the Prime Minister and the Premier of the State under concerned. It is expected that at least administration, w i ll one of the three States to which the act applies w ill pass legislation to ensure the validity of the Commonwealth regulations in that State. It is considered reasonable, however, that the power to have recourse to the support of the State law should be exercised only after consultation with the State government, and that the power to return to reliance on the Commonwealth law when the legal position has been clarified should also be exercised only after consultation. the Amendment agreed to.

186,Mr Dedman (Corio,"Minister forDefence and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [4.23] I move That, in sub-clause (3.), paragraph (6), after the word "" notice "", the following words we have provided that the act shall not be added:"" (including its operation in respect of any period prior to the date specified in the declaration) "". This amendment is intended to clarify a legal point which may arise in the event of an attack on the validity of the Commonwealth act. It is expected that in one State at least a State law will be enacted to back up the Commonwealth law in the event of such an attack. A State law dealing with the distribution of liquid fuel cannot validly operate while a Commonwealth law dealing fully with the same subject is in operation in the State. This clause enables the operation of the Commonwealth act in a State to be suspended, and thereupon a State law can validly operate. However, it is not entirely clear from the clause as drafted that such a State law could then validly operate from a date before the suspension of the Commonwealth act so as to enable the State law to back up the past operation of the Commonwealth law.

The Government has discouraged the attempts by this all-Australian company to relieve the petrol shortage. Ampol has sent telegrams to the big combines in which it has asked them to take their quota of French petrol, and to reply to the offer this evening. The option which Ampol has on French petrol will expire to-night in Paris. How does the Government view that offer? How has it assisted that small Australian company? In view of the offer of French petrol, the introduction of rationing is unnecessary. Sir EAEI.E PAGE -And this bill is unnecessary. every honourable member can support with confidence the amendment that has been submitted by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) on behalf of the Opposition parties.

But I have an interest in "" Australia Unlimited "". This so-called Labour Government, which pretends to mistrust combines and monopolies, has encouraged American and English trusts and has attempted to discourage a small all-Australian company from importing petrol. I invite the Government to accept my challenge, and denounce Ampol for having done what the Commonwealth has neglected to do, which is to look all round the world for non-dollar petrol. Ampol has found petrol and it has a contract, and has offered part of the consignment to other oil companies in Australia. I understand that this afternoon the Minister for Defence referred to me as having violated The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order!

Had the Government been as vigilant and enterprising as this Australian company, it would have found petrol, as the company has found it, and there would be no need to introduce a system of rationing to terminate on the 31st August next. Consequently, I support the amendment. We will find the petrol that Australia must have. An Australian company found petrol, but it has been discouraged by the Government.

The honourable member for Wentworth advanced two reasons for his amendment, and they were antagonistic to each other. He said that since I had painted such a black picture of the prospects of getting petrol, the Government could not possibly foresee how rationing could be abolished by the end of August next year. Then he switched from that argument to a totally different one, and maintained that rationing should be abolished in January next. That shows how confused the honourable member is. Then the honourable member threw out some kind of a challenge, although I do not know just what it was about. He knows that the Government cannot itself import petrol. It is true that the Commonwealth could bring the tankers along-side the wharfs, -but it has no storage facilities. The storage tanks belong to private enterprise.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The right honourable gentleman must withdraw the statement unconditionally. Australian Country party seems to think that the Government should do something about the offer of Ampol to share with other companies the petrol that it proposes to import from France. What could the Government do about it? As I have said, the Commonwealth has no storage tanks. Of course, there is a reason why Ampol has made this offer to the other oil companies, and to the Government which, unfortunately, cannot take it up. The reason is that the petrol will cost Ampol 2d. a gallon more to import than the price for which it will be able to sell the petrol. That price, by the way, has been fixed not by the Commonwealth, but by the State governHARRISON'S ments acting in concert. right again. The amount is 3d., not 2d. I do not think that the company is very generous in offering to share this quantity of 18,500,000 gallons. nothing to do with the people! The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN This is not a "" free for all"". The Chair will take immediate action if there is further interruption. made the offer because it is faced with a loss, and it wants the other big companics to share the loss. The Leader of the Australian Country party said that the importation of 18,500,000 gallons of petrol would make petrol rationing unnecessary in Australia. That is not true. It would be necessary to import an additional 90,000,000 or 100,000,000 gallons to make petrol rationing unnecessary. The right honourable gentleman suggested that the Government had not encouraged those who sought to import petrol from non-dollar areas. The Government has given every encouragement to them, subject always to the condition that the petrol will not cost dollars. It is only because the petrol that Ampol proposes to import from France will probably cost dollars, that the Government is a bit indifferent to the transaction. If it is found that no dollars are involved, the Government will give the company every encouragement. The amendment of the honourable member for Wentworth is childish. What government would bring in legislation to operate for a period of two months only ? If petrol rationing is necessary, it will certainly be necessary for more than two months. The date at which the legislation will cease to operate has been fixed as the 31st August of next year because it is based upon complementary State legislation that also expires on that date.

225,Mr Dedman (Corio,"Minister forOne of the provisions of the hill is that from the 1st January, 1950, the National Security (Prices) Regulations shall be discontinued. One effect of this action will be that persons formerly employed by the Prices Branch, all of whom made a declaration of secrecy under the National Security (Prices) Regulations may be free after that date to disclose information obtained in the course of their duties. When prices control was taken over by the States the secrecy provisions of the National Security (Prices) Regulations were amended to give to the State prices control authorities access to files in the eustody of the Commonwealth. This was necessary to prevent duplication and to permit of an easy transition. The State officers who examine such files are sworn to secrecy in the same way as were Commonwealth officers under Commonwealth prices control. There is no guarantee, however, that existing State legislation will be continued indefinitely, hence the need for a standing Commonwealth provision to guarantee that secrecy will be observed by officers who have had access to confidential documents held by the Commonwealth Prices Branch or loaned to State prices organizations. The provisions embodied in the amendment have been designed to cover persons, including new employees, who have or have had, or who will have, access to the records in question, and at the same time be sufficiently wide in scope to embrace the Commonwealth archival authorities who, it is anticipated, may become custodians of a selected portion of the records.

There are only two sections that really matter in the ? rincipal act-sectio n 6 and section 22. f these two sections were removed there would be little left of the principal act. This bill will completely alter the framework of the national health service scheme, and therefore it is pertinent that I ' should address myself to the motives that have actuated the Government to introduce this measure. This bill deals wholly with the question of how medical practice is to be carried out and the manner in which prescriptions are to be checked and the payments to be made to doctors. It is interesting to note, therefore, that the Minister for Health said at the conference to which I have referred I think for checking purposes it would be necessary that the practitioners keep clinical records of their patients. This is the general practice now and may be a principle. These clinical Tecords would be produced for adjudication in case of dispute. For the purpose of checking accounts from time to time these clinical records would be subject to checking by medical officers of the department and not by laymen. tioners, not by officers.

244,"Bowden, G. J. Mr Harrison","I have said that Ithe prelude to the establishment of a completely nationalized health service. Tho TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable member may not pursue that line of argument. The clause before the committee relates to the payment of fees to doctors for medical services rendered by them. read the whole of clause 3 because it is a lengthy one. Briefly proposed new section 6 provides that the regulations may make provision for the establishment, maintenance, conduct and operation of a scheme for the provision of sickness benefits or medical services by way of payments by the Commonwealth in respect of professional services rendered by medical practitioners. It provides that a scheme established under the section may define the circumstances in which people shall, or shall not, be entitled to benefits or services under the scheme, and may provide for participation in the scheme by medical practitioners in respect of particular classes of the services. It also provides that the maximum fees to be charged by medical practitioners who participate in the scheme shall be fixed by, or assessed under, the regulations. Proposed new sub-section (3.) deals with the reduction of a maximum fee fixed by the regulations. Proposed new sub-section (4.) deals with arrangements between medical practitioners and societies or persons and provides that the Minister may make arrangements for the provision by the Commonwealth of sickness benefits or medical services in lieu of the benefits or sion. Services provided for under those arrangerefund to patients 50 per cent, of those ments. The provisions of proposed new sub-sections (5.) and (6.) widen the scope of the legislation still further. Surely the wording of the clause gives me sufficient scope to deal with the matters which I have endeavoured to bring before the committee. This amending legislation contains nothing which alters the objectionable features of the principal act. Indeed, the clause which the committee is now discussing highlights the very features of the principal act to which we so strenuously objected and, in particular, it provides that medical services all be provided by way of regulation. The principle of government by regulation, which is the principle that is adopted in this bill, is a dangerous one, because it enables regulations to be made without recourse to or discussion by the Parliament. Honourable members have only to examine the bill quickly to see the extraordinarily extensive regulationmaking powers that are proposed to be conferred under the measure. The regulations that will be made under this measure may revolutionize our medical services in such a way as to prevent the Australian people from securing the medical benefits for which they are paying by means their social services contributions. The Government should ensure that the medical services that are available to the Australian people are the best possible, but I do not consider that the regulations that will be made under this measure will achieve that objective. It is indicative of the Government's desire to use this bill as election propaganda that it has been brought down in the dying hours of the Parliament, with polling day approximately only six weeks away. It would appear that the Government intends to rush the bill through the Parliament and immediately to gazette regulations'so that it will be able to say to the people, on the election eve, "" This is part of the record on which we stand "". The regulations that will be made under the bill to fix the fees that shall be charged by medical practitioners for their professional services will strike at the very heart of the medical profesThe Government proposes to fees, but it also proposes to determine what fees shall be charged. Is it the intention of the Government that the fee that a newly-qualified doctor is allowed to charge for his services shall be the same as the fee that a surgeon of many years' experience is to be allowed to charge? Is it the intention of the Government to provide by regulations that the fee of a specialist shall be the same as the fee of a lad who has just left a medical school? If that is so, what incentive will there be for doctors to specialize in certain branches of surgery or medicine or to do post-graduate research ? The whole thing is ridiculous.",59,Deputy Speaker Mr J J I3 Evidence That There Is Still Disagreement
245,Mr Harrison,"I do not want toThe Government's proposal to establish a nationalized medical service of this kind will do more to undermine the skill and proficiency of medical practitioners than any of its other actions. The proposal is wrong in principle, and I do not believe that the people will accept it . Despite the "" blah "" in which the Government will indulge during the election campaign, this scheme will be received with the same coldness as the "" free bottle of medicine"" scheme was received. This clause will confer upon the Government the power to make regulations. It provides for the repeal of section 6 of the principal act, which is the operative provision of that measure, and for the insertion, in its stead, of a new section. The new section will not remain in existence for very long. In February, when the Labour party is in Opposition with its tail between its legs, the whole scheme will be wiped out of existence. The proposed, new section is based upin a bad principle, to which objection was raised when the National Health Service Bill 1948 was being discussed. The view of almost every medical practitioner is that the matters which, under the proposed new section 6, will be dealt with by means of regulations, should be stated specifically in the legislation. When the Minister for Health (Senator McKenna) was speaking to the motion for the second reading of this bill in the Senate, he saidThe main purpose of the bill is to amend section (3 of the National Health Service Act 1948 . . . however, it has become apparent that with section 6 in its present form, payment for medical services would be rigidly and literally limited to those items that are expressly referred to in the schedules of the regulations. I assumed that many regulations had been made under that act, but I have discovered with pleasure that not one has been gazetted. Honourable gentlemen will recall that about a year ago the House sat for almost the whole of one night discussing that measure, which was said to be extremely urgent. The national health service scheme was to be administered by regulations, but as yet no regulations have been made, and I do not believe that any regulations will be made before the general election. That will mean that the new government will be able to start with a clean sheet and geton with the job. If the Government really desires that a national health service scheme shall operate in this country, sooner or later it must reach agreement with the medical profession. It is obvious that such a scheme can only be carried into effect by medical practitioners. The members of the medical profession have stated that the principle upon which they insist is that an essential ingredient of a national health service scheme is that it must be such that it cannot be altered at the whim of the Government of the day and that its principles must be set out in legislation so plainly that they cannot be misunderstood and cannot be changed except after an open discussion by the Parliament. We have not had too open a discussion to-day in relation to this matter. Honourable members are not permitted to discuss a matter in this chamber in the same way as honourable senators have been allowed to consider it. However, we shall have other opportunities. To-day, the Government has dealt two severe blows to its prospects of being returned to the treasury bench at the forthcoming general election. Its first mistake was to prevent me from submitting a motion in which I recommended that a gift of food be made to the United Kingdom. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Lazzarini) -Order! The right honourable member is not in order in In framing the regulations, referring to that matter. clause under consideration. The doctors insist that they must abide by tha principle which I have mentioned, and their attitude is perfectly reasonable. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway), who is keenly interested in the conditions of waterside workers, will recall that the Stevedoring Industry Act provides specifically what shall be done in that industry. Those matters have been determined, not by regulation, but by the Parliament itself, in open debate. One Minister did not vote in a division on the bill, because he did not agree with the principle that was embodied in it.",60,Deputy Speaker Mr J J I3 Evidence That There Is Still Disagreement

The doctors realize that they are not the favorites of the Government, but they consider that they should receive the same measure of justice as has been granted to the waterside workers. I have porary Chairman, that the provisions of certain legislation should be determined by the Parliament, and should not be fixed by regulation.

He has always advocated that various matters should be dealt with not by regulation but by legislation. I regret that the honourable gentleman is retiring, and I wish him a long life and happiness. If you, Mr Temporary Chairman, were retiring, I should express the same sentiments about you as the result of our long association. The doctors will not be parties to a matter two hoots if a regulation is scheme that is controlled by regulation. challenged before the High Court of AusThe schemes in operation in the United tralia. The High Court bases its judgKingdom and New Zealand are controlled ment on the wording of the act and not by acts of Parliament, and not by Minison a promise that a Minister has made ters of Health, under their regulationto the Parliament. The doctors object making powers. A regulation to which to the Government's proposal to operate medical practitioners might object, might the national health service by regulation. remain in force for many months before the Parliament met and honourable members had an opportunity to submit a motion for its disallowance. The Government's plans for the national health service should be set out specifically in this bill. If the doctors refuse to co-operate, the system cannot function and so the matter of payments will not arise. I come now to the second principle upon which the medical practitioners insist. They contend that the relation -between doctor and patient is personal, intimate and confidential, and they refuse to submit their clinical records to other persons for scrutiny. Is that request unreasonable? Doctors and patients are in favour of it. Patients tell their doctors in confidence intimate details that they would not dream of mentioning even to their closest friends, and that mitted to paper. The doctors have Throughout his long already submitted proposals for a scheme that will operate satisfactorily without the supervision and "" snooping"" that is proposed by the Government. I recall that on the 1st July, 1943, the Social Security Committee presented to the Parliament a report which embodied the submissions that the British Medical Association had tendered in evidence on the 12th September, 1941, and again on the 6th March, 1943. The medical profession is prepared to work under that scheme immediately if the Government will adopt it. The Government should .*ay to the doctors, ""We realize that the relation between doctor and patient is inviolate and sacred. We recognize that for many years, the doctors have borne the responsibility of treating the poorer sections of the community without charge. We agree to incorporate in the act the scale of payments that may be made "". The Government's proposals in that respect are unsatisfactory.

250,Sir Earle Page,"I may not havuThe relation between doctor and patients must be maintained if the best traditions of the medical profession are to be preserved and if the best treatment is to be ensured ,for patients. After all, that should be the principal objective of a national health service, but the Government advocates a system under which people will queue up for treatment and be served with nostrums free of charge. One of the objectives of a national medibe independent of parties. In my dealcal service should be to improve the health of the people. I am gratified that the Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Barnard) is at present in the chamber because he was the chairman of the Social Security Committee which presented to the Parliament the report to which I have referred. The honourable gentleman will admit that the British Medical Association assisted that committee in every possible way. He nods his head in assent. The British Medical Association has been accused of having adopted an unco-operative attitude, but that kind of allegation is comvery close to making a second-reading pletely false, and wicked. The people themselves do not believe it, and that is the reason for the apathy of the public to doctors under the Government's scheme the Government's proposed national health service. I assume that the regulations that will govern the operation of the scheme have not yet been drafted, and I beg the Government, even now, to heed the representations that I have made cn behalf of the medical profession. It has taken the Government seven years to hammer out the present scheme, and during that period, it has received a number of setbacks. At one period, the Government went beyond the limits of its constitutional power, and the High Court declared invalid the vital sections of the National Health Service Act. On another occasion, the Government did too little, and the scheme was unacceptable. I urge the Government to turn for advice to the medical practitioners who have at heart the improvement of the health of the people of Australia. The British Medical Association insists upon maintaining the highest ethical standard of conduct, and opportunities are given to doctors to qualify for high medical and surgical degrees so that they will have the latest knowledge of methods of treatment. The general standard of the medical profession in Australia is as high as is that of any other country. World WarI . provided a real test . of the proficiency of Australian doctors. At three casualty clearing stations, three doctors who had practised in country districts were selected to perform the most difficult surgical operations. That appointment recognized their outstanding ability. National health should ings with State departments of health I have been struck by the fact that they have been able to establish a valuable tradition in their dealings with the medical profession. When an all-party parliamentary committee brought in its recommendations on the repatriation scheme, an opportunity presented itself to lay the foundations of a national medical health scheme. The Government, however, wants its own scheme, and it is beginning at the wrong end. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. The right honourable gentleman is getting speech. must hear a proper relation to the duties they are called upon to perform. For instance, the payment that is proper for a. general practitioner would not be the same as the payment that is proper for a specialist. In any case, before deciding upon payments, we should be sure that we are able to get properly trained men. Under the present system, it has been possible to attract to the medical profession some of the finest brains in the world. There is a freemasonry amongst medical practitioners that operates in every country, and is not affected by race or language. It would not be possible to establish the same tradition amongst medical officers who worked only their eight hours a day. The first consideration is the health of the people. A doctor cannot leave a very sick person, or a woman in labour, simply because the clock strikes four. The important question is whether payment should be in the form of a salary or a fee for service. I feel strongly that if the best results are to be achieved there should be something in the nature of incentive payments to doctors, nurse9 and all those associated",62,Deputy Speaker Mr J J I3 Evidence That There Is Still Disagreement

You yourself, Mr Temporary Chairman, as' a senior member of this House, will acknowledge that an important scheme of this kind should not be inaugurated by regulation, but that the Government should bring down legislation dealing specifically with the scheme. Conditions are constantly changing, and only the other day the British House of Commons passed legislation which altered the method of paying chemists for their services under the national health scheme. health service bill, not a pharmaceutical benefits bill. seems to think that matters pertaining to national health can be put into separate compartments. In fact, they are all part of the same purpose, which is the preservation of the health of the people. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The right honourable member's time has expired. The clause which the committee is now considering is the vital clause of the bill in that it provides for the repeal of section 6 of the principal act, and the substitution there for of provisions which, in effect, amount to an entirely new piece of legislation. I am sorry that the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page), who is a former Prime Minister as well as a distinguished surgeon, has not had a better opportunity to expound his views on this matter. Now, in the dying hours of the session, we are asked to approve of a new piece of legislation which touches upon the institution of a national health service. Of course, the Government has the numbers, and the bill will be passed. The first bill, which has since become the principal act, was introduced in the small hours of the morning during an all-night sitting, and was whisked through in a most unorthodox manner. It is strange that the Minister for Health (Senator McKenna) should have sought so little expert advice on so important a measure as this is. The bill provides that the Minisbill does not still impose civil conscription ter for Health, or his deputy, the Directoron doctors? One should read the last General of Health, may make regulations affecting the lives of all Australian citizens. The British Medical Association, which is an honourable body, commented in a recently published booklet on the Government's proposals as follows:The Government has questioned the good faith of the medical profession, rejected its advice, and broken off negotiations for the provision of a national health service acceptable to all parties. Accordingly, this booklet is published to set forth the health policy for the nation being advocated by doctors and to illustrate how far the present Government's scheme falls short of requirements. There is a foreword to the publication by a very distinguished surgeon, of whom Australia may be proud. I refer to Mr Victor Hurley, formerly Air ViceMarshal Hurley. He points out that the British Medical Association is a non-political organization concerned only with the welfare and good health of the people. We know that the Minister for Health has conferred only twice with the British Medical Association over the Government's national health service proposals. The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Holloway), who is now at the table, is always at the beck and call of the trade unions, but there have been only two brief conferences between the Minister for Health and the British Medical Association. At one of those conferences, the Minister was indiscreet enough to say that the aim of the Government was to eliminate private medical practice. Sub-section 6 of the proposed new section 6 states that nothing in the section authorizes any form of civil conscription. Was there ever greater humbug and hypocrisy put into a bill than that? The British Medical Association recently contested the validity of the principal act and the High Court ruled that it imposed civil conscription on doctors. So with a great deal of its common cunning the Government put into the legislation the short provisionNothing in this section authorizes any form of civil conscription.

(Balaclava) [5.51],"manual A National Health Service, issued by tbe British Medical Association, and written by that fine surgeon Victor Hurley, which statesThe doctors arc willing and ready to cooperate with the Government in a national health service, and they believe that such a service can be given to the people on a democratic basis, without forcing doctors to be subject to control and direction of their professional work by government officials. They object to being coerced into a regimented service and demand the right to practise their profession as free individuals. Yet the Government, in the dying hours of the Parliament, brings down a bill which is merely propaganda. We well know how the Minister for Information ( Mr Calwell) will use it. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Lazzarini) -Order! imagination. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN . -On e may not do so in this connection. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN . -The honourable member will deal with the clause or sit down. Section six of the Principal Act is repealed and the following section inserted in its stead:""6 (1.) The regulations may make provision(a) for or in relation to the establishment, maintenance, conduct and operation of a scheme for the provision of sickness benefits or medito continue, by simply inserting a few cal services by way of payments by the Commonwealth in respect of professional services rendered by medical practitioners; Section6 is the main part of the principal act. The Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) accepted an amendment to the bill relating to the social services referendum that was submitted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies). It provided that there should be no civil conscription. Even so, the Government is still trying to conscript the doctors. The Government has tried to bring the doctors together like ""vets"" to treat men, women and children as members of a herd. The Minister for,Health (Senator McKenna) thinks that the people may have only official diseases and that they may be treated only with official medicines. Proposed new sub-section 6 (2.) (a) is also objectionable. It readsWithout prejudice to the generality of the last preceding sub-section, a scheme established under this .section may The w o r d "" scheme "" is a p p r o p r i a t e (a) define the circumstances in which persons shall, or shall not, be entitled to benefits or services under the scheme; (6) provide for participation in the scheme by medical practitioners in respect of particular classes of professional services; and (c) provide that the maximum fees to be charged or received by medical practitioners participating in the scheme in respect of professional services to which the scheme applies shall be the fees fixed by, or assessed under, the regulations as in force from time to time. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. [Quorum formed.'\ of the sitting I had pointed out that this clause contains a substitution for section 6 of the principal act, which includes full power to make regulations. I had pointed out that sub-section (6.) of the proposed new section 6 statesNothing in this section authorizes any form of civil conscription. I emphasize that the Government lost its case before the High Court on this very issue of civil conscription, yet it intends lines in the act, to carry out a form of civil conscription. A doctor can still be fined £50 if he transgresses against the provisions of the act. The Government hopes that it will get away with this measure because it has brought it down in the last hours of the Parliament. This bill, however, is just a part of the socialist plan. The white-haired boy of the socialists in the Senate is the Minister for Health, who sponsored this measure. It was he who endeavoured to explain away the socialist policy of the "" socialization of the means of production, distribution and exchange"" by saying that the Government would only nationalize those services which were socially undesirable and which were being used to exploit the people.",64,Deputy Speaker Mr J J I3 Evidence That There Is Still Disagreement

Chifley) often says that any one who wants to know anything about coal should go to the coal-miner to find out what he wants to know. On the same reasoning any one who wants to understand anything about medicine and. surgery should go to the medical profession to find out what he wants to know. The Government should not t r y to conscript and regiment doctors into a government pattern. I also direct attention to the fact that sub-section (2.) (c) of the proposed new section w ill provide that maximum fees to be charged or received by medical practitioners participating in the scheme in respect of professional services to which the scheme applies shall be the fees fixedby, or assessed under, the regulations as in force from time to time. So the Government intends to establish prices control of surgical operations and of medicine. I am not a constitutional lawyer but I consider that it has not the constitutional power to do so. This is, perhaps, another of those legal blunders put forward by the Attorney-General (Dr. Evatt) that have cost the country hundreds of thousands of pounds in court appeals. referendum on prices control and yet in this bill it intends to lay down the maximum price that a doctor may charge for an operation. Sick men or women desire to choose a doctor for themselves and they w ill not be satisfied with anybody the Government sends along. W ill not the maximum fee become the minimum?

265,Sir Earle Page,"That was what Ihonorable gentleman had read the bill as carefully as I have done he would not have been asked to resume his seat. I do not intend to wander away from the bill as he did in his speech this afternoon. The objection of the right honourable member is to the regulation providing for fees. Sw Earle Page interjecting, The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN Order! The right honourable member for Cowper has made his speech, but he is keeping up a running fire of interjections. He must cease doing so. of the proposed new section 6 readsWithout prejudice to the generality of the last preceding sub-section a scheme established under this section may(«.) define the circumstances in which persons shall, or shall not, he entitled to benefits or services under acting on the advice of a panel the scheme; (6) provide for participation in the scheme by medical practitioners in respect of particular classes of proof fees applicable to those doctors who fessional services; and (c) provide that the maximum fees to be charged or received by medical practitioners participating in the scheme in respect of professional services to which the scheme applies shall 'be tbe fees fixed by, or assessed under, the regulations as in force from time to time. Proposed new sub-section (4.) provides that when an arrangement has been made between a medical practitioner and a society, body or person under which professional services are rendered by that medical practitioner, the Minister may make arrangements for the provision by the Commonwealth of sickness benefits or medical services in lieu of the benefits or services to be provided under such arrangement. exerted on a medical practitioner to enter the scheme. If , however, a medical practitioner does come into the scheme his fees must be in accordance with the prescribed schedule of fees. The right honourable member for Cowper has said by interjection that in New South Wales a schedule of fees has been drawn up by the friendly societies covering medical attention of various kinds. Apparently, he does not object to that. How, then, can he object to the proposal that the Minister or the Government, acting on the recomthe right mendations of an advisory committee or body, should prescribe by regulation a schedule of charges to apply in respect of services rendered under the scheme? To say the least, the right honourable gentleman is strangely inconsistent. A medical practitioner who enters into an agreement with a friendly society to charge fees in accordance w i th a schedule drawn up by the society is in the same position as a medical practitioner who decides to come under this scheme. Honourable members opposite are merely continuing the same line of argument which they advanced in relation to the legislation that dealt with pharmaceutical benefits. The right honourable member for Cowper agrees that it is desirable that the Government should institute a national health scheme, but he is not prepared to agree that the Minister, of medical practitioners, should have the right to prescribe by regulation a schedule come under the scheme. No difficulty would arise in connection with this matter if the British Medical Association would play ball with the Government and nominate representatives to an advisor-""panel to make recommendations to the Minister in relation to the schedule of fees to be charged. When the principal act was before the Parliament we were informed that the British Medical Association had been requested to nominate members for appointment to such an advisory body. It failed to do so. I know a specialist in South Australia who specialized in the treatment of diseases of the ear, nose, eyes and throat, who was prepared to make such an agreement with friendly societies for the treatment of their memNo compulsion w ill be bers who suffered from those diseases. He compiled a schedule of charges for surgical operations of various kinds. How can the right honourable member for Cowper contend that the fixation of a schedule of fees in respect of the doctors who elect to come under this scheme w ill destroy the medical profession in this country? The right honourable gentleman has assumed that in compiling such a schedule the Minister would not have regard to the comparative skill of different specialists. Medical men who specialize in the treatment of diseases of",66,Deputy Speaker Mr J J I3 Evidence That There Is Still Disagreement

267,Mr Thompson,"Sub-sectio n (2.)all kinds have their consulting rooms in North-terrace, Adelaide, Collins-street, Melbourne, and Macquarie-street, Sydney. Many of them are highly skilled men. I can understand that some of them would not desire to be tied down to a medium fee, particularly in relation to the treatment of a wealthv patient who could afford to pay the highest fee. All of these difficulties could, however, be ironed out if the members of the medical profession were prepared to co-operate with the Government. Honourable members opposite who claim to represent the middle classes of this community are doing their supporters a grave disservice by opposing this scheme. Most .people in the poorer sections of the community are members of friendly societies. If they have to undergo a surgical operation they are entitled to obtain treatment in a public hospital. Most middle class people are not members of friendly societies and are not entitled to obtain treatment in public hospitals. They have to pay the highest fees that are charged by members of the medical profession. I have met many men occupying good positions who have put by most of their savings in order to enable them to enjoy the leisure of advancing years, but who, as the result of sickness or accident, have had their life savings eaten up in high charges for medical treatment and surgical operations. No new principles are involved in this bill. Its purpose is solely to make it possible for those doctors who are prepared to co-operate with the Government to implement the health scheme. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) has referred to proposed new sub-section (6.) which provides that nothing in this section shall authorize any form of civil conscription. honourable member indulged in rather caustic criticism of that provision. It will be recalled that when the Commonwealth sought power by way of referendum to institute a national health service it agreed to an amendment that was proposed by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) to insert in the legislation a provision which specifically excluded any form of civil conscription. Mr Thompson. Proposed new sub-section (6.) is in conformity with that principle. The insertion of that provision in this bill makes it clear to the people that no compulsion is to be exercised on any medical practitioner. The sole purpose of this bill is to amend the principal act in such a way as will make it possible to institute a health scheme under which one-half of the medical fees incurred by patients treated by doctors who come under the scheme will be paid by the Government. Honourable members opposite are opposing the bill merely for opposition's sake. I am glad that the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Thompson) has made it clear to the committee that this is a price-fixing measure. The honourable gentleman has said that, because the Government will pay 50 per cent, of the cost of medical treatment, it must have power to determine the maximum fees that are to be charged by physicians and surgeons for their professional services. Patients can consult general practitioners of great experience, who are, in the main, the backbone of the medical profession, or they can seek the advice of young medical men who have just obtained their medical degrees; but, under ' the Government's proposals, the maximum fee that can be charged by both types of practitioner will be the same. I visualize the time when the schedule of prices will provide the charge for the removal of a tonsil at £1 10s., for an appendix at £5 and for a kidney at £10. One only needs to use one's imagination to see the utter absurdity of these proposals. When a patient is being operated upon it is sometimes discovered that the condition from which he is suffering is much more serious than was expected. In those circumstances, is a surgeon immediately The to consult his price-list to find out what he may charge for the more serious operation? We begin to see what will happen under the regime of a socialist government. Bottles of coloured water will be supplied free of charge. There will be a price-list providing that the charge for the removal of a tonsil shall be £1 10s.; for an adenoid operation, £ 1 ; for the removal of an appendix, £5; and for the removal of a kidney, £10. Prices",67,Deputy Speaker Mr J J I3 Evidence That There Is Still Disagreement
268,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [8.20].,"will rise or fall, according to the treatment that is required. I have no doubt that eventually, the Government, if it has its way, will provide that the forceps and other instruments that are used in operations must be stamped with the socialist brand. Indeed, if this Government remains in power, the socialist brand will eventually be put upon every person in this country. Let us consider the case of an ordinary physician. He will be allowed to charge 5s. for applying a mustard plaster. It might be worth 17s. 6d. to him if he treats a case of migraine. Influenza takes various forms. Is the physician's charge for the treatment of influenza to increase as the temperature of the patient rises? If the Government would establish a real national health scheme under which more beds will be provided in hospitals, greater consideration will be shown to medical men and nurses, and tuberculosis will be stamped out within the next decade, it will have done something worthwhile, but it is useless to dabble with a scheme that will put a premium on inefficiency by making it not worthwhile for medical practitioners to specialize in various branches of medicine and surgery. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The honourable gentleman must confine his remarks to the clause. are to be fixed for various forms of treatment, medical practitioners will not be encouraged to do the post-graduate work that a specialist must do. I leave it at that. The Government will not be able to induce self-respecting medical men who have the interests of their patients at heart to participate voluntarily in this scheme. Doctors will not willingly allow themselves to be made fools of by socialistic red tape. Minister for Labour and National Service) [8.25] -The right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) and the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) have not dealt with the clause that the committee is now considering. Indeed, they have no desire to do so. They have taken advantage of this opportunity to attack the national health service lock, stock and barrel. However, it is here to stay. It is well known that honourable gentlemen opposite are opposed to a national health service. It is also well known that the majority of the members of the British Medical Association are also opposed to it, but there are some medical practitioners who are ready to participate voluntarily in this scheme which envisages that 50 per cent, of the fee charged by a medical practitioner for his professional services shall be paid by the Government in order that patients may be relieved of at least half the cost of medical treatment. That is the basis of this measure. The .proposed new section 6 will not alter materially the principles that have already been agreed to. One reason for its introduction is that it will widen the scope of' the existing section in such a way as will give the Minister for Health and the officials of the Department of Health greater opportunities to consult with members of the medical profession and with organizations such as friendly societies. Anotherreason is that fear has been expressed that when the medical profession and Commonwealth departmental officers have reached agreement regarding the fees that may be charged for certain kinds of medical treatment, the scale of fees might be changed by the Commonwealth without notice having been given to the medical profession of the change. The new section is designed to ensure that the agreed scale of fees shall not be altered without three months' notice of alteration being given. The clause has no other purposes. It does not alter the existing system other than to make the original provision more flexible. Authority is given to the department to conduct consultations with friendly societies and other organizations with a view to bringing them into the scheme if they so desire by agreement. The department is also given power to have consultations with medical practitioners, and provision is made for three months' notice to be given if any suggestion is made for altering the fees. The right honourable member for Cowper has been most unfair. He made a charge against the Minister for Health (Senator McKenna), who cannot defend himself in this chamber.

295,The Committee W I L L Therefore Mr Barnard (Bass,"Minister f o rhonorable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) referred to the Social Security Committee, of which I was chairman for a number of years. That committee made certain important recommendations to the Government. The right honourable member said that the proposals submitted by the British Medical Association would be satisfactory if incorporated in a national health scheme. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr The Minister said there was some doubt Harrison) made all sorts of absurd statements about the payment of doctors under a national health scheme. He knows very well that, for many years past, a medical scheme has been operated for the benefit of ex-seTvicemen under a satisfactory arrangement with members of the medical profession. The purpose of the honourable member was obviously to ridicule the Government's proposals, which have been designed for the benefit of the public. The honourable member for Hindmarsh and according to the Government's ( Mr Thompson) mentioned the cirformulary. cumstances of people in the middle income group, who suffer so severely when there is serious illness in Order!

That statement is well some results. This Government scheme substantiated by an examination of the will get no result at the present time present measure. In the original act, simply by reason of the fact that the there is a section which provides that people themselves know instinctively that regulations may be made for any purpose it will cause a deterioration of medical that is expedient or incidental to the treatment and of health and will destroy carrying out of a national health service, the relationship between doctor and but not one regulation under that section has been so far gazetted, although the act came into force more than a year ago. Now, the present bill has been introduced on the ground that some tinpot regulations have become necessary. I throw that idea out with scorn. We should examine this bill to see whether something is not being sneaked in as was the ease with the Pharmaceutical Benefits Bill. about my veracity, but I challenge him to point out one remark that I have made in this Parliament or anywhere else that was not 100 per cent, correct. The Minister has said that I do not tell the whole truth, but, from its dark beginnings about two a.m. one day, this measure has been one of deceit.

298,Sir Earle Page,"It is a pity wepatient which, means so much. A f t e r all, it is the patient's confidence in the doctor, more than any other thing, that helps a treatment along. If people are not to have a regular doctor, but to have some part-time doctor who rushes in to treat them, the medical service w ill become very poor indeed. I therefore urge the Government not to make any regulations under this bill when it becomes law. A fte r all, it has not made any regulations under the principal act, although that measure is a year old. I do not know, of course, whether the Government can carry the bill with the number of members that it has now available in the chamber member has kept the debate going long enough for us to obtain the necessary numbers. Sir EARLEPAGE educate the people of Australia. To-day I was stupidly prevented from making a second'-reading speech on this matter, and subsequently the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully) moved the closure and so stopped me from speaking. I ask the Government not to make regulations under this measure, but to let the people decide the matter on the 10th December next, at the general election. I am satisfied that when we return to this chamber in the next Parliament we shall have a majority and this measure will be repealed. No regulations associated with it w ill ever be made, because we shall bring into being a system that w ill not only improve the health of the people but w ill also use every voluntary agency, such as friendly societies anddoctors and nurses' organizations, and that w ill steadily improve public health and cause us to have a greater pride than ever in what has been achieved.

This bill provides for the approval of an agreement that w ill , in effect, mean an increase of the retail price of sugar throughout Australia from 4£d. to 5d. per lb. It is the result of an application submitted by the sugar organizations of Queensland and New South Wales through the Queensland Premier. Those applications arose from steadily increasing costs and steadily decreasing returns from raw sugar. The Government has agreed to the major portion of the industry's requests by introducing this measure. I propose to deal with this subject under various headings, such as the justification which exists for the increase of prices to be granted; the effect of that increase on the sugar industry itself and on the wholesalers and retailers of sugar, and also upon the consumer; the relationship of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited to the industry; the effect of the increase on that company; and, finally, the industry's request for a temporary suspension of the annual payment of'£216,000 to the F r u it Industry Sugar Concession Committee, which I think that it is known to honourable members generally that for many years",72,Deputy Speaker Mr J J I3 Evidence That There Is Still Disagreement

303,Mr Davidson (Capricornia) [9.5],"past the economy of the sugar industry has been based upon a series of agreements, each of five years' duration, formulated between the Australian Government and State governments, under which, first of all, an embargo was imposed on the importation of sugar grown by black labour. assured market to the industry. Secondly, the Queensland ment is required to make refined sugar available to the capital cities of Australia at a specified price. That is the basis of the industry's economy. In 1945, when the then expiring agreement and the provisions for the new agreement were being discussed the industry submitted an application to the Government for an increase of the price of sugar. It was pointed out that during the war years the industry had suffered from reduced production and increasing costs. A request was made, at that time, for an increase above 4d. per lb., which was then the retail price of sugar. The Government refused that request, but qualified its refusal with a statement to the effect that if costs continued to move against the industry the provisions of the agreement would be reviewed during its tenure. In 1947, as a result of the continual increase of costs, the industry again found it necessary to ask the Government for an increase of the price to 4Jd. per lb. By that time the factors in favour of the increase had become so strong that the Government granted the application. In speaking to the amending bill to give effect to the increase, I pointed out that it did not place the industry in a favoured position. The industry, in fact, was only being returned to the level that it had enjoyed at the onset of the depression, and could not in any way be considered to be receiving a very great advantage.' After dealing with deductions that had to be made from the increased price, as the result of increased costs of various kinds, I summarized the position by sayingThus, we have deductions amounting to ment and dismay when the 1948 crop was 30s. a ton, which will depress the amended being finalized that only £1 3s. a ton was price of raw sugar to £24 Cs. a ton, which is only Gs. a ton more than the price paid after left of the £3 16s. a ton increase that had the depression cut of 1933. Thus, while the been granted in 1947. It became obvious price for the consumer is raised to the pre-that something would have to be done if depression level, the return to the producerthe stability of the industry were to be will be practically equivalent to the return obtained in the worse years of the depression.preserved. After a careful check of rising ifr. Davidson. History has shown that my summary was correct. In the succeeding season, in 1947, the price obtained for raw sugar for home consumption amounted to only £24 a ton, or 6s. a ton less than I had forecast. I pointed out at that time that any further rises in costs would necessitate That embargo gives an the industry again asking for relief and for a further adjustment of the agreement. Govern-, It must be taken for granted that the Government's action in granting an increase in the price of sugar in 1947 indicated its desire to stabilize the industry. The present financial returns in the industry show very clearly that the Government's objective has not been achieved. That fact can best be expressed in terms of the raw sugar return to the industry during the last two years. Prom the 1947 increase, which was £4 13s. 4d. a ton on refined sugar sold retail, there must be deducted certain amounts to take care of increased margins to wholesalers and retailers and for conversion of 94 NT raw sugar to refined sugar. As the result of those factors the increase of £4 13s. 4d. a ton was reduced to approximately £3 16s. a ton of raw sugar. -During 1947 and 194S, costs continued to mount far beyond the level that had been anticipated by the industry and, I assume, by the Government. These increased costs were separate from the additional costs involved in the adoption of the 40-hour week. It will be recalled that the Prime Minister, in announcing the increase in 1947, stated that any further increase in costs due to the operation of the 40-hour week would not be accepted by the Government as a reason for granting a further advance in price. The increased costs to which I have referred are over and above those incurred as the result of the adoption of the 40hour week. They resulted from a steady increase in shipping freights and in certain refining charges, such as wages, bags, coal, &c. These items increased the cost by £2 13s. a ton. ""We found to our amazecosts the industry presented to the Government a claim for an increase to 5d. per lb. The check that was made indicated that Gosts had so risen since the 194S season that the margin of £1 3s. left to the industry out of the increase granted in 1947 would not only he completely absorbed but that an additional £1 a ton would be lost. in fact, the minimum amount which If no increase in price had been granted for the 1949 season the price received for my own experience, I know that the raw sugar would be not more than £21 a ton. It is a significant fact that that price would represent the lowest price received by the Australian industry for raw sugar since 1919. I invite honourable members to compare cost levels in 1919 with those that now prevail. They will realize that without these increases the price received by the industry would have been at the same level as that which applied in 1919. In such circumstances an impossible position would have arisen. The Government is to be commended for having realized the strength of the case that was submitted to it by the sugar industry, for having accepted as accurate the figures presented supporting that case, of the 1949 crop, would be at least as and for having granted an increase of -Jd. per lb. The figures submitted by the industry show the complete justification of its application for an increase in price sold on the old basis. In announcing to 5d. and also for the Government's action in granting the application. I pass to a consideration of the effect sugar industry realizes that, and prowhich this increase will have on the sugar industry. It is important that every one should realize that this increase proposal. It believes that continually is only a small one, and that it represents increasing costs will show that its claims the minimum which could be asked for by the industry. It is anticipated by the industry that the increase that is proposed costs continue to rise. in this bill will bring the price of raw sugar to approximately £24 a ton. In the submissions-which the industry made to the Government that figure was stated, but it was determined on the assumption that the increase of ^d. per lb. for refined sugar would operate from the 1st October. It is obvious that a percentage of this year's crop will be sold at the old rates, and that the net result will not be £24 a ton. From 1933 to 1938 the industry received £24 a ton for its sugar. I point out that the increase that is proposed in this bill will bring the return to the industry only up to the level which it received in predepression years. The return of £24 a ton is lower than the amount received by the industry from 1929 to 1932. At that time, the cost of refined sugar was 4^d. per lb. It will be obvious that this proposed increase will confer no great favour on the sugar industry. It is, could be granted to the industry. From industry, in presenting its case to the Government, deliberately kept its request to a minimum. The reason forthat was that it was felt that time was of the essence of the contract. An immediate increase was a matter of urgency. An application for an increase of Id. per lb., which, I think, would have been completely justified, would probably have caused the Government to decide that, before it could grant such an increase, it would have to conduct an inquiry into the industry. Such an inquiry would have taken a considerable time. The industry believed that an increase of -£d. per lb., which was made applicable to the major portion valuable to the industry as an increase of Id. per lb. which applied only to the 1950 crop, leaving the 1949 crop to be this increase, the Prime Minister has said that eventually an inquiry will have to be held into costs in the industry. The vided the investigation is thoroughly carried out, it is quite satisfied with that are completely justified and probably will justify a further increase of price if I turn now to the effect of this increase tipon wholesalers, retailers and consumers. It is sometimes said that when increases of prices are granted the interests or wholesalers, retailers and consumers are not properly safeguarded. As a result of this increase, the position of the wholesalers and retailers has improved. Before the 1947 increase, the retailers were operating on a margin of £4 2s. on a ton of refined sugar. After the 1947 increase, the margin was £4 13s. 4d. a ton. After this increase, it will be £5 4s. a ton. It will be seen, therefore, that the position of the retailers has improved to a greater degree than has the position of the sugar producers. As a result of this increase, the retailers' margin will be 26 per cent, greater than the 1946 margin, whereas the price that will be paid to the sugar producers now is only 10 per cent, greater than the 1946 price. The interests of the retailers have been properly safeguarded. Sugar wholesalers operate on a 2 per cent, discount. It is obvious, therefore, that if there is an increase of the price of sugar then the gross profits rise. Before sumers will each pay 5s. a year more for the 1947 increase, the wholesalers' margin on a ton of sugar was 13s. 3d., and after this increase, it will be 16s. 7d. the household consumption of sugar by The margin has increased by 3s. 4d. a ton, or by 25 per cent. The sugar producers have received a price increase of 10 per cent, during the same period. As a result of this increase the wholesalers and retailers are, relatively, in a better position than are the sugar producers. The effect of an increase of the price of sugar upon consumers is a very important consideration. When the proposal to increase the price of sugar to 4£d. per lb. was discussed in 1947, honourable members on both sides of the House were at pains to point out that Australian sugar consumers, in comparison with sugar consumers in other countries, were in a very favorable position. Tables were produced which showed that at that time the price of sugar in Australia was lower than the prices that obtained almost anywhere else in the world. That favorable position will be maintained very largely. The International Sugar Council publishes a year-book regularly. publication shows that in 1948 the only countries in which the price of sugar was lower than it was in Australia were Mexico, Denmark, Argentina and Peru. The figures given in that Year-Book are in terms of United States cents a kilogram. Australian sugar, at 5d. per lb., costs 14.8 undertaking, and from that time onwards cents a kilogram, but the price of sugar in New Zealand is 24.02 cents a kilogram. Cuba is the greatest sugar producing country in the world, but the Cuban people are paying 21.7 cents a kilogram for sugar. The price of sugar in the United States of America, Canada and the United Kingdom is 20.5, 19.7 and 18.5 Mr Davidson. cents a kilogram respectively. Those figures prove that, even when this increase is taken into account, the Australian sugar consumer, in comparison with the sugar consumers in other countries, is in a very favorable position. The per capita consumption of ,-iugar throughout Australia, taking into consideration the sugar that is used in manufacturing processes, is approximately 120 lb. a year. On that basis, the result of this increase of the price of sugar by i d . per lb. will be that Australian contheir sugar. If the sugar that is used in manufacturing processes is deducted, each person in Australia is 80 lb. a year. Therefore, so far as the household is concerned, the result of this increase will be that each person will pay an additional 3s. 4d. a year for sugar. That is equivalent to the price of, say, a half dozen beers a year. I submit that the value of the Australian sugar industry to the nation is more than th« price of a half-dozen beers a year per head. Australian sugar consumers have had the advantage of an assured supply of sugarat low prices for many years. In 1920 or thereabouts the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Haghes) introduced a measure which provided for an increase of the price of raw sugar to £30 6s. Sd. a ton. The right honourable gentleman had visited the north of Queensland and had realized its potentialities. He decided that for a period of five years the price of sugar should be fixed at a level that would ensure the development of the sugar industry in The most recent Queensland. A condition of the guarantee was that the industry should undertake to develop its productive capacity to such a degree that it could provide Australia for all time with the sugar that it required. It is interesting to note that by 1924 the industry had honoured its it has produced more sugar than Australia has required. From then until now Australian consumers have been assured of a supply of reasonably cheap sugar. The use of the word "" supply "" prompts me to make a brief reference to the shortages of sugar from which the southern States have suffered from time. to time. Those shortages have been due to factors that have been completely beyond the control of the raw sugar industry. Since 1924 there has not been a shortage of raw sugar in Australia. The supplies of raw sugar in this country have always been sufficient to satisfy the requirements of manufacturers and domestic consumers. The trouble has been caused from time to time by industrial disputes which have delayed shipments or have interfered with the refining of sugar. Shortages of refined sugar, therefore, are attributable to causes that are outside the control of the industry itself, and any blame for that position should be placed, not upon the sugar industry, but upon those to whom it rightly belongs. I now propose to deal with the relation of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited to the industry. From time to time, I have been asked questions that suggest a considerable lack of knowledge of the part that this company plays in the economy of the industry. I have been asked to explain the position of that company in the industry, and the effect of the increased price on its finances. Therefore, I shall clarify the position. The Queensland Government acquires each year the raw sugar that is manufactured in that State, including the raw sugar that is manufactured at the three mills operated by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited'. In addition, sugar that is manufactured in New South Wales in the company's mills is placed voluntarily by the owners in the Queensland pool. In order to carry out its obligations, the Queensland Government, having acquired the whole of the sugar, and therefore being the owner of it, appoints the Queensland Sugar Board to administer the refining, sale and distribution of the sugar. That board is appointed by the Queensland Government as its refining and selling agent in Australia. From the time the raw sugar is manufactured in the mills and is placed in ships or other specific points of delivery until the wholesaler takes delivery of the refined sugar, the commodity belongs to the Queensland Government and not to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited. At no stage does that company own the sugar. The only return that the company obtains from the industry is represented' by the fees that it is paid by the Queensland Sugar Board, acting as the agent of the Queensland Government, for the services that it provides in refining and distributing sugar in Australia. The company has nothing to do with the export of sugar. The whole of the accounts of the 'Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited, representing its operations as the agent of the Queensland Sugar Board, must be submitted each year to the Auditor-General of Queensland to ensure that they are completely in order. I shall cite in terms of pence per lb. the fees that were paid to the company in 1947. These figures are the latest that I have been able to obtain:-Management , .083d., cost of selling .039d., interest .030d., refining costs, embracing wages, coal, packages and other materials, insurance and delivery of refined sugar, depreciation of plant and processing losses, .491d. The total is .643d. per lb., or slightly more than -£d. per lb. of refined sugar. That amount represents the complete return per lb. that was received by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited' for its operations in 1947. As that company in addition to refining and distributing sugar makes available to the Queensland Government moneys for financing the acquisition of cane throughout the season, it will be granted that it is performing a fine service for a very low fee. The company has no voice in determining the distribution of the moneys that are paid by consumers and allocated to the industry by the Queensland Sugar Board. I shall now deal briefly with that part of the industry's application that was not granted by the Commonwealth. The industry asked that the statutory payment of £216,000 per annum by the sugar industry to the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee should be suspended, at least temporarily, until the large reserves that had been established by that committee were liquidated. The Government has refused that application, and I believe that, from the statement by the Minister in his second-reading speech, the position regarding that fund has not been fully understood; otherwise I consider that at least a part of the industry's request would have been granted. The Minister referred to the application by the industry for the suspension of that payment, and after giving some explanatory details, he saidThe Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee Funds, apart from being used for purposes of domestic and export rebates, may also a ton should not be payable. It would be used for "" the purpose of promoting the use be payable for at least another five years. and sale of Australian manufactured fruit products in the Commonwealth of Australia or overseas"". Therefore, the Government could not agree to any action which might jeopardize of sugar consumed in Australia. the fruit processing industries. It is the inclusion of the last few words in that statement of the reasons for the Government's refusal to grant the application that suggests to me that the Commonwealth has not fully understood the position. It was not the intention of the sugar industry to jeopardize in any way the fruit or fruit processing industries, and the acceptance of the industry's proposals would not have had that effect. For many years the fruit industry's requirements of sugar have been increasing and manufacturers have enjoyed certain concessions that have been payable to them from a fund established by the sugar industry. A domestic rebate of £2 4s. a ton is payable to the manufacturers of fruit products in respect of sugar that is used by them in the processing of fruit. There has always been a qualification that that rebate shall be payable only if the manufacturers pay to the fruit-growers an amount that is considered by the Efuit Industry Sugar Concession Committee to be a reasonable price for the fruit. Por many years, that committee, which was established to administer that fund, has actually laid down the prices that should be paid to fruit-growers in the south. The result has been that since that time fruit-growers have received good prices for their fruit, and have developed their industry considerably. realized that it has a certain responsibility to return the support that it receives from the industries in the south, and for that reason it has been gratified to be able to give suitable assistance to the fruit industry. But when it accepted that obligation it did not at any time undertake to play the role of fairy godmother for all time to industries in the south. It was considered that after some years, when a basis for reasonable fruit prices had been established in the south, the necessity for that payment would cease. But in any case, there still remains in the Mr Davidson. fund more than £800,000. The proposal of the industry that the contribution of £216,000 should not be collected does not mean that the domestic rebate of £2 4s. A contribution of £216,000 represents between 8s. and 9s. a ton on the quantity The second consideration which the processors receive from the fund is an export rebate payable on the sugar content of exported fruit products. Manufacturers of products which include sugar are able to buy sugar at the equivalent of the export parity price, so as to permit them to compete on the world's market with products containing cheap blackgrown sugar. No rebates have been made under this provision for some years, because the price of sugar in Australia has been cheaper than the world parity price. The Australian manufacturers of fruit products have been getting their sugar cheaper than their overseas competitors have been able to buy sugar. Thus, during the last few years, the fund standing to the credit of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee has been steadily growing. Indeed, the position is becoming ridiculous. So long as the world price, of sugar keeps up there appears to be no limit to the size of the fund, and no actual use for it. Therefore, the sugar growers say, ""Why not relieve us of this payment, at least for a period ?"" A few days ago, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture tabled the last report of the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee, from which I have taken the following particulars:The sugar industry has £ s. d. Receipts, 210,000 0 0 Interest treasury bonds .. 22,159 5 3 238.159 5 3 ExpenditureDomestic rebate . 123,444 17 5 Administration 814 2 9 124,259 0 2 Excess 113,900 5 1 Balance at 31st AugustCash in banks 101,793 0 0 Treasury bonds 750,000 0 0 851,793 0 0 In view of the fact that there is being established a large fund for which there is no real U3e, and that the industry has asked for the suspension of the payments for a period only, the Government might well have accepted the industry's proposals. However, the principal request of the industry was for an increase of price from 4£d. to 3d. per lb., and full credit is given to the Government for haying acceded to that request. We should like the increase to be applied as rapidly as possible so as to cover the bulk of the present crushing, and to ensure that the price of the whole crop will be in the vicinity of £24 a ton. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: The bill. -Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) say whether anything will be done to make more sugar available to housewives in the southern States during the fruit-preserving season ? matter up by letter with the Premier of Queensland. be improved? [9.46] I support the bill. As the repreespecially in Tasmania and Victoria. sentative of an important sugar-growing With pride I think this increase arises district in southern Queensland, I apprefrom a question that I asked of the ciate the fact that the Government has Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) not very acceded to the request of the industry for long ago. an increased price. The attitude of honourable members to the sugar industry has changed notably since I first entered the Parliament. I pay a tribute to such report adopted. pioneers as Mr Doherty, Mr Johnson and Mr Powell for their work in gaining recognition among fruit processers and consumers in the south of the importance of the Queensland sugar industry. It is the only industry in Australasia which has not had the benefit of an increased price since the depression. At that time, Senate's amendment) : the price of sugar was reduced, and no increase has been granted until the present time. In past years the industry (2.), insert the following sub-clause:suffered from the hostility of housewives the"" (2.) [73] and fruit processers in the southern States. That hostility has now waned, and now honourable members representing all States in the Commonwealth are prepared to see justice done to the industry. By the application of scientific methods, by increased efficiency and by hard work, those engaged in the sugar industry have been able to carry on, but the proposed increase of $d. per lb. is long overdue. This is not a party matter. The industry is important to the development of Queensland and the defence of Australia, which is the only country in the worldthat produces cane sugar with white labour. Moreover, Australian sugar, produced by white labour, is the cheapest in the world. It might be argued that sugar sells in England for less than it doeshere, but to the British price there must be added the bounty paid to the beet-growers, and the protective duty on imported sugar. When such factors are taken into consideration, the price of Australian sugaT compares favourably with that of sugar in any other part of the world, including Cuba. With the aid of science the cheapest sugar in the world is produced in southern Queensland. I am very glad that the sugar industry is to obtain this increased price. It is worthy of assistance. It iB an important factor in the defence of Australia because of its operation in Queensland. It is also, with a great deal of reciprocity, of great assistance to the Bill agreed to.

Defeiice and Minister for Post-war Reconstruction) [9.58] I move That the amendment be agreedto. One of the provisions of the bill, which appears in clause 24, deals with the payment of money to the Collector of Customs. It has been deemed wise to make an amendment of this provision. The Senate, therefore, deleted the subclause (2.) which appeared in the bill when it left this House, and inserted a new sub-clause in its place. The effect of the new sub-clause, as explained by the Minister for Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley) in the Senate, is to enable the Collector of Customs to accept a guarantee in respect of the duty on coal instead of making it mandatory upon him to accept a deposit of money for that purpose. The sub-clause that has been omitted reads(2.) Notwithstanding the provisions of the ln*t preceding sub-section, a deposit of money nmy be accepted by the Collector on account of the duty on coal to be produced during a period approved by the Collector, and removal may he made during that period, without entry, of coal the duty on which does not exceed the amount of tbe deposit.

It will be seen, therefore, that the amendment is limited to the one point to which I have referred. I rise only to say that this amendment to a bill that we had before us for the first time earlier to-day is symptomatic of the haste with which legislation is being forced through the Parliament in order that it may rise at a time that has been decided upon by the Government.

The party whips, to whom I also express my appreciation, have had a very busy time during the life of this Parliament. The Parliamentary Draftsman has also been kept busy, and although the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) has made reference to some matter of drafting that did not please him, J am sure that he will admit that the Parliamentary Draftsman has a really difficult job. The officers of the House have accorded election. He has been in poor health for members the greatest courtesy and attensome years and that fact has forced him tion, and have contributed to the harto decide not to contest at the general monious working of the Parliament. election the seat that he now holds, They have indeed contributed very greatly although he would be certain of winning to the comfort of members of tbe House. it if he faced the electors. The older memI express my appreciation of the efficiency bers of this House will remember the brilof the Hansard staff, the members of liant invective of the honourable member which make much better speeches than for Batman when he was at his best in most of us are capable of making. I know debate in this House. His speeches were that my speeches seem much better after not always enjoyed by his opponents, but I have read them in Hansard than he has made a great contribution to the they seemed when I made them, public life of this country. He leaves and I put that down to the literary skill this Parliament after having rendered of the Hansard staff. The members of very great service to Australia, and that staff have had a great deal of strain to the party with which he has been imposed upon them during the present associated. Parliament. Apart from the fact that the House has been sitting on four days a week, morning sittings have imposed a great strain upon the Hansard reporters, not be contesting his seat again. WhatandI am sure that all honourable members ever differences there may have been w ill joi n with me in congratulating them between that honourable member and me upon their work. The staff of the Parliamentary Library and, indeed, he is one of the best behaved has given great service to all honourable members of this House. Other honourable members who sought its assistance and members to whom I wish to bid farewell its members have extended to us the and to whom I wish to express my greatest courtesy at all times. I appreciate the work done by that staff. I also (Macquarie-Prime appreciate the work done by the staff of [10.5 J I the refreshment room and all other staffs in the House. I take this opportunity of expressing my good wishes and appreciation to a number of honourable members who are not seeking re-election at the next general election, and who will therefore not be returning to the House. They are old friends who hold the respect of every member of the Parliament and of all Australians. One of those honourable members is the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), whose lengthy illness has kept him from attendance at the House for some time. This has been greatly regretted by all of us. The right honourable gentleman has given a great measure of service, not only to the Labour party, but also to the whole Australian nation, and I deeply regret, not merely for reasons of party, but also for personal reasons, that he will not be returning to this Parliament. The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), who is an old member of this House, is also not seeking reI understand that the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson) w ill I can say that he has always shown great courtesy to every member of the House,",80,Special Adjournment

I really do not know who the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) will have to get his teeth into in future, as the honourable member for Bendigo will not be returning to the House. The honourable member will have to find a new subject for some of his repartee. I also express my regret that, due to ill health, the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott) will not be contesting his seat at the next general election. A ll the honourable members that I have mentioned have given good service to their country. Politicians do, after all, render service to the people whom they represent. expressing, on behalf of tbe Government, its good wishes to all of those honourable members who will not be returning to the Parliament, and also its appreciation of their work. In expressing my appreciation of the courtesy accorded me by honourable members opposite I shall not be hypocritical enough to offer them tbe wish that they will get everything that they want between now and the time that the next Parliament meets. That would not be the right thing to do, and I would not be quite sincere if I did it. I hope that some goodwill and best wishes for happiness, honourable members opposite will not be returning to the Parliament, and I suppose that that feeling is completely reciprocated. I take the opportunity now to thank personally all the members of the House, no matter to which party they belong, for the very great courtesy that they have extended to me as head of the Government. It is perfectly true that some honourable members opposite have been slightly rude at times when feelings have run high, but I do not mind that at all. Our personal relationships, whatever differences we may have politically, are particularly good. Also on behalf of the Government I thank honourable members opposite for their courtesy. In particular, I thank the Leaders of the Opposition parties and their deputies for the courtesy, consideration and kindness that they have Ur. Chifley. shown to me. I shall always be able to look back on this Parliament without feeling that any member of it is my enemy. I wish all honourable members the best of health and I am sure that, despite the vicissitudes of political life, a great number of them will return to the Parliament. However, there is room for some expansion and we shall see many new faces in the Parliament after the next election because of the increase of the number of seats. The Christmas and New Year season will have passed before we meet again and therefore I express to all honourable members my very best wishes for themselves and their families, and all those who have been associated with them in the perI take this opportunity of formance of their duties. I again thank the officials in the House from the highest to the lowest, for the kind consideration which they have always extended to me. In the unavoidable absence of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Menzies) 1 desire to express, on behalf of the Liberal party of Australia, the good wishes of all its members to those who have so ably assisted us during the last three years. I concur, in the main, in what the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley) has said. I join with him in expressing health and prosperity to those who are about to leave us. The close of this Parliament gives us an opportunity to say farewell to some of those among us who have been closely associated with the parliamentary life of this country. Several honourable members on both sides of the House will not stand for re-election, and we shall miss them in the new Parliament. Those honourable members include the honourable member for Deakin( Mr Hutchinson), who has always comported himself as an extremely worthy representative of his constituents. We thank him for the great public service that he has rendered to this country, and we wish him health and prosperity in all his future undertakings. The honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott), whose state of health, unfortunately, precludes him from continuing in public life, has made his mark in the political arena.",81,Adjournment Valedictory

The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr To the officers and staff of the House, Rankin) will transfer to the Senate, and I have no donbt that our misfortune in losing him from this chamber will be regarded as good fortune by those who will sit with him in that chamber. I should like to say a few words about the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), for whom I have a great respect. was first elected a member of this House, and his sincerity, capacity and obvious honesty of purpose impressed me most forcibly. country will be the loser because he will no longer take an active part in public life. I also express my regret that the Parliament is to lose the services of the honourable member for Batman( Mr chamber, and who have the means of Brennan), whom I was compelled to respect in the early days of my political life. He was then a force to be reckoned with. T have crossed swords with him on many occasions and in debate he has always been scrupulously fair. During his parliamentary career, he has contributed a great deal to the national life of this country. The honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha), who is of more lecent vintage, will also leave us. His cheery nature, and the courtesy that he has extended to all honourable members, have endeared him to all of us. We are glad to accept the friendship of all those who oppose us politically. Although we do not see eye to eye with them politically, we respect their integrity, and the tenacity of purpose which has prompted them to cross swords with us in the hurly-burly of parliamentary life. I extend my regrets to those who will not be with us in the new Parliament. No doubt they will listen attentively to their colleagues attempting to obstruct the business of the new Government, as we have quite successfully done in respect of the business of this Government during the last three years. I shall now refer briefly to my personal arsociation with the Prime Minister. In the short period in which I have been Acting Leader of the Opposition, his courtesy and kindliness have been a great Fonrce of satisfaction to me. Ho has been helpful in every way, and T have been most appreciative of his help. I express my appreciation for the valuable assistance which they have always rendered to me. I greatly regret that, because of ill health, Mr Speaker (Hon. J. S. Rosevear) is unable to be present at the close of this Parliament. He is a man of great character, who, possibly, knows the StandI remember him when 1 ing Orders better than did any of his predecessors. To you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I extend my very best wishes. Although we have crossed swords with you on a number of occasions, there has been no This lasting-bitterness in our relations. My good wishes are also extended to the members of the Hansard staff, and to the gentlemen who sit quietly in the broadcasting booth in the corner of this putting our speeches over the air, either in a way that reflects great credit on us by the volume of our voices, or creates a wrong impression in the minds of the listeners by toning them down. The fact that, in the hurly-burly of politics, with the sharp thrust and parry of political debate and disputation which we get in this democratic Parliament, we are able to make warm personal friends among honourable members of different political faiths, augurs well .for the continuance of our parliamentary system. Although there may be sharp cleavages of opinion on political matters, we do not carry our differences into our personal relations. [ have no doubt that the lot of the future Prime Minister and of Mr Speaker and the officers of the House will be much harder when the newer members meet in this chamber, full of enthusiasm and brilliant' ideas, and have to be directed in the performance of their duties. [10.19] -In the temporary absence of the Leader of the Australian Country party ( Mr Fadden) I wish to associate the members of that party with the expressions of goodwill that have been uttered by the Prime Minister( Mr Chifley), on behalf of the Government, and by the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) on behalf of the Liberal party.

We have realized that you had a duty to perform and that you performed it to the best of your ability. I join in the expressions of appreciation of the work of the Hansard staff and the officers and staffs of the various parliamentary departments. I refer particularly to the staff of the refreshment rooms, whom we are apt to forget after they have fed us so well. My party desires that I should express our gratitude to the officers of the Commonwealth departments for the assistance and courtesy that they have extended to us at all times. We appreciate it very much. * On some occasions the press has said nasty things about us, but I forgive those who' have done so, as I forgive those who have drawn nasty cartoons. We have shortly to face our masters, but apparently the press has no master. The Parliament is to lose the services of the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott). The honourable gentleman is a great Australian and a man who is well versed in national and international affairs. He will be a great loss. It is a pity that the Parliament is to be deprived of the services of a young man of the calibre and promise of the honourable member for Deakin( Mr courtesy itself. I also express appreciaHutchinson). The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Rankin) will not return to the Parliament again as a member of the House of Representatives. He has been associated with the Australian Country party for a very long time. There is no man in Australia whose honour and integrity excels that of the "" General "". He has rendered yeoman service to his country in the Parliament and in the field. I express the hope, which I am sure is shared by all honourable members, that he will be successful at the forthcoming general election and that he will be happy in the Senate. I have known the honourable member for Denison (Dr. Gaha) in health and in sickness. I have seen him in this chamber in the course of debates when he has been really venomous but, I have also seen Mr Bernard Corser. him at meal times when he has been quite approachable. I have seen him in the middle of the night when I have been in pain and he has been the essence of kindness. I know his ability as a medicai man. I can never thank him sufficiently for his kindness to me. No mention has been made of the honourable member for Watson( Mr Palstein). re-election. do not like to see honourable members leave the Parliament. I hope that he will find his niche somewhere. Two other honourable members who will not return to the Parliament are the right honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin) and the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), two stalwarts of the Labour party. The right honourable member for Yarra has never been the man that he was before he assumed the responsibilities of Prime Minister of this country during the depression years. Trugreat burden that was imposed upon him then almost killed him. We hare learned to like and respect the honourable member for Batman, and we shall miss him hecause we realize his worth and integrity. I express my gratitude to the Prime Minister for the assistance that he has given me on many occasions. WheneverI have approached him, he has been tion of the assistance that I have received from other Ministers. All country members realize that their task is made much easier by reason of the courtesy and assistance that is extended to them by Ministers. I also extend my best wishes to my colleagues, the Government Whip and the Liberal Party Whip. Our association has always been pleasant. AgainI offer to all honourable members my own best wishes, and those of the party to which I belong, both for the Christmas season and for the election.

However, I have endeavoured to the best of my ability to maintain order in the House.

The to ing officer has had to do his duty. AgainI express to all honourable members my appreciation of the assistance that they have given to me. It is pleasing indeed to know that Mr Speaker is improving in health, and on his behalf also I extend good wishes to all honourable members of the Parliament.

The basis uf payment to Trans-Australia Airlines is by way of lump sum payments which cover the carriage of a ll mails tendered by the postal authorities, including unsurchaTged mails when particular circumstances, such as the inadequacy of surface transport, jus tify such mails being tendered. The credits to Trans-Australia Airlines in respect of the financial years 1946-47, 1D47-48 and 1948-49 total £898,500. 2. The contract with Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited made in 1940 provided for payment for the carriage of mail at the rate of .055d. per lb. mile on the main routes' and .110d. per lb. mile on outback routes. Consequent upon the great increase of mail loads due to war conditions, the company voluntarily reduced the rate of payment on the main routes to ,0375d. per lb. mile, and later to .025d. per lb. mile. For the three financial years prior to commencement of Trans-Australia Airlines' operations, viz., 1943-44, 1944-45, and 1945-46, the payments to Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited totalled £1,884,000. 3. A considerable task is involved in separating the receipts by the Department of Civil Aviation and the payments to airline operators on account of domestic and other mails which bear a surcharge (or air mail fee) of 3d. per i oz., from the similar receipts and payments on account of other mails carried by air. It is not possible, ""therefore, to state the extent of profit accruing at the present time to the Jepartment of Civil Aviation on account of ' u 3d. surcharge, but it appears from a general examination of the matter that some profit does accrue. Sof a r as the Postal Department is concerned, the ordinary postage ingredient of air mail articles, which is Sydney; and assistant retained by the Postal Department, is estiHe had no first-hand mated to be sufficient to cover the cost of postal handling. Mr"" WHITE asked the M in is t e r for C i v i l A v i a t i o n , u p o n notice1. What is the amount of interest-free capital paid to (a) the Australian National Airlines Commission; and (6) Trans-Australia Airlines, since their inception? 2. What were the trading losses of Transoperations ? 3. What has been the dollar expenditure on behalf of (a) Trans-Australia Airlines for aircraft and spares; and (b) Qantas, since being taken over by the Government? 4. What mail subsidies have been paid to Trans-Australia Airlines and Qantas under government operation? a. What government expenditure has been incurred on the opening of Qantas and British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines offices in the various capital cities? The answers to t h e honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Advances aggregating £4,370,000 have been made to the Australian National Airlines Commission since it s establishment. Trans-Australia Airlines is merely the trading name of the Australian National Airlines Commisson. 2. Trans-Australia Airlines commenced operations on the 9th September, 1946. The first three years of operation of that organization constituted the developmental period of the commission's undertaking. As indicated in the commission's annual reports and financial accounts, the excess of expenditure over revenue during those years was as follows, viz.:-1946-47 , £A505,927; 1947-48, £A296,801; 1948-49, £A94,886. 3. (a) The dollar expenditure on behalf of Trans-Australia Airlines for aircraft and spares for each financial year since its inception was-financia l year 1945-46, 1,093,741 dollars.; 1946-47, 2,368,423 dollars; 1947-48, 1,3G6,883 dollars; 1948-49, 2,121,768 dollars. This dollar expenditure was incurred in purchasing four DC4 aircraft ordered early in 1946 and five Convair aircraft ordered towards the end of that year as well as for spares for these and other aircraft purchased by the Government from the United States Government during or immediately after the war. (?>) Since Qantas Empire Airways became wholly owned by the Australian Government on the 1st July, 1947, the dollar expenditure of the company up to the 31st August, 1949, has been 7,389,836 dollars.

In addition, for the financial year 1947-48, the sum of £33,972, and for 1948-49, the sum of £89,605, were credited to the Commission's accounts in connection with services of a developmental nature as approved by the Minister. In 1948-49, these developmental services included the internal services in Queensland formerly operated by Qantas Empire Airways, which were taken over by Trans-Australia Airlines as from the 2nd April, 1949. The total amount claimed by Qantas Empire Airways from the Australian Government on account of its airmail services since the company became wholly owned by the Australian Government on the 1st July, 1947, up to the 31st August, 1949, is £1,485,088, being £1,287,300 in respect of the Australia-United £197,788 on account of other services. The company's operations to Japan are under charter to the Department of A i r for the carriage of military loading and have not been taken into account. The company's claims are still subject to check. 5. The Commonwealth Government has incurred no expenditure on the opening of Qantas Empire Airways and British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines offices in the capital cities. However, since the 1st July, 1947, Qantas Empire Airways has spent £7,700 on alterations to premises in Melbourne which are partly occupied by Qantas Empire Airways and partly by tenants. The total expenditure by British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines in opening offices in capital cities is £6,714. ter for C i v i l A v i a t i o n , u p o n not i c e What amounts have been paid by the Cortimonwealth Government to Trans-Australia Airlines for each of the financial years since its inception on account of: (a) the carriage of mails; (6) passenger fares; and (c) other payments for freight and like services? honourable member's questions are as Empire Airways state that the total payment follows:(a) The amounts credited to Trans-Australia mately £1,168,647, which amount includes Airlinesi n respect of the carriage of mails Qantas Empire Airway's share of the operators in each of the first three years of operation mail revenue pool under the partnership were: 1947-48, £325,000; 1948-49, £399,300.
