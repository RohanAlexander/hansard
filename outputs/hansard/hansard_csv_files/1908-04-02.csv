Was this"" Order issued with the knowledge and approval of the Public Service Commissioner ? 3. Was this Order made generally applicable to the Public Service throughout the Commonwealth ? 4. If limited to the Customs Department, was it made generally applicable to that branch of the service throughout the Commonwealth, and, if not, why was it made specially applicable to the Customs service in New South Wales, and enforced upon its branch of the Service? 5. Is it a fact that this Order (Comptroller General's Circular No"". 88) is in direct contravention of Section 69, sub-section 4, of the Commonwealth Public Service .Act, and of Refutation No. 82 thereunder? answers 'to the honourable member's questions are as follow1.

The Public Service Commissioner does not consider that the Order contravenes section 69, sub-section 4, of Regulation 82, for the reason that the period of recreation. leave is discretionary, 18 days being the maximum period, but the Chief Officer or Minister has power to reduce this where circumstances warrant it.

116,Mr Dugald Thomson (North,"-Some Defence whether cadets were medically examined, and received a reply in the negative. night that it was useless for us to purchase guns unless we had the men to put behind them. and say that money is wasted in training the material to put behind our guns unless we make sure that that material is sound. Sir John Gorst, who was Minister of Education in the Balfour Government, writes in his book entitled Children of the NationMillions are spent in providing ships* and rifles and guns for wars that will never take place : the smallest outlay is grudged towards providing the men to man those ships and fire those guns should the occasion ever arise for the people to defend their country. It is the duty of the Minister to see that the medical examination insisted' upon in regard to candidates for admission to other branches of the Defence Forces shall take place also in connection with the enrolment of cadets. A Royal Commission appointed by the House of Commons instructed Dr. McKenzie to examine the children attending one of the large schools in Edinburgh, and he discovered that no less than' 7 5 per cent, of them were suffering from some defect of the eye, ear, nose, or lungs. In many cases the defects were small, and could, no doubt, be cured in time; but they were such defects that, if the boys were not examined before being trained, might prove injurious to the individual, and lose us the services of a soldier after the expense of training had been incurred. It will be seen, therefore, that, putting aside the humanitarian aspect, it would pay the Department to have these boys medically examined. In Adelaide, a leading medical gentleman of large, experience is quite satisfied that, if. the school children of South Australia were examined, 50 per cent, would be found to be defective; and we must remember that the conditions there are infinitely better than they are in the slum cities of Birmingham, Leeds, or even Edinburgh. The Premier of South Australia' has appointed Dr. Rogers, an able medical gentleman, to examine 1,000 school children; and I am anxiously awaiting the report, because I believe it will be shown that, in spite of any defects, a military training will be of service both to the boys and to the country. ' In view of the new defence scheme^ and of the fact that all the (Hindmarsh) [3.22]. vote for this year has practically, been time ago I asked the Minister of spent, there is not much use in discussing these Estimates; and I content myself with expressing the hope that the Minister will The honourable gentleman said last see his way to have the same examination in the case of the boys as in the case of the adult members of the Forces.

The question of defence-is one to be taken seriously. ought to be taken seriously. We have already had two schemes prepared by persons more or less efficient; and there is another scheme in prospect. These changes themselves make for inefficiency; and we should endeavour to attain some sort of continuity. which I share, that the present system is not receiving the encouragement that it might receive at the hands of the Government. isting forces are being encouraged as they might be, simply because there is another scheme in prospect. ference with the existing forces. ber of young men in my constituency wrote to me expressing their desire to establish a troop of Light Horse; and, although I laid that letter before the Minister, no success attended my efforts to meet their wishes.

In his speech on the defence policy the Prime Minister said that of the 22,000 militia, not more than half were available for active service. HereI think that, according to the Prime Minister, not more than half of the men are; available, after we have gone to the expense of training them. Before we undertake any scheme of conscription we ought to exhaust our resources in the way of volunteers. no occasion for a speech on the general defence question; but Parliament,and the public generally, are waiting for the Bill There is an cimpression abroad, which must precede our third scheme of defence. My object now is to impress on the Minister of Defence that he should avoid in .the new scheme all the inefficiencies and defects of the second scheme. The Military BoardI regard as an unfortunate experiment. Only a short time ago we were told of a gun which arrived in Sydney, which was not unpacked, and had been lost for about twelve months. The Minister of Defence, with his usual generosity, took all the re-, sponsibility; and he could not point to any officer who could really be said to be answerable for the occurrence. It is the absolute absence of responsibility that seems to make the Military Board so unsuccessful, and to have brought about the present chaos in the Department. It is. not the fault of the Minister. ' I believe that if the Minister were working with a General. Officer Commanding, whether permanent or As a layman, like the militia-wit h a man who had control, and who felt some' responsibility-thing s would be very much improved. The MinisterI t is a force more mobile than has done very good work. No Minister has faced the problem with a stronger determination to work hard, or has shown greater enthusiasm in his task. But, unfortunately, the Minister is purely a political head. He holds his position because, in the first instance, a constituencychooses him, and then because the Gomembers of the vernor-General selects him as a colleague of the Prime Minister. selects him to be a colleague. the true constitutional stand-point.

Now the Military Board is supposed to be composed of certain officers who will give to it continuity of purpose. That was the principal ground upon which its constitution was recommended. It was said that the system of having .general officers commanding was simply that of bringing officers from England who in a short time would go back again, without giving to our policy any continuity of purpose whatever. But since the Military Board was appointed, it seems to have become simply a sort of fighting ground for better pay and better-commands. It was stated in the press some time agoI cannot say whether the facts are correct-that Colonel Wallack, the present chairman of the Military Board, was last year receiving ^""600 a year, whilst Brigadier-General Gordon was receiving Â£900, and the State Commandant of Victoria Â£800.

My point is that the Chief of Ordnance should know something about ordnance, and when the new scheme is under consideration, I hope that the Minister will be able to provide for responsibility in regard to re-organization.

Field artillerymen cannot be employed permanently, and the Department gets over the difficulty, by using garrison artillery to form an instructional cadre for field artillery. The Minister stated in a recent interview that the garrison artillerymen ought to be confined to garrison work, which is practically an endorsement of the opinion that there must be a nucleus of permanent men for the field artillery. provision for them. ister will consider the matter in connection with the new defence scheme. Although he has been generally reasonable, I wish to mention an instance in which he has not done exactly what Parliament wishes to be done. There are some in his Department who deliberately try to prevent effect being given to the wishes of Parliament. The matter to which I refer is one to which I have been drawing attention during the last seven years-the granting of commissions to rankers.

When Senator Playford held office as Minister of Defence, the Prime Minister, on his behalf, offered to arrange for me to meet him and some of the officers of the Department, with the object of discussing an amendment of the regulations relating to the granting of commissions to rankers. Unfortunately, at the last general election Senator Playford was defeated. The Conference, however, took place, those present being the Inspector-General, Major-General Hoad; the Chairman of the Military Board, Colonel Wallack; the Secretary of the Military Board, Mr Pethebridge; the present Minister of Defence, and myself.

His officers go the length of ripping up the arrangement of twenty years, and then they report to the Minister that they have done it. sometimes hard on me for not following the advice of experts, but experts did this thing. is a simple case of administration. That is all. ' It is no expert matter. Here is a case in which there is a company of riflemen seventy-five strong, who have had a range in a gully for eighteen years past; and all at once some interested land-owner reports that some bullets are dropping on his property. land-owner is, or where the bullets have dropped. They cannot be traced. All that 1 the land-owner has to do, however, is to make a complaint to the Department, when, without an atom of consideration for the riflemen, the range is absolutely closed. The riflemen are not even consulted about it, or told that it is intended to close it. They have no opportunity of making a complaint before the thing is done.. quite sure that the Minister himself did not tell him about this matter first? tary of-the rifle club told me about it. The Minister certainly did not. All the infor0 mation that the Department has on the subject is contained on one sheet of paper containing a report of about 100 words, and it has taken the Minister a fortnight to get even that. There is not a word from the State Commandant about it. The Commandant in New South Wales seems to have nothing to do with anything of this sort. One finds his initials on a paper or two, and that is all. If anything could be more inept and more absurd than the methods of procedure of the Defence Department I do not know of it. Do honourable members mean to tell me that the Minister is not responsible for that kind of thing ? It is a Ministerial matter pure and simple. If the Ministeris content to allow his officers to do this sort of thing he must accept the responsibility. too many military experts looking after things. matter of expert knowledge, or anything of the sort.

The very greatest of all the questions with regard to which it was considered that Federation would secure advantages was this. We were told that at least we should have an efficient defence service.

India, I used'to have the impression that he was a major in an infantry regiment. The present State Commandant of Victoria was a ranker, but, by study, qualified for a commission. It is idle to say that because a man has been in the ranks he is not fit to take charge of a body of men. There is nothing like experience; it is only by experience that men can fit themselves to command. How is that experience to be gained ? Happily, we are not always at war, and our men, therefore, must be afforded opportunities for training in connection with various manoeuvres. I have no desire to labour this question, but, as one whose ancestors for six generations were rankers in the British .Army-m y grandfather was with Wellington, from the lines of Torres Vedras to the Loire, and my father enlisted for the Crimean war I feel strongly upon it. Barracks are in my electorate does not entitle me to pose as an expert, but we! have abundant evidence that men of the ranks are as capable of learning, and of qualifying for leading positions in our forces as are men in higher walks of life.

The exigencies of the situation may require it to be removed; but, to my mind, the Williamstowm site is a good one. We have had a depot there for some years, and there are many reasons why that depot should be retained. There is ample land, for its extension. I desire now to draw the attention of the Minister of Defence to the Estimates relating to the Ordnance Department. I notice that provision is made for an inspector of ordnance machineryin the Estimates relating to Victoria. The duties of that officer extend all over the Commonwealth, and I fail to see why he should not be a staff officer in the Central Administration. is referring t'o Major Harding. necessary at the present time to have an inspector of ordnance machinery, surely that necessity will be greater by-and-by. It will be observed, however,. that no provision is being made to train men for that position. The office is in the professional division, and the occupant of it ranks as a major. We are told that nearly every man one meets' ini America is a colonel, and military titles certainly seem to be on the increase here. The machinery section of the Ordnance Department was at one time on the civil side of the service, but we now have an ordnance machinery corps. have always been on the military side. In the old days the officer in charge, who was a man of exceptional ability, showed that the men were not receiving payment commensurate with their services, and ultimately a change was made. But whilst The mere fact that the Victoria the head of the corps is a major, the ""officer next to him in Victoria is merely a warrant officer artificer, and I believe that that post is. to be done away with. Tha't' being so, the next officer to the major in charge will be a staff sergeant artificer, drawing ns. per day.

When he returned to Australia he went back fo his position in the regiment, and, asking for nothing, was content so to serve. Later on, Colonel Burns resigned, and was succeeded by Colonel Vernon, who, however, almost immediately afterwards also resigned. Captain Cox then, became the senior officer; and he was recommended for the appointment by both' of his superiors. However, the authorities in New South Wales began to demur to giving Captain Cox the command, raising all sorts of obstacles. Cox, not acting of his own accord, but on advice of others in the ser. vice, made application. I may here say that Captain Cox desired to resign longago, rather than fight this matter; and it is not due to him' in the least that we are discussing his position to-day. There were others in the service in New South Wales Strathrae, Elandsklbof, who thought it was time to take a stand for simple justice; and, on their suggestion, Captain Cox put in a claim for a command under section 22 of the Defence Act, which is as follows :The Governor General may appoint any person to be an officer or promote an officer for distinguished service, or for marked ability and gallantry in active service, without' his .passing the prescribed examination. That is how tlie trouble began. The Government declined to give. Captain Cox his rank; but, as he could not be passed over, he was appointed to the command of the regiment. One would have thought that an officer of such distinguished service would, at least, have been given the privileges and rank of such a position, if only temporarily. ' But, as a matter of .fact, although he has been commanding the regiment for two years, he is still receiving the comparatively paltry pay of a captain. This is a position of affairs which the Minister could alter without doing an injustice to any officer in the service, because there is not one who would raise the slightest cavil if Captain Cox were treated in the manner to which he is entitled. It is all very well for the Minister to point to hundreds of. other officers, but I ask whether those officers have colonelcies to accept -whethe r there are opportunities to put them in command even if the Minister were so disposed. There were two officers who went through the war in command of mounted infantry."" The moment Colonel Carington came back to Australia from the war he was given a provisional command. not the Minister. Mn. JOSEPH COOK -I ' am not saying who did it, and I am not complaining. I will put the matter fairly. Colonel Carington was given pay privilege and rank as a colonel.

Forces are to be encouraged, the Government must not treat in this fashion men whodevote their lives to their hobby, and who have succeeded in winning the highest commendation from the best officers in the British Army.' This is no proper return to make to such a man'as that. to add a few words to what has been said about the. case of Colonel Cox by the honourable member for Parramatta. I agree that this officer has been very badly treated. When a man risks his life, and gives up comfort and the prospects of civil advancement, to serve his country in war, whilst the feather-bed soldier stays at home, it is humiliating, when he returns, fo find that the men who have looked after their own private interests, have received all the good things. There seems to be something very "" fishy"" indeed about the whole casei. officers, on their return from South Africa, got their local rank, and that, as soon as there was an opportunity, they were put into positions of command. This officer, however, after his fine service in South Africa, was required to pass an examination. the kind in Queensland, as the honourable member knows. The Queensland officer, whose name I will not mention, served with honour and distinction in South Africa, and was mentioned in despatches. His services were publicly recognised, by both Lord Roberts and Lord Kitchener, on the field of battle. He was giyen promotion for them, and was a born soldier, brimming over with enthusiasm for his work. But when he returned to Australia, what happened? He found that while he was away, he had lost his promotion irt his regiment, and was told that he would have to return to the same position that he occupied when he left, or take none at all. Being a highspirited individual, he said , "" If this is the 1 treatment I am to get, I will have no more of it "" ; and he-forthwith left the service. When an officer returns from war with the record that Colonel Cox has, there is someHe is a man who would thing -wanting in our military system if we do not see that he gets a "" square deal."" The Department must know what this man has done. Surely it is more honourable fo be promoted on the field than by mere seniority. It is too humiliating to put such an officer under instruction or examination from men whom he could teach in matters of military tactics. When there was an opportunity for the Government to step in and do justice to this officer, I cannot understand why the Minister did not do it anything until the opportunity occurred. to be a soldier on the battlefield, surely that is the best proof of his fitness that we can have. case. There could be no better kind of examination than that which an officer undergoes in war. should never have been asked to go up for examination.

We want experienced soldiers in Australia. We are constantly sending officers abroad in order that they may gain practical knowledge of the art of war. Here is a man whoreturns to us ready trained, and full of vim and enthusiasm; but simply because he has not social influence at his back, he 'does not get a "" square deal.""

I should like to know what the final arrangement is to be in this matter, and, to test the feeling of the Committee in regard to the present arrangement, I intend to move the reduction of the salary by Â£ 1 . We are also asked to vote Â£580 for the Director of Stores, but the officer who fills that position is at present acting as accountant in the London office. Seeing that he is an expert in military stores, and particularly in clothing, the country needs his advice in connection with the proposed new 7 scheme of defence. have our military clothing made in Australia? cers cannot remain in London and do work for the Defence Department. At the present time, the CEief Clerk is acting as Secretary, and, fortunately for the Minister, is doing the work well, he being one of the most capable officers in the De[358] partment. If (Captain Collins and Mr Savage are needed in London, their positions in the Defence Department should be either abolished or filled by other officers. Coming to another matter, no doubt the Minister saw the statement in the Age a few days ago as to what is done with officers who have received special training abroad. Or. their return, they all seemto expect office billets. But men who have been sent to England or to India to increase their military education, instead of being put into offices, should travel about the Commonwealth, so that their knowledge may be imparted to the troops, and our Defence Minister Forces made more efficient. given about that. drew the attention of the Minister to this matter.

A garrison artillery gun is fixed in large fortifications. act as drivers although being garrison men. They are all-round men.

If we have three permanent men for each gun-on e to load, one to train, and the third man to sponge out-the rest of the work can be done by any one, and we can rely upon the guns being properly handled. The reason why in the Imperial service nine permanent artillery men are attached to each gun in action is to prevent any one man being overworked and to provide for casualties. At the battle of Ingogo there were only one or two artillerymen at one of the guns; the rest, were infantry. The report of the debate continuesson artilleryman drives he is not a garrison artilleryman. means that.although we choose to call these men garrison artillery the whole of them can be made into infantry, because they are all-round men. My opinion is that our artillerymen should be all-round men. They should be able to [ 3 5 8 ] -2 . handle a carbine, a garrison gun, a siege gun, or a horse artillery gun.

Powerful. in the amendment I will have it altered. say that he wants to have all-round men, so that if he chooses to employ them as infantry men he will do so. ThenI find that the honourable member for Dalley spoke to the question, sayingIt seems like butchery to ""have a g o"" at the Minister now. It is not real warfare. The right honourable gentleman has capitulated to the honourable and learned member for Corinella. But we have not merely to look to the present; we have to consider the future also. During the last two years, Parliament has shown a strong . sense of economy in regard to military matters, and the Commandant, being wise in his generation, has cut down the permanent forces. The honourable member proceeded to point out, as the honourable member for. Corio had done, that the Minister was making a mistake in accepting the amendment, but it was agreed to. I hope that the Minister will either cause the Act to be amended, or, so to speak, take the bit between his teeth, and see that the men are trained in field as well as in garrison artillery work. It is essential that we should have in our permanent men a skeleton army. connection with the cadre. scientific branch of the service should be all-round soldiers. A man cannot know too much about artillery. The more skilful we make our gunners the better machines they will be when we want them.. Those who were members of the first Parliament will remember the debate which took place in this House with regard to the treatment of troops on the Drayton Grange. During that d'ebate I attacked the officer^ in charge, Colonel Lyster, declaring that on the report of the Commission I thought that some of the men had been cruelly done to death. I still hold that opinion. I went on to say, however, that the man in charge of the troops on board, Colonel Lyster, who is now the State Commandant of Queensland, should have been hanged, because he was neither more nor less than a murderer.

Since that conversation I have again read the report of the Commission, and in the light of the information I have received from Colonel Lyster, recognise that in many cases, in the first instance, I placed a wrong construction upon statements in it . In justice to Colonel Lyster, therefore, I wish to withdraw unreservedly the remarks that I made, and to express my regret that I should have uttered them.

I am satisfied myself that such an attempt now would end in chaos. About two years ago, two field forces were manoeuvring between Rockhampton and the border, and on the second day the men had to go hungry in the absence of any ""tucker,"" although they were within thirty miles of Brisbane. I am afraid, therefore, that if an attempt were made to assemble the troops from' all over Australia in some parts of New South Wales, they would be starving before very long; but, at any rate, the efficiency or inefficiency of the forces I desire the Minister to tell us would be proved. I am sure we all desire that the hopes of the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence may be realized in regard to the new defence scheme, which, if it does not mean absolute efficiency, will provide forces that can be made efficient. Any Personally, I should be willing to pay almost anything for an efficient. service; and I am sure that no one in the country would say a word against any reasonable expenditure. But, as I have said every session, we might as well throw the money into the sea as spend at in the way we are now doing. We are spending practically _ Â£ 1 , 0 0 0 , 0 00 a year merely to provide billets for people, and, in the matter of defence, we have been living in a fool's paradise. If the hopes of the Prime MinN o ; but I believe in the ister and the Minister of Defence are only partially realized, we shall have a force of which every one in trie country will be proud.

He did not go on to say-bu t I presume that he will quite admit-ho w necessary it is to have also those men organized and equipped under an efficient general staff and officers. It is of no use to have efficient riflemen unless we have the organization to bring the riflemen to the scene of action. We need to have ammunition trains, baggage trains, ordnance trains, and all that organization which goes to make a mob of armed men into an efficient fighting army. The honourable member, also omitted to say, but it is none the less true, that it is of no use to have a number of armed men, and the means of taking those armed men to the field of action, unless we also have the skilled brains to direct their energies to the best advantage. We need to have a general staff in the background, with the requisite knowledge and training to direct an army along strategic lines to ultimate victory; and capable commanders in the field able to take the greatest tactical advantage from the actual fields of battle. But I did not rise so much to refer to the necessity for having equipment and brains as well as arms, and the knowledge of how to use themj among the rank and file. A very important point was raised by the honourable member for Maranoa in connection with the permanent Secretary of the Defence Department. I do not wish to say a word against Captain Collins. I believe that he is a very valuable officer in. whatever secretarial position the Commonwealth may choose to put him. But he occupies a very anomalous position. when, for years, he has received his salary as Secretary of the Defence Department, whilst he himself has been permanently resident in London doing other than defence work. fence work,,is it not? tain Collins' office in London is largely defence work, but Captain Col.lins' own duties take him very much outside his office. He is frequently away doing the work of an Australian representativeI do not mean, of course, of a High Commissioner-in London. our defence materiel? duties placed upon him by the Government from time to time. These duties vary from his being asked to collect works on Australia to expediting the shipment of defence materiel. He discharges a variety of work, which entitles him to consider himself the chief Commonwealth representative in London. Of course, he is not a High Commissioner, but he is undoubtedly the representative of the Commonwealth, doing all the work that the Commonwealth wants done there. But he occupies an anomalous position, because year after year he is drawing his salary as Secretary of the Defence Department, whilst he is 12,000 miles away, and' another officer, Commander Pethebridge, is doing his work at a smaller salary. It is not fair that one officer should be down on these Estimates for Â£ 9 0 0 a year, whilst the man who is doing the work is not getting the same salary. In common justice he should be getting the same. orable member suggest that Captain 'Collins should get? serves every penny of Â£ 9 0 0 a year. The only fault that I personally could find with the late work of Captain Collins as Secretary for the Defence Department may not be regarded by other honourable members as a fault at all. Indeed, I am not sure that I regard it as a fault. I refer to Kis minutely careful scrutiny of public money, which, in connection with this Department, may occasionally be carried too far in a faddy way. Bur! still, it is, generally speaking, a very fine fault for a public officer to have. I find that Commander Pethebridge is to receive an allowance for acting as Secretary for Defence, amounting to Â£ 2 0 0 . But the momerft' Captain Collins comes back to Australia to take up his duties-if he is to bef brought back-thi s other officer will have to be , It is chiefly defound some work commensurate with the higher' pay that he ihas been receiving 1 during! Captain Collins' absence. As far as I can gather from the Estimates, there is no place for Commander Pethebridge to fill at the increased salary. I suggest for the consideration of the Minister that it is essential that this question of an absentee Secretary for Defence. should be settled, in justice to Captain Collins and to Commander Pethebridge, at the earliest possible moment. the other night t'hat the High 'Commissionership required consideration, and that he would not much longer delay dealing with the question.",54,Department Of Defence

The Minister apparently thinks that it matters little where men who have to be brought a distance of some 800 miles are sent', and that the Board should be able to carry out its organization with such a question unsettled ! I agree with the honourable member for Maranoa that the military position is farcical. The naval position is no more satisfactory. For this state of affairs, too, we have to blame, not the naval officers, or those administering den mobilization many miles from a centre the Naval Agreement, but the Minister and Parliament. position have Ministerial irresolution and indecision placed our naval Shortly after the first meeting of this Parliament, the Naval Director recommended that six cruisers, under separate Australian control, defence of Australia, and the Government of the day, of which this Government, is the heir, decided against that recommendation, and in favour of the Naval Agreement, which aims at Imperial naval 'Cooperation. quently made further representations on the subject, and it was decided-owing , as Mr Mrf. Playford told the Argus, to differences of opinion in the Board-to refer the whole question to the Imperial Defence Commit-' tee, the highest expert autharitv in the Empire. The Committee considered Captain Creswell's report during several months, and condemned it, declaring that it showed '-' an inappreciation of the latest developments of naval strategy."" On the receipt of its report, two courses were open-to act on it as the highest expert opinion in the Empire; or to refuse to do so, from political considerations, of which the Government is the judge. permitted them to take neither course. They referred the report to the officer whose scheme was so adversely criticised by the Committee, and he naturally adhered to his first opinion. shelved again, and although other policies Have been brought forward, we have not discovered to date whether the Government intend that there shall be one. control for all the King's ships, in whatever part of the Empire they may be, or whether the Australian ships shall be under separate control, as if Australia formed no part of the Empire. be blamed for inefficiency when Ministers will not state a policy?

I do not intend,, however, to criticise him personally. I find that some 48,000 sets of saddlery would be required for the new force, but there is no reference to such an outlay in the Prime Minister's estimate? On the Imperial service scale a division which numbers some 20,000 men will require 1,585 Tiding horses and nearly 6,000 draught horses. Apparently., however, there is no intention on the part of the Government to organize the vast horde of unequipped, if armed men which it is proposed to bring into existence. I speak not as a captious critic, but as one anxious to ascertain how the Government propose to overcome this difficulty. Are we simply to have a horde of men who will remain in the one place in the hope that the enemy will come to them, or are we to have a mobile army ? would be a fairly clever Ministeri f he could induce Parliament to grant him Â£500,000 for the purchase of horses. which has-been foreshadowed to be a mere instalment of the total expenditure that the Government have in mind ? Does the Minister think that if he can induce the country to bear with resignation that instalment he will be able to induce it to submit quietly to additional expenditure? way to deal with a matter of this kind is to make a straightforward statement to the Committee. The Minister' should take the Committee into his full confidence and trust to the patriotism of honourable members. I would only say in conclusion that I think that both in respect of their land and sea defence proposals the Government are putting the cart before the horse. It takes from six years to ten years to train a warrant officer, let alone a commissioned officer, for the highest rating in the navy; only one year to build a ship. What should we do first of all.? Should we buy our ships without training our men, or should we first of all train our men if we can obtain from the Admiralty 1 supvessels in which to train them, and seek afterwards to purchase our ships ? On the completion of the Naval Agreement we shall have enough Australians and New Zealanders trained in the Imperial Navy to man four Australian cruisers if we desire to It is time that we purchase them. The Government instead now propose to borrow men from the Imperial Navy and to buy ships that will be under the patronage of this Parliament. In other words, we are to have our ships before we have the men to man them ! Would it not be better to feel our way and first of all to train our men? In the same way the Government are proposing, in regard to the land forces, to obtain a horde' of men before they ascertain how they are going to secure the necessary officers. The militia is utterly inadequate to provide at once the number of officers who will be requirecT for the forces which it is proposed to raise. The Ministry should first think about fhe establishment of a Military College. They should set to work to train officers as quickly as possible-to build up the forces from something that we have at present-and eventually arrive at universal service if it is desired. I am not saying anything in opposition to the princiole of universal service. I recognise that if we believe that Imperial naval strength is inadequate to our purposes, and if we consequently feel that our policy must be to protect the country from invasion, we must have something like universal service. But we must have efficiency. The only way to secure that efficiency is to begin by adopting a proper method of training our officers. During this debate the Minister has made several observations which seem to me to show that he has no confidence in the experts in his Department. I think I can safely say that he appears to have lost The proper confidence in a number of them.

I say, therefore, that he ought to come to the House and say, "" I do not believe in the Board for this purpose, and think it should be abolished."" If he I do not wish to ask him to freely and frankly takes the House into his confidence, and urges it on this non-party question to set the Defence Department right, I am sure that he will be supported, and that he will make a successful appeal to the patriotism of every honourable member. pite the strong temptation which such a subject as the Estimates of the Defence Department offers for discursiveness, as evidenced by many of the speeches that have been delivered, I do not propose to deliver a lengthy address.

The Minister will admit that there is a very large measure of justification for any adverse criticism that may be offered. inception the Commonwealth has been called upon to spend annually about ^1,000,000 on defence, and there is a feeling abroad that up to the present we have obtained very little for our money. .The honourable member for Parramatta, who made a very excellent speech, emphasized that point, but he seemed to miss the cause. In the opinion of that honourable member the cause lay not so much in the Department as in the fact that there had never been a substantial Ministerial head-that Ministers had come and gone so rapidly that not one had been able to find and give effect to a proper working system. I disagree with the idea that that is the main reason for the failure of the Department. reason is deeper rooted, and is in the Department itself rather than in it's administration. The Commonwealth, rightly or wrongly, decided at the outset to depart from the old ideals that had animated the advisors of the States Governments in the matter of defence, and to have, instead ot a professional military class, a citizen soldiery. That was the policy laid down, and there came a tug-of-war between the men who believed in the. Old' World professional military systems, and those who believed in a citizen soldiery. T make bold to say that the efforts of a very, large section of the military authorities have been in the direction of discrediting and frustrating the policy laid down by the Commonwealth Parliament. Those authorities have set themselves, not openly but covertly, to bring discredit on the principle, with a view to establishing their own ideal; and to my mind that has been the main cause of the friction and dissatisfaction. The trouble will continue until such time as we have at the head, not only a Minister but also an officer who is thoroughly in sympathy with the Commonwealth policy. We require a man there who is in touch with the spiritof Australian democracy, and who desires to build up a system of defence on the basis of a citizen soldiery. While there is this antipathy to a citizen soldiery we can expect nothing but the chaos which has prevailed during the whole seven years of Federation. I have been forced to these conclusions by a feeling that there is an antipathy man against the unprofessional military man, the former regarding the latter as something beneath him. The surprise is that our citizen side of the Defence Forces From its has remained so strong and active. We have to make up our minds now whether we shall have a citizen soldiery or aprofessional soldiery. Are we going to place on the shoulders of this young Commonwealth those old-world methods which, by their excessive cost, have ground down democracy ? Are we not to have practical effect given to our ideal of a citizen soldiery which, while being efficient and effective, will not be costly. Let us lay down definitely the lines of such a policy, and see that we work up to it. We must have a certain permanent force for the purpose' of securing efficient drill, but we must make our -permanent officers understand that our ideal is 'to defend Australia by means of The a democratic citizen soldiery. If our officers will not work up to .that ideal, let them be sent about their business. Let them go to the old world, where they will find opportunities of giving effect to their own antiquated ideas of defence. No matter what Government we'have in power, so long as the wishes of Parliament and of the people of this country are practically set at defiance, there will be difficulty and confusion. While I do not wish to enter into a discussion of the new defence proposals of the Government' just now, the present affords an opportunity for honourable members to offer suggestions which may be useful to the Government in preparing their scheme. When we were dealing with this subject in the first Parliament of the Commonwealth, I was one of the few members who expressed the idea that we were committing a mistake in not attaching greater importance to the naval side of defence. I believe that that aspect of the question has been too much neglected. Indeed, the neglect has been little short of criminal. First, I would emphasize the importance of the defence of our harbors. We ought to spend a little more on providing torpedo boats and small fast cruisers that we could place along our coasts. "" I do not think that there is any need to engage in the construction of large war vessels. So long as we are associated with the British Empire we'do not need to do more than look after the defence 0? our coast-line. We are peculiarly situated in this respect. We are not in close proximity to the territory of any large power that may be hostile to us or to the Empire to which we belong. Any hostility that may arise must come from a distance. The enemy must concentrate his large war -vessels at some point distant from Australia. Where Australia might be made to suffer in this connection is through damage done by commerce destroyers. Our commerce is of vital concern to us. The first aggressive action by an enemy would probably be, not to send a fleet of ships to Australia to take possession of any part of our country, but to despatch a few swift commerce destroyers to damage our trading vessels and harass our coasts. We want to be in a position to meet that danger. We have no need to fear troubles within our own borders. But, so far, our principal preparations for defence have been made inland without any consideration to the dangers that may come to us from oversea. A very effective means of defence could be provided for the protection of our harbors. In addition to that, we need to train and eciuip our young men in the country districts to participate in the defence of their country. First of""all, in pursuance of that policy, we need to develop our rifle clubs, and to give every opportunity for our young men to become proficient in shooting. Good shooting is largely a matter of practice. Many of our young men have acquired skill'in marksmanship, and have been able to hold their, own in competitions abroad. We need to afford increased ^opportunities for such practice. I feel sure that if we encourage our young men, in their spare time, to devote themselves to this training, providing them with skilled instruction, they will be an invaluable asset for defence purposes in time of danger. We also need to encourage the Australian Light Horse. I have found on the part of the military authorities a certain hostility to the formation of light horse corps in the country districts. The officers' seem to want to keep the corps near to the city. In fact, they have laid it down as a principle that a light horse corps must not be established outside a certain radius of a city. like to travel for instructional purposes. it said that the officers do not.like to go no sympathy from the Department. into the little, bush towns and country centres to train our light horsemen. But they need to be reminded that the Defence Force take in such a corps. officers. They should be plainly told that that the old scheme would do so; but I if they do not like to go into the country found that the military heads were so districts to give instruction to , men who desire to participate in the development of this valuable arm of our forces, we have no need for their services. It has to be remembered that city men who join light horse corps have means of earning a livelihood that are not, as a rule, associated with horsemanship. These young men generally occupy positions in banks or stores or offices. Horsemanship is not a matter of daily occupation with them. It is rather an exercise or a pastime. But in the country districts men almost live in the saddle. They practically make their living by their horsemanship. These are the kind""of men tfhom we want forthis sort of defence. who rendered most valuable service during the Boer war. the men who, without any previous training, enlisted for service in Africa, and proved their fitness largely in consequence of their skilled horsemanship: I am asking that the Defence Department shall not discourage these men in the formation of light horse corps, but shall rather endeavour to utilize their services. By way of practical illustration of how the Department treats this branch of the service, I may mention that ""there is at Condobolin a company of men who have been applying for five years past to be registered by the Department as a half-company of light horse. These men did'not wait for the Department to come along and register them. They constituted themselves a corps without any departmental influence. They number about fifty men now, and include some who went to Soutb Africa during tlie war and rendered valuable service there. One of the promoters of this very company is a young man, long resident in the district, who, without any previous military experience, went to South Africa, acquitted himself well, was promoted, and was selected as one of the Australian representatives who went Home to the King's Coronation. He has come back and has made use of his knowledge by inducing his young friends in the district them, instruction, and for five years they I have heard have continued their operations with little or I was told",61,Kelly Doe S The Minister

Three officers did good service in South Africa, two of 'them obtaining promotion on their return, while the third, who, so far as the papers go, was the best, was left out in the cold. The two who were promoted are of high social standing, while the third has little social status. largely determines promotions under the present system. That is in accord with the military ideas of the old world, but is incompatible with a citizen soldiery. .The man who desires to be captain of a little country corps has to light for the position if he does not possess social standing; but if he is a big land-holder, or a local magnate, he gets the position without trouble. We shall never have a satisfactory citizen soldiery until an end. is put I have also had applications, to this. I hope that every encouragement will be given t'o the development of our citizen soldiery on true democratic lines. I desire also that the Minister will do what he can to give members of rifle clubs opportunities for acquiring proficiency in the management of firearms, instead of Alpermitting treatment such as the honourable member for Parramatta has complained of, and which has been extended to many districts. The development of The Minister has said the Australian Light Horse is also desirable. We should not confine our defence preparations to the big cities, but should utilize the services of the men who, Why should the cost be so living in the saddle, have not to be taught how to handle and manage horses. I am I am certain that the pleased to know that the matter , of providing equipment is receiving attention. Men may be properly drilled, but, without proper equipment or the ready means of obtaining it , they must be at the mercy of a foe. One of the first things to be done is to establish a small-arms factory, so that we may be independent of outside sources, for the supply of ammunition and weapons. In this, way, we can base our defence system on safe and sound lines, gradually We do not developing it as time goes on. However,, as the Minister wishes to get through the Estimates, I shall not offer any further criticism now. The [ro.20] -It is not mv intention to deal at length with the Militarv Estimates, because most of the money set down for the financial year has been already spent, and we can now only lament its expenditure.

There is the British Fleet, and there is the United States Fleet to protect usj because the American Navy Board has decided to keep fourteen battleships at the Philippine Islands continuously, and to have a fleet in the Pacific equal to any other there.

The enormous sum of money that we waste on militarism would fill the Northern Territory with immigrants. It would buy millions of acres of land, and settle it with a population whose very magnitude would keep out invaders. But I suppose it makes no difference what I say. This military system of utter waste will go on. No one seems to have the courage to attack it. I have been longing to be the . Treasurer if only that I might be able to do so; but that seems further away than ever. I am almost afraid to say a word against the military, for .it seems that the time has come when Australia must take all its orders from the men on horseback. Are we to make any change ? . If we could turn the whole country into a great military school so that we should haw no ""common soldiers"" I should not mind. Our officers, with few exceptions,hold the "" common soldier "" in utter contempt. The lines of demarcation, caste and rank, are really so rank that one can smell them on turning a corner sixteen miles away. The honourable member for Parramatta has referred to-day to the case of an officer who has a real grievance. He has fought for his country, shown his ability, valour, and genius on the battlefield, and has returned to Australia only to find that he is not The same thing wanted. I learned recently of another officer who went with one of the Australian contingents to South Africa, fought there, was wounded, taken prisoner, and ultimately released. A t the close of the Would the honourable war the High Commissioner of South Africa appointed him judge.of compensations, his duty being to distribute amongst the Boers the Â£ 9 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 which the British nation, in the greatness of her generosity, chose to give those whose property had suffered during the war. Although that man was a major in South Africa, he was not given the rank of major on returning to Australia. The Minister will never succeed in establishing a satisfactory system until he secures officers who are in sympathy with the citizen soldiery. When one talks with the regular men who draw regular pay-the regular sol; diers whom we know as the ""dancing masters,"" and the ""Toorak Society Roosters"" -on e finds that they have no sympathy with the Prime Minister's scheme. All these men ridicule it , and yet neither the Prime Minister nor the Minister of Defence has the courage to go beyond them. The Minister to-day spoke of. experts in his DeI would not partment.

For all time the working men have done the fighting, and while they have been away Mr Boodlier has generally been grabbing everything they have left behind.

We well remember what their employers said when, they volunteered for service: ' ' Yes, my boys, go forth and fight for your country.""

Why should not those who have property pay for its protection ? I repeat that we ought to have a great military school in Australia, so that we need have no common soldiers. Let us have no one below the rank of a colonel, and let every man wear a badge on his shoulder to denote his rank and authority. The Labour Party is the only party in this House that can boast of a fighting man. We have in our ranks a man who carried the flag in South Africa, and yet it is said sometimes that we are not loyal. We are all proud of him, and as I listened to his speech to-night I could not help feeling glad that Re was the man who had done the fighting instead of me. The honourable member for Wentworth talked about spending Â£500,000 on horses for the forces. He should remember that horses grow old and die, and that such an expenditure would be wasteful. The country which has not learned to encourage men to go to the front by looking after them on their return-by making heroes of them-ha s not learned its business. Only lately in the United States of America the pension valve has been opened, so that every man who has smelt powder will receive a pension. Nothing but an' earthquake sufficient to bring down the pyramids of Egypt would change our military system. There seems to be a sort of bureaucracy which prevents the Minister's orders being carried out. If a change is ordered, it is so made that there is no difference. I am in favour of an Australian Navy, but it may very easily be shut up like other navies; and in any case, why this scare about war? So long as the Anglo-Japanese friendship exists, there can be no onslaught on Australia by Japan; indeed, I believe that it is this friendship that has prevented a war between the United States and Japan. honourable member to confine himself to the item. protest against this waste of money on a useless military system. taxed to buy braid, feathers, and other ornaments for roosters who are of no use [359] In the United States of to me. It would be much more profitable to utilize our permanent army in shooting Western Australian rabbits for sale in England. However, I suppose that whatever We should touch them arguments we advance, these Estimates must be passed; but it is time that we cut down this foolish expenditure, and utilized the money in encouraging immigration, and in irrigating our lands. The most expensive gun or war vessel becomes obsolete in ten years; and, as I said before, there is no reason for a scare about war, seeing that we are thousands of miles awav frcrr everywhere. No fleet in the world could carry sufficient provisions to enable an army to land and penetrate twenty. miles inland, and even if that could be done, we are well able to defend ourselves.
