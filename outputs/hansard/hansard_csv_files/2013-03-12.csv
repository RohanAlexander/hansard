It has said that the Howard economics', but that would be wrong because government was the most profligate, the bones have weight. There has been highest spending government, in the nation’s absolutely no weight and no substance to the history. It was the most reckless-spending government in this nation’s history. When Deputy Speaker, you will hear a lot of the economy was raining gold bars, what that whinging from those on the other side about government should have been doing was government spending. But when they go addressing some of the long-term problems, back to their electorates they are talking the long-term issues, that we have in this about the projects they wish the government country. As members from the National would fund. The longest line in my Party would often lament, it should have electorate is that of Liberal Party councillors been spending more on infrastructure, more and Liberal Party supporters who are on roads. It is a source of great knocking on my door saying, 'Whatever you embarrassment to those in the National Party do, you've got to stop that Tony Abbott, the that this government has spent more on roads Leader of the Opposition, from tearing up and more on rail-more on critical the NBN; and for God’s sake can you ensure infrastructure-than the coalition ever did that it turns up to my business, to my house, when it was in government.

They will not ensure, at the time in the economic cycle be talking about these sorts of things in their when the government needs to act to support electorate, but when they come here to jobs and growth, that you stimulate the Canberra these are exactly the sorts of things economy. If that means going into deficit, that they are saying the government should then that is the right thing to do. As the be doing. economy starts to recover, you start to pull I have spoken about spending on back on spending-and that, indeed, is infrastructure.

That tax has delivered only $125 million in the is why we have delivered $130 billion worth last six months.

That is the a long way to delivering much needed right thing to do. You will not hear that from infrastructure projects in my electorate.

I cited the number of report of the Joint Standing Committee on tax file numbers that were found in 1999, the Electoral Matters that the integrity of the last time there was a review of tax file roll, on the one hand, and the wish to put as numbers. There were 3.2 million more tax many people on it as possible, on the other file numbers than there were people in hand-which is the government's desireAustralia at the census prior; there were constitutes a great gulf between the 185,000 potential duplicate tax records for government and the opposition. individuals; and 62 per cent of deceased Unfortunately, the Australian Electoral clients were not recorded as deceased in the Commission also seems to be dead keen on sample match. It was pointed out to us in the just sticking people on the roll willy-nilly committee, when we took evidence on the without having to honour the Electoral Act in concept of automatic enrolment, that, for its current form-that is, to require people, instance, a Centrelink roll, which the AEC when they turn 18 or become citizens, to fill now uses, is in fact a composite of anything out a form and become an enrolled voter.

The reason is that just before the before the speeches are made and before the 2010 election the government changed the manifestos, if you like, of the parties are put. law so that a prepoll vote, which was This means that people who vote before previously a declaration vote and therefore election day are not given all the information could be opened prior to 6 pm on election which is given to people who are voting on day, became an ordinary vote so that it election day. would be counted on election night and we would get a quicker outcome. But the This is why we feel so strongly about the problem was that adequate information was maintenance of our system of postal votes not given to all of the electoral offices right and of allowing political parties to be part of across the country, and so they did not know that process so that they can send out that the change had been made. information informing postal voters of what the political parties' attitudes are.

It is very the tax-free threshold which Labor has put in important that we contemplate that in the place which has certainly been to the benefit context of this bill. of people in my electorate.

Tuesday, 12 March 2013 Parkes Electorate: Clontarf Foundation Deputy Speaker, on your overt promptness. Today at 6.30 pm there will be a special function in Parliament House to recognise and promote the work of the Clontarf Foundation. The Clontarf Foundation was started in Perth, from memory, about 15 years ago. It is a program based on Australian Rules football and engaging Aboriginal boys and young men. Over time it has evolved and operates in most states and territories in Australia. Indeed, for the last 12 months it has been operating in four locations in my electorate. We have academies in Bourke, Brewarrina, Coonamble and Moree. In New South Wales it is no longer based on Australian rules but on rugby league. Last Tuesday, at 6.30 in the morning, I attended the Clontarf Academy in Moree. I travelled on the bus as it went around to the homes of these lads, who are in years 7, 8 and 9. I was at the junior academy. There are two sites in Moree: one at the senior school and one at the middle school. About 35 turned up at the school in all, and we engaged in football training for about an hour. We had a game of touch football and various exercises, in which the local federal member was completely humiliated by the athletic ability of these boys. What is remarkable is that these lads would previously have already had their first brush with the law. They would already have opted out of school. One of the boys I spoke to did not go to school once last year. He was living with his grandmother. They did not know he existed. But because of the Clontarf Foundation he is now coming along to school. They go to training, they have breakfast and they have a room at the school, where they are mentored and given advice. I have to say that I have not been in a group of young teenage men that was more polite, more respectful or calmer. We in this place talk about a lot of things with regard to our Aboriginal brothers and sisters, but I have never seen a program like Clontarf Foundation. I would encourage anyone who is available tonight to go along. The Governor General, who is the patron for the foundation, will be here. I believe it deserves the support of everyone in this House. At that age these boys have been put on the right track. They are getting support right through into adulthood; in fact, some of the boys who started off in Perth all those years ago are nearing 30. The Clontarf Foundation is something to watch and something to support. Cunningham Electorate: headspace Wollongong Ms BIRD (Cunningham-Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (16:02): I endorse the statements of my colleague. On a similar topic, youth issues, I take the opportunity today to extend a very big happy birthday to headspace Wollongong, which turned five years old last month. I attended its birthday on the beach with Minister Kate Lundy. We took the opportunity to talk to a lot of the staff and commend them on this very important birthday occasion. In February 2008 I had the great pleasure of attending, with the former member for Throsby, Jennie George, the opening of headspace Wollongong in its original premises and acknowledging, particularly, the work of Dr Andrew Dalley locally in getting underway that",165,Bills Supported The Need To Modernise The

174,Mr Coulton (Parkes,"The Nationals Chief Whip) (15:59): I congratulate you, Mrparticular headspace. I think it was one of the first three in the country and has fulfilled a very important role in our local community. Indeed, we were informed that over the last 12 months headspace has helped 914 young people, delivering over 10,000 services-about 10 services per young person. Clearly that is a group of young people who may well not have accessed the sorts of medical and mental health services that they would have needed if this very youth-specific service had not been available. Beyond service delivery on site, the local headspace goes out into local schools and community organisations, running information and education programs on health and well-being for young people. It is a very, very valuable service. I know that each time headspace holds a function here in Parliament House colleagues from all across the parliament attend to express their support for this very important service. I think it is tremendous that it is so well encouraged and supported. In fact, I think that the biggest dispute is always members wanting a new headspace in their area. Everybody wants to be able to sign up for the young people in their region to have access to this excellent service. Since headspace was established in Wollongong in 2008, all up about 3,250 people have attended the service in Wollongong. It is a team of youth workers, GPs, psychologists and mental health nurses who work together to support the young patients. At the time of the birthday party, a local GP, Dr John Watson, acknowledged the work of all of the team and we all paid respect to their efforts-including the receptionist, Nicola, which shows that the whole team creating a warm, non-threatening and friendly place to go is so important in supporting the health and overall well-being of our young people. (Time expired) Flinders Electorate: Voices of the Outer Suburbs Campaign Suburbs campaign being sponsored by the Star News Group and the Cardinia mayor, Brett Owen, amongst others for Casey and Cardinia, two of the municipalities within my area, the latter of which I share with my friend and colleague the member for McMillan, who is in the chamber at this moment. The challenge for the city of Casey and the shire of Cardinia is one of growth. These are two fantastic municipalities. We have seen, whether it is in the coastal villages or Koo Wee Rup or Lang Lang, growth, population, families coming together and quality of life but also some of the difficulties associated with all of these issues of increasing population. We have had challenges, for example, in relation to services and roads. The Voices of the Outer Suburbs campaign has been launched and I give it my full and complete support. It is against that background that the Star News Group has adopted it as an appropriate and rightful campaign for those two areas, and it is against that background that I want to outline the four areas in my parts of the municipalities of Casey and Cardinia in which I think we can make real progress as part of the Voices of the Outer Suburbs campaign. The first is in relation to the lack of internet access, particularly in an area such as Botanic Ridge. There is no point waiting for the National Broadband Network, because, for many people, it is not going to come over the next decade. It is a provide omise without a delivery date.

It is a fantastic project that uses tertiary treated recycled water, and is a huge boost for local agricultural production. The third area is relation to bypasses for Koo Wee Rup and Lang Lang. The Koo Wee Rup project is seeing enormous progress being made in the planning, and I hope to see it delivered. The Lang Lang bypass is a project on which we will continue to work. The fourth component is reticulated natural gas for Koo Wee Rup and the coastal villages of Cannons Creek, Tooradin, Warneet and Blind Bight. This is an agenda for the Casey and Cardinia municipalities, and I am delighted to endorse the Voices of the Outer Suburbs campaign. Chifley Electorate: International Women's Day Women's Day in the Chifley electorate by hosting the Coral McLean Award breakfast. I was delighted to be joined by the Minister for Health and Ageing, Tanya Plibersek, who was warmly welcomed by all those in attendance. As well as paying tribute to the extraordinary contribution of women to the fabric of our community, the award and breakfast honour the selfless contribution of Coral McLean, who passed away in 2011 and is often described as the mother of Mt Druitt. She contributed over 100,000 hours to our community, particularly in the area of social justice, remains fondly remembered and is an inspiration to others. I hosted my first International Women's Day breakfast two years ago. It was a relatively small gathering of about 30 local women, and last week's breakfast brought together over 100 women, representing every facet of our community. The calibre of this year's nominations made the task for the judges all the more difficult and I want to thank those people who took the time to recognise and nominate friends, colleagues and associates. I would also like to thank the three judges for their deliberations and wise judgment in making these awards. This year's judges were: Alice Wheatley, who is the Regional Manager of Anglicare Mt Druitt and who nominated last year's award winner; Merleen Millson, who worked alongside Coral at the Mt Druitt Area Legal Centre, a strong advocate for equal pay for women; and Yasodai Selvakumaran, a HSIE and Aboriginal studies teacher at Rooty Hill High School. The winner of this year's Coral McLean Award was a very surprised and very deserving Margaret Boyd from Woodcroft. Margaret takes volunteering to the extreme as a regular volunteer guide at the Westmead Children's Hospital, by raising money for Dunrossil Disability Services and by working with veterans and widows with Rooty Hill Naval Association, who acknowledge that without her leadership they would struggle to get things done.

177,Mr Husic (Chifley,"Government Whip) (16:08): Last week I marked Internationalprofit organisation Food Within, which provides lowto middle-income families struggling to make ends meet with healthier lifestyle choices. Twenty-six-year-old Liza Moscatelli was named Young Chifley Woman of the Year. She is heavily involved with the Ted Noffs Foundation of Mt Druitt, where she inspires others with her passion for music and photography. She has completed a social work degree and has been part of the Street University initiative for two years and facilitates art workshops. Because of the depth of the nominations this year, the judges decided to make a Judges Commendation Award, which went to Ambika Dhungyel. Ambika came to Australia four years ago after spending 17 years in a refugee camp in Nepal. She has become an active volunteer in the Bhutanese community in Sydney. I want to congratulate all the winners and everyone who was nominated. Health: Strokes namely, the prevalence of strokes in our community and the impact that they have on our fellow citizens. In Australia today there are 60,000 strokes every year, a number which will only increase as our population ages. One in six people in Australia will suffer a stroke in their lifetime. In fact, strokes kill more women than breast cancer and more men than prostate cancer and are the second biggest killer after heart disease. Around 20 per cent of people who suffer strokes are under the age of 55. The cost to society in terms of human hardship is extreme, not to mention the more than $2 billion financial cost that has been quantified as a result of strokes. I want to pay tribute to important organisations in our community like the Howard Florey Institute, which does so much work in stroke prevention research and in its clinical trials. Also at a local level, I have had the privilege of getting to know the Boroondara Stroke Support Group and its founder and president, Jenny Cheng, and last year I attended its 10th anniversary celebration. It has around 100 members that are affected by stroke and provides self-help for these survivors, for their carers and for volunteers, and provides a range of activities including art and recreation, sport and strength training, as well as gardening and other activities. I also had the privilege recently to meet with two outstanding women: Dawn Oldham and a lady called Emma Gee. Both are stroke survivors. Dawn Oldham, who is a resident in the Boroondara, was a talented stockbroker. At age 42 she was struck down by a stroke. In her words, 'I had a stroke in my pantry while I was preparing for dinner, the same day I played basketball and scored three goals and was feeling fantastic.' It was because her husband had seen the advertisement for FAST, the Face, Arm, Speech and Time campaign on TV, that he was able to deal with her incident of stroke. So it was too with Emma Gee. Emma was 24 years of age, was working full time as an occupational therapist and was an avid runner when she was struck down with a stroke while having an operation to remove the arteriovenous malformation, AVM, which had formed in her brain. Both are outstanding people who have supported the National Stroke Foundation's call for action and its eight particular calls. I have spoken to the member for Dickson, the shadow minister for health, to express my support for the call to action and for the $198",172,Bills Supported The Need To Modernise The

McEwen Electorate: Mount Ridley College P-12 College. Mount Ridley College is a fantastic government school in Craigieburn which caters for students from prep to year 12. The college is a new school, now in its fifth year of operation. It was designed to be built over five stages to grow with the surrounding population. At present the college is provide teaching and learning programs for students from prep to year 10. Stages1 to 4 have been completed by the former Victorian government, and these stage builds are servicing the needs of prep to year 9 students. Since the Victorian Liberal-National coalition came to power in 2010, all work at the school has come to a grinding halt. The Victorian coalition government has failed to fund and construct the fifth and final stage of Mount Ridley College, meaning that year 10 students are being forced to be accommodated in second-hand portables. Stage5 of the master plan would include construction of much-needed teaching and learning spaces for the college's senior students in years 10 to 12, as well as counselling and administrative space. Mount Ridley College prides itself on the innovative teaching and learning programs it has developed. It is held in very high regard in the local and wider community. The school council is deeply upset that its VCE students next year will not have the opportunity to learn in proper dedicated teaching spaces. This year the school has 392 students, who would use the facilities if they were available. By 2015, the stage 5 facilities are supposed to accommodate in excess of 800 students when the senior school becomes fully operational. Despite numerous attempts in correspondence with the Victorian Minister for Education Martin Dixon, his government has consistently failed to provide any confirmation of when the construction of the final stages of the school will commence. In fact, the minister has stated there are no plans to build stage 5. Alarmingly the placement of year 10 students in second-hand portables has caused a number of issues. Students are not experiencing the delivery of the innovation programs as the portables do not allow for flexible learning spaces, and integrity of the college's teaching and learning programs has been severely compromised because of this. The fantastic staff of Mount Ridley College have noticed a disconnection with year 10 student engagement levels with other students. These have dropped off, along with a sense of belonging, as the seniors now get moved around, with no core facilities. The lack of senior school facilities is also having an impact on the parents of current and prospective students. Many parents are openly questioning whether the school will be ready prior to their child's year 12 graduation. I agree with Traci Coe, the school council president, who said: The needs and visions of a school do not alter despite the changes in government. Mount Ridley P-12 College remains committed to continuing to offer the best innovative teaching and learning programs. Our community, like all school communities, is entitled to have its building program completed in a timely manner.

180,Mr Randall (Canning) (16:17,"TodayI would like to raise the issue of the NBNmeeting on February 19 rejected the planning application for an NBN fixed wireless tower. Many local residents raised concerns about the visual amenity the tower would impose as well as the potential health impacts. Residents felt that the location for the tower was simply not right and the community questioned the amount of planning done by NBN Co. and the government. They simply could not believe that, in the entire locality of Boddington, only a few square metres of land would be appropriate for a tower. One Boddington resident questioned NBN Co. when it conducted a community information session in the town. They asked, 'Why can't we get optic fibre, as it runs to Narrogin? Wouldn't it go past Boddington so we could connect in?' NBN did not know. The resident also said, 'Blocks were subdivided above Hotham Avenue and they were required to have pits and trenches for these optic cables before sale. If they were not going to be utilised, why did they have to be constructed?' The NBN did not know. In addition, the shire understands Boddington is the only 'super town' that would not be serviced with fibre, seeing this as a missed opportunity for the growth and viability of the area. Furthermore, Boddington is a town already serviced with ADSL2+ through the soon-to be-obsolete copper network. By replacing the current ADSL2+ with the proposed NBN fixed wireless, we could see internet speeds reduced from around 20 megabits per second to 12 megabits per second respectively. While the coalition supports the provision of fast broadband on an equitable basis to Australian homes and businesses, a project of this size and scale deserves proper planning and adequate consideration when making these decisions. NBN planning is a big issue in my electorate. I have metropolitan areas within the electorate, hills, regional areas and plenty of apartment-style buildings, all dictating unique planning challenges. While only seven per cent of homes and businesses nationally are to get fixed wireless or satellite services via the NBN, in Canning these wireless technologies could be delivered to around 45 per cent of localities. NBN Co. originally promised that towns with 1,000 people would receive fibre, but last year it changed the goal posts and said it was only towns with 1,000 or more premises that would get fibre to the home. When NBN Co. made this decision it meant that up to 400 towns in regional Australia were no longer on the government's list of places to receive fibre. Boddington is one of those towns affected by this change. The shire would like to request the NBN Co. to review its technical information to address any constraints in servicing Boddington and nearby rural living areas with optic fibre to the premises. I will work with the shire and support them on this matter to try and get a proper outcome. Moreton Electorate: Bus Services 'Happy birthday' to you and the rest of the ACT. You don't look a day over 99! I want to speak about an important matter in the electorate of Moreton. I share one-quarter of my electorate with state Liberal National Party member Scott Emerson, who is the Minister for Transport and Main Roads. In July last year he announced a review of the bus network. This overhaul of Queensland bus services will mean cuts to routes, reduced frequency and fewer weekend and evening services. The Newman government has not properly consulted with the community about cuts to their local services. Additionally, any reduction in the frequency of local services will hurt those most in need of reliable bus services, including pensioners, commuters, low-income families and students. I suspect it is actually part of a",174,Bills Supported The Need To Modernise The

These are buses that belong to the people of Brisbane and were paid for by the people of Brisbane. Sue from my electorate uses the bus service daily to and from work. She is one of the people affected by the up to 30 routes that are to be cut. She has petitioned against the changes as they will put more cars on the road, adding to congestion and pollution. Sam already suffers from peak hour traffic and has petitioned against the cuts to services, but he also calls on the state government to make these services more affordable. Jacinta is petitioning to have community consultation about the removal of public transport. These are people who have contacted me, a federal member, about a local government issue that is also a state government issue, because the state government has signed off on these cuts. Bus service cuts affect the entire community, whether people use the services to get home late at night after a few drinks or to get to and from work each day or to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Good public transport connects communities, and I do declare an interest because there is a bus service right outside my door that is about to be cut. Public transport is there to serve the public. For pensioners and students on the south side, these services are often their only means of transport. I know the suburb of Acacia Ridge in my electorate has identified the changes that will have significant effects on the communities as they rely on these services to visit doctors, to get to work, to go to meetings with employment agencies and to go to Medicare offices. The 192 bus service is an essential service for those travelling to and from the PA Hospital. Constituents all across my electorate have been calling, emailing and talking at street stalls to me, expressing serious concerns about the changes. I commend another state member in my electorate, Jackie Trad, who is launching a petition to the Newman government asking for further consultation before anything else is cut. In less than a week, over 1,000 people have signed the petition, but neither the state nor the council LNP governments are listening to their voters. In fact, an independent councillor in my electorate, Nicole Johnston, mentioned today that in the public committee meeting she was at today she tried to raise this review of the TransLink bus services, but the councillor in charge insisted on talking on the history of steam ferries rather than the cuts to buses. (Time expired) Baillieu, Mr Ted Australian today about why Labor lost so badly in Western Australian. The answer was 'The Liberals didn't give us a fair go-they didn't remove their Premier in his first term,' so it was unfair to the Labor Party and it went from that position of unfairness. Quite often the cartoonists send a message to us that we can accept with a smile on our face but, in truth, is exactly right. BecauseI am a close friend of the former Premier of Victoria, it is only natural that I am going to speak about this person. As I have said publicly before, decency delivers no dividends. This man was a decent man, a very honest man and a man who put family, the Liberal Party, the state of Victoria and its people first before his own political best interests. Having said that, it is interesting to look at the coverage of the event in the newspapers. There is a clear lack of knowledge by the journalists of what actually happened. The only person who would know what actually happened would be the former Premier himselfperhaps the current Premier, Denis Napthine, and I wish him all the best, and some others.",175,Bills Supported The Need To Modernise The

You go down there and do the job that the state governments have to do when there are reductions coming through day after day from the federal government, from the GST and from other receipts. When you are in that position then you might find it is very difficult to run a state government. I just applaud the former Premier and I wish the new Premier all the best.

Where the legendary King O'Malley stood 100 years ago, the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, Simon Crean, stood. He commended the work that King O'Malley did in building the national capital. In a sign of just how far we have grown, the Chief Minister of the ACT, Katy Gallagher, officiated at the ceremony to mark our centenary. As Ian Warden wrote in today's Canberra Times, 100 years ago there were just 1,700 people in the Territory that was allocated for the national capital, and those 1,700 people were outnumbered by 320,000 sheep. There were no proper roads. Dignitaries were transported by horse along dusty roads. Today we looked out on a beautiful and flourishing city that has well and truly fulfilled the plans of Walter and Marion Griffin. The naming of Australia's new capital city was a secret that was not leaked; another sign of how things have changed. There was some speculation 100 years ago that we would be called 'Federata' or 'Shakespeare', but thankfully they selected 'Canberra', which we heard this morning means 'meeting place'. Last night I joined over 150,000 of my fellow Canberrans for a spectacular night of music, fireworks, entertainment and birthday celebrations, and I want to commend Robyn Archer and the organisers for a very special event. Like so many, celebrating our birthday just reminds us of the vibrant community that we have here in Canberra, and as the chair of ActewAGL, Michael Costello, said yesterday at the Spiegel Garden, 'Today we celebrate our community, but we also celebrate our country.

Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Ms LEY (Farrer) (16:31): BeforeI make my remarks in this particular bill, can I also join members and senators in this place in wishing Canberra a very happy birthday. I went to high school in Canberra, both to Campbell High and to the fantastic Dickson College where I finished very early on in the years when the college system began, and Dickson College is still a remarkable place of education in this city. TodayI rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013. The intent of this bill is to improve the administration of the Higher Education Loan Program in line with some of the proposals put forward in the postimplementation review on VET FEE-HELP in 2011. The post-implementation review made a number of sound recommendations-a number of these were introduced to parliament last year-seeking to further increase the number of registered training providers who are eligible to offer VET FEE-HELP courses. The coalition recognises the important role that income-contingent loans can play in vocational education. Under the Howard government, income-contingent loans were extended to full-fee-paying students in higher education courses through FEE-HELP in 2005, and they flowed through to the vocational sector to vocational education and training-that is, VETto VET FEE-HELP in 2008. Of course, income-contingent loans under the previous name of HECS in higher education courses have been around for some 25 years. Access to FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP has enabled thousands of Australians the chance to access an education that they might otherwise not have been able to do. It has enabled them the financial assistance that they need to fund the course of their choosing. But the reality is that the take-up rate of VET FEE-HELP has been well below expectations. There is a range of requirements that providers must meet in order to be able to offer VET FEEHELP courses. Regrettably, these requirements have proven too onerous for the vast majority of providers. Of the approximately 2,000 providers who offer diploma and advanced diploma courses only 112 are currently approved as VET FEE-HELP providers. This places serious limitations on the ability of students to access income-contingent loans to fund their qualifications, and, as we know, the cost of those qualifications is increasing. In 2012, a quarter of 20to 24-year-olds were not in full-time education or work. So many of these young people, who are not currently in work or training, come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and they struggle to afford to study at all. Access to incomecontingent loans in VET or higher education qualifications is crucial to assist these young people in finding a course of study and a career path by boosting equity of access and affording them the opportunity for a better life. There is also an economic argument in favour of increasing access to income-contingent loans. Many of the courses that could be funded by FEE-HELP or VET FEE-HELP are in areas of skill shortages, and we potentially have a future workforce impeded only by the cost of study. In addition to the acknowledgment made in the post-implementation review regarding the low take-up of VET FEE-HELP, a number of recommendations were made to improve the overall administration of the Higher Education Loans Program. As a result of these recommendations, this bill seeks to achieve the following. Schedule1 of this bill allows for the automatic revocation of a provider's registration as an approved higher education or vocational education provider, where the provider has either had their registration cancelled by the relevant tertiary regulator or been deemed unable to operate by a court of law. Schedule2 of the bill will see providers able to change their name where there is no change of legal entity. As the system currently stands, if a provider changes the name yet the legal entity remains the same, the provider is required to be reapproved as a new applicant. In order to ensure that students are not adversely affected, the minister is currently required to revoke the approval of the provider and reapprove the same entity with retrospective application. This is a practical measure, avoiding additional red tape for providers. Schedule3 will enable the minister to issue compliance notices to providers who are failing to comply. Currently the only courses of corrective action available to the minister are to either suspend or evoke approval of a provider or to withhold payment. This schedule provides an alternative measure, ensuring that providers have an opportunity to undertake corrective action and continue to operate without the sanctions that previously were the only available measure and were extremely harsh. Schedule4 of the bill seeks to update the calculations of HELP repayment thresholds. This has come about as the Australian Bureau of Statistics has decided to publish the average weekly earnings data on a biannual basis, shifting from quarterly. This will ensure that individuals can repay their HELP debt based on more accurately calculated repayment thresholds in accordance with the ABS data. The final amendment will see an update of the qualification definitions in the act to echo changes made to the Australian Qualifications Framework. So, while we welcome this bill and the amendments that it puts forward, I think it is necessary to acknowledge that there have been few such successful measures in the VET space achieved by those opposite. The broader system suffers from an incredible overload of bureaucracy and red tape. We on this side of the House have made it clear that reducing red tape for business and bureaucracy is high on our agenda. The national partnership on VET reform may well be considered to have failed, given the lack of sign-up by three key states. It would be impossible for anyone who enters into the administrative and compliance aspects of vocational education and training in this country to not be completely bamboozled. We in the coalition supported the extension of income contingent loans to the vocational ed sector, because we have a really strong record in making sure that those who would study vocational education as opposed to higher education-or, in the common lingo, TAFE and training versus university-should have access to exactly the same support, including financial support. But, if the government are serious about this, it has taken them a while to recognise the extraordinarily low take-up-112 providers out of 2,000 who are using the scheme. AlthoughI do not have detailed information, I would suggest that in rushing through the initial piece of legislation there was a failure to follow up, there was a failure to listen and there was a failure to consult. And that failure is written large across the entire government. If the government had been tuned in to the needs of the providers of registered training, as they should have been, they would not have sat on their hands and said, 'Okay, three years later we'll just get the department to do a review and see what the review says.' So three years pass and no-one has any idea that the system is not working, even though the intention might have been good in the first place. As I said, this is the pattern we are seeing in the training arena from the current government time and time again. We will be watching closely to see if the modest measures that will be achieved by this legislation, which of course we are entirely supportive of, actually make a difference. If they do not, I would suggest to the minister, who is a new minister in this space and a little more engaged than the previous one-and I do not mean that unkindly, but certainly the previous minister seemed to the sector to be rather hands-off-that the minister acts sooner rather than later to hang on to this valuable cohort of students and this valuable group of training providers. Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013. The previous speaker talked about the great record of the coalition. She should go north of the Tweed and see the terrible and appalling record of the LNP state government in Queensland. To localise this particular bill, there are two examples from my electorate that I will give the member for Farrer if she wants to have a look at the impact of both sides of politics on education. The University of Southern Queensland is the first, where the Education Gateways Program, the capital infrastructure program, is getting nearly $49 million of federal government funding.",177,Bills Supported The Need To Modernise The
189,Mr Neumann (Blair) (16:39,"I rise to speak in support of the Higher EducationMore university students than ever are being funded by the federal government, hitting the Bradley target of 40 per cent of people from low socioeconomic backgrounds getting into university. More young people than ever are going to university. The University of Southern Queensland in Springfield has a broader reach and larger footprint than ever before. It is going ahead in leaps and bounds. Up the road, however-in fact, beside it-are the Springfield campus and the Bundamba campus of Bremer TAFE. That TAFE is funded almost exclusively by the state LNP government. What have we seen there? Cutbacks to services, cutbacks to courses and cutbacks to funding. We have seen more barriers, more obstacles, being put in place to young people-particularly those from low socioeconomic backgrounds in the Ipswich and West Moreton region-getting access to higher education. We have gotten lectures from those opposite about education funding. Go to my electorate and you will see the difference between what a Labor government will do at a federal level in terms of tertiary education and what a coalition government will do in terms of vocational education and training. I say to the member for Farrer: have a look at what the Howard government did in terms of VET education and what they failed to do. We saw fewer students than ever before going to university under them. More than 190,000 students have gone to university under us-more than ever. Have a look at what the coalition government in Queensland has done. She mentioned-and this is referred to in the explanatory memorandum of this bill-the April 2012 COAG National Partnership Agreement on Skills Reform. These amendments contribute to our commitment given under that agreement. Why do I mention that? It is because the LNP government in Queensland signed up to that national agreement on skills reform. The legislation before this chamber makes further improvements to HELP, including VET FEE-HELP, that were signed up to by various Australian governments. In my home state, the minister responsible for employment, training and education, John-Paul Langbroek, has said, 'We're not responsible for training; we are not responsible for tertiary.' The LNP state government has got a task force dealing with the students who go to the sorts of institutions in Queensland that this legislation relates to. Students who go to those TAFE institutions are having the number of campuses cut by that task force from about 82 to 44. In my electorate, we are seeing barriers and obstacles put in the way of students all the time. Courses are being cut. Those opposite come in here and lecture us about what they are doing and say that they will keep an eye on us. Keep an eye on our record, because our record when it comes to tertiary funding is very good compared to that of those opposite. This legislation, as I said, is a result of COAG's national partnership agreement and is pursuant to recommendations made in the final report of the implementation review of the VET FEE-HELP assistance scheme back in September 2011. It also includes other amendments. What this is about is enhancing the quality and accountability of the whole education framework that underpins HELP by making sure that there can be an automatic revocation of providers in circumstances in which there is a risk to public moneys and a high risk to students. We are going to make sure that those educational institutes have integrity and character and can deliver what they say they can. We are going to strengthen the compliance framework underpinning HELP by making sure that a minister can provide a compliance notice to the provider of education services. Why is this so important? It is important because these income-contingent loans are paid to those institutions to help eligible students with their tuition fees to make sure they can get assistance to get through those courses which will give them an opportunity in life and give them a leg-up to make sure they get financial security and achieve all they want in terms of their dreams, aspirations and goals. For kids from poorer backgrounds that is particularly important. If you are a kid from Basin Pocket and you went to the local state primary school, Ipswich East State Primary School, and your parents had never gone to high school or never gone on to university, the idea that you might be able to go somewhere like Bremer TAFE and get a trade or qualification is really critical. This is what this is about. I mention that particular national partnership agreement on skills reform because this legislation comes out of that. What happened in Queensland as result of that? Guess what? There was a program in Queensland that was geared to helping students and geared toward helping the training of young people particularly-8½ thousand of them, according to the Deloitte Access Economics report in July last year-that actually provided assistance to those people who never would have got a job but for the Skilling Queenslanders for Work program put in by the previous Labor government. They put $90 million towards it. Fifty-seven thousand people got jobs as a result of that program. The Queensland government, a week before the evaluation report came out-this is the government that signed up for the national partnership agreement here in April last year-decided they would get rid of this. They got rid of a program a week before the report came out. They spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on a report and guess what that report says? It says that 57,000 Queenslanders got jobs in vocational education training by the skilling that the previous government had undertaken. It said there was an additional $6.5 billion in state gross product and gross domestic product to 2020; an additional $1.8 billion in consumption in Queensland and Australia to 2020; an additional $1.2 billion in state tax receipts to Queensland by 2020. That is for $90 million of job training, particularly for disadvantaged people. That is why we provide FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. If we have institutions that are not providing the services, we should clamp down on them. That is what this legislation is about. But why would you close down good institutions that are providing help for young people, particularly disadvantaged young people in my community like BoysTown, who were getting about $154,000; the Salvation Army Canaan School for Training and Development, who are getting $395,000 and $120,000 for two programs; or Worklinks, who got $128,000 for another program; or Riverview Employment and Learning Program through the Riverview Neighbourhood House Association, $147,000; or, indeed, Ipswich City Council, which also got $45,500 for its community literacy program; or Harvest Rain Adult Literacy Project, who got $95,000 for its community literacy program? Why would you close it down? Not a peep from those opposite about those sorts of programs. These are good programs. These people would never, ever get compliance notices by the minister under this legislation before the chamber, but the coalition in Queensland took the opportunity to close down the funding to good providers, taking away billions of dollars from the Queensland economy to save $90 million. The minister has the temerity in Queensland to say that he is not responsible nor is the government of Queensland responsible for training. He has got it in his title! Yet he takes the money away. They are persecuting working-class people in my community, putting barriers and obstacles to training in their way. Good providers will not be affected by this legislation before the chamber. If they are bad providers, then they have compliance notices. We are improving the system, and what the Queensland government should do is reverse these stupid cuts that impact adversely on the Queensland economy and on people in my community. When it comes to Bremer TAFE, they should re-employ those people, put those programs back in place, and get with the program that we need to undertake to make sure that people get jobs, that the economy in Queensland remains sound, and that the unemployment rate can be reduced. So far, we have seen it go up-up, up and up-under the LNP government, all for its obsession for so-called cuts. There has not been a peep, a word or a whisper from any of those opposite. We had sanctimonious unction from the previous speaker about this sort of thing. Come to my electorate and see what your comrades and colleagues in the LNP are doing. member for Stirling-Riverina. I apologise. Canberra celebrations have been all too much for you. Congratulations, too. It was a wonderful centenary function this morning and I know you participated with the member for Canberra. Indeed, today is a very important day for Canberrans. Canberrans also understand the need, the necessity and the importance of higher education. Canberra perhaps has more people with degrees per capita than any other capital city in Australia. We know how important a good education is; it is the great enabler. I take issue with the previous speaker, the member for Blair, for his criticism of the shadow minister and, as he called it, her being sanctimonious on the issue. I listened very closely to the member for Farrer, my neighbouring electorate colleague, and I did not think she was sanctimonious at all. In fact, I thought she gave quite a good account of the bill. You would almost think that the coalition was not supporting this legislation from the way the member for Blair has just carried on. Once again, like so many Labor members opposite, he has tried to introduce state issues into what is a federal matter. If he wants to talk about state matters, he only needs to think about the Victorian election in November 2010, New South Wales in March 2011, Queensland in March 2012, the Northern Territory in August 2012, and Saturday's Western Australian election to see that many of the things that his government offers are not in the best interests of this nation and are being rejected by the voters at the ballot box. He should be very careful when he tries to introduce those state issues into what is a federal matter. The federal matter before us is the Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013. You would almost think that we as a coalition were opposing this bill from the sentiments that the member for Blair expressed and the condemnatory way-the virtual assault-in which he described the things we are proposing and the sorts of things that state governments are doing. These are not even in line with what this legislation is about because those are state matters. A post-implementation review of vocational education and training-the Higher Education Loan Program: VET FEE-HELP-was undertaken in 2011. This bill seeks to introduce some of the recommendations made. This bill amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003 to",180,Bills

191,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (16:50,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh. Theenable the strengthening of compliance and accountability frameworks for VET FEE-HELP and FEE-HELP loans. The amendments also improve transparency between the tertiary education regulators and allow for more efficient administrative arrangements when changing business entity names of approved providers. So, there, I agree with what is proposed. The coalition is in support of what is being proposed. I am really at a loss to understand why the member for Blair continued his rant in the way that he did. In 2005, income contingent loans were extended to full-fee paying students in higher education courses through FEE-HELP under the Howard coalition government. In 2008, income contingent loans were extended to the vocational education sector in the form of VET FEE-HELP. These loans ensure students wishing to pursue a vocation can be provided with financial assistance similar to that on offer to university students through the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. The Howard Liberal-Nationals government recognised the importance of vocations and higher education and of enabling people to have the assistance they require, through tertiary and vocational supporting programs, to get the best job and realise their full potential. Certainly it was done then. The Labor government now says it is doing the same. When it comes up with a proposal or a plan that the coalition can see will be beneficial to those people looking to better themselves, we are in agreement with it. The loan may cover or partially cover the tuition costs for the VET course, however, VET FEE-HELP is not available for Certificates I to IV and students are required to repay their loan once their income exceeds the minimum repayment level, which is $49,096 for 2012-13. In order for students to be able to access these loans, their registered training organisation needs to have approval to offer VET FEE-HELP. The eligibility criteria for offering VET FEE-HELP includes a provider being a body corporate with the principal purpose of offering education, proving their financial viability, having central management based in Australia, offering VET accredited diploma and advanced diploma courses, with credit transfer arrangements in place, and being a member of an approved tuition assurance scheme, or have exemption from this requirement. Of the 2,000 or so providers who offer diploma and advanced diploma courses, only 112 are currently approved as VET FEE-HELP providers. That was certainly brought out in the speech earlier this afternoon of the member for Farrer, the shadow minister. As a result, the take-up of VET FEE-HELP has been low, with only 39,124 students accessing VET FEE-HELP assistance in 2011. Given that the intent of extending income contingent loans to the VET sector was done largely to alleviate the inequity of access, it is apparent there is considerably more work to do. In addition there are some major areas of skill shortages which could be addressed by ensuring that the organisations which offer these qualifications are VET FEE-HELP eligible. When I speak of inequity of access, that is certainly a factor in regional areas. Because of a lack of all sorts of services and support programs students in regional areas have a more difficult job of actually gaining tertiary education and better vocations than do people in metropolitan areas and people in your own electorates and here in Canberra. That is why I know the shadow parliamentary secretary for regional education, Senator Fiona Nash, has been so strident in her advocacy for independent youth allowance. Whilst that is not part of this bill, it is something that is important and imperative for regional students. Schedule1 of this particular bill is intended to bolster the accountability frameworks for FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP. These amendments specifically will enable the automatic revocation of registered training organisations' approval as a higher education or vocational education provider when any of the following have occurred: the relevant tertiary regulator has ceased the provider's registration; a court has made an order to wind up a provider; or ASIC has determined they can no longer operate. Until such time as all paths of appeal have been exhausted the provider will continue to be registered. The proposed amendments in schedule 2 of the bill would allow the minister to change the name of the entity for HELP purposes through one legislative instrument, but only in cases where there has been no change in legal ownership. Currently, if a provider changes their name yet the legal entity remains the same, the provider is required to be re-approved as a new applicant would be. In order to ensure that students are not adversely affected-and this is most important, because the last thing we need is for levels of bureaucracy to be affecting students when they need to get on with the job of learning-the minister is currently required to revoke the approval of the provider and reapprove the same entity with retrospective application. Therefore, the entity would no longer be required to reapply and go through a duplicate approval process, which is currently the case. Schedule3 of the bill will enable additional flexibility for managing provider non-compliance. Currently, the act has limited options available for the management of non-compliance by providers. As it stands, the only options available to the minister are to either revoke or suspend the approval of a higher educational or VET provider or to withhold provider payments. These actions may be excessive for many administrative breaches. Under these amendments, there will be provision for a provider to be given a compliance notice which specifies the breach, the corrective action required and the time frame for this to be undertaken. Schedule4 of the bill seeks to update the calculation of HELP repayment thresholds. This has become necessary as average weekly earnings data is determined by the Australian Bureau of Statistics data. This data was published quarterly; however, it is now published biannually. Schedule5 of the bill deals with other amendments and will see the consolidation of provisions related to the government's ability to seek information from relevant tertiary education regulators in the one division. These will improve the transparency-and we all want greater transparency-with the relevant tertiary education regulators and enhance arrangements to identify at-risk providers. Additionally, there have been changes to definitions to incorporate changes to the Australian Qualifications Framework. These changes will help to enhance the quality and accountability frameworks underpinning the higher education loan program, will enable the government to better manage risk to students and public moneys and will effectively and flexibly respond to low-quality providers. When it comes to enabling universities and other support mechanisms for students to gain better vocations, I am on record thanking and praising the government for initiatives which have helped Charles Sturt University, whose Wagga Wagga campus is in my electorate. I attended the opening of the life sciences hub along with the Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills, the member for Cunningham. It is a tremendous facility and it will do so much not only for this nation but for regional Australia and for the Riverina electorate. At the moment, there is a push in Wagga Wagga for a rural medical school. I know that the relevant ministers are well aware of this, and it is something I will certainly be pushing. I know how important these rural medical schools are to the recruitment and retention of doctors in regional areas. There are proposals being put forward by the University of New South Wales and Charles Sturt University. I am in support of those proposals. A collaborative effort, a whole-of-government approach, is something that would be very beneficial to Wagga Wagga, to the Riverina, to country New South Wales and to the nation. I thank you for the opportunity to speak on this bill. The coalition supports this legislation. Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (17:03): At the outset, I acknowledge the comments of the member for Riverina, who has demonstrated his passion for his constituents with his ability to speak for an appropriate length about an issue of importance to him and to the chamber. I was pleased when I was an academic at the ANU to work alongside Bruce Chapman, one of the architects of HECS, who put in place a truly world-leading piece of policy. It is easy to forget now that HECS, now known as HELP, has become so much a part of our social fabric. The notion of income-contingent loans was one in which Australia was stepping out as a world first. Milton Freeman mentioned the notion of income-contingent loans in the 1960s but it was Professor Chapman who really picked it up, put flesh on its bones and suggested it as a way of ensuring two big things. The first was that, because with a university education there is the private benefit to the student as well as the public benefit, they should contribute a little bit back into the public purse. University education boosts earnings significantly, and HECS, now HELP, recognises that private benefit. But, secondly, it was the recognition that we needed to expand the sector. We needed to ensure that university education was not something just for elites but was attainable for all Australians. The only way of getting those additional resources into the sector was to ask students to give a little bit back. So now, when we look at policies in which Australia is leading the world I think we should also look to the HELP policy-a policy which has proven its worth and is now being adopted by a suite of other countries around the world. The UK, Germany, Israel, Thailand and Chile are all adopting or looking at adopting the HELP policy. I suspect that will be the case down the track with policies such as plain packaging of tobacco and putting a price on carbon pollution-we are moving with other countries in the world to put in place policies that future generations will thank us for. What we are doing with this policy is ensuring that the thresholds are indexed at appropriate levels. When HECS was originally introduced, repayment did not start until you reached average weekly earnings. That was based on the simple notion that you should not have to pay back your HECS debt until your university education had begun to pay off in earnings for you. When the Howard government came to office, that model was changed and the repayment thresholds were brought down substantially. I am pleased that now the HECS repayment threshold have been restored so that they are around average weekly earnings. This bill is a part of a major university investment by this government. Since Labor has come to office there have been more than 150,000 extra Australians studying at university and total funding for the sector has been increased substantially. At the Australian National University, just to pick one of the many excellent universities in my electorate, there has been an increase in enrolments from 6,350 students to 7,086 students, significant investment in education and significant investment in improving access to youth allowance and the quality of student learning and living areas through our investment in housing. That matters, because high-quality university accommodation improves the learning experience. Recently, we had the ANU alumni awards recognising extraordinary alumni. I acknowledge Alumni of the Year joint recipients Anne Gallagher and Martin Parkinson; Vice-Chancellor's Special Commendations Adam Ford, Danny Bishop and Chris Duffield; International Alumnus of the Year Cheong Choong Kong; Young Alumnus of the Year joint recipients Sebastian Robertson and Jennifer Robinson; Student of the Year joint recipients Katrina Marson and Ray Lovett; and Student of the Year finalists Aditya Chopra, Julie Melrose and Georgia Majoribanks. In closing, I also note some important reforms being put in place by the government in teacher education courses. This government recognises that it is important to improve the academic aptitude of new teachers. When I was at the Australian National University I did work with Chris Ryan looking at the academic aptitude of new teachers and those entering tertiary education, and what we found was deeply disturbing. From 1983 through to 2003 the share of teachers who were in the top fifth of their class measured on literacy and numeracy had halved. Over the same period, the share of teachers who were in the bottom half of their class had doubled. So we had seen a fall in the academic aptitude of new teachers from the 70th percentile to the 62nd percentile, and we had seen a fall in the academic aptitude of those entering teacher education courses from the 74th percentile to the 61st percentile. It is a development that had also been seen over that period in the United States and it is a development that concerns this government. Literacy and numeracy does not guarantee you are going to be a great teacher but, all else equal, we want those who are at the whiteboard to have strong literacy and numeracy standards themselves. So, as the minister has announced, we will be putting in place literacy and numeracy testing, a more targeted admission process for teaching courses and more assistance to help all teachers over every stage of their career, recognising that there is no more important job in Australia than teaching students, particularly disadvantaged students. With those remarks, I commend the bill to the House. and Minister for Small Business) (17:10): I thank all honourable members who spoke in this debate. The Higher Education Support Amendment (Further Streamlining and Other Measures) Bill 2013 provides legislative authority for the Australian government's Higher Education Loan Program, or HELP. FEE-HELP and VET FEE-HELP assist individuals to access higher education and higher level vocational training by providing students with income-contingent loans to assist them in paying their tuition fees. By accessing HELP, students do not have to make any loan repayments until their income reaches a minimum threshold-currently $49,096. This bill builds on the amendments made in the Higher Education Support Amendments (Streamlining and Other Measures) Act 2012 and supports recommendations made in the Post implementation review of the VET FEE-HELP assistance scheme-final report September 2011. The amendments follow extensive stakeholder consultation and contribute to commitments made under the April 2012 COAG National Partnership Agreement on Schools Reform.",183,Bills
192,Mr Bowen (Mcmahon,"Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Science and ResearchThe amendments will enhance the quality and accountability framework underpinning HELP by providing for the automatic revocation of providers in specific circumstances where there is a risk to students and public moneys. This will occur only after all appeal and review mechanisms have been finalised. The amendments will also enhance the government's ability to protect the integrity of HELP by improving the range of provider compliance mechanisms available to the government. The existing arrangements for seeking information from the relevant tertiary education regulators will be further enhanced by consolidating these provisions into one general provision. The amendments will also streamline administrative arrangements for changes to business entity names for approved providers. Further, the bill will enable individuals to continue to repay their HELP debt based on appropriately calculated repayment thresholds by updating the calculation of indexation to apply to HELP repayment thresholds. This amendment reflects the move by the Australian Bureau of Statistics from quarterly to biannual publication of average weekly earnings data. Finally, amendments will provide consistency across the tertiary sector by updating qualification definitions in the act to align with changes to the Australian Qualifications Framework. I commend this bill, and its purpose to strengthen and enhance the government's incomecontingent loans program, to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment Bill 2013 Second Reading Debate resumed on the motion: That this bill be now read a second time. Territory (Self-Government) Amendment Bill 2013 on the day that Canberra celebrates its centenary. This bill is very timely, because it enhances the ability of the ACT assembly to be the master of its own destiny, and I think that is a reasonable aspiration for the parliament here within the ACT. One hundred years ago in 1913, Lady Denman, who was wife of the then Governor General, Lord Denman, stood upon the newly laid foundation stone and announced that the name of the new Australian capital would be Canberra. In an article by Ian Warden that was featured in the Canberra Times today, he described it as such: The site that people descended on for the day (VIPs coming on special trains from Sydney and Melbourne to Queanbeyan from whence they were taken on in a fleet of new-fangled horseless carriages) was totally pastoral. There were just 1700 people in the federal territory, hopelessly outnumbered by 320,000 sheep. Warden notes, spine tinglingly, that the name chosen by cabinet had not been leaked, and that the public had deluged the Department of Home Affairs with 750 suggested names, such as Eros, Cooee, Swindleville and Kangaremu. Those were discounted by the cabinet at the time but there were some other names that were taken seriously such as Federata, Parkes, Myola and, interestingly enough, Shakespeare.",187,Bills
193,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (17:13,"It is fitting that we discuss the Australian CapitalFinally, the name of Canberra was chosen by the cabinet. That word is a derivation of an Aboriginal word Kamberra which means meeting place. As was noted by the Prime Minister quite aptly today in her comments about the centenary of Canberra, that was quite an interesting decision for a cabinet in 1913 to have taken. I think it fits very well with the nature of our society today. In 1913 there was nothing much more here than a sheep paddock. In 1927 the capital was moved from Melbourne to Canberra. There would not have been a lot here. There would have just been politicians coming in for, I presume, much lengthier periods of time, given the nature of how difficult it would have been to travel from the various parts of the country then. I reflect about how it must have been then and how it is for us today. As politicians, funnily enough we would spend more time here than anywhere besides our home, but we can have very little interaction with the city. Shamefully, I can say I can come here for weeks on end and not leave the area within walking distance of Canberra Avenue. But I do actually know the city very well because I studied at the ANU. I was a little disappointed to be missed when the member for Fraser was going through the significant alumni. I assume that I will appear at some stage on that list. It is true that we can interact very little with the city itself but I have the privilege of knowing the city very well because I have lived here for many years. I studied here and I subsequently worked here. I have been down to Tuggeranong and Belconnen and Woden. It is perhaps a shame that, when we come here for work for lengthy periods of time, we just do not get out to see the sorts of delights that Canberra does have to offer. I offer my personal congratulations to Canberrans on what is a very significant event in the life of their city. The capital was administered by the national government up until 1989 and Canberrans were very reluctant to embrace self-government. Indeed, it came eventually after asking Canberrans whether they wanted it and Canberrans consistently saying no. The Hawke government at the time just insisted and passed the self-government act in 1989. It took a while for Canberrans to seriously embrace self-government. Prior to that, all the decisions had been made by the minister for territories. I think that was a good decision by the Hawke government to give the ACT self-government. I do not think it was necessarily that great to be administered directly by one federal government minister, even though there were advisory bodies that had been set up to advise that minister of matters of concern for residents of the ACT. Those advisory committees had existed since 1920 and were initially made up of appointed officials until some of them started to be elected in 1928 and in 1930 an ACT advisory council was established to advise the minister on matters that directly affected Canberrans. The first fully elected body, the Legislative Assembly, originally consisted of 18 members and began operating in 1974. That is an interesting number to ponder because the current assembly only has 17 members, so it has less than that original advisory committee that was established in 1974 when Canberra would have been a significantly smaller place. The name was officially changed from the Legislative Assembly to the House of Assembly in 1979. However, the federal government was under no obligation to take the advice that was given by any of the appointed or elected bodies. An advisory referendum, or plebiscite, was held on 25 November 1978 to ask residents whether the ACT should be granted self-government. A resounding 63½ per cent of electors voted against Canberra being granted self-government. So it was not until the late 1980s that the then Hawke government decided that the Australian Capital Territory with a population of 270,000 people did need its own system of self-administration. Then the federal parliament passed the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 along with other related legislation which established self-government in the ACT. Notably, however, section 122 of the Constitution allows the Commonwealth to override a territory law at any time. The Commonwealth has used its power under section 122 on a few occasions only and in cases where the territory law has created much debate or controversy within the Australian community. I think that is right. I think that for one parliament, where the federal parliament overrides the wishes of another democratically elected parliament, the circumstances need to be extremely dire for that course of action to be warranted. Once a territory has been given self-government and once they elect their own officials, it is really quite improper in my view-apart from the most extreme circumstances-for another group of elected officials to override the wishes of that lawfully elected parliament. Up until 2011 the self-government acts covering the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory gave federal ministers the right to veto or change territory laws without referring the matter to the federal parliament. That is quite an extraordinary power for a federal minister, if you think about it, to be able to unilaterally override the wishes of the elected parliament within the ACT or the Northern Territory, and that act has now been amended to remove this veto power. This bill is a further enhancement of the ability of the ACT Legislative Assembly to set its own course, and in this case it has set the course about how many elected officials should sit within the Legislative Assembly. It is a unicameral legislature. All states with the exception of Queensland have two houses of parliament from which to draw a cabinet and the expertise. Seventeen members of parliament for a city of 325,000Dr Leigh: 375,000500,000 and so you can see that Canberrans, funnily enough, as the seat of the federal parliament, are not overly represented by their own politicians. It makes sense that if it is the will of the Assembly to expand the number of politicians within that Assembly, that they should be allowed to do so, and it is my understanding that both of the major parties represented in the Assembly wish to do this. It seems highly likely that they will vote-and they will need a two-thirds majority under this legislation-to increase the number of members within the Assembly itself and, if they feel that that is the appropriate course of action, then they should be entitled to do that and this legislation will enable them to do just that. This bill will change the mechanism by which the size of the Assembly can be adjusted. It does not itself make any changes to the size of the Assembly, but it will leave that now within the hands of the Assembly itself. In conclusion, I wish to point out the very good work that the one opposition representative within the coalition party room representing the ACT, Senator Gary Humphries, does on behalf of his constituents, which are all the people of Canberra. He has had a very distinguished political career in the ACT parliament where he was Deputy Chief Minister and subsequently served as Chief Minister. He has served his city with great distinction. Clearly, sometimes he has been at odds with some of his colleagues within the coalition party room",188,Bills
194,Mr Keenan,"375,000 in Canberra! It has grown rapidly! I think Tasmania has aboutabout what he believes is an appropriate course of action for his community. I respect him greatly for the efforts that he has gone to to stand up for his community. I have seen him take on the vast majority of the party room when he believes the interests of Canberra are being threatened. I have not necessarily agreed with his positions but he has been a very strong and vocal advocate for his constituents. I just want to note that here today, because it is a great privilege to work with Gary both as the one opposition representative for the ACT but also somebody who works within my portfolio areas as well. He is an exceptionally capable and intelligent member of the upper chamber. In this centenary year of the ACT, he will hold a significant place within the history of the self-governing territory. I wanted to acknowledge that here today. In conclusion, in the centenary year of Canberra it is appropriate that the Legislative Assembly of the ACT be allowed to set its own destiny in regard to it size. The opposition therefore supports this bill. I note that it has had the strong support of both of the major parties within the assembly. It is right that the federal parliament pass it. Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (17:25): It is a pleasure to rise to speak on the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment Bill 2013 today, the 100th birthday of Canberra. This morning we had a re-enactment out the front of Parliament House of the ceremony of the laying of the foundation stone. I have here the program for that ceremony, which was held on 12 March 1913. Today's ceremony aimed to shadow that historic ceremony of 1913, when sheep greatly outnumbered the residents of Canberra. The ceremony this morning acknowledged the rich history of Canberra-not only the political heritage but also the social tapestry of the city. I was very pleased today to hear the member for Stirling speak so warmly of the city that I have the honour to represent in the federal parliament. Walter Burley Griffin said that he was designing a city for a nation of 'bold democrats'. To borrow a phrase from Seamus Heaney, I have always thought of Canberra as being the kind of place where hope and history rhyme. In the centenary celebrations, Canberra has been given an opportunity to celebrate but also to remember much of our history. Historian David Headon has produced a series of centenary booklets and centenary director Robyn Archer has made sure that history has been interwoven into the celebrations. We have also taken the opportunity to invest in the city of Canberra. The Australian government has contributed $20 million to the development of a visitors centre, a children's play space, ceremonial gardens, an events pavilion and an events terrace at the National Arboretum. In building the National Arboretum, we really are reaching out to the generations to come, because arboretums often involve planting saplings that will only become great trees once we have shuffled off this mortal coil. There is also an opportunity for communities to come together. One of my regrets about today is that I am missing out on the street parties that are being held throughout my electorate. The parties in Lyneham and Hackett in particular are ones that I would have looked forward to attending. They are in fact going on at this very moment. They are bringing together communities to have a bit of fun and enjoy their history. One of my contributions to the celebrations has been through the celebrity suburb name competition, which involves thinking about who or what your suburb might have been named after if you had particularly wicked ancestors. For example, Cook might have been named after Master Chef, Dunlop after tyres, Latham after Mark Latham, Reid after Chopper Reid, Russell after Russell Crowe and of course Scullin after the Oarsome Foursome. This is an extraordinary city to live in and to represent. Ours is the bush capital, where you can look up and see hills from inside a shopping centre. There are plenty of cockatoos and magpies and, yes, even galahs. When the scoping party visited Canberra in August 1906, a newspaper reported wrote: 'A deep breath of the air is like a draft of champagne.' Federal parliamentarian King O'Malley turned Canberra's chilly climes to his advantage by saying: I want us to have a climate where men can hope. We cannot have hope in hot countries. A sentiment, I am sure, thought of by many a pub-goer to King O'Malley's Irish Pub in Civic on a cold winter's night. Canberra is Australia's sporting capital. We have the Australian Institute of Sport and a plethora of great sporting teams-the Comets, the Brumbies, the Raiders, the Capitals, Cavalry, Strikers, Knights, Lakers and GWS. But we also play more sport than people in other parts of Australia. Four out of 10 Canberrans play an organised sport compared with three out of 10 for the rest of Australia. Canberra is Australia's ideas capital. Wi-Fi was invented at CSIRO. Our most recent Nobel laureate is Brian Schmidt, the ANU researcher, who won a Nobel Prize for his research on the expanding universe. We also have ideas generated by the public servants, such as HECS, Medicare, universal superannuation and plain packaging. We have social entrepreneurs in Canberra who are inspirational for the rest of the country. We are also the country's history capital. We are not the oldest city in Australia but we are the only capital city in Australia named after the traditional owners rather than one of the white interlopers. All around us the nation's history is the local geography for Canberrasuburbs from Deakin to Curtin, Scullin to Chifley. In fact, the only one you feel sorry for is Prime Minister Gorton, the only Prime Minister to make Canberra his home after retirement but who missed having a suburb named after himself because the planners wanted to avoid confusion with 'Gordon'. We are also Australia's social capital. Walter Burley Griffin wanted ours to be a community with 'great democratic civic ideals', and I think he would be pleased to know that Canberrans are more likely to volunteer than people in other parts of Australia and more likely to donate money to a charity. They are more likely to trust others and to join community organisations. Part of that is not just the fact that Canberrans are, on average, a touch better educated and a touch more affluent than the rest of Australia, because even when you compare like with like you see that Canberrans are more civically engaged than people of similar demographics. I think it is something to do with the urban design-the fact that in Canberra you do not have to burn a litre of petrol to buy a litre of milk; that you can live in the suburbs but walk to local shops. That means, for example, that a Sydneysider with a full time job spends 13 days a year commuting-13 24-hour days just sitting in the car. A Canberran with a full-time job spends eight days a year commuting. That is an extra five days a year to spend with friends and family, playing an organised sport or getting involved with family and the community. That is not to say that we should not work to improve Canberra. I do commend the member for Stirling for his bipartisan support for this bill. This bill is a recognition of the work that is being done by ACT Chief Minister Katy Gallagher appointing an expert reference group to review the size of the ACT Legislative Assembly. That expert reference group comprised ACT Electoral Commissioner Phillip Green, who is the chair; Anne Cahill Lambert; Meredith Edwards; John Hindmarsh; and Louise Taylor. This expert review will look at the number of electorates and the number of members per electorate. I have put a submission into that inquiry because I believe that it is important first and foremost that the assembly be able to set its size, as state parliaments can already do. The ACT assembly, now into its third decade, has proved itself the decision-making equal of any other parliament in Australia and I believe ought to be able to set its own size. The workload of ACT parliamentarians is significant indeed. A standard rule for the size of an assembly body, if you look across parliaments around the world, is an assembly size of about the cube root of the population it represents. So, for example, if you take Australia's population-23 million-the cube root of 23 million is 284, not far off the 226 members of the Australian parliament. If you take New South Wales, for example, the population is seven million. The cube root of seven million is 191 and the New South Wales parliament has 135 representatives-in the ballpark of what the cube root rule would lead you to expect. But if you apply that to the ACT's population-375,000-you get an assembly size of 72, four times larger than the current assembly. Put another way, you can ask the question: 'If you had an assembly of 17 people, what population size should it represent?' The answer is about 5,000 people, about the population of Palmerston, one of the suburbs in my electorate. That may sound ridiculous, but if you look to Norfolk Island, for example, it has a ninemember assembly serving 2,000 people; Wreck Bay in my own electorate, with a population of 200, has a community council of nine people. So the ACT assembly is almost uniquely small for the workload that it deals with. Its current 17 MLAs are particularly hard working. I would particularly acknowledge the numerous mobile offices run by Chris Bourke, Mary Porter, Mick Gentleman and Joy Burch; the doorknocking work of Yvette Berry; and the hectic public speaking schedules of Katy Gallagher, Simon Corbell and Andrew Barr. It is tough to be an MLA in the ACT for two reasons. The first is that the number of people they must represent is large. The second is the number of issues are vast, because there is no local council here, unlike, say, the Northern Territory or Tasmania. The work of the assembly ranges from everything from schools to garbage collection. The result of having a 17-member assembly is that government members who are in the ministry can hold between four and six ministries. These are exceptionally high workloads and they are replicated among the shadow ministers. It is also worth pointing out that not only does the assembly represent a very large number of people for its size but that it is also true of federal electorates. My own electorate of Fraser now has 131,698 people on the electoral roll. That is either the largest or the second largest of any of the 150 members in the House of Representatives. At the last federal election the average number of electors per electorate was 94,000. But at current rates of population growth it does not look as though the ACT will receive a third seat in the House of Representatives. That then expands the workload on the ACT's House of Representatives members. We deal with a considerable number of local queries and I believe that the representation of the ACT population would be improved were we to have a larger assembly. The assembly size is for the assembly, but my own view is that increasing the assembly to 25 MLAs-five electorates each returning five members-is the minimum that ought to be considered. That would be still well below the ratio of members per population that other states and territories have. In fact, it would only provide a level of representation comparable to 1989, when the territory first attained self-government. I do think that the territory, were it to go to only 25 members, should do so in conjunction with a commitment to steadily increase the assembly size as the population of the ACT grows. I think that would be appropriate, given the extremely large workload of the assembly. So while I commend my assembly colleagues on their hard work, I do hope that there will be bipartisan support for this. I was very pleased to hear the member for Stirling speaking of the federal coalition's bipartisan support. But I am aware that there are always temptation to play politics with this. I can see the temptation that the ACT Liberals may face, where they decide that they can run some sort of cheap, populist line of saying that they are going to vote against extra politicians. While it might be in their immediate political interest, it would not be in the long-term interests of the ACT, and I do urge them to place those long-term interests first. In closing, I make mention of a great Canberran, CEO of the ACT and Region Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Chris Peters. Chris passed away on 27 February this year. He had a ready smile, a generosity of spirit and a willingness to engage in public debates on matters large and small in the ACT. His commitment to building this great city, I think, will live on beyond him. He is known as a great advocate for business in Canberra, and having great advocates for business-as I know the member for Canberra is and as am I-is so important to ensuring that this diverse city does well in its second century. I commend the bill to the House. Ms BIRD (Cunningham-Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (17:40): It is my pleasure to sum up this debate, and I would like to thank all the members for their contribution. I do feel a bit like the town crier of birthday felicitations as I spoke earlier in the chamber to wish Wollongong headspace a happy fifth birthday and I have great pleasure in summing this bill up and wishing Canberra a happy 100th birthday today, so it is a great day to be speaking in the chamber. I also acknowledge the two speakers before me, the members for Stirling and Fraser, and I am sure in the great tradition of bipartisan reaching across the aisles they will, in a particularly positive manner, resolve the contentious issue of the member for Stirling as an ANU illustrious alumni in his assessment and make the member for Fraser's list in the future. I am sure they will resolve that matter. It is appropriate that the bill be debated in the House today as it is the 100th anniversary of the laying of a foundation stone and the proclamation of the name of Canberra. Earlier today, as the previous speakers outlined, at the front of this building, the Prime Minister and the minister for regional Australia were joined by the Governor General, representatives from all parties, Indigenous elders and a live television audience for a ceremony at Canberra's foundation stone. The leaders of 100 years ago came to Canberra's naming ceremony with the same enthusiasm, pride and optimism for the future that still drives us today. In many ways, the city's development has mirrored the nation's into a confident and vibrant place, nurturing the Australian sense of community and building resilience for the challenges of the future. Canberra is home to the institutions of Australian democracy and to many of the historical and cultural collections that tell our national story. The city should be and is a source of pride for all Australians. Regional Australia Minister, Simon Crean, said that the legacy of Canberra's founders would be strongly felt as it continued into its second century. We have the bill today that reflects on the maturity of this city-state. The purpose of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Amendment Bill 2013 is to amend the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 to grant the ACT Legislative Assembly the power to determine its size. Currently, the process to change the number of members of the assembly requires a resolution to be passed by the assembly and then for regulations to be made by the Commonwealth and agreed to by the assembly. A now mature parliament, self-governing for more than 20 years, should not require the permission of another parliament to adjust itself to meet changing demands over time. The passage of the bill will provide just recognition of the maturity and capacity of the ACT Legislative Assembly demonstrated since it has attained self-government. What the passage of this bill does not represent is a change in the size of the assembly, only the mechanism by which change can occur if desired by the assembly. Nor does the bill represent a panacea to any particular issues that the assembly may face. I am sure all members will agree that it is a fitting act on this historic day, a celebration of the 100 years of the capital, that we support this bill, and I commend it to the House. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Order that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Australian Natural Disasters Debate resumed. first time. I have seen you in the chair, I wish you well and hope that you are enjoying yourself in that illustrious spot. I rise to speak about recent natural disasters, because over the summer I have had three natural disasters occur in the electorate of Wannon: three significant and major bushfires. We started off with a large fire at Drik Drik down between Dartmoor and Nelson. This was a large bushfire which had to be brought under control using fixed-wing aircraft and CFA, DSC and SES crews. It was a major operation and everyone involved did a sensational job, first, to contain this fire in what was a large area. Much of the area where the fire was burning is inaccessible, yet through backburning everyone was able to mount a huge effort to ensure that the fire did not do significant damage. The major damage it did do was to get into a pine plantation where the bill will probably run into millions of dollars, which shows you the significance of being able to bring these types of fires under control quickly. We also had the Chepstowe-Carngham fire occur in the electorate of Wannon. This was a completely different fire. This was in farmland. The fire occurred at a rapid rate of knots. It burnt 1,300 hectares of farmland. Nine houses, sadly, were destroyed and it left farms and native forests charred. It also led, as we have seen once again, to great community spirit. Once",190,Bills
195,Mr Tehan (Wannon) (17:45,"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Windsor. As this is thethe fire was finished, once it was over, the community got together and worked out what they needed to do to help those who were impacted. It was a telling reminder for me as I drove down to fly to Canberra yesterday. As I was driving by in over 30-degree heat in the middle of the day, there were local community members fixing the charred fences which they had removed. There they were on a public holiday Monday putting those fences back together, all volunteering their time to do it for a farmer who had had all the fences destroyed. It is what country communities are all about and it was just very, very humbling to see these people going about their work, chipping in for their local community. The other fire-and this is a more recent fire that we have had in Wannon-is the one which occurred in the Grampians. Again, this was a significant bushfire. It could have caused extensive damage. It very nearly led to houses being burnt to the ground. It very nearly meant that we saw large portions of farmland destroyed. Once again, the CFA, DSE and the SES did a wonderful job in bringing this fire under control. Some of the stories of how they did that are quite remarkable. At some stage the fire was sweeping down hills faster than the fire trucks could go. Usually, CFA members will tell you, fires travel quicker uphill than down hills, but in this case, given the steepness of some the country and the ferocity of the wind, this was not the case and the fire was actually moving at a rapid rate down the hills. This gave a new challenge to those that were fighting it. The fire has been contained and, once again, the use of fixed-wing aircraft was very important in doing this. I must commend everyone involved in making sure that we had air crews to throw at fires as well as ground crews. There is one important point would like to make about all these three fires. This is something that, as lawmakers, we will have to look at seriously. All of these three fires occurred in areas which are mobile black spots-that is, when the fires occurred, community members could not be informed of what was going on quickly by mobile phone and they could not communicate to the outside world what was occurring by mobile phone. One of the great technology uses we now have is the ability for CFA and DSE to alert communities through text to those areas which are potentially being threatened by bushfires. The trouble in these areas was there was no ability to do that because they were in mobile phone black spots. If we are to get serious about warning communities, if we are to get serious about making sure our emergency response services have all the tools available to them then we are going to have to look at mobile phone coverage. This is a real issue. I will just run through some of the areas in my electorate which are mobile phone black spots: Landsborough, Moonambel, Victoria Valley-where the Grampians fire was-Nareen, Tarrayoukyan, Carisbrooke, the outskirts of Marysborough-a town of 9,000 or 10,000 people, Bealiba, Marino, Digby, north of Casterton, Cape Bridgewater, significant areas around Balmoral and Harrow. These are all parts of my electorate which are still lacking proper mobile phone coverage. As we look at this, we are going to have to ask ourselves: if we are going to have a proper emergency response to disasters, is there an obligation for us to look at mobile phone coverage? Is there an obligation for us to make sure that the government contributes to providing mobile phone coverage in areas where the commercial facts mean that the commercial providers will not do this? They will not do it without some sort of government assistance. I think down the track as we see mobile phone coverage spread and the importance of mobile phones not only as a provider of phone coverage but also as a provider of data and a provider of broadband services, we are going to need government to seriously ask these questions. We have a universal service obligation for fixed line telecommunications. Do we now need to look at whether we would want a universal services obligation for the provision of mobile phone coverage? We probably do not have the finances to be able to do this at the moment but this is something that we are going to have to put on the agenda because these communities are missing out on this important technology. When it comes, in particular, to emergency services management, this tool is becoming more and more important. If there is a lesson from my electorate about the three natural disasters which occurred over this summer, it is that we need to look seriously at mobile phone coverage and whether the federal government is doing enough to play its part in warning these communities of the potential of natural disasters. We have to remember it can be a split-second thing which can save property and save lives. If we cannot get the message out to communities that there is the potential for a natural disaster to hit them quickly and rapidly, we put those communities a greater risk of being impacted severely by these natural disasters. I will leave it there. On behalf of all the communities in WannonI would like to place on the record my sincere thanks for the efforts of the CFA, both those who are paid and those who are volunteers, the DSC, the SES, the police and everyone else who was involved in making sure that these fires were contained and eventually put out. I would like to pass on my sincere sadness for those who had their homes burnt, who lost everything in the ChepstoweCarngham fire. For those farmers who have had their livelihoods impacted on I would like to sincerely thank the VFF and the local branches, who organised to have fences repaired and have the damage done to farms fixed so that those farmers could get on, and, hopefully, once we get rain, see their livelihoods get back on an even keel. Natural disasters have occurred across our nation since time immemorial. They are going to continue to occur. But as we advance as a society we have to make sure we use every tool we can to deal with them. Dr STONE (Murray) (17:56): On indulgence, I also would like to make a statement on Australian natural disasters. We have always been the land of drought and flooding rains. If you have lived in Australia for more than a holiday you will understand this. Add fires, cyclones and the very occasional earthquake, and we do have more than our fair share of natural disasters in this country. Fortunately, in the form of our volunteering we also have an enormous spirit in responding to these natural disasters. We do not just expect the government or the defence forces to come to the aid of those who have been inundated or burnt. We pull together as smaller or larger communities and literally help ourselves, with the support sooner or later of those who have a professional capacity to help. I think it is one of the amazing strengths of our Australian society that these very often unsung heroes come out again and again as the disasters occur year after year, as was the case with the floods in Queensland. During those floods people in very high risk areas were inundated for sometimes the third or fourth time. Again and again the same people come out to help them to mop up and start again. In my particular part of Australia, we have a broad set of flat plains. Given our average rainfall of about 15 inches you would not expect that we would be inundated with floods. They have always been a fairly rare event, but over the past two years we have had extraordinary flooding rains. Before our flooding rains, which we have just commemoratednot celebrated, but commemorated-as they occurred one year ago and two years ago almost to the day, in the first weeks of March, we had the worse drought on record, some seven years of heartbreak, when we saw more than 50 per cent of our dairy farms forced to sell their water in order to survive financially. You can imagine that in an area like ours, which is dependent on irrigated agriculture, once you have sold your water you are no longer productive as a dairy farmer enterprise. And of course hanging off our dairy farming are our jobs in food manufacturing, transport and all the other logistical activities that make food manufacturing one of the biggest employers in the country. Drought first of all occurred in my area as a natural disaster. It was a slow insidious drought that sapped the financial, physical and emotional strength of our families. Then, literally within weeks we saw the worse floods on record in those same formerly drought stricken areas. Two years ago almost to the day the floods swept across what we call our northern plains. There was a tsunami of water moving from the south to the north pushing before it the fodder and the fences. There was an extraordinary loss of over $2 billion in both private and public infrastructure and assets. Those people, all in tiny communities-the biggest often had only about 2,000 people, some of which are districts and not towns at all-pulled together, saved lives, saved livestock and helped one another to recover by sharing farm equipment. We had farmers walk their dairy cows for seven hours to someone else's dairy, which had not been flooded. The cows stayed there literally for months while the original dairy could be put back into action. We had some loss of life later on when some tragedies occurred as people tried to clean up. In one very tragic circumstance one man fell into a fire he was making from the debris on his farm fences. But, in the far west of the electorate of Murray, the community's spirit has been extraordinary. I want to reflect on the small town of Bridgewater, which is on the Loddon River. That town was completely inundated, to a depth of over several metres. Their caravan park was washed away and their shops were completely put out of action. You can imagine the distress in the town, given it is a very old, historic place. But I was there just a week ago, and it was like a phoenix risen from the ashes-or, rather, from the mud. That town is now celebrating a new bakery. It has had a huge influx of newcomers, who are going to the bowling club and celebrating the beauty of the town and its recovery from the flood. I have to commend the spirit of that community, who have fought back bravely and strongly. Of course, the Loddon Shire has supported them all the way. Just 12 months ago we had the flood to the east of the electorate, over what we will call the Goulburn and Murray valleys. These floods occurred particularly in the shire of Moira, where 70 per cent of the entire shire area was devastated. It is the home of some of the best fruit and dairy production in Australia, so you can imagine the impact of these floodwaters not just moving across the country but then settling and staying for six and seven months in some places on what was highly productive land. Twelve months after this devastating flood in, for example, the Moira shire, in March 2013, 70 per cent of the repair of roads, bridges and other infrastructure is still not completed. The March 2012 floodwaters destroyed, for example, the Numurkah Hospital. Twelve months on, that hospital has only just moved out of tents into an interim, temporary building. This temporary centre only opened a few months ago. For nearly 12 months this community, of 5,000 people in the town and many hundreds more farm families in the surrounding area, had its community health centre, its hospital, operating out of tents. I am not talking about Bangladesh or Pakistan; this is northern Victoria, only three hours drive from Melbourne. That community was expected to look after its sick, its elderly and its children, using tents, and that is what they did. They need $18.3 million to rebuild their hospital, which was devastated by the floodwaters. I want to commend the chief executive of the hospital, Jacqui Phillips. She has been magnificent. In particular, she has been so patient. We have to do better when we have flood devastated infrastructure as vital as a hospital. That $18. 3 million is, of course, a lot in a state which inherited a lot of Labor debt, but you have to look at priorities sometimes. That town has to have its hospital replaced some time very soon. Floods do not just inundate and destroy; they also cause road closures. Some individuals from Numurkah, Nathalia, Katamatite, Tungamah and other small places simply could not travel to work along the closed roads to centres like Shepparton, Cobram and Yarrawonga for weeks. Often, small businesses could not afford to pay individuals during their absence from work. In some cases individuals were required to use their holiday time. All of the community, well beyond those whose houses or farms were flooded, bore the brunt of this natural disaster. I commend those who were so stoic about this situation, who spent their time when they literally could not get up the road to go to work helping their neighboursmopping out homes, pulling out rotting furniture, trying to make safe animals that were stranded and comforting the very elderly. I want to commend those communities, whose strength was extraordinary. They now have legends which I am sure will be passed on to other generations, about the amazing saves that occurred; the extraordinary metal flood barrier that was built in Nathalia, behind hundreds of thousands of sandbags; and the young children, the SES, the CFA, the Red Cross and other community groups who manned and patrolled that flood wall day after day, daring it to overtop. As I said, tragically the western region of the Murray electorate had its experience of the flood two years before; in the east of the electorate it was one year ago-all following that seven years of the worse drought on record. I want to talk about how we can help in the longer term, because we have a problem with, for example, the flood loans that were offered. These natural disaster loans were made available from the federal government via the Rural Finance Corporation of Victoria, who did their very best. But, if you have already had seven years of drought, obviously your farms and your small businesses have had their equity eroded, they have been going deeper into debt; so, when a government offer loans of up to $200,000 at some 3.2 per cent interest, they are very attractive, but unfortunately they are unavailable to many of the people who wish to borrowthey have had their equity eroded too far. Yet, with a break, these properties could be back being viable dairy farms, orchards or small businesses. SoI think we have to understand a bit more about the context in which loans are offered by the federal government, that we are going to be looking at a community of smallbusiness people and farmers whose equity is going to be very low but whose capacity to fight back, given a break, will be quite substantial-given the demand for food, the quality of their properties, the quality of their soils, the climate, what remains of their infrastructure, and their skills and expertise. In my area there was only $5.78 million lent to some 44 individuals in the shire of Moira, the city of Greater Shepparton and parts of Indigo. While 81 per cent of all the loans that were applied for were approved-54 were processed-and that may sound a good figure, so many of the people who came to my office and looked at the criteria just walked away sadly saying, 'We're not going to be eligible for these loans, given the erosion of our equity', and sadly those farms did need that support very much. I am also very concerned about the exceptional circumstances drought support, which we have had for many years in Australia. It, of course, kept literally thousands of my farmers during the seven years of drought with food on the table. They were not able to make enough for their children to have even basic things like new school uniforms, or to go on school excursions-and they could certainly not take holidays. So the exceptional circumstances support, which gave them the equivalent of the Newstart allowance plus an interest rates subsidy, was an essential part of keeping numbers of our dairy farmers in business so our economies of scale could be maintained, which in turn of course kept our food factories in place, with all of the employment consequences. Once we started to hear of a new regime of exceptional circumstances that Labor is proposing, you can imagine a lot of people sucked in their breath to see what might be proposed. I am not convinced that the new response to natural disasters that has been put on the table is adequate to deal with the situation where we are not looking at how to deal with prospective climate change but at when a natural disaster occurs suddenly. Whether it is fire or flood, and you have a devastating situation with a lot of loss, whether it is livestock, infrastructure or even lives, you do need an emergency response, you do need more than a low-interest loan which you cannot apply for because your equity has been eroded. SoI am asking for this government to understand that there are extraordinary circumstances often in Australia, with low-interest loans not necessarily being the best way to provide support in the longer term. Rather, we need to be looking at how, in my part of the world in particular, we can better build our infrastructure-our rail and roads, which held up the water. The Goulburn-Murray Water Authority's infrastructure had not been built with the capacity to manage these floods. In fact, we know that the floods that occurred just two weeks ago again led to the inundation of the Shepparton East area, where Goulburn-Murray Water Authority channels seem to still be a problem in relation to of local flooding. We have to look at that infrastructure and how it can be better managed or built to withstand flooding, especially when we are told the new legislation related to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is to put another 420 gigalitres down the Murray and Goulburn rivers in my part of the world with the deliberate intention of further flooding. In finishing my remarks about natural disaster, I want to make the point that we are not responding sufficiently in my part of the world to fires. We have just heard from the member for Wannon about the devastating fires in his part of Victoria and we are very sympathetic for the loss that occurred in that Western District and in the beautiful areas around Stawell and Halls Gap and so on. In my part of the world we have not had a history of bushfires because we had a lot of irrigation channels to intercept any fires such as grass fires or overland fires. We do not have that much mountainous country. But just after Christmas we had serious fires in the Violet Town area in the Shire of Strathbogie. The area does have quite inaccessible rough and steep and hilly country. That really drew to the attention of our local fire brigades, volunteers, Red Cross, our professional firefighters and to all of us the fact that you must have access to firefighting helicopters and fixed wing aircraft. They were the key to our being able to fight these fires in this very inaccessible country. The fact that those planes cannot fly after dark is a problem. I do not know how we surmount that. Fires that were being controlled during the daylight hours simply took control again after dark when the planes stopped dumping their loads of water. The other problem with inaccessible country was that with a lot of these farm properties we were trying to send fire trucks in where the farm tracks and the farm creek crossings simply could not take the vehicles. We need to have better information for fighting fires in these areas. That means surveillance between fire seasons and information gathering so that we do not have loss of life or people or their equipment put at jeopardy because no-one quite knows the terrain or where the access tracks, fences, bridges and culverts are. I want to commend the Shire of Strathbogie, the local firefighters and volunteers who fed the firefighters, and the farm owners themselves who did everything they could to protect their own and their neighbours' properties. Fortunately there was no loss of life there. There is a serious problem in Victoria. We have the world's biggest red gum forest in the shape of Barmah Forest which is a high-risk area. It is so fire prone that the local country fire authority refuses to go in there should there be a fire. They argue that there have not been sufficient cold burns. There are no longer cattle grazing in the Barmah Forest so there is nothing to reduce the fire load other than cold burns. These are not being carried out. The tracks into the forest are now overgrown. Trees have fallen on them. If you should send in firefighters on the ground in trucks, their lives would be seriously in jeopardy. That is why local firefighting brigades say that, until the state does the job and cleans up the forest and makes sure that there are proper fire access tracks, they are not going to risk the lives of their members. Even more than that, we have a stupid situation where South Australia and New South Wales have a ban on any fires being lit in public areas, outdoors, state parks and state forests between the months of December and March through the fire summer season. Victoria, which has even more at risk country-especially along the Murray River-only has regulations which say that you cannot light a fire in the open on a total fire ban day. On any day in December, January or February which is not a fire ban day you can light a fire outside, with certain restrictions about the size of that fire. We had 10 unattended fires that our rangers had to put out at Ulupna Island on the Murray River this summer. Those rangers are very concerned that each one of those fires could have spread and burned Australia's biggest red gum forest, enormous numbers of wildlife-particularly a very vulnerable koala community. Yet we have this discrepancy between the regulations governing fire lit in the outdoors between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. I am calling again on the Victorian government to consider bringing its fire regulations into line with the two other states which border it so that we can have a better chance of controlling outdoor fires during this fire-prone period which occurs in Australia every summer. I am pleased to make a statement about natural disasters in Australia. Clearly we depend on our volunteers in this country, and they are magnificent. We have seen sad loss of life through our fires in the past in Victoria; we have seen extraordinary loss of assets through flooding, in particular in my part of the northern plains of Victoria; we have also had drought, which has decimated families and left them so in debt that they struggle still to survive; and we have had fires-very happily, with this most recent fire, without loss of life, but I recall the Strathbogie fires of 1989-90, when there was loss of life. I thank the chamber. motion on the national disasters over the past few months. I wish to offer my sincere thanks and admiration to the people of Australia who have been affected by these natural disasters, but also those that have not and have made a wonderful effort to help those in need. It is interesting to have listened to the member for Murray's contribution, and it reminds me of the words of Dorothea Mackellar's poem My Country. It goes, in part: I love a sunburnt country, A land of sweeping plains, Of ragged mountain ranges, Of droughts and flooding rains. I think, given the events of the past two or three months, that is very relevant. It is certainly a country that has had many extremes: from the bushfires in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia to the drenching rains, the wild winds and the severe flooding unleashed on the eastern seaboard-not just once, but several times. Australians have definitely dealt with a range of natural challenges which have tested our resilience and resolve. For some people, the clean-up is a harsh reality, especially for those still rebuilding their lives following similar events in 2011. Once again, they have experienced the treacheries and trials of natural disasters and they have only recently been able to come up for air from the devastation that occurred previously. Many that we have spoken to have not yet even managed to complete renovations, repairs, replacements or relocations. They have yet again had to deal with the unpredictability of torrential summer rains. Following these recent events, particularly around Bundaberg and the Fraser Coast, people have still not been able to re-enter their homes or even to salvage what they can of their lifelong possessions. This in itself, I am assured, is most devastating. We were fortunate once again in my electorate. Whilst there were widespread outages for our electricity et cetera, by and large we were spared the devastation of further up the coast and in the Logan, Albert and Coomera rivers. At last count, there were only some 15 houses that were inundated-some partially but some substantially-and the people in those places have lost almost all of their goods and possessions. But through all of these fires, storms and floods, it is always heartening to watch that spirit of mateship-an unwritten Aussie code of conduct-that emanates across the country; whether it is Victorians heading to Tasmania or Tasmanians flying to Queensland to help out one disaster after another and to repay the favour of lending a hand to a mate when he is in dire straits. After recent floods in my electorate of Forde, which were some three inches or so below the 1991 flood-which was the last major flood that we had-I visited the Logan River Tree Farm, where they had at least 1½ metres of floodwaters through their mature tree nursery. When I visited, Ailsa Thompson and her staff were working frantically hand washing the leaves and stems of hundreds of trees with the few hoses they had. They were desperately trying to save seven years of hard work, which included the recovery from the 2011 floods. My thanks go to the local council and the local fire station. After we contacted them and made them aware of the situation, they were able to make available a number of high-pressure",195,Statements On Indulgence
196,Mr Van Manen (Forde) (18:15,"I too rise to join everyone else that has spoken on thiswater appliances to help make the job easier, particularly given that the trees were reasonably mature and on large concrete pads. Their main work was to clean the mud off those concrete pads to make access to the trees easier. My thanks also go to local councillor Jennie Breen for her effort in putting together a working bee, which was very well received by a number of people in our community, but there remains much work to be done. As I said earlier, some 14 properties were affected by the floods and, in many cases, houses were also left without power for up to five days. One major piece of infrastructure that, fortunately, on this occasion was not damaged beyond repair-although it was significantly damaged in 2011-was the John Muntz Causeway at Upper Coomera. Fortunately, we have been able to reopen that piece of road, but it is operating on only one lane, as it has been since 2011. Thankfully, the federal government, out of the natural disaster relief funding, is contributing along with the state government to the replacement of that causeway. The result will be significantly better than what is currently there. I remember the 1974 floods at my home in Waterford. It was interesting to see the current floods and note how much bigger the 1974 floods were than those we had recently. Thankfully, this year's flood level stayed well below the '74 levels; otherwise there would have been far more devastation. I saw a house that, on this occasion, had a small amount of water go through it, but I remember the effort involved in cleaning that up in 1974, when it was under about three metres of water that covered the roof. I would like to commend the local councils, both the Gold Coast City Council and the Logan City Council, on the work that they did in trying to notify residents in at-risk areas. Also, as the water receded, they returned to each of these homes to assess the flood impact and offer clean-up assistance to affected homes. As with any of these things, some people were missed along the way, but this has been a great experience for the council to try to improve its processes. My thanks go to the SES, the local state MPs, the councillors and community groups, who were all out in force assisting affected people. I would also like to thank everybody on the Gold Coast weather website, which continued to put up information for people on what was happening around the neighbourhood, and also the people who started the Logan region weather and information page on Facebook. These same people also started a drop-in centre at Park Ridge for people who needed assistance. When people in the community are working together to help provide information to everyone else in the community and let them know what is happening locally, it makes dealing with these events so much easier for everybody involved. The damage that has occurred during these natural disasters around the country has been phenomenal. Our thoughts go out to those people who have lost income, livelihoods and valuables, not only in my electorate but around the country. We thank the federal government for its support of those people in difficult times and also the various state governments, because they have their own disaster relief arrangements as well. For those in my electorate of Forde, whilst Logan and the Gold Coast were not declared natural disaster areas for individuals, we have written to the Attorney-General on behalf of people and businesses affected for consideration on an individual basis. We do thank the government for the fact that a number of those people have already been assisted. We must not to forget them just because we are a month or two down the track. These people will take a long time to recover from what they have been through. I encourage people to continue to get behind those who have been through these disasters and assist them in rebuilding their lives. sitting here a while ago listening to my colleague speak, it struck me that it does not really matter what religion or god you believe in-if you are a farmer, you very definitely believe in Mother Nature. Just lately she has been a very, very tough lady. She can be absolutely wonderful, but just listening I realised that in the last month or so we have had fire, flood and drought all at the same time in our country. As the member for O'Connor will no doubt tell us shortly, we did have and still have very serious drought in WA. In western New South Wales, if you have not had the recent rain, you are still going into it. We have the repetition of floods in central and south-eastern Queensland and south-western Queensland. At the same time we have had fires in northern New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania, as we just heard the member for Murray talking about. They are all horrible and they all have an incredible effect. Strangely enough, the greatest stock losses, and probably the greatest loss of human life, is not normally due to fire, except where you get an incredibly quick one-which you would expect-or to drought, although it can be if it goes on long enough; normally it is flooding that seems to take the most in human life and in stock, I guess because we do not take it as seriously as fire. But, by heaven, in recent years it has caused an enormous loss of life in Queensland and enormous losses in terms of our animals. On the Friday and Saturday just after the worse of the flooding had subsided in Bundaberg and up in that area, in North Burnett, Banana and Gladstone, I was up there with my leader, Warren Truss, Paul Neville and Kenny O'Dowd, the member for Flynn. In Bundaberg it was quite something. It was a record flood; it was beyond anything ever seen. Two years before it had gone up to just under eight metres. This time it went over nine. It was just an amazing thing. That last metre of water is one heck of a lot of water. When you think how flat it is there, you are talking an unbelievable amount of water. There were something like 2,500 homes inundated, and, if it had not been for the helicopters, undoubtedly people would have been in a lot more trouble than they were. The same thing occurred two or three years before up in central Queensland, and of course a couple of years before, almost to the day, down in the Lockyer Valley. You do not expect Mother Nature to be quite so severe so at times close together in pretty much the same places. I saw things with dairy through North Burnett and areas up there, where people, for three, four and five days, were unable to milk their cows. For anyone who understands dairies at all-and obviously a lot do not-they are not going to milk again after going out for that time. They go dry and get incredible complications. One family that we saw there were just at the end of their tether. It was a father and son, and they had an electrician there. He could hook the power up, but they could not make anything work because most of the motors were still under water. They had to hand milk something like 400 cows just to try to relieve them, and that does not work that well-not with today's number of people to do it. That was a family I really worried about, but they were not the only ones. There were others that had gone for days without milking-others had gone five. One bloke had pigs for 30 or 40 kilometres around. He would get a phone call to say, 'There's a couple of pigs wandering around here-are they yours?' At least they were alive; a lot were not. There were",202,Statements On Indulgence
197,Mr John Cobb (Calare) (18:25,"I rise to speak on the natural disasters. As I waspermanent plantings in orchards where there was just nothing there. I am talking about serious citrus trees, and it looked like a desert. It was pretty horrendous stuff. I think that everyone had to be commended for hooking into it; governments-local, state and federal. I think that, by and large, people did what they could and did the right thing. It got to the point where, particularly up there around north Burnett and further up, they could not even ring. It was mobile country-the standing lines were down. But after a couple of days the mobile towers do not work because their batteries go flat. Embarrassing as it might have been for Telstra, that was the case for quite some time. Sometimes there is only so much that people can take. At least Emerald, Theodore and those that have been belted twice in a couple of years were spared this time, but Bundaberg and the horticulture there-not to mention the domestic side within the town-certainly had Mother Nature give them some hurry-up over those two or three years. As I said, the fisheries were totally wiped out two years before; cattle had ended up on North Keppel Island that time, and it is away out on the Great Barrier Reef. Certainly, once again beef cattle, as well as dairy cattle, have been scattered across the countryside. There were people who were missing a thousand cattle. At times like this you wonder why we farmers do it. We deal with flood, fire and drought and, as I said, this particular time it was all happening in our country at the same time. In my part of the world-I grew up in an area in the Cobar shire-through the fifties, sixties, seventies, eighties and into the nineties we had serious fires every 10 years. My electorate, Calare, was pretty lucky with the fires. It did have some small ones, but nothing like in the north of the state and certainly nothing like in Victoria and Tasmania-thank heaven! We had flood last year-Forbes was cut into three-but, once again, not like the sorts of floods that South-East and west Queensland had over the last few years. One would think that that part of the world at least is going to be spared a repetition of it in the near future; these things do seem to even out. But I think we have to take our hats off to the people who have marched through it. As I said earlier, I think that by and large the right thing has been done by the various levels of government. Certainly, when called upon the armed forces did their job as professionally and competently as they always do when asked to do it. Wherever it happensnot just agriculturally, but in all ways-I think we have to admire the people who shrug and get on with it and who say, 'Next time we'll be luckier.' speech and those mentioned today by members in this place have also been affecting Western Australians, particularly in my electorate of O'Connor, where we lost a volunteer firefighter in the Two Peoples Bay bushfire west of Albany last October. Wendy Bearfoot suffered horrific burns to more than 60 per cent of her body when her truck was engulfed by flames caused by a freak wind change and, sadly, she passed away as a result of injuries. 25-year-old Charlene Hordyk was also badly injured with burns to 20 per cent of her body along with five other fellow firefighters. I take this opportunity to acknowledge the bravery of these Australians who are risking their lives to help protect other people's lives and property. I would also like to offer my sincere condolences to Mrs Bearfoot's family including her husband of 30 years and her three",204,Statements On Indulgence
198,Mr Crook (O'connor) (18:34,"Natural disasters like those in the Prime Minister'schildren. To Charlene and the other injured firefighters I wish them a very speedy recovery and thank them for the outstanding contribution they have made to our community. The Two Peoples Bay fire was only one of several bushfires around my electorate, with other major fires in Esperance on the South Coast, Bremer Bay on the mid-South Coast and Northcliffe last month. In all of the stories that members have contributed to this discussion there is a common theme and that is the remarkable work of emergency services personnel and the thousands of volunteers who support them. Bushfires are not the only disasters to hit the O'Connor electorate, although they are the dramatic events that catch our attention most vividly and that demand our vigilance. Freak weather events are becoming more common across this vast electorate such as the storm that devastated the small community of Dudinin in the central wheat belt. While the east coast of Australia has been hit by similarly dramatic flood and fire, Western Australians and particularly Western Australian farmers have been suffering the much slower and less striking effects of drought and other unpredictable weather patterns. I have been contacted by many of these farmers who are currently in dire straits. They have said that this season has been particularly difficult. In some parts of the state it is the culmination of five dry years in a row. Others are experiencing unseasonal rainfall patterns and freak storm events. WA farmers are under some of the most difficult agricultural conditions in the world, which appear to be getting more difficult with changing weather and increasing incidences of natural disaster. As with all disasters there is one critical factor that enables us as individuals and as communities to prepare in advance, to manage the event while we experience it and to react to a worse-case scenario when it happens. That critical factor is information. Information is the key to working together in difficult situations. Information is the tool that allows us to assess past disasters and to plan for future disasters. The availability of information is a service we rely upon in the modern world to keep in touch with our loved ones, to make sure that they are all right and to check whether they need our help. Information is critical for emergency services responding to big disaster events. It is also critical for farmers and communities struggling to cope with a series of lesser, progressive events that combine to create a disaster for their lives and livelihoods. Information is important for local governments, for health services including the Royal Flying Doctor Service, for the main roads, for industry, for tourists and travellers, and for people in their homes when these disasters strike. However information is the one thing that the firefighters at Two Peoples Bay were working without. On 12 October 2012 Wendy Bearfoot and her colleagues were working in an area with limited radio network coverage and no mobile phone reception. There was little or no means of conveying critical information about changing conditions. There was little or no means of calling for help. In a dangerous situation where rapidly changing weather can make the difference between life and death, how can this be an acceptable set of circumstances for our emergency services to operating under? Yet this is the exact situation in many regional areas. In the Great Southern region around Albany, the local Chief Bushfire Control Officer, Mr Ross Fenwick, has been working with state member of the Legislative Council Mr Colin Holt to identify nine bushfire brigade sheds that receive no mobile phone coverage whatsoever and a further seven that can only access a signal via connection to an external antenna. These are the volunteer bushfire brigades that thousands of people are relying upon to protect them, their property and their livestock against bushfire events that are a serious threat, not just an outside possibility. Again, it is not just the bushfire scenario we need to consider when we talk about the lack of critical information. The Bureau of Meteorology has recently decommissioned the Eucla weather radar on the Western Australian and South Australian border. I understand that the radio was old and that it was going to be costly to replace it, so it has been switched off. This is a service that provides critical weather information to emergency services, to the flying doctors, to the main roads, to the pastoralists and to the local and travelling community. It is a service that is seriously lacking in other parts of O'Connor as well, denying people the information they need to protect themselves and to defend themselves against weather events that can devastate their lives immediately in freak events or slowly over seasons and years. My electorate offices have been approached time and time again by farmers crying out for government support. They tell me they need more information-critical weather information. They need to know when and where rain is falling so they can farm productively because, while the effects are not so obvious and not so immediately dramatic, drought is a natural disaster like flood and like fire. It has the power to take away people's lives and livelihoods. These farmers need to know what has happened in previous years so they can prepare for what seasons might look like in the years to come. They need weather radar so they can prepare for and respond to changing conditions so that those conditions do not become a disaster. I understand that at least two weather radars are necessary, one in the wheat belt and one in the south-west. This is in addition to the existing weather services, which need to be protected and replaced when necessary. But what I am hearing is that the weather radar is being decommissioned, and it is not only Eucla that is getting the chop. I understand that the Bureau of Meteorology has undertaken a review recommending the enclosing of aerodrome forecasting equipment at 78 regional aerodromes around the country. This equipment, like the Eucla radar, is old and needs upgrading. I understand that the costs of upgrading these services is somewhere near $7 million. WhatI want to ask is: what is the cost of not upgrading this equipment? What is the cost of switching off these services and taking away this source of vital weather information for remote and regional areas? What is the cost to these communities that can no longer rely on the Royal Flying Doctor Service, because the flying doctor does not have the information required to get in and out of a particular aerodrome safely? What is the cost to the communities when the viability of their aerodrome services is questioned by operators that cannot afford the extra costs of contingency fuel supplies to make it into the next aerodrome in case the weather is found to be inclement upon arrival? And what is the cost of further isolation from emergency services, from essential services and from help? The cost is similar to that experienced by communities whose fire brigades cannot communicate effectively. It is a drastic and dangerous cost. I implore members of this House to think more broadly about natural disasters, not just about how we help people to clean up and support them with crisis response initiatives and not just about how to assist communities struck by dramatic events. These communities are very worthy, and they must receive our help. But I implore the government and future governments to help and support the people on the ground who are preparing for, managing against and battling with the effects of all sorts of natural disasters, big and small, on a daily basis. In Western Australia this means that people in regional areas in O'Connor and across rural Western Australia must be provided with more information-equip them with the tools they require, arm them with the information they rely upon, provide them with critical information services and information communication services so that when things do go wrong they have the very best chances to survive and to carry on battling in the years to come. These people need mobile phone towers. They need weather radar and weather stations. They need to know that they will have the information they need when they need it. And they need to know now that the government takes the natural disasters they are experiencing seriously and will help them to protect themselves. In 2013 in Australia, one of the most advanced, prosperous and privileged nations in the world, how can we justify denying a significant proportion of our population this kind of information? It is information that is so much more critical to those people living in remote and isolated communities amongst harsh and dangerous environments and far from major service provision centres. This information is taken for granted by the rest of the population and by populations across other developed nations. It is time that we brought our regional Australians up to date and provided them with these basic services. Australians in the regions need information and services for communication for their survival. There is a huge anomaly in talking about supporting people in the face of weather driven natural disasters when we are taking away weather monitoring data services. There is a huge contradiction in providing services for emergency situations if those services cannot communicate effectively when the disaster strikes. The bottom line is always going to be very important, but in this instance the bottom line must not cost lives. Murdoch, Dame Elisabeth Joy, AC, DBE Debate resumed. was a particularly sad and poignant day for the Dunkley community. Dame Elisabeth was a local resident and had inculcated herself into so much of the life of the local community. We knew her as a neighbour, as a friend, as a patron to many organisations and as an inspiration to many local people. There was a wonderful tribute paid to her not just as a one-way gesture but as a statement of mutual support in the establishment of the Elisabeth Murdoch Secondary College, which is located in Langwarrin not far from her home. They have benefitted from the guidance and wisdom of Dame Elisabeth and from the example that she set for and the encouragement that she gave to the students. She had a genuine commitment to the success and vitality of that school community. In return, the school community has honoured her for many years and they were particularly saddened by her passing. That day, 6 December 2012, was a day when we lost a great national identity, a remarkable woman who fostered optimism and new possibilities. She was also an incredibly generous spirit and highly respected among the local community. Even in recent weeks, Cruden Farm, that delightful home that Dame Elisabeth raised a remarkable family in for generations, has still hosted community organisations, celebrations, events and fundraising for community groups who might not otherwise be able to access an opportunity to use such a splendid and special place. It is in reach of so many.",205,Statements On Indulgence
199,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (18:45,"The passing of Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, AC, DBE,I want to also remark on the very particular sadness that her dedicated staff felt upon Dame Elisabeth's passing. I have known a number of them over many years. They are widely recognised, particularly the gardening team under the leadership of her gardener, a fellow green thumb and gardening traveller who has been so much a part of Dame Elisabeth's expression of commitment to Cruden Farm and the majesty of that property. I cannot imagine the loss that they must have felt. I have spoken with a number, including at the funeral. They have a very raw and real sense of grief at the passing of someone who so much a part of their lives as they were a part of Dame Elisabeth's life. Her life was one lived with purpose and passion. She was not wishy-washy on many views. She had strongly held views, but arrived at those views after careful consideration. She was devoted to her family and very dedicated to the many medical, artistic and community endeavours that benefited from her drive and generosity. Much will be written about Dame Elisabeth's invaluable contribution to and support for national significant cultural, scientific and medical organisations. But she had a profound impact on the course of the lives of many who her work touched. Beyond the Elisabeth Murdoch Secondary College, perhaps you and others might be aware of the world-class McClelland Gallery, a sculpture facility of high quality dedicated to sculpture on a property that spans many hectares, including bushland areas of high environmental significance punctuated by remarkable works of sculpture. Dame Elisabeth was a benefactor of and an inspiration for that gallery for many years. It will also be a lasting tribute to her passion, her support, her personal encouragement and her engagement with local artists and community organisations-but one example of the very meaningful and lasting legacy she leaves our community. I mentioned Cruden Farm. Dame Elisabeth was a very willing and keenly engaged host, opening her family home and the remarkable gardens to so many. It brought great joy and delight to countless worthwhile causes. Everyone loved exploring that garden. Who would have thought that in the outer suburban areas around Frankston would be-as I used to say to Dame Elisabeth-the Langwarrin botanical gardens? It was actually her family property. She planned and nurtured that garden over decades, over generations, with such thoughtfulness. She was extraordinarily proud of that property. As I said, her partners in the remarkable endeavour, the gardening team, were so devoted and so committed. That garden caused me to learn a bit more at Dame Elisabeth's urging. I was fortunate to be, from time to time, invited as a guest. We would sit and talk over lunch about some of the challenges, the pressing issues, of the world, and occasionally we would talk about the goings-on within her family. They were lovely luncheons. On one occasion she asked whether I could be of assistance to her. I was always keen to support her work as she in turn supported the work of so many in our community. She was passing off one of her patron roles because as her life progressed her remarkable energy was maintained, but the spread of hours over which it was applied had to be curtailed, at the advice of those who cared for her. I am sure my friend and colleague might be aware of some of the gardening varieties that are collected. She asked me whether I would be happy to be a patron of one of the floral societies down our way. Mr Frydenberg: That is very you, Bruce. out my obvious deficiencies in this area. Mr Frydenberg interjectingdiscussion. Dame Elisabeth said, 'Bruce, what do you know about orchids?' I said, 'Dame Elisabeth, what I know about orchids you could write in crayon on the back of a stamp.' She said, 'Perfect; you will enjoy much in learning about orchids.' I said, 'I do have the odd orchid or two.' She said, 'I would be really grateful if you would relieve me of the responsibility of being patron of the Mornington Peninsula Orchid Society.' I said, 'Obviously the criteria has been relaxed significantly, to go from your good self to me, but if I can help out I would be happy to.' I learnt so much about orchids. I did my research. I was happy to present prizes at the annual show. Mr Frydenberg interjectingdiscovered in any given year. I remember vividly her encouragement to be the patron and to present the prizes at the annual show. I brought along my own creation one year-that was my then newly-born daughter, who gained a sash as best of breed at the show. She was not quite an orchid variety but she carried the gene pool of my sweetheart, Kate. They were some of the wonderful memories that I have of a remarkable woman. Her extended family I have, through public service, been pleased to count as acquaintances over many years. Our thoughts will continue to be with Dame Elisabeth and with her extended and extensive family. When I was shown some of the family photographs of the Christmas gathering I was not sure it was not the crowd at the Dolphins footy finals, but, no, it was the children and the cousins. It was quite a turnout but a time of great joy for Dame Elisabeth. She has an extraordinary network of beneficiaries from a life of selfless service and generous community engagement. The support of her family, her personal staff and a network of confidants has enabled Dame Elisabeth to achieve so much and to touch the lives of so many. I miss her. I miss her insights and that sparkle in her eye that I will always remember. Her passing will leave a massive hole in our local community, as a friend and as a neighbour, as a contributor and as a remarkable individual who lived as an enduring example of a long and purposeful life splendidly lived. The community that I represent in the greater Frankston-Dunkley area will forever remember Dame Elisabeth for her caring nature, her warmth, her kindness, her generosity, her integrity. We were thrilled that she was a neighbour and a friend-an inspiration. We have been blessed that she has been part of our community. passing of Dame Elisabeth Murdoch, but also recognition of a life well lived, a life lived to the full and a life that achieved so much not only for the local community but also for the community of Victoria and for the people of Australia. Her family can be rightly proud. Although from humble beginnings, she really made the most of the opportunities that she had. Like the member for Dunkley, I share the distinction of having been a local member for the Langwarrin area, albeit for a shorter time than him-just one term. I have to admit that in that time. I did not meet Dame Elisabeth. I am also confident that she never voted for me, so I",208,Statements On Indulgence

203,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (18:55,"I join the member for Dunkley in expressing sadness at thestand here to acknowledge someone of views politically different to mine but whose absolute commitment to her community was extremely well known. I also grew up as a Frankston boy and lived in Karingal, not far down the road from Langwarrin and Cruden Farm. Even as a young man, I knew it was a famous place. The member for Dunkley mentioned the situation about the McClelland Gallery, which was just up the road from where I lived at that time, and it is also a great reminder of and a tribute to Dame Elisabeth and her commitment to the local area. As a local member, I often drove at that time and since past Cruden Farm and realised I was passing a place of special significance not only to the local community but also to Australia. When you try to encapsulate a life such as this, it is basically all words and is hard to do it justice. Sometimes, to try to do that you fall flat-I certainly know that I will-but I would like to pick a few things that have been said by others, and some things that were said by Dame Elisabeth herself, that say so much about the nature of the lady-and she was a ladyand the nature of the mark that she left on the community of which she was part. One story that I found fascinating was that in the time after 1975 there was an active discussion at cabinet level about Dame Elisabeth possibly becoming Australia's Governor General. I quote from an article: Years later, when told of these cabinet discussions, Dame Elisabeth reacted indignantly. ""I am astounded. How could anyone even suggest I should be governor-general of Australia?"" she said, completely rejecting the widely held view that she would have been a splendid choice at such a crucial time in Australia's history. Dame Elisabeth's final say on the matter was: ""I'm ashamed when they invite me to be included in Who's Who and ask me to write down my academic degrees and qualifications and I can write down nothing except home duties. Never in a million years would I have said yes to any suggestion that I become governor-general."" I stand here today and say I wish she had said yes, although I know that at the time the Governor General who was appointed served in that role with great distinction, as have, frankly, those who have followed on since then. But it says much about the lady herself that her response was that she was not worthy. Yet she filled her life with so many worthy acts and so many worthy ideals. For example, and I quote: For 33 years she was a member of the committee of the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne-and president for the last 12 years before her retirement. The driving force behind the site and construction of the great new hospital in beautiful Royal Park, Dame Elisabeth even took on Victoria's legendary premier Henry Bolte-and won-when he was urging a less favourable site. Then there were her years as trustee of Victoria's National Gallery, her support for the Victorian Tapestry Workshop and her hidden life as one of Australia's most generous philanthropists, helping people and organisations with millions of dollars distributed through the Elisabeth Murdoch Trust. Young artists and musicians were given the chance to study overseas because of her generosity, which also spread to support for talented prison artists serving long sentences. Dame Elisabeth was also a founder of Melbourne's Murdoch Children's Research Institute; the first woman appointed to the Council of Trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria, as I mentioned; and President of the Royal Children's Hospital from 1954 to 1965. The CEO of the Royal Children's Hospital, Christine Kilpatrick, said Dame Elisabeth was the driving force behind the establishment of the Royal Children's Hospital at the Royal Park site in the sixties and was a passionate supporter of the hospital's work. Murdoch Children's Research Institute Chairman, Leigh Clifford AO, said Dame Elisabeth's vision and commitment had saved thousands of children's lives and improved the health of many who are living with rare and common childhood conditions. The member for Dunkley mentioned the McClelland Gallery. Robert Lindsay, Director of the McClelland Gallery Sculpture Park in Langwarrin, said Dame Elisabeth was committed to the gallery for more than four decades. He said: She had the vision, energy and passion for this gallery as well as helped with financial support. She was an incredible person, who led by example. If she decided something was important, she would go ahead and do it. Dame Elisabeth was patron of more than 100 charities and continuously supported local causes and individuals on the peninsula. Tim Harper, Principal of Elisabeth Murdoch College in Langwarrin, paid tribute to Dame Elisabeth and her incredible generosity of spirit: I consider myself very fortunate to have had multiple opportunities to meet with Dame Elisabeth. She was always friendly and open and a tremendous person. Words can't describe how generous and community minded she was. Mr Harper said he always felt inspired when walking away from a conversation with her. So we hear, from those comments, those involvements, those commitments and those ideals, that this was a lady who had much to be proud of, who was at the same time was selfeffacing and modest but also a person of strongly held views. She was someone who could be very proud of what she achieved in her time on this earth. It was a long time, but she had a good time, and the things that she did will live on long after her passing. Her family should be proud, as are all Australians, of someone who lived her life in a way that was of great credit to herself and her family and also those around her. House in paying tribute to Dame Elisabeth Murdoch. Dame Elisabeth lived a long and fruitful life. Her passing on 5 December 2012, aged 103, was marked by a chorus of admiration that came from all corners of society, community organisations that were beneficiaries of her philanthropy, business and political leaders who were in awe of her courage and constancy and of course her 77 living, direct descendants, including five great-great-grandchildren, that were touched by her love and affection. All came to know and respect this remarkable woman. Despite being born to a different time, when Australia was a different place, Dame Elisabeth's values and purpose never lost their relevance and appeal. She would say, 'It is personal relationships that bring happiness, not money,' and, 'Always think of other people before yourself.' And help others she did. Supporting more than 100 charities, in particular the Royal Children's Hospital and the children's research institute that bears her family name, Dame Elisabeth gave much more than financial support to her chosen causes. She gave her time and her ideas, often helping to drive new projects and build broader support. She was the first woman on the Council of Trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria, a founding member of the Deafness Foundation of Victoria, a founding member of the Victorian Tapestry Workshop, on the Patrons Council of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria-and the list goes on. So many organisations were beneficiaries of her involvement.",210,Statements On Indulgence
204,Mr Frydenberg (Kooyong) (19:02,"I join with my colleagues on both sides of thisAcknowledging Dame Elisabeth's significant contribution to society, the Queen made Elisabeth a Dame Commander of the British Empire in 1963. Dame Elisabeth was later awarded a Companion of the Order of Australia, in 1989, and in 2005 she was named Victorian of the Year. But it is often the case that great people who live great lives do not always have an easy run. Dame Elisabeth is no exception. After what was described as a fairy-tale romance, the marriage of Dame Elisabeth and Sir Keith came to an end after 24 years, following the untimely death of Sir Keith in 1952. Dame Elisabeth also experienced the tragic loss of her daughter Helen Handbury due to cancer in 2004. But Dame Elisabeth nevertheless continued on, hardly resting from her charitable efforts, and travelling down to Melbourne often, from the family property at Cruden Farm. I remember countless charity functions where Dame Elisabeth would be welcomed as a special guest, only to find later during the auction that you could bid for an afternoon spent with friends having tea at Cruden Farm. I do not know how many times Dame Elisabeth hosted guests at Cruden Farm following a charitable auction, but I am sure there would be just too many to count. In a fascinating exchange in 2008, Andrew Denton interviewed Dame Elisabeth and asked her, if Keith was to return now, what he would think of her and what she has achieved in her life. 'Oh,' she said, 'I think he'd be very proud. I haven't wasted a minute. I've made use of all that time-and, I think, good use of it. That's what I hope one would think.' And so she has. A remarkable life. A remarkable lady. My condolences go to all of Dame Elisabeth's family-in particular her children Rupert, Anne and Janet, and Janet's husband John Calvert-Jones. To Lachlan and Sarah Murdoch, whom I have come know, and the Calvert-Joneses, who are good friends, I join with you at this sad time. Australians can be proud that Dame Elisabeth was one of their own. There are few people in the world who can match her record of philanthropy and good deeds over such an extended period of time. May she rest in peace. Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (19:07): I rise today to speak about a great Australian: Dame Elisabeth Murdoch. There are no words that can adequately portray the contribution Dame Elisabeth made to the community and Australia as a whole. She was an inspiration for thousands of people around this nation, and she was an inspiration to me. I had the very great pleasure of meeting Dame Elisabeth on a number of occasions. I enjoyed sitting next to her at dinner, which guaranteed a lively conversation. Dame Elisabeth was known not only for her sharp wit and curious mind, but for her ability to converse with people from all walks of life. On her conversational skills, she was once famously asked, 'What is the art to holding a conversation over a dinner table, to engage in someone?' She responded, 'Ask the man what he does. That's my opening. I am never stuck for a question. If you ask your next-door neighbour what he does it flows out. You can't stop him.' It is good advice, and having tested it I can say that it is accurate. One hundred and four years ago, Dame Elisabeth was born in Melbourne and educated at St Catherine's School, in my electorate of Higgins, followed by Clyde School in Woodend. Dame Elisabeth had deep roots within the Melbourne community. At an early age Dame Elisabeth displayed a strong commitment to charity, for which she is so well-known. She volunteered for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and, as a school girl, knitted a record number of baby garments for the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne. This last activity earned her a tour of the hospital, which confirmed to her that her life would be one of service. This passion for helping others drove her life's work. But it was not her only passion. At the age of 19 she was courted by, and then married, one of Australia's leading publishers, Sir Keith Murdoch. They had four children: Rupert, Janet, Anne and Helen. In 1952 Dame Elisabeth assumed the role of matriarch, when her husband passed away from cancer at the age of 67. Dame Elisabeth served as President of the Royal Children's Hospital Management Committee from 1954 to 1965 where she was the driving force behind fundraising events and donations. She was recognised for her work in 1963 when she was appointed Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire. This association with the Royal Children's Hospital is one, of course, that is a close connection and one that so many Australians and particularly Victorians really, really admire her for and have received much benefit from. I have a very good friend who is currently receiving excellent care with her newborn baby at the Royal Children's Hospital. It is a very stressful time and I know that without the great care and skill of the people at the Royal Children's Hospital it would be a very, very traumatic time for her. So we admire Dame Elisabeth for the great work that she did there. In 1968 Dame Elisabeth became the first woman on the Council of Trustees of the National Gallery of Victoria. She held the position for eight years. In the same year she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws by the University of Melbourne in acknowledgement of her contributions to research, the arts and philanthropy. Trinity College installed her as a Fellow in November 2000. In 1976 she co-founded the Victorian Tapestry Workshop and served as its chairman from 1986 to 1988. In 1984 she helped found the Murdoch Institute known today as the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, another very well-known and well-regarded institute. She was an honorary Fellow of the Australian Institute of Landscape Architecture and she funded the Elisabeth Murdoch Chair of Landscape Architecture and the Australian Garden History Society. In an interview later in her life, she was asked why she dedicated her life's work to helping others. Her response was 'as a sort of thanksgiving'. Humble to the very end, Dame Elisabeth understood and respected the life that she was handed and, in turn, gave back to those less fortunate. Graceful and elegant, Dame Elisabeth was someone we could all look up to as an example of the human spirit at its most gracious and compassionate. Dame Elisabeth leaves a wonderful legacy. While she may have 77 direct descendants, her life has enriched millions more, and we thank her for that.

205,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (19:12,"I rise today to place on record my condolences to theAC DBE. Born five years before the start of World War I, Dame Elisabeth grew up in Toorak, the youngest of three daughters of Rupert and Marie Greene. At 18 years of age, Dame Elisabeth met the influential journalist and media proprietor Keith Murdoch at a Red Cross dance in Melbourne. Keith had actually arranged their introduction upon glimpsing her photograph in his Table Talk magazine. Keith was 42 and their age difference set society tongues wagging. But they were married in a matter of months. They went on to have four children. Even though she was widowed only 23 years later, Dame Elisabeth always identified her loving marriage as the foundation of her long life. 'Happiness gives great strength,' she said. A simple and practical woman, Dame Elisabeth believed that we lived in a materialistic age. Dame Elisabeth spoke of her family fortune and of philanthropy with the ABC's Andrew Denton. He asked her: Is philanthropy about more than simply giving money? She replied: Oh you must be involved. I think if you've got money it's perfectly easy to give it away and nothing to be particularly proud of but it's being involved and knowing what you're helping. And you know, really being committed to whatever things you're helping. Apart from raising her children, Dame Elisabeth devoted her life to philanthropy, supporting more than 100 different charities. She was devoted to the arts, to gardens and the landscape, to education and medicine, to the disabled and to the underprivileged. Her name is perpetuated at places like the Melbourne Recital Centre, the Royal Botanic Gardens, the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and the former Langwarrin Secondary College. For her service as life governor of the Royal Women's Hospital, Dame Elisabeth was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire, Civil Division, CBE, in the 1961 Queen's Birthday Honours List. Dame Elisabeth was keen to share her fortune. My sister Kate, who knew Dame Elisabeth, told me how she was very proud to give her support to less popular causes like children in care and those battling mental illness and substance abuse. Dame Elisabeth was also involved in an organisation to rehabilitate prisoners back into society. When asked in the interview with the ABC's Andrew Denton why she chose to support an organisation for prisoners, Dame Elisabeth said: … you can help them to rehabilitate. … … … I find that the people who run them are so good. They're so selfless and so good giving their voluntary time. The world is full of good people. Dame Elisabeth passed away at her home in Langwarrin in December 2012. She was 103 years old. On behalf of the people of the Ryan electorate, I pass on my condolences to Dame Elisabeth's family. Murdoch. She lived just outside my own electorate. Very early on in my time in parliament, my then fiancee, Paula, and I were invited to Cruden Farm to meet with Dame Elisabeth-I think she was sort of kicking the tyres of the newest member in the area. We had a long discussion about life and about community, family and responsibility, and then she decided to",214,Statements On Indulgence
206,Mr Hunt (Flinders) (19:16,"I had the enormous pleasure of knowing Dame Elisabethtake Paula and me on a drive through Cruden Farm gardens. She had been given a little fourwheel drive beach buggy by her family. She took off on this beach buggy, at what I think was then about age 93, and roared around her gardens at speeds which were probably illegal and certainly undesirable, and she was roaring with laughter the entire way. For me, it was an experience in speed at the fastest of levels, but for us there was a sense of a grandmotherly, by then great-grandmotherly, figure who loved life, had a great appreciation for community and family-we had spent the vast bulk of our time talking about the local community and its priorities-and was not afraid to live every day as if it mattered and to simply express the joy of her life. I think that was a fantastic thing. On a later occasion-by then I had met Dame Elisabeth and spent quite a bit of time with her on different fronts-I arrived at a charity dinner for the Royal Children's Hospital, to discover that I was seated next to Dame Elisabeth for the evening. There were about 600 people there and I sat down and said, 'Hello, Dame Elisabeth.' She said, 'Hello,' and I said, 'I think I'm your date for the evening.' She looked at me and said, 'Could do worse; could do better.' She was a very relaxed soul throughout all her later years. Of course, I did not know the earlier incarnation, but I know many people who did know the earlier incarnation of Dame Elisabeth and they said, 'Take the 93-, the 95or the 99-year-old and imagine what she was like in her 40s, 50s and 60s'-this phenomenal ball of goodwill and energy. On the Mornington Peninsula and in the Frankston area, she was simply the most adored citizen we had. There is no question about it. She was always seen as open and accessible. As the patron of more than 100 charities, many of which were local, she was a great supporter. I dealt recently with Beyond Disability. Beyond Disability is a group set up by Richard Stubbs and supported by people such as Tom McGann for those who have significant disabilities which cause almost complete immobility. Beyond Disability provides computers and computing software and training so that people-maybe with their teeth, maybe with voice command or in other ways-can manipulate and work on the internet and engage in computing activity. Dame Elisabeth was of course a very strong supporter of this local peninsular charity, Beyond Disability. They were amazed at their access and the way in which they could engage with somebody who was engaged with the great global issues but who was also intensely aware of the community in her backyard. I know many community groups that have held events at Cruden Farm, were personally hosted by Dame Elisabeth and were amazed at the way in which she would make time and engage with them-in the sense not of polite tolerance but of deep personal interest in what they had to say and what their needs were. I recognise that Dame Elisabeth came from the most famous of families, but this was somebody who ignored all of that and was completely engaged in the local community. She did not care what somebody's station was in life; she just cared whether they were sincere, whether they had a need and whether she could assist. I am delighted to acknowledge the life that was Dame Elisabeth Murdoch. I am delighted to have had a really wonderful set of encounters with her as a great resident of the top of the Mornington Peninsula. I thank her for her life and I pass on my best to her family-but I know that, whilst there is lots of sadness, they celebrate one of the great Australian stories. Government and Minister for the Arts) (19:21): I wish to join with the chamber in",215,Statements On Indulgence
207,Mr Crean (Hotham,"Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Localremembering the long and full life of Dame Elisabeth Murdoch and to convey not only my condolences but those of my family to her family-in particular my mother, because the mutual interests of both mum and Dame Elisabeth brought them into regular contact over the years. Dame Elisabeth has set a personal challenge for all of us in this chamber and in the broader community. She took her position-granted, it was a fortunate one, but she used her considerable skills and resources to make a difference by contributing to the life and well-being of her community. She did so with grace, humility and an enduring curiosity about the interesting people who made up that community. It would take too long to recite all of the contributions that Dame Elisabeth made to our community over the 104 years of her life. But I will mention a number, to demonstrate the diversity of her interests: to health, medical research and academia as Life Governor of the Royal Women's Hospital, patron of the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and a member of the Patrons Council of the Epilepsy Foundation of Victoria; and to adults and children with disabilities, as patron and founding member of the EW Tipping Foundation and as a founding member of the Deafness Foundation of Victoria. To international relations and business: she was patron of the Australian-American Association Victoria, which was founded by her late husband. To heritage, and flora and fauna: Cruden Farm at Langwarrin is one of Australia's finest examples of landscape gardening. She also devoted herself to less popular causes such as prisoners, children in care, those battling mental illness and substance abuse. I will come to her investment in arts organisations and artistic talent a little bit later, but Dame Elisabeth set the benchmark for how we can contribute to our community-whatever our financial and personal circumstances. Her passion and her commitment told us that volunteering and donating is not something you put off to next year or to better times; it is something that you do now. Dame Elisabeth also made it abundantly clear to all that contributing her money and time and energy to a cause brought a rich return to her personally, as well as to the communityshe in fact showed philanthropy could be fun. Each of us here can follow her path and learn the rewards of service. So it is fitting that we honour her with this condolence motion. A few weeks back the Melbourne Recital Centre had more than 1,000 people come to the Elisabeth Murdoch Hall for its celebration of Dame Elisabeth's life. The deep interest and enjoyment of the arts, particularly music, led to her involvement in building some of our best arts companies. She supported the careers of many of our most talented performers and artists. She touched so many lives in the arts that it is no surprise the evening saw a full house. It is also fitting that we remember her in that last week, because it was then that we announced the name of Australia's new agency for philanthropy, social investment and business partnership in the cultural sector. That agency, Creative Partnerships Australia, is charged with building a culture of giving in Australia, something that Dame Elisabeth taught us so much about. In a way, through that organisation we will be building on her example and helping more and more Australians make a personal contribution to their community. Coming from Melbourne, Dame Elisabeth was an integral part of Victoria, and Victorians all knew her work well. My mother in particular enjoyed the opportunity to interact with her when she was a member of the women's association, raising money for acquisitions at the National Gallery of Victoria. It was again another of those mutual interests that brought them together. Dame Elisabeth's longevity meant that she was able to see the impact of her philanthropy and her involvement. She could see what she was contributing to, and so many of the end results. More than most of us she knew that investing in the arts brings with it a significant dividend. Dame Elisabeth received numerous honours throughout her life, including being made a Companion of the Order of Australia and a Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire. She had a long association with the Australian Ballet, Opera Australia, the Bell Shakespeare Theatre Company and the National Gallery of Victoria, of which she was the first female trustee. Dame Elisabeth was chair of the committee that established the Victorian Tapestry Workshop and a trustee and supporter of the establishment of the regional McClelland Gallery and Sculpture Park, along with many other arts groups and individuals. She leaves a magnificent legacy, and it is incumbent upon all of us not only to respect her and pay condolences in her passing but, in respect for her, to continue to build upon so much of what she laid foundations for. I extend my sympathies to the Murdoch family. We will miss her but we will not miss her example. It is incumbent upon us to remember to build upon that example. Closing the Gap Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the document. anniversary of Closing the Gap. This is without doubt an incredible achievement, not just for the parliament but for our entire nation. Closing the Gap is an important bipartisan effort that recognises that the way forward will depend on people working together, irrespective or race or background, to improve education, health and quality of life for all Australians. It is an effort that, I am pleased to recognise, both sides of the political spectrum are striving towards. As the Prime Minister said in her speech: … the Indigenous and non-Indigenous people of this country have decided to walk the path of reconciliation together. Importantly, the Prime Minister acknowledged: The mistakes made in one generation are being repaired in the next. The gap is being closed. So for all the challenges we will inevitably encounter between now and 2031, this is a moment to savour. Not just because we reached a target but because we showed what we can do together. The Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, also rightly acknowledged the hard work that has gone into achieving the progress that has been made so far. Mr Abbott said in his Closing the Gap speech: There is a new spirit in this land. There is a new spirit which reaches out to embrace the indigenous people of this country, so different from the spirit that was abroad when the Prime Minister and I were young. It is a tribute to so many people in this place and around our country that that is now the case.",216,Statements On Indulgence
208,Mr Wyatt (Hasluck) (19:28,"We had the privilege of being part of the fifthI rise to add my voice to the support of the many in support of the continued work to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. I am pleased to see the involvement of parliamentary colleagues over the term of this parliament making contributions to those debates on many fronts. We see positive changes in the number of Indigenous Australians in employment, with 47 per cent of Indigenous Australians now in mainstream employment. That is significantly up from five years ago. It means that they participate in the economic opportunities that this country affords those who wish to take the pathway into different jobs and ultimately earn incomes that benefit their families. I also raise my concern that we do not lose focus at this critical point in our endeavours. I think if we take the headline messages out of both those speeches and walked into communities and the suburbs where Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families live, we would see a gap that we would find hard to comprehend, given what we have heard in the parliament. Some of that gap is around missed opportunity in respect to education. I also look at the incarceration rates that are continuing to climb in every jurisdiction. That means you have young Indigenous Australians taking a pathway into corrective services and, in some instances, into recidivism where their incarceration rates become cyclic. They spend time out and they go back in. It is an opportunity that is lost in terms of the hope and aspirations that we desire for all young people. When I look at the Australian Public Service, I see Indigenous Australians employed within a number of agencies but there are very few in positions within the Senior Executive Service where they are contributing to not just the debate on the needs of Indigenous Australians but also the debate on the needs of the Australian public through the agency in which they work. For example, the Office of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health focuses on the health of Indigenous Australians and yet in its history I have never seen any Indigenous person appointed to the most senior position within the organisation or to the branch manager positions within state and territory offices. I have seen them appointed to levels much lower than that, which is a pity. If we are truly closing the gap and changing the mindset we would have developed the capability for them to participate anywhere within the public sector. I hope that in 10 years we do not have identified positions within the public sector, that what we have is the same strategy that applied when we focused on equity for women. We did not create positions that were made for women as we do with Indigenous Affairs. Within the decade what I want to see is an Indigenous person holding a position at the deputy secretary or secretary level of a Commonwealth agency on merit and on the basis of the skills and capability that they bring. Although we have had gains, they are not significant enough to be uniform across the board. We are closing the gap, we are making tremendous gains in leaps and bounds. But if we take the whole spectrum in terms of housing, community infrastructure and the number of people who are progressing in their quality of life, we see some disparities still. I would hope that, when we achieve the targets we have set under the national partnership agreements and through the COAG processes, we do not overlook all of those other factors that come into play. If we halt that then we will see a discrepancy between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people. WhatI would also hope is that in the future Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs become the lesser pathway for progression within Australian society and a greater pathway of opportunity is created in a much broader context. I am always concerned, when we walk into Aboriginal communities, whether we really see the true story. That is why I have been a strong advocate of members of this parliament getting out into their electorates and identifying the gaps themselves. It is when you go and visit constituents, work with the organisations in the process of meetings, and understand the challenges and things that we have to change, that you will really see the gap close in a number of areas beyond just the five aspects we have targeted to achieve. My concern is that some of the true nature of what is happening at our regional and remote Aboriginal communities is not accurately reflected in data. One of the things I love about data is that you can collect data, analyse it, bring it into a national construct and see where we have made change and differences, just through the trending of data. It is when we dig down and go back to the realities of families and communities that we see there are still gaps yet to be addressed. In a bell curve, 25 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have made significant advances, both within their career pathways and in the income that they bring home on a fortnightly basis. They are highly successful and they do the same normative things as any other Australian family whose members work full-time-although there is still a cultural obligation that you support and help family members. I suspect that that is why you do not see too many Indigenous Australians as millionaires: because we tend to have a cultural obligation of sharing the grief and pain. As part of my work on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing, I have seen with my own eyes the work that still needs to be done in our country. I have listened to community members and service providers on the ground, who work hard to achieve improved access to services that many of us take for granted. There are still people living in abject poverty with no help and no hope for a better future. There is a sense of futility for some individuals because they see no horizon of hope from where they currently sit within the context of the continuum of opportunities that prevail within our broader Australian community. Many Indigenous people are living under substandard living conditions relative to other Australians in all settings-rural, regional and remote. Only recently, I met with a group of Indigenous leaders in my own electorate and they talked about the substandard housing that some of them are living in and their frustrations in working with government agencies to try and remedy the problem. One of the elements that I really appreciated when the NPAs-national partnership agreements-were being framed was that the National Indigenous Reform Agreement had a set of principles as to how government agencies would work with Indigenous communities, organisations and people, whereby they were equal partners in shaping the way programs, services and initiatives would roll out to make a difference. Sadly, that has not occurred to the extent that I would have thought. Life expectancy, employment rates, childhood mortality rates and literacy rates still show a marked difference between our Indigenous Australians and the rest of the Australian population in rural and remote regions. We still have a distance to travel to close the gap in Australia. We still need to fight for many families and young children who are facing an upward battle to have access to the same healthcare and education as children living in the metropolitan areas. One of the key challenges that still remain, as I said earlier, is the youth incarceration rate. I once participated in a review of imprisonment programs, and the element that came through in that was the normative thinking and expectation that imprisonment was a pathway in life-that it was just the normal process of living. We have really got to focus on dealing with that issue. We also need to initiate long-term, lasting change. One excellent example of this is the training of Indigenous doctors. Doctors are making a tangible, positive difference in closing the gap. I saw the beginnings of the medical school in Newcastle, where Dr Sandra Eades graduated as one of the first Indigenous doctors. From that grew the pathways for many others. We now have in excess of 120 doctors. Kelvin Kong in New South Wales has completed the requirements to be a surgeon. So we have made strident gains in some key areas but we need that uniformly. We need to see individuals go into the financial sector and into areas that will generate opportunities for a rethinking of the contribution that can be made through the financial gains available to all of those who seek to invest and seek those opportunities. Young men and women are establishing their own enterprises and are being successful in a slow and steady way. Joe Proctor is a financial adviser and investor with Macquarie Bank. Terri Janke is the owner of Terri Janke and Company. Natalie Walker is the CEO of Australian Indigenous Minority Supplier Council. David William is from Gilimbaa. Quinton Tucker is at BYAC Contractors. All of them are employing other Indigenous Australians as part of their workforce but are engaging external people to skill them. Eventually they want to become strong economic entities in their own right to participate not only in the mining boom. Isabelle Adams at Vision Network has had her own consultancy company for some time and has made a tremendous contribution to some of the reforms. Whilst we can acknowledge that we have closed the gap in some key areas, there is still much more work to be done. There needs to be a greater effort of consistency. The other element that has to be considered as a gap is the active participation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people being equal partners in the delivery of government services and programs. There is still a desire for the control to sit with state and Commonwealth government agencies. If the change occurs then we will see real ownership of many of the facets of the gaps that are still there and I think we will see improvements within the decade that parallel the achievements we have made thus far. I hope that we see within the next two terms of parliament further reporting on other key areas that demonstrate that we are on the path to success and that we are on the path where all Indigenous Australians work very closely and are part of the leadership of this nation in every field of endeavour-not just in Indigenous affairs but in the institutions, the financial structures of this country and the corporate sector. I congratulate both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their fine speeches that reflect the gains we have made thus far. Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (19:43): It is a pleasure to follow the member for Hasluck in this important debate on closing the gap. He is the only Indigenous member of the House of Representatives and the Senate, which is an indication of one gap that we need to work to close. Were Indigenous Australians to be represented in this place in proportion to the number in the Australian population there would be at least five Indigenous members in parliament and many debates, this one included, would be richer for that. I hope we will see Nova Peris joining the next Senate, but we still will have further to go. It is an indicator of how many of these gaps take too long to close. I am proud to represent an electorate which is the home of the Ngunawal people. Often when I am looking for stories of Indigenous Australia. I turn to Stories of the Ngunnawal, an excellent book which discusses some of the stories of the Ngunawal elders. One story by Dorothy Brown Dickson reminds us of how tough it was for some of the Ngunawal people. Ms Dickson grew up in an Aboriginal reserve in Yass. She refers to how tough life was for the young men. She says: They couldn't have a drink in peace. They had nowhere else to have a drink and socialise as they weren't allowed in the pubs. People would come up there all the time arresting them, and taking them down to the lock-up. When the police needed slave labour to look after their yards and cut wood, there always seemed to be someone in jail to do it. She goes on to say: Even the shop-keepers were prejudiced. You had to wait until the white people were served first in the shops. When Aborigines went to the picture theatre they had to sit down the front by themselves. And the welfare would come up there all the time, checking on people. She goes on to talk about her friend Betty Russell, who she used to walk to school with. She says: One afternoon I went to Betty's place. Betty was quiet and her mother was sad. I asked What's the matter?' Betty said the welfare was sending her mother and brothers and sisters to Walgett. I was really sad. It really broke my heart but nothing could be done. I never saw Betty for years after that. It is vital that we report to parliament on progress on closing the gap. Progress on closing the gap is a multifaceted challenge. It involves issues of the heart, such as the inclusion of Indigenous peoples in the Constitution; symbolic acts of recognition, such as our existing practice of acknowledging traditional owners of the land in formal speeches; and perhaps in the future other practices, such as that adopted across the ditch, of dual naming of places. Today being Canberra Day it is appropriate to note that Canberra is the only Australian city that carries an Indigenous name rather than the name of a European settler or a respected European. We ought to have more cities in Australia carrying traditional Indigenous names. I wanted to speak today about a number of pieces of work being done to close the gaps. They are not all directly connected with one another, but I do not think many of these efforts to close the gap are directly connected with one another either. One issue that I have been active on as a member representing a large number of public servants is ensuring that the Australian government meets its target of 2.7 per cent Indigenous employees in the Australian Public Service. This is of particular concern to me as a result of an issue raised by the CPSU here in the ACT recently-that the share of Indigenous public servants in the Australian Public Service has not been increasing but in fact declining, falling from 2.4 to 2.1 per cent. In an effort to work out what we can do to increase the share of Indigenous employees I wrote to all ministers asking what strategies they are employing to improve the share of Indigenous employees in their departments, and I thought I might share some of those strategies with the House today. Several departments have structured mentoring, leadership or buddy programs for Indigenous Australians, focusing on career development and ensuring retention. Other departments hold national conferences for their Indigenous employees as an opportunity to share ideas and experiences. Some departments have Indigenous apprentice, cadet and graduate programs as well as particular Indigenous strategy teams within their human resources divisions. In certain cases those human resources divisions have developed memoranda of understanding with Indigenous studies centres at universities as a way of partnering with those centres to get talented university graduates. There are departments that already exceed the 2.7 per cent target and are aiming higher. They have set aspirational targets for 2015. One minister has an Indigenous advisor working on his staff and has had that advisor for a number of years. Several departments participate in the Learn Earn Legend! Work Exposure with Government program, administered by DEEWR. It is a program that aims to give Indigenous Australians exposure to work in the offices of parliamentarians and in the Australian Public Service. There is also work being done across the APS through its Diversity Council to make diversity issues visible, and there have been efforts to make sure that public servants are offered leave for cultural and ceremonial purposes which are appropriate to the needs of those employees. Those include up to two days leave with pay for participation in NAIDOC Week activities and cultural and ceremonial events. The targets are 2.7 per cent for departments that were below that threshold as at 2009, or a 20 per cent increase for departments that were above the threshold. I do hope that we will see the share of Indigenous employees in the public sector track upwards, perhaps even through use of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander recruitment agencies, better working with existing Indigenous staff to design and deliver cultural appreciation training and through identified Indigenous positions-meaning not that the person who is successful in getting the position need be Indigenous but that they must understand Indigenous issues and take responsibility for communicating effectively with Indigenous people. Such positions may well be an important step towards increasing the share of public servants who are from an Indigenous background. A second issue to which I want to draw the attention of the House is work being done by Canberra public servant Daniel Billing, which has been publicised in the Canberra Times by their excellent education editor, Emma Macdonald. Mr Billing is working to provide home Kindles to Indigenous students. He noticed how his own seven-year-old took to the Kindle intuitively and enthusiastically, and so came up with a plan to fund Kindles for Indigenous students in an effort to boost their interest in reading. The ACT's only participant is Forrest Primary School sixth-grader Yulcailia Hoolihan-Mongta. At the time she received her Kindle, the 11-year-old had a reading age of nine and spent just 45 minutes a week reading. After 12 weeks with the Kindle she has increased her weekly reading to two hours and 20 minutes and gained about a year's worth of reading activity-a year's worth of reading activity just in that three-month period, according to her teacher, Gemma O'Brien. I commend Emma Macdonald for her work in publicising the Indigenous Reading Project and Daniel Billing for his activism, as well as the many generous philanthropists who have donated towards it. But one philanthropic body is notably absent, and that is Amazon.com. Amazon.com has Australian sales, I would estimate, of around $1 billion a year. Based on the available estimates, they hold about one-10th of the $13 billion online sales market. And yet Amazon.com pay no GST, they pay no company tax and they make no charitable donations to a single Australian charity-$1 billion in sales, and not a cent in charitable donations. I asked Amazon.com how they could defend this, but I got no comment. I think this is unacceptable; I think Amazon ought to recognise their duty to Australia to behave as a good corporate citizen. AndI cannot see a better charity for Amazon to support in Australia than the Indigenous reading project. So, as a Kindle user and a keen consumer of their products, I do encourage Amazon.com to become a better Australian corporate citizen. Third, I wish to draw the attention of the House to the July 2012 report Evaluating new income management in the Northern Territory: First evaluation report by J Rob Bray and coauthors. This is an important report because it cuts through much of the ideology that has surrounded new income management in the Northern Territory. It focuses on the empirical evidence relating to income management. It notes that there are few consistent impacts of new income management. Instead, there have been diverse outcomes. The report notes wide and inconsistent views and experiences of income management. There have been many who wish to remain on the program, which has had a positive impact on their lives. There has also been a statistically significant improvement in the ability to afford food among those in the treatment group relative to the control group. There were other positive and negative aspects noted. The Basics card has been valued, but the loss of autonomy resented. Some subject to income management have noted that they find it restrictive or frustrating. There is a sense of a disempowerment. We need more empirical evidence of this type. I commend Minister Macklin for commissioning this important research. It is only through taking a clearheaded look at the empirical data that we will be able to craft better policies. If closing the gap were easy, it would have been done by generations past. It is because this is a difficulty task that we set ourselves to it. Finally, let me acknowledge the Indigenous softball program, which I had the pleasure to be engaged with at the Hawker Softball Centre at an event last year. Softball has been a leader among sports in engaging with Indigenous Australians, particularly women's softball. There are Indigenous softball clubs springing up across urban, regional and remote Australia. I commend the work of Softball Australia in this area. Sport can help change lives and provide a sense of self-esteem and an enthusiasm to be involved in the community. Sport will play an important part in helping to close the gap. I commend the statement to the House with a sense of optimism about the goals but also with clear-eyed realism about how far we have to go. to the Prime Minister's fifth annual statement on Closing the Gap. In doing so, I would like to commend both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for the manner in which they contributed to the debate in February this year. Both the tone and the content of their respective speeches to the parliament reflected very positively on them and on their efforts to address Aboriginal disadvantage throughout our nation. Much has already been said by other speakers about the successes and the failures in reaching the ambitious targets set in 2008 in relation to life expectancy, mortality rates, early childhood education, reading, numeracy and writing, year 12 achievement and employment outcomes. I would like to acknowledge the Prime Minister's comment that this will be the work of an entire generation of Australians. We should not become disheartened by any early setbacks or indeed become complacent about any of our successes. Every gain in this space will be hard won and it will be difficult for us to consolidate those gains. As the Prime Minister said: Let's always remember: closing the gap is not inevitable. Keeping it closed is not inevitable either. We must guard our gains and never allow a backward step.",218,Ministerial Statements
209,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (19:57,"I also appreciate the opportunity to speak in relationSimilarly, the Leader of the Opposition remarked in his speech that this must be a national project with a focus on results on the ground. As he is a member who above all others in this place has lived the creed in terms of going out and working in the Indigenous communities and delivering practical results on the ground, I will quote from a speech by the Leader of the Opposition in which he said: … the sad truth is that it is easy to spend money but it is hard to make a difference. That is why it is so important that we focus on not just what is happening here in his building, what is happening here in the administration, but what is happening on the ground. The focus should not be on what Government is doing but it must also be on what people are doing in response to the initiatives of government, because it doesn’t matter what we do in this place. All our fine words, all our noble sentiments don’t matter if adults aren’t going to work and if children aren’t going to school. I endorse those comments from the Leader of the Opposition. This is about making a real difference in the lives of Aboriginal people throughout Australia. I have said repeatedly in my time in this place that you do not need to travel to rural or remote communities in the Northern Territory to witness Indigenous disadvantage in Australia. Regional towns right throughout Victoria, including in my own electorate, and right through New South Wales and Queensland provide examples of Indigenous communities struggling to meet ends meet and get ahead in their lives. I do endorse the building blocks of the Closing the Gap initiative, which have been supported through the COAG process. It is about early-childhood development, schooling, health, economic participation, healthy homes, safe communities and governance and leadership-governance and leadership from this place and also from the communities themselves. These building blocks are very easy for us to talk about because they do make sense. It is a matter of getting the kids to school, healthy, at an early age and making sure that they are actually attending school by giving them that good start in life so that when they reach those early years of education they are ready to learn. It is helping them and their families to value an education with the prospect in the longer term that at the end of their education or training journey there will be a real job for them, and they can have their own economic independence. I believe that we have a role in this place to help provide the leadership, but it has to be in partnership with the communities that we are talking about. There must be a level of responsibility accepted by the community leaders themselves, by the individuals and by the Aboriginal elders to help their own communities. I think we have a very important role in this place by helping to provide the framework to ensure that there is a safe living environment for those people. I want to talk about a slightly different gap from the nature of other speeches that have been made this evening and earlier, and that is the gap in Aboriginal participation in the social and civic life of our communities. I would argue that the relationship of most white Australians with Aboriginal people does not really extend beyond the abstract. We might cheer for them in their sporting pursuits, whether it be in the AFL or in rugby league, and some of us may have the opportunity to work with Aboriginal people in their professional capacity. We do get the opportunity to read about their issues in the media, in particular the Australian has done an extraordinary job in recent years of highlighting areas of Aboriginal disadvantage in our nation. I would argue that most of my colleagues in this place-and, in fact, most of my white Australian friends-would not have a single Aboriginal person they could say is their personal friend. I would argue that most of us have never actually sat down and had a cup of coffee or shared a meal with an Aboriginal person or their family outside, perhaps, the professional role they may have in the community. There is a real social and civic life gap in the lives of Aboriginal people and the relationship with white Australia. I think there is an enormous gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians and there are very few opportunities at the moment for that social engagement, particularly, I would argue, in our city or suburban locations. It is probably a bit different for us who are fortunate enough to come from regional towns. We are often involved more directly in our communities, whether it is through our sporting or community activities. I would argue, still, that it does not always extend to a friendship or a social engagement between white Australians and Aboriginal Australians. Once the footy game is over there is very little actual social interaction. I think it is to our enormous loss as a nation that we do not find the ways to bridge that gap. It is a gap that, I think, all of us can address in our daily lives. There are simple things like making sure that the young Aboriginal children in our communities are involved or included in our sporting clubs, that we actually invite the young Aboriginal children to our own children's birthday parties and go out of our way to make sure that those bridges are built across the cultural divide. I think we can extend the hand of friendship beyond the grand speeches that we might make in this place or the grand gestures of the Apology by the member for Griffith. These are all important gestures but, unless they are backed up by practical action on the ground by each and every one of us, it will all be for naught. It is all about taking some small and practical steps to understand each other and to show respect for one another. I had the good fortune as a young person growing up in Gippsland to know many Aboriginal people and to still regard them as both friends and family members. My family link, if you like, is through my dad's cousins, Jack and Edna, who fostered and provided safe homes for many Aboriginal people. In times of great need they provided refuge for young Aboriginal people. Theirs is quite a remarkable story. My Uncle Jack was prisoner of war in the Thai-Burma Railway. He was a POW for several years yet, when he returned, despite experiencing all the atrocities endured on the Thai-Burma Railway, he harboured no ill-will towards his Japanese captors, which I find quite staggering. When he returned to Australia he had a renewed commitment to serve others who were less fortunate than himself. His calling, as he described it to me once, was to work with Indigenous people. He moved his family to a little place called Newmerella, which is on the outskirts of Orbost, not far from the banks of the Snowy River, and during his lifetime he either fostered, adopted or provided refuge for up to 20 Aboriginal children. It is an extraordinary life story. He was able to provide for them with his wife, Edna, and their own children a stable, safe family environment for these young Aboriginal people who could not, for whatever reason, live with their blood relatives in the township. Those young Aboriginal people were part of my formative years growing up. We spent a lot of time with them quite often because, obviously, with a large number of children in his own house, Jack and Edna needed a bit of respite and some of the young Aboriginal people would come and stay at our place in Sale in the school holidays. So we had a lot of exposure and a lot of experience with young Aboriginal people, and we regard them as our cousins. I am sure there was no actual blood relationship at all, but we regard them as cousins, and to this day I still regard them as my cousins. Many of those young people went on to achieve good educations, they went on to achieve stable jobs and they have been able to fully participate in the economic and social lives of the Gippsland community. At the same time, they have been able to retain their cultural identity. This is a microcosm of what can be achieved by working in partnership with Indigenous people in their own communitiesmaking sure that they are healthy, making sure they have had the chance to go to school and achieve an education or training and then have the realistic aspiration or expectation of achieving a job at the end that time. Just a month ago, I introduced the Prime Minister to one of those kids-one of those young Aboriginal people. I should not call him a kid because-his name is Lionel Dukakis-he is actually 50 now. When the Prime Minister visited Heyfield, I dragged Lionel out of the crowd and made him come over and say g'day to the Prime Minister. It was a great moment, and Lionel got his photo taken with the Prime Minister, and I am hoping that Lionel still votes for me in September. Nevertheless, he had his photo taken with the Prime Minister and it was a lovely moment. Lionel trained as a builder, he has gone off and worked in the mines and now he works as a cultural liaison officer with the Department of Sustainability and Environment. He has been a terrific role model for other young Aboriginal people in the Gippsland region. He has raised three successful children who have all done well in both their education and their employment. I wonder many times, when we see the extent of Aboriginal disadvantage and Indigenous disadvantage in my community, what he would have achieved and what his brothers, sisters and kin would have achieved without Uncle Jack and Aunty Edna's guidance. What was great about that relationship was that it provided structure to their lives, and for a lot of Aboriginal people in my electorate there is a lack of structure. They lack positive role models. There is, unfortunately, an intergenerational welfare dependency which has developed over 20 or 30 years, and it is a blight on our community that we have not been able to help these people and rescue these people from their perilous situation. SoI welcome this opportunity in this place to talk about the Closing the Gap initiatives but in doing so I hope that we continue to remember that the these fine words we hear in this place need to be backed up with action on the ground. It concerned me as I prepared my notes for this evening's comments that, with the exception of the member for Hasluck, we have a lot of white voices in this place talking about Aboriginal issues and not enough Aboriginal people themselves in this building making a contribution to our nation's great democracy. I thought rather than just have me talk about the Closing the Gap initiatives, I would ask a few of the Aboriginal people in my community for their comments on how they thought we were progressing after five years. I asked several people in the community for their responses, and they were generally quite positive in the fact that they thought we were making progress and that we were actually heading in the right direction with the Closing the Gap initiatives. But there was, of course, a cautionary note that more needs to be done. One of the young men I spoke to was a fella by the name of Will Carter. Will, typical of a lot of the Aboriginal boys in my community, is a gun footballer. In fact, I think he has won quite a few club best and fairests and a couple of league best and fairests as well. Will now works in the employment industry for young people, not just Indigenous people but other young people as well. He says, in relation to Closing the Gap, that it does have the right intentions-he is heartened by that. But he says that there needs to be more of a focus on the placement into jobs with the generous employers that have been so willing to be part of something so big and there are other ways it could be better approached in terms of getting the major multinationals like Coles and Woolworths involved more directly in our community. I take up Will's suggestion that the major multinationals have a lot more to offer in making sure Indigenous young people have the opportunity to get casual work and then go on to full-time employment. He also makes the point, and I think it is a very good point, that Reconciliation Week and other activities need to be driven by the young Aboriginal people in our community. The best place to start is the education system. He believes there are great opportunities to ensure that young Indigenous people still appreciate their own culture but also have the willingness and expectation they will gain paid employment. Some comments I received were from a lady by the name of Aunty Phyllis Andy. Aunty Phyllis is an absolute doyenne of my local community and an elder of the local Aboriginal people. She works with the Lakes Entrance Aboriginal Health Association and makes the point that the East Gippsland region is going from strength to strength but trying to deal with the demands of health, housing and education has become very difficult for the Lakes Entrance Aboriginal Health Association. She calls on both state and federal governments to renew their focus in the growing health needs of our community. The last person I consulted was a fellow by the name of Wayne Thorpe, who does some great work in my community. I will quote directly from Wayne's brief email to me. As my uncle said to me, which way is best for Aboriginal people? One way open the gap. Culture will close the gap for our people. Kids need to learn culture as well as adults. We have tried the Australian western values. It is Aboriginal culture that will fill the empty void created in our lives. When our cultural beliefs are respected and are part of our daily lives then we can engage in the other cultures of Australia. That was from Wayne Thorpe, who is a traditional custodian of the Gunai people. These are wise words from people in my community. The general response I receive is that we are making progress. It has been a long journey and it has been extremely painful at times, but we must continue to work together for the benefit not just of Indigenous people but of the broader Australian nation. I commend the motion to the House. I thought that was an outstanding contribution. In my 17 years, as of 2 March this year, in federal parliament, I have not sensed such a unity between the parties on any issue as on this issue. I think it is a great thing for our country and it is an opportunity to take some really significant steps. We have done a lot, but there is a long way to go. My contribution today will focus on what I believe to be a necessity in the Closing the Gap targets-that is, added to those six specific targets, we should be adding the target of reducing both victimisation and incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. In terms of victimisation, statistics show that Indigenous people are almost twice as likely as non-Indigenous people to have been a victim of physical or threatened violence. Indigenous women are 31 times more likely than non-Indigenous women to be admitted to hospital for injuries caused by assault. Their children are 31 times more likely to witness their",224,Ministerial Statements
210,Mr Mcclelland (Barton) (20:12,"I start by commending the member for Gippsland.mum, their grandma or their sister being the victim of an assault than the broader Australian community. In remote areas Indigenous people are hospitalised as a result of family violence at 35 times the rate of the rest of Australia. In Indigenous communities the victim and offender are intimate partners 60 per cent of the time as compared to 24 per cent of the time for non-Indigenous Australians. Indeed, in the case of homicides, similarly, 60 per cent of homicides in Indigenous communities are between intimate partners whereas it is one-quarter of the homicides in the broader community. These are appalling figures, and there is no question that the people who commit those crimes should be incarcerated. That is unquestionably an appropriate response to those crimes. Equally, we need to assess whether our strategies are appropriately graduated. There is a strong argument that high levels of incarceration, particularly for minor offences such as traffic offences and non-payment of fines, may ultimately undermine our objective of safer communities. For instance, in New South WalesI think you have to get about 120 hours of driving experience up before you get a licence. The expense of that for some members of Indigenous communities is prohibitive. If they are at a remote location and they require transport, whatever may be the need of the journey, they will frequently drive unlicensed. The consequence of that is a fine if they are apprehended. The consequence of non-payment of those fines, in some states at least, can be incarceration. There are strategies in place, and a number of volunteers are now in Indigenous communities teaching young people to drive, to prevent the rate of fines and, consequently in some communities, incarceration. That is a lateral approach to imprisoning young people because they are driving without a licence. I can give you some of the percentages in terms of the broader community. Today Indigenous Australians make up only 2.5 per cent of the population but they account for 26 per cent of the adult prison population. The incarceration rate of Indigenous adults is 14 times higher than non-Indigenous adults. Between 2000 and 2010 the rate at which Indigenous women were incarcerated increased by 58 per cent. That is, in our most recent past decade, the rate of incarceration of Indigenous women increased by 50 per cent. The rate at which Indigenous men are incarcerated increased by over a third to 35 per cent. Of greatest concern, however, is that those figures are even higher for Indigenous juveniles. Only five per cent of young Australians are Indigenous, but half of the young people in detention-in prison and juvenile detention-are Indigenous. Indeed, Indigenous young Australians are 28 times more likely to be in detention than non-Indigenous Australians. We have apologised, and we had reason to apologise, for the stolen generation. We are at the precipice of a lost generation because of the rate of incarceration of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. In fact, Indigenous young people are more likely to be incarcerated today than at any time since the release of the reports of the royal commission into Aboriginal deaths in custody more than 20 years ago. In other words, the situation is getting worse; it is not getting better, and this is not good enough. Experts have talked about the marginal effect of incarceration in terms of reducing crime. Indeed, evidence suggests today that excessive imprisonment rates, particularly for those relatively minor offences that I have referred to-fine default, traffic offences and so forthmay actually cause more crime in the longer term. Professor Dave Brown, who must be getting on a bit because he taught me at university, makes the point that prisons can become schools of crime which result in the fracturing of family and community ties, hardening and brutalisation, and poor mental health outcomes for those who have been incarcerated. After an offender is released they are likely to have lost essential life skills, have an increased reliance on criminal networks that they have built up in prison, and experience reduced employment opportunities and access to social programs. This is a profound and worrying situation in Indigenous communities because it simply leads to recidivism, where they go around the cycle again and then end up in either juvenile detention or prison. Prof. Brown also points out that studies have shown that there may be a tipping point for certain communities where, once incarceration reaches a certain level, crime in the community will actually increase. Instead of it being a deterrent, it becomes a rite of passage where it is an expectation-or indeed a thing of pride-to have served your time in prison, as opposed to what we know: that prison should be very much a deterrent and very much the local community saying that this conduct is unacceptable. Concerningly and tragically, this trend is intergenerational. The Corrective Services NSW Women's Advisory Council's submission to the Doing Time inquiry, which was a report of this parliament-and I commend that report to all members; I think it is an outstanding report-gave the account of one of their experts. The expert said, 'When I was going to Mulawa prison,'-this is the women's prison-'a young woman came up to me and introduced me to her mother and grandmother, who were also incarcerated.' Three generations: grandmother, mother and child were incarcerated. They had all been in custody and were all in Mulawa, in the women's jail, together. It was not remarkable to them; it was simply something that happens. That is three generations, all living generations, incarcerated in the women's prison-and I spoke earlier about the rates of incarceration of Indigenous women increasing 50 per cent from the period 2000 to 2010. If we do not turn these trends around it is difficult to see-if not impossible to see-how we are going to make the other Closing the Gap targets in terms of health, in terms of education and in terms of employment if we do not have functional communities. In the Prime Minister's Closing the Gap speech she referred to the need for there to be an availability of places in educational institutions, and the Leader of the Opposition said that yes, there needed to be places in those educational institutions for young people. But he went a step further: he said that there need to be places and those kids needed to turn up. I say that they are both right, but I go a step further: not only do they need to turn up, but they need to be functional-and I can give you a first hand example of that. When I was Attorney-General, I was taken on a tour of Kununurra one evening by police officers in Western Australia. The first thing those police officers did was take me where there were Indigenous youths on the streets-some as young as seven, they pointed out to me. The police were obviously worried about that because of the welfare of the young people, but also from the point of view of what those bored young people may get up to on the street. The next thing they did was take me to their homes a few blocks away, and that provided the answer: drunkenness was rife, with all its associated ugly antisocial behaviour; the noise, the tension-quite frankly, the sense of bedlam-was profound. I am not a small person, but there is no way that I would have walked down those streets. In fact, it was distressing to see that those hardened police officers became quite emotional in advising me that the kids we saw in the streets had to wait until alcohol induced sleep had set in before venturing back through the streets to their homes. Yet those kids were expected to turn up at school the following day and be functional. Clearly, in the circumstances that I saw, that was going to be an impossibility. There are a number of successful programs. Indeed, in Kununurra, I was able to fund a program that was a drop-in centre so kids, instead of being on the street, could drop into the centre; that is one of the advantages of being a minister. I returned 12 months later and saw the centre up and running. It was pointed out to me that the cost to government of the centre was some $200,000 a year. It was pointed out to me at the same time that the cost of the centre, with capacity for 50 kids to drop in, was the cost of incarcerating one Indigenous youth. That was an example of a successful program and there are obviously more sophisticated programs to prevent recidivism that require the intervention of social workers, employment experts and so forth. There are a number of very successful programs around. As the member for Gippsland pointed out, the vital importance of those programs is that they are being developed in partnership with Indigenous communities. My fundamental point is this: there are many, many examples of very successful programs, but unless and until we make a specific target for Closing the Gap to reduce rates of victimisation-that is, people who are victims of crime-and rates of incarceration of Indigenous Australians, we have Buckley's of making the other Closing the Gap targets. known challenges that we as a nation face in ensuring that our Indigenous brothers and sisters achieve all that they are capable of doing. I hope to point to some opportunities that would bring about the kind of change that we all aspire to but in some respects the Closing the Gap account provided to the parliament reflects modest progress in these areas. The speeches delivered by the parliamentary leaders were excellent. I am reflecting primarily on the Leader of the Opposition's eloquent words about the importance of work. Some years ago I had the honour and privilege of being concurrently the Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs with oversight responsibilities for AusAID and the Parliamentary Secretary for Indigenous Affairs. One thing that frankly bewildered me was why the two policy groups did not speak more with each other to learn from each other's experiences and draw insights and inspiration from what was succeeding. As I represented our nation at the millennium development goal discussions, I had the honour and privilege of speaking in Jakarta for our region and at the UN headquarters in New York about progress. ThereI could point to the hundreds of millions of citizens in our region that had lifted their lives out of poverty. There was no magic bullet to doing that. It was enabled by the only durable strategy in human history that has ever worked-that is, sustainable economic growth. One can transfer wealth between peoples or countries and that may mitigate some of the harm you see from abject poverty and many of the social challenges that have been discussed in this debate. But to achieve a durable lift in opportunity, in quality of life, in incomes and in living standards there is no substitute for economic growth. That was clear when we applied our policy minds and rigour to our overseas development assistance, but it seems to be something that we were not prepared to talk about in our own poverty alleviation and hardship challenges here. It was as if what worked for the away game we could not talk about for the home game. To this day, I remain bewildered about that disconnect-where the learnings are not cross-pollinating between our poverty alleviation and hardship actions overseas and what we do at home.",228,Ministerial Statements
211,Mr Billson (Dunkley) (20:26,"In my contribution I will not recount some of theAsI listened to the eloquent words of the Leader of the Opposition, it reminded me of a few insights that I gained over that time-insights that I urge the government today to embrace with much more vigour than I have seen to date. They were simple concepts that there is more opportunity to contribute to the economy than simply working for someone else. The Leader of the Opposition spoke eloquently about FMG and Twiggy Forrest's strategy, where he said, 'IfI have the jobs I can train people for them.' That was an excellent insight into the matching exercise that is so crucial to having people see a pathway for their own improvement-in fact, how they can achieve their own sense of economic independence and individual self-determination. It was contrasted with some of the aid initiatives, particularly in the Pacific, where we were training people for jobs that did not exist. It was a cruel hoax on people, to urge them to engage in study and training for years when there were no economic opportunities for which those learnings and skills could be applied when they completed their courses of study. Twiggy Forrest's and FMG's approach says, 'We have jobs; we will prepare people for them.' But one thing that I am urging the government to take a look at, recognising the resourcefulness and resilience of Indigenous people and Indigenous communities, is the delicious opportunity for self-employment and small business formation. I know through my travels that major investments in communities with significant Indigenous populations would be welcomed more warmly where there were Indigenous economic opportunities arising from that investment. I know that even from CDEP programs, where you see Indigenous people engaged in support for their communities, they are using the very same skills which, if supported by appropriate guidance, advice and qualification recognition, could see those very same participants transform themselves into small business people-to be self-employed. This could transform, say, some home maintenance work in a CDEP program into a home maintenance business. Yet where is the support for that kind of transformation? Where is the effort for the Indigenous community to activate and to make their own self-employment and small business opportunities in our country and, in particular, in our regions? I am concerned, and I think a lot of it is because the government, through its own rhetoric, often would not know enterprise if they fell over it. There is this conception that the only modality of economic contribution is a person working for somebody else. Yet we know that the entrepreneurs, the self-employed and the independent contractors are crucial to our economic prospects-the courageous men and women of small business who take risks to create opportunities for themselves and for those around them, and who add an economic vitality to their communities. That is why I pay tribute to Debbie Barwick-she is the chairperson of the New South Wales Indigenous Chamber of Commerce-and to Professor Dennis Foley. He is a professor of Indigenous research at the University of Newcastle. They have been onto this for some time, and I hope their efforts get more encouragement than has been seen to date. There is scope for it within existing funding. I am not here saying that there needs to be more money thrown at a policy solution that is not proven: no, that is not right at all. There are resources available-there is a head nod to this opportunity-but it is all backswing and no follow through. There is a need to follow through on some of the glib terminology that surrounds some program description that talks to self-employment, enterprise and entrepreneurship but then does not result in any meaningful and sustained engagement and support to see it actually materialise. In the area of the Indigenous employment program there was a notional thought that about 80 per cent of that funding should go to employment and about 20 per cent to economic development-supporting the infrastructure that enables Indigenous people to create their own opportunities and their own businesses, and to give method and structure to their own instinctive entrepreneurial characteristics. We believe that, instead of that 80 per cent to 20 per cent split, about 97 per cent of that funding is going to employment programs and a small fraction, around three per cent, is going to economic development. Yet-I go back to my original observation-economic growth has been proven throughout the ages to be the only durable way of sustainably lifting economic opportunities and alleviating poverty. Why has the government frozen some Indigenous economic initiatives? Organisations have gone through extensive tender processes to get on panels, to have someone to hear them, only to be told that the government is not in a position to support them, and that there has been overspending in some areas-an excessive commitment of resources to employment and nothing left in the cupboard to support economic development. Big, profitable companies have been supported in implementing employment strategies, yet we have not seen any support of substance going to organisations like the New South Wales Indigenous Chamber of Commerce, a trusted, active and proven organisation to which Indigenous people can turn to support their own small business formation and self-employment opportunities. Parliamentary inquiries have identified this opportunity, yet the support is not there. Even the 2008 draft, through to the 2011-18 Indigenous Economic Development Strategy under priority 4, supported the need for a commitment to organisations and agencies that could provide a one-stop shop to support Indigenous people in organising themselves and engaging with commercial opportunities, with self-employment and with small business start-ups. Yet that head nod, that acknowledgement, has not been followed through with resources. This is not to discount the action needed to alleviate the harm that others have talked about. This is about constructive steps to restore the hope that things can be better, to provide a purpose for learning that might see academic participation increase and to provide context and meaning to the encouragement from, for example, the former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, in his observation about joining up the Closing the Gap education initiative to encourage a greater degree of vocational and higher education participation. It is about saying enterprise and self-employment is crucial to the economic future of the Indigenous community but it needs support. There is chapter and verse on how-and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, in their inquiry into being 'open for business', developing Indigenous enterprises in Australia, showed this-big corporates would love to interact with Indigenous enterprises as part of their rounded approach to their economic life and to the key performance indicators they communicate to their shareholders, and on the idea of Indigenous business chambers, hubs and one-stop shop models. This is supported by the Minerals Council, which points to that very policy measure as being crucial in ensuring that small businesses are run, owned, operated and guided to the benefit of Indigenous people and in ensuring that Indigenous people are able to take up economic opportunities. In Message Stick's submission to the committee inquiry, Michael McLeod and Dug Russell, talk about the need for government to understand business and entrepreneurship and to put in place support programs that would see young Indigenous people not only recognise sporting excellence as a way out or an opportunity for individual self-determination and economic independence but also celebrate the heroes of Indigenous business. Young Indigenous boys and girls would be able to see someone had already walked that path and created opportunities for themselves and their communities. It is a grossly underdone area of the suite of policy tools that are broadly badged as the Closing the Gap initiatives. I urge the government to get behind that excellent work that Debbie Barwick and Professor Dennis Foley have undertaken. In the few minutes that are left I want to point to another area where I think there is great hope, and that is private sector collaboration. I touched on it in terms of enterprise, entrepreneurship and self-employment, but I will go further. In my own community, two outstanding local people, Mr and Mrs Paul Williams, are providing Indigenous education opportunities through their philanthropic efforts in the Woomera Educational Scholarship Trust. This is a remarkable, selfless and generous statement by two local members of our community who have been very successful in their business careers and accumulated wealth that they want to put to virtuous and worthy causes. They have chosen to provide outstanding educational opportunity for young Indigenous people at some of the nation's leading schools, in particular the Peninsula School in my electorate of Dunkley. They provide for tuition support where Indigenous people, largely from the north-west of Western Australia, come as boarders. The private trust also has to fund travel home for students who would otherwise be eligible for ABSTUDY and therefore able to reach out for travel expenses to return to their families with stories of their educational success and to reconnect with their communities where they are outstanding role models and inspirations. Yet if that same opportunity was funded publicly that travel expense would be funded and supported by the taxpayer. I think that private philanthropy which provides world-class education opportunities for Indigenous students should be supported, whether it is funded by the taxpayer or by remarkable individuals like Mr and Mrs Williams. I have written to Minister Garrett saying this has to be a bureaucratic oversight, that surely we want to support this sort of private initiative. Doing so would open up an opportunity to provide another scholarship for another young Indigenous person to go back to their community as a remarkable role model and a statement of what application and commitment and making the best of the opportunities within your reach can do for you. That is a message I would like to see more of in Indigenous communities. There are some examples. Ms BIRD (Cunningham-Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (20:41): I am very pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate in response to the Prime Minister's report to the parliament on the Closing the Gap report for 2012. The annual report to parliament has occurred each year since Prime Minister Rudd offered the official apology to the stolen generation on behalf of the nation in 2007. I was very pleased, as I am sure many of us were, to have been able to be present in the chamber on this very significant and moving occasion. At the time. I said: … there is so much that was stolen because of these policies and it is so important that we reach out. We do … through to an ongoing commitment to make sure that Aboriginal people's opportunities in our country are improved. I finished my contribution with the comments of many of my local constituents who also wished to express their support for the apology and the commitment to closing the gap. I concluded: There is no doubt that each of us in this place will be particularly keenly endorsing and supporting the current government's commitments to closing the gap so that the apology issued last Wednesday will actually be the beginning of a whole new period for Indigenous Australians and an opportunity for them to take some of the many privileges that are their rights as citizens of this nation. In 2008 the Council of Australian Governments agreed to a set of targets which included firstly, the close the life expectancy gap within a generation-that is, by 2031; secondly, to halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five by 2018; thirdly, to ensure access to early childhood education for all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities by 2013; fourthly, to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for children by 2018; fifthly, to halve the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 or equivalent attainment rates by 2020 and, finally, to halve the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and other Australians by 2018. Subsequent to the apology and the COAG agreement, both Prime Ministers Rudd and Gillard have provided a full report to the parliament on the release of the Closing the Gap report each year. On6 February this year, Prime Minister Gillard provided the most recent accounting for 2012. In introducing her report, she told the House: Closing the Gap is a plan of unprecedented scale and ambition, a plan not only to uplift the lives of Indigenous Australians but to do so in a shared endeavour of partnership and respect. That high level of ambition commits us to two decades of annual reckoning until we bridge the gulf that stands between us. Few if any of the men and women who sit in this parliament today will still be here when a future Prime Minister delivers the final Closing the Gap statement in 2031. A short walk to this despatch box that we hope will mark the end of a monumental journey. Wherever we are on that day, the people of this land will want to hear one thing. That we have, at last, accorded Indigenous Australians the health care, education, job opportunities and community services they deserve. This is a legacy that I am sure any of us would be pleased to see outlive each of our individual careers. This is a significant year. As the Closing the gap report identifies, it is the 20th anniversary of the Native Title Act being passed, it is the fifth anniversary of the national apology to the stolen generations and it is the year in which the first of the targets set back in 2008 will be achieved: ensuring all Indigenous four-year-olds living in remote communities have access to early childhood education within five years-that is, by 2013. In her speech, the Prime Minister reported that the Closing the Gap target, for all Indigenous four-year-olds living in remote communities to have access to early childhood education, will be achieved this year. This is particularly important, as it is well established that the early years are critical to the establishment of healthy, happy children and that being well-prepared for formal education is an invaluable investment that more than returns the cost of the investment. The Closing the gap report itself identifies that children who attend quality preschool programs are more likely to be successful at school, stay in school longer, continue on to further education and training, and fully participate in employment and community life as adults. The report identifies the following achievements: Data from 2011 reveals that 91 per cent of Indigenous children in remote areas are enrolled in a preschool program. This data, consistent with the governments' commitment regarding delivery, indicates that the target of 95 per cent enrolment will be met this year. The Government is working with Indigenous communities, large and small, to ensure children are enrolled in school and get to school and that the benefits of attendance are realised. Providing access to quality preschool programs is an important basis for better school attendance. I am personally very interested in the education based targets for the reason that educational achievement is inextricably linked to overall improvement in life outcomes. The report on the fifth target tells us: Results from the 2011 Census show the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in Year 12 or equivalent attainment is narrowing. In 2011, the proportion of Indigenous 20-to-24-year-olds with at least Year 12 or Certificate II was 53.9 per cent-a 6.5 percentage point increase on 2006. This means progress against the target of halving the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Year 12 or equivalent attainment rates by 2020 is ahead of schedule. The report continues in addressing the fourth target, to halve the gap in reading, writing and numeracy between Indigenous and non-Indigenous within a decade: … between 2008 and 2012 the percentage of Indigenous students at or above the National Minimum Standards in Year3 Reading increased by 5.9 percentage points. However, overall progress is mixed. Of the eight cases where the NAPLAN results in 2012 can be compared to the progress points set for 2012, three results are above or close to the 2012 trajectory points. In the other five cases, progress will need to accelerate if the target is to be met. In her speech, the Prime Minister reflected these mixed results, including the fact that 'in year 9 writing the 2012 gap is almost double that-35 percentage points' and that 'year 3 reading actually declined in 2012 after improving between 2008 and 2011'. The Prime Minister stated: I cannot conceal that these literacy and numeracy results are a source of personal disappointment. I feel that we would all share that disappointment and would have a determination to turn those results around and, very importantly, sustain the achievements that have been made. The full report provides extensive details on the progress of all of the targets and the related initiatives aimed at achieving the target outcomes. I encourage members of the public who are interested in this issue to look at the full report. It is undoubtedly the case that health and life expectancy, housing and employment, and security and participation are all important components of a full life to which all Australians deserve access and which far too many Indigenous Australians are often blocked from achieving. To quote the Prime Minister once more, she said: It is the work of an entire generation and work that has begun with us. I feel that it is a heavy responsibility that we should gladly carry as it is inconceivable that we would put this task down and walk away, as too many have done in the past. I commend the Closing the gap report to the House and, in particular, encourage people to remain committed to achieving the six targets, as I am sure that all in this House remain committed to their achievement. the Prime Minister's speech on Closing the Gap. I would like to say from the outset that the Parkes electorate, after the seat of Lingiari, has more Aboriginal people than any other electorate in Australia. According to the 2011 census, there are 21,891 Aboriginal people in my electorate. I take the responsibility of representing those people in this place very seriously. I also take it as a great honour to represent those people. But, unfortunately, an Aboriginal boy born today in the electorate of Parkes has a life expectancy 15 years less than a white boy born on the same day. The median age of Aboriginal people in my electorate is just 21. That indicates that the life expectancy is, indeed, very short of the other end of the scale. I have been the member for Parkes for just over five years. Achieving things for Aboriginal people in my electorate has been my greatest challenge. I do not take any joy in the fact that, of the things I do as a member of parliament-things we can all achieve as members of parliament-I should be doing a lot better for Aboriginal communities. When representing Aboriginal people, it is all about personal contact. People ask me what the views are of my Aboriginal community, and I say, 'I haven't got an Aboriginal community; I've got a hundred Aboriginal communities.' Each of those communities is individual: each has its own thoughts, aspirations and problems. The nominated targets for Closing the Gap are very relevant to the people that I represent. This is not all about bad news. There are a lot of good things happening in my electorate. The Aboriginal Employment Strategy, which has been very successful, was spawned in the town of Moree. When I go around my schools, I see that the student leaders and some of the younger people are doing remarkable things. There was a young lad I first met when he was as a student at Moree High School. Last year he was a member of the youth parliament, and he came to Canberra and he mixed it with the best. He now works for a department here in Canberra and is into a successful career in the Public Service. But, as we talk about Closing the Gap, I think we need to do a lot better. There have been some government decisions made over the last five years that have been detrimental to some of my communities-for instance, the removal of the CDEP. While it was far from perfect, and while it was never intended to be permanent employment and in some cases ended up being such, it was at least something. When the CDEP was removed from the village of Toomelah, the overall situation in that community deteriorated quite a lot. Unfortunately, quite often, from Canberra, we do things with lines on maps. In 2008 Toomelah and Gunnedah-which was then in my electorate-Narrabri and Moree were no longer considered to be remote and so CDEP would be removed. Now that line has moved further west and the communities of Coonamble, Walgett and Lightening Ridge are going through the same pain. While in theory it may be fine, and these services will be replaced by other providers, it does not take into account the personal relationships that are involved in providing these services. In all these country towns, the personal relationships that you build over a period of time are particularly important. The other thing is that, if we are going to do the best thing by our Aboriginal people, we must not accept lower standards than we would for the rest of the community. By accepting lower standards and glossing over the problems, and praising things that are less than adequate, we disrespect those people we are trying to protect.",231,Ministerial Statements
212,Mr Coulton (Parkes,"The Nationals Chief Whip) (20:51): I rise tonight to speak onUnemployment is a big issue and is at the core of a lot of the problems in my communities. But it is not that there is a lack of work-unfortunately, the nature of my communities, and the nature of employment with agriculture, is such that a lot of the work that Aboriginal people did has now changed. The real challenge is to give the younger people the skills required to take up those positions. It is a great disappointment to me that we have people from all over the world working during the wheat and cotton harvest, and in the foundries, the workshops and the mechanical shops in my electorate that could be done by local people-but that has to be addressed through education. I would like to speak about another couple of issues. One of the programs I am working on at the moment is in relation to the coalition's Green Army policy, should there be a change of government at the next election. I would be very keen for a training program, particularly the Boggabilla-Toomelah area, into full-time work in skills of resource management-weed control, river bank stabilisation: outdoor manual work that would be appropriate and that these people would enjoy. On the Macquarie River trails there is a great program, RiverSmart, looking at highlighting the benefits of the river, basically to help ensure the health of the river but also to promote it for tourism. It is a wonderful opportunity for Aboriginal employment, not only in constructing walkways and things like that, but also in guiding and tourism type work. That is something that I certainly hope we can get off the ground. Another shining light in my electorate is the Currawah Adventist Aboriginal College. The Seventh Day Adventist Church have constructed a boarding school at the village of Gongolgon which is about 100 kilometres south of Brewarrina on the Bogan River. I went to the opening of the school and I was very, very impressed with what the Seventh Day Adventist Church are trying to achieve. They are drawing children, mainly from disadvantaged families and dysfunctional homes, from right across eastern Australia and the children are going to the school in the middle of, basically, nowhere. Those school children went to Canberra last year. They were well presented, enthusiastic and keen to learn about our parliament. They were as good as any school that I have escorted around this building. They were a real credit to the teachers and staff at the Currawah Adventist Aboriginal College, and those boys and girls were also a credit to themselves. That college is in danger of closing. They were hoping for some sort of financial assistance, maybe through Aboriginal Hostels Limited, particularly from the government to keep going. They will be in Parliament House tomorrow or the day after for some meetings to try and obtain funding assistance to keep the school open. That is real benefit and real achievement and is making a difference in these young people's lives. I would like to close by speaking about the Clontarf Foundation. I have just come from a function where the Governor General was the special guest as the Patron of the Clontarf Foundation. Of all the programs I have seen since I have been an member of parliament in any sphere I have never seen a program that has been more successful in obtaining the outcomes that they desire than the Clontarf Foundation. The foundation have four academies in my electorate that have been open for less than 12 months. Last Tuesday morning I had the privilege of attending the Clontarf Academy in Moree. I went on the bus with the tutors and we picked up the kids from their homes. The sun was not up-it was pitch black-but the kids were ready to go. We had an hour of training in rugby league. It started off in Perth with Aussie Rules but it has been adapted in New South Wales to Rugby League. Twelve months ago many of the boys were not attending school. One boy had missed a whole year of school. They were now enthusiastic and were attending school. They were polite and respectful and they had a real purpose in their lives. As a member of parliament very rarely do you actually get to see a program that works like that. There are many places where the Clontarf Foundation could roll out. At the moment, I think, there are 9,000 boys in the academies across Australia. The foundation have identified double that number that could benefit from the academy. I would recommend all members in this place to look at the work of the Clontarf Foundation. There is a great potential to help the boys in Dubbo, Wellington, Nyngan, Cobar, Lake Cargelligo, Condobolin, Narrabri, Walgett and any other number of possibilities. Tonight we heard from a man, Geoffrey, who is 28 and who started with the academy as a teenager. He was a wayward Aboriginal boy and is now fully employed as a boilermaker working in a mine. He has a partner and two children. The Clontarf Foundation have helped him all along the way and now he is being a real father to his son and daughter. He spoke tonight-and it is as good a speech as I have ever heard in this place-about his lifelong journey from an errant boy who was not attending school to a proud father with full time employment raising two children in Western Australia, if anyone wants an endorsement of what this can do. The apology given by Kevin Rudd in 2008 is still very special to the Aboriginal people in my electorate. They talk about it still. That was a milestone. But we really need to embrace programs that work. We need to accept no less a standard for our Aboriginal brothers and sisters than we do for ourselves, and we need to put our energy, our emotion and our commitment into genuinely closing the gap so that by the time these children are adults the Aboriginal community and the Australian community are one, in every aspect of their lives. the Opposition for their fine speeches in parliament in relation to Closing the Gap targets, delivered annually. Across Australia, according to Reconciliation Australia, governments spend about $25 billion a year on programs aimed at closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. But, sadly, the trust between both groups is still too low, and there is still perceived prejudice between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Nearly half of all Australians believe it is harder to achieve success if you are an Indigenous person. But we have seen some improvements. We have seen betterment of our Indigenous brothers and sisters, but it has been too slow-painfully slow. We have seen reconciliation action plans initiate so many improvements in the lives of people, and I commend those companies-there are currently about 358 organisations with reconciliation action plans. These are focused on employment, Indigenous business and education, and there are even pro bono organisations. There are others concerned with cultural competency. It is known that reconciliation action plans improve the contact between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. The attitudes-the pride, the prejudice-will go. And they improve trust. As the Chair of the Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs in the House of Representatives, along with the deputy chair, the member for Murray, I have written to the presiding officers because there is no reconciliation action plan in this parliament. We are urging the presiding officers to think of a reconciliation action plan for this particular place.",237,Ministerial Statements
213,Mr Neumann (Blair) (21:05,"I want to commend the Prime Minister and the Leader ofThere are a number of other things I want to say, but first I want to mention the fine speech by the former Attorney-General, the member for Barton, and commend him on his 25th Lionel Murphy lecture: 'Vigilance against injustice in the justice system'. As I heard him speaking tonight I recognised the tenor of that speech. I commend to those who may be listening, and to other members, this fantastic speech by the former Attorney-General in relation to the challenges regarding the injustice that is experienced by Indigenous Australians. When we did the Doing time-time for doing report we discovered, as the member for Barton said, that in the 20 years since the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody the condition and situation for Indigenous Australians has got worse. Indigenous juveniles are 28 times as likely to be in detention as non-Indigenous juveniles. Indigenous juveniles make up more than one-half of the detainee population on any given day in Australia. Indigenous young adults are 15 times as likely to be in prison as nonIndigenous young adults. Sadly, the dysfunction continues across generations: poverty, despair and despondency-simply the expectation that as a rite of passage you would visit and live with your parents and grandparents in incarceration premises. We made many recommendations in our report. These were motivated by the prisoner census data, which show that between 2000 and 2010 the number of Indigenous men and women in custody increased by 55 per cent in the case of men and 47 per cent in the case of women, and also that if you were an Indigenous woman you were 35 times as likely to be hospitalised by partner abuse as a non-Indigenous woman. We made many recommendations to the government: endorsing justice targets that states and territories in the Commonwealth could come to, supporting an inclusion of safe community building blocks, and also putting serious money towards getting agreement across the jurisdictions for this. We also recognised the social norms that impacted families and communities through mentoring, sport and recreation: the fact that there were fewer people able to be mentors to Indigenous boys particularly; the fact that FASD-foetal alcohol spectrum disorder-was such a curse, particularly in Indigenous communities. I commend to the government the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, chaired by the member for Moreton, and its many recommendations in relation to FASD-a report which flowed from our Doing time report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs. I commend the many recommendations made. The idea that finally FASD be recognised as a registered disability-that is, a condition for eligibility for support services in health and education systems-is something which needs to be done in this country. We also need to look at better alternatives to Indigenous young people entering the criminal justice system. We need a more holistic intervention. The New Zealanders had Maori youth courts. We have not got much empirical evidence across the Tasman, but we can certainly see that the anecdotal evidence supports alternative systems for Indigenous people. Sadly-I did not intend to make a political speech here-the Murri courts in my home state of Queensland have been closed down by the LNP state government. This is a terribly retrograde step, a really bad result for the Queensland community, and I think it is going to cost the Queensland community not only in dollars but also in social justice. We need to make sure that we look at education. One of the things we discovered was that schools which were connected to Indigenous communities did better-their kids did better. A perfect example of that is in my community. We have a very large Indigenous community in Ipswich; we have Indigenous medical centres and schools, but Leichardt State School-Lee Gerchow is the principal there-is probably as well connected to its 25 per cent Indigenous school population as any other school in Ipswich. The school's improved results since its better connection with the Indigenous community are outstanding. We have put a lot of money in there-$723,000 recently for support programs, mentoring and cultural improvements-but that is because the school took the initiative; that is important. We should focus more upon that in our school communities. Simple things like amplification devices in schools-too many Indigenous young people cannot hear properly, and we need to think seriously about that; more school pools and better pools and recreation facilities in Indigenous communities. Things like alternative accommodation-we found that too often Indigenous people had nowhere to go so were kept in detention-and alternatives for bail so that they can get out. We do not have the data collection in this country to see the full extent of the challenges we face. The member for Barton, in his fine speech in the Lionel Murphy lecture, talks about these issues. The government has taken up many of these things that we have recommended, and I urge it to be more vigilant about those sorts of things. One of the things that our committee has recommended-the government is yet to respond; it is to do with Closing the Gap-deals with a report called Our land our languages. We dealt with what Paul Keating said in his Redfern speech: … bizarre conceit that this continent had no owners prior to the settlement of Europeans … Mabo was a very controversial decision on 3 June 1992. At the time of white settlement in this country, there were 250 Indigenous languages; there are now only 18 viable Indigenous languages in this country spoken across all generations. We have not done enough maintenance on the revitalisation of Indigenous languages. There is so much more that we can do. In our report Our land our languages, we made an number of recommendations, including the recommendation to: … include in the Closing the Gap framework acknowledgement of the fundamental role and importance of Indigenous languages in preserving heritage and improving outcomes for Indigenous peoples. We have recommended twice now-twice-a national Indigenous interpreter service. We did it in our Doing time report-it had been done 20 years before in a previous parliamentary report-and we did it again in Our land our languages. We recommended to the government a national interpreter service, and I urge the government to think about this. Too many people go to jail, too many people get poor diagnoses on health outcomes-go to the Northern Territory and you will find this-and too many kids have an inadequate education because we have not got a national interpreter service. We need that, and we have recommended it to the government in the Our land our languages and Doing time reports. We have, through the Doing time report, come up with another inquiry-it is underway and we are going to report in May-that is, the role of sport in closing the gap. The participation rate in sport for non-Indigenous Australians is 74.3 per cent, while, sadly, it is only 65.5 per cent for Indigenous Australians. The difference is even worse for Indigenous women. The reality is that not enough sporting organisations have reconciliation plans. The evidence we have heard in the public hearings is that the AFL and the NRL are doing a great job; they are doing great work. Some of the sporting organisations, at our public hearings and on the public record, could not even tell us how many Indigenous people play their sports. They could not tick a box; they could not tell us what efforts they were making to help Indigenous young people. There is not enough sporting equipment-not enough barbells and dumbbells, tennis courts, pools, football fields and basketball courts, not enough basketballs and footballs-and sporting organisations just go in there, fly-in fly-out, do a clinic, and then go away and leave these people on their own again. Not enough effort is being made in sport to close the gap. I look forward to our report and deliberations. I expect it to be a bipartisan report, as were the other two. The member for Murray has been a tremendous advocate in this area; we have worked very closely on this issue. I expect some very strong recommendations from this committee in relation to this issue, but we have a lot to do. It is not just about plucking elite athletes from Far North Queensland and the Northern Territory to go and play in the NRL and the AFL; there is a lot more that we can do. The member for Dunkley mentioned business. We are doing a lot in helping business. In my area, we have an Indigenous Business Enterprise Centre established with seed funding from DEEWR-federal government funding. We have seen 85 Indigenous people go into full-time work in 18 months in my community; the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre has an Indigenous focus as well. I want to give an example of a particular individual. I am proud to say I have his painting of honey ants in my electorate office. His name is Robin 'Tallman' Wakkajinda and he is a local artist. He had drug problems and he had alcohol problems. He comes from Gayndah, from the Wakka Wakka Jinda tribe. He is a mentor. This fellow is a fantastic artist. He has turned his life around with the support of the local IBEC. He is a business success. I was pleased to be there with the Mayor of Ipswich, Paul Pisasale, to help open Robin's exhibition of his paintings at the Old Ipswich Courthouse. They are brilliant. I have seen this fellow go around with young Indigenous people in my community. They love him. Sadly, he is disabled in his hand, but he is one of the most brilliant artists you could ever see. His artwork sells for lots of money and he has turned his life around. He is a business success. He has talent, and with the support of great people like Clive Pearce, from the Ipswich Business Enterprise Centre, he has succeeded. This is the sort of help that we can provide. The funding was given via a flexible funding pool to develop and pilot a unique enterprise program in Ipswich. This is an Australian-first initiative, and that is what we have got to do. I am all for rights, but we have got to have responsibility as well. People have got to pick themselves up. We can give them a helping hand to do that and we have got to get them on their way. We live in a free enterprise economy. People want to develop their talents and their dreams and their potential, and 'Tallman' is a perfect example. If we do this across the country, the member for Dunkley will be proved wrong. We can do it. We should fund it. Have a look at those reports. We should support the likes of the IBEC in Ipswich with additional funding. It is an Australian first. This should be a prototype for Indigenous business enterprise centres across the country. We should do it. I commend the Closing the Gap target. This will help in closing the gap if we do it across the country. they are moved by the plight of Indigenous Australia. Attitudes and knowledge vary markedly from our major cities where many people have met few Aboriginals and have little first hand knowledge of the issues and circumstances facing people of Aboriginal descent, to regional towns and outback communities where residents deal with the reality of Indigenous communities living within their midst, with both the successes-and there are many-and the excesses and failures of the system and individuals and the penalties the larger community pays for those failures. It was encouraging to hear the Prime Minister report the increase in mainstream Indigenous employment from 42.4 per cent in 2006 to 44.7 per cent in 2012. While I have no hard figures to back this up, I think I can see small but positive improvement in my major regional communities, in places like Port Lincoln, Port Augusta and Ceduna, where there is apparent growth in Aboriginal families with mum or dad, or both, at work, living in better housing, driving better cars and getting their children to school. There is still quite a way to go in many instances, but I sense that progress is being made. Employment is simply one of the most important, if latter, keys to the puzzle. I say 'latter' because long-term productive employment is very difficult to achieve if an individual has poor education, poor language skills and a negative experience of being raised in a dysfunctional household. This is no truer with Indigenous communities than with the population at large. Not having a stable and loving household, good language skills and a reasonable education does not mean an individual cannot break the barriers and become a productive, fully integrated member of our society, but it elevates the degree of difficulty many times. So while the apparent rise in employment is encouraging, it is a concern that by far the majority of Indigenous jobs are in the government sector and, more particularly, in the Aboriginal industry. That sector should play an important role, but we will never achieve true equality in Australia until the workforce is truly integrated. While we have jobs that are perceived as black or white, prejudices are reinforced rather than broken down. It is important for the general advancement of Indigenous Australians that they are seen as 100 per cent part of mainstream Australia, and to do so they need to be represented in the mainstream workforce at similar levels to the mainstream population. However, I add a point of balance and congratulate those in the resources sector who have made a dedicated effort to raise Indigenous employment. Overall, I am more encouraged than discouraged with the progress in employment in regional centres. However, it is in the remote communities where I fear outcomes are at best stagnant. All of the remote Indigenous communities in South Australia are in my electorate. Aboriginal communities like Oak Valley and Yalata in the west, Nepabunna in the central region and the APY lands in the far north are joined by regular towns of mixed populations like Coober Pedy, Oodnadatta and Marree. In all, those who identify as Aboriginal in my electorate make up about seven per cent of the population, or 10,000 persons. Of that, about 4,000 live in remote communities. The biggest group of these live in remote, isolated Indigenous lands, and by far the best known of these are the Anangu, Pitjantjatjara and Yankunytjatjara lands in the far north-western corner of the state, where about 2,500 people live. The APY lands are by no means the only area where the problems exist, but they are a",239,Ministerial Statements
214,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (21:20,"Regardless of where Australians live, there is little doubtvery useful tool for assessing the issues facing communities closer to the mainstream because they are in every way isolated from the rest of the state. It is in the APY lands where the gap is the largest and, despite the very best efforts and an annual expenditure by the taxpayer of between $150 million and $250 million-it seems that no-one has any real idea how much-it is difficult to see progress. It is worth pointing out that this is around about $100,000 a head. Huge amounts have been invested in housing, schools and health clinics. While further housing would be desirable, these physical facilities are by and large very good-the kinds of facilities that most communities in Australia would be happy with. But it occurs to me that despite the best efforts of those who work within them, the net result in most cases is no improvement. There is a paradox that exists in these communities. I try to visit the APY lands a couple of times a year. It is a one-week trip each time. My guess is that there are around about 80 different organisations on the lands, government and non-government, all trying to make a contribution to improving the lot of the locals. When I speak to people from any of these organisations they give convincing and enthusiastic evidence that they are making a real difference and closing the gap, if you like. I must say that when I look at the work most times I am convinced. However-and here is the rub-if all these programs and organisations were doing such a good job, then why aren't we making progress? Why in most cases are things getting worse? Why are there communities that are theoretically at least alcohol free with still unacceptably high levels of alcoholand drugdriven violence? Why is there sexual assault on minors, very poor school attendance, astronomical incidence rates of diseases like diabetes and impaired hearing in up to 95 per cent of the children? Noel Pearson has argued far more eloquently than I ever will that the root cause of these evils is passive welfare. He is right. Helping people is a double-edged sword. When we assume responsibility for a commitment in a person's life that would normally be their responsibility, we diminish their future obligation to perform the task. Eventually, if we do it often enough, everything becomes the government's responsibility. Apart from the art centres, there are almost no business enterprises on the lands that provide employment outcomes that are not dependent on government. They are the only businesses on the lands that produce a tradeable resource, thus actually providing genuine market-driven work-related income to the communities. In the very high expense environment of the APY lands, even the art centres are not able to be self-supporting industries and require ongoing taxpayer support. However, they are the best that we have and I congratulate them for their progress and sincerely hope that the market will continue to support the growth of these centres. Virtually all other jobs related to income come courtesy of the taxpayer in industries providing services to the rest of the population or in environment driven jobs where locals are funded to care for country. It is worth noting as this parliament is presented with more legislation on native title that the APY lands are owned freehold by the communities. That is not title guaranteeing access, not traditional ownership and not pastoral leases but the most secure title to land availablefreehold. It was gifted to the Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara people by the Tonkin Liberal government in 1981. While I support Indigenous people to establish their links with the land, I send a strong word of caution to those who think that ownership in any form is the silver bullet that will address the breakdown of traditional culture. The APY lands are a 32-year demonstration that that is clearly not the case. In so many areas, things are no worse, and that is certainly in the area of employment, alcohol and drug abuse and levels of literacy. In fact, in some ways I wonder if the granting of ownership has made things worse. One would wonder how that could possibly be. Perhaps there was an air of expectation that with ownership would come wealth and the work to generate that worth was expected to be performed by others. Certainly jobs on committees and on boards, accompanied by cars and travel benefits, are seen as real jobs. Jobs cleaning schools and health centres cannot be filled and have to be performed by teaching and medical staff. Perhaps it was the interfamily battles over the spoils that to this day debilitates attempts at governance. Appalling governance has led to repeated failures. The APY Lands Council, for instance, has once again just recently been bailed out by the state government to compensate for funds that have been lost to shoddy management. If we are truly to close the gap, there must be a consolidation of the plethora of local boards ultimately funded by taxpayers on the lands. The amalgamated bodies must be given more responsibility but also face a far greater responsibility to meet the same demands of probity that local government must meet. If these bodies cannot meet those levels, as with any local government that suffers chronic failure, administration must be installed. Part of the malaise of remote Indigenous Australia is that we set a lower expectation of Indigenous communities. That is, we set the bar lower. Eventually this is totally unproductive and leads to accepting lower employment performance, lower standards in schools and lower levels of compliance with the law of the land. The idea that we accept this because people are Aboriginal is condescending. It is offensive and racist and should not be accommodated. I will draw your attention to the schooling system for a short while. Tens of millions of dollars have been spent on schools on the APY Lands-in one case as much as $4 million at a school which is now closed barely four years later. Yet for all this expenditure, according to the study collated by Professor Mark Hughes, an academic extremely well regarded in this area, South Australia is the worse performing state in Australia in Indigenous education, according to the NAPLAN information. The schools in themselves are fascinating and seem to be mostly staffed by dedicated teachers. Teacher-student ratios are extremely low. Breakfast and, in some cases, lunch programs are common. A plethora of travel, excursion and life education programs exist. Yet attendance rates are appalling. The attendance issue is exacerbated by cultural activities, with perhaps the most disruptive and unpredictable being sorry camps. These camps are yet another example of how the culture of the Indigenous peoples has been distorted by its head-on collision with the modern world. I visited a sorry camp that had been sitting for almost 6 weeks, camped in the rubbish which accumulates around such camps and within 800 metres of a small town with running water, toilets, housing and showers that was empty for the duration. There were infants in the arms of mothers amongst the flies and filth, and children some hundreds of kilometres from home, absent for weeks from their normal schools. Traditionally, the deceased would have been buried within a day or two. The cultural guardians of the Anangu simply must sort this issue out, and I acknowledge that they are making some efforts to do so in this area. To return to the schools, apart from sorry, attendance is still an issue, and I am pleased that at least there has been a move to income management on the lands, albeit as a voluntary model at this stage. More than 250 people have signed on to the program, and it is at least implied that the compulsory management may be enforced if parents fail to get their children to school, although it is yet to be seen whether governments are prepared to commit to the tough love required to enforce this outcome. I watch that space. Classroom teachers are faced with the dilemma of trying to get children to school with no other incentive than making learning a fun experience with small bribes. It is concerning to see children dribbling into schools over an extended period in the morning. This is hardly an ideal start to the day. The problem with having to be constantly entertaining and fun is that the core tenets of education get demoted. This is a tragedy because we know that those lessons are the ones which will, in the long term, deliver the mainstream jobs that I spoke about earlier. I have spoken before in this place about my visit to Cape York, and I am very pleased the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth is here to hear this. The Cape York Institute is run under the direct instruction method by Noel Pearson, and I can only say that all of Australia's remote communities should be interested in the package. I urge the South Australian government to at least make the package available at some trial sites in the state. All of this raises this issue of the difficulty of ever closing the gap in this remote world where there is no genuine economy. Certainly we must support these communities and allow the adults of today to live their lives as best we can provide for. But every effort must be made to break the cycle and educate the next generation to equip the new generation, as Noel Pearson says, to walk in both worlds. That means having good English language skills. It means having strong basic maths and an understanding of the social demands of living in the outside community. Denying these children those keys means that they are tied to a region where there are few jobs, and it will condemn them to the uselessness of a life on welfare. I do not doubt the good intent of the political class in Australia to address the deep-seated problems of remote Indigenous Australia. But I think in so many cases we are addressing the symptoms rather than trying to apply a long-term vision to the issues at hand. What is needed is an independent analysis of the economic possibilities of the communities and honest assessments of the population these communities are capable of properly supporting, and then making appropriate and evidence-based decisions about their future. Maintaining, supporting and encouraging new generations to live in communities that cannot ever support them will not only destroy the individuals but will destroy the culture of those whose future we are seeking to advance. Youth) (21:35): I want to follow on from the member for Grey's contribution and spend a moment reflecting on and acknowledging some of those remarks that the member made. It is the case that he serves an electorate where there is a significant amount of social disadvantage amongst people, particularly those living on what is referred to as the APY lands. The member posed the question to the parliament: why aren't we making progress? He was also prudent enough to acknowledge that the political class, as he put it, does want to see delivery of greater achievement potential for people in regional and remote Australia for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people but thus far, notwithstanding the amounts have been appropriated to the goals and the many programs and efforts of a range of successive",243,Ministerial Statements
215,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith,"Minister for School Education, Early Childhood andgovernments both at the national level and at the state level, we cannot say with any great degree of pride that we have succeeded. I do not presume to have the intimate knowledge of the member's electorate that he has, but I think part of the answer, particularly when we look at the educational attainment levels of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in remote communities, is the remoteness. The fact is that Aboriginal people are in a particularly difficult situation if they are still living effectively within clan culture on country and a long way away from the services and the economic and social activity that characterise our regional centres, our suburban Australia and our cities. The disjunct between the way in which people still want to live there and the way in which the remainder of the Australian polity organises itself is a great one. Like the member, I have been to a number of communities and seen what I think are some signs of disengagement that are at such a level that you really do wonder what the prospects for young people growing up in these communities will be. At the same time you see underneath that the great strength of family and culture that has seen people occupy these lands for tens of thousands of years. In part it is the time that we live in, the time that we are here as legislators, as politicians, in this parliament when we are witnessing that great gap. I think it is to the parliament's credit and to the credit of governments that there has been a national intention to try and close the gap, recognising that it is there, and that the Council of Australian Governments itself, the highest council in the land, if you like, has set itself this task. But it is by no means easy and I do not think there are any quick or convenient solutions. One thing I do know is that we have to persevere, that we have to have open and honest dialogue. We have got to try policy initiatives but we have also at all times got to engage and involve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the future. I want to communicate to the member for Grey that I have had some invitations to visit the APY lands. I hope to get out to that part of Australia sometime in the not-too-distant future. As I was remarking, the Closing the Gap framework has six targets set by the Council of Australian Governments. It is a national approach to close the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. We did have some good news from the Prime Minister recently when she spoke to the parliament and reported on Closing the Gap and also an identification of the areas in which we need to do much better. We do know that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children do start school developmentally behind. So it was particularly satisfying that the Prime Minister was able to announce that the first of the six targets had actually been met, and that is that all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander four-year-olds in remote communities have access to early childhood education by 2013. That is particularly important for the prospects of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on community, because it is at the very early stage of life when their brains are still in what is described as a high degree of plasticity, and also learning habits as well both of young people and mums in particular can be engendered and there can be confidence that when kids go into a schooling system, which is quite often subject to disruption, as the member for Grey pointed out, that they are able to still keep learning. I also want to reflect on the levels of investment from government. I do sometimes hear contributions and read commentary about whether or not money is or is not well spent. WhatI can say is that with the investments we are putting in the National Partnership Agreement on Early Childhood Education, we are seeing more children than ever participate in preschool or kindergarten programs. SoI think to that extent with this result it is definitely an investment that is bearing some fruit. We are also on track to half the gap in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander year-12 attainment or equivalent attainment rates by 2020. That is pretty important, because the transition from school to work is one which is a significant and sometimes almost unreachable journey for many young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Halving that gap in year 12 attainment is a huge part in equipping them for the prospects of either future study or potentially work as well. I want to quickly addressed in NAPLAN tests as well, because we did have disappointing results in the 2012 NAPLAN tests. I think it is important to remember that the trend from 2008 to 2011 was actually quite encouraging and we need to keep building on that. We will have ACARA, the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority, examine the 2012 student performance to see if there are underlying reasons in that result. I can actually identify some of the reasons, particularly in the Warlpiri triangle, where we have a growing population of young people enrolled in school but in an area that has been subject to some significant community unrest over the last 18 months to two years. There, I think, the opportunities that children had to attend school regularly unfortunately were reduced; notwithstanding that, we are seeing improvements, particularly in reading. We are seeing some improvements in year-3 reading both across Australia and more specifically in some of the states with a high proportion of Aboriginal kids in remote communities. We are also seeing some improvements in year-5 numeracy. But there is no question that there is much more to be done. What do we need to do in terms of making sure that we are maximising the opportunities for young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students to both achieve well at school and go on to work as well? One of the things that has been particularly important has been to do work with another eminent Aboriginal educator, Dr Chris Sarra, and his Focus Schools Next Steps Initiative, to which we provided significant assistance-funding of about $30 million. There are a number of focus schools where the focus is particularly in this case on improving school attendance, on classroom engagement and the academic achievement of around 9,000 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students. That is done in cooperation with states and territories who are running the government school systems where the majority of young Aboriginal students are, through the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan agreed by the states to support children's readiness for school, building good practice in schools, developing community based school leadership and parental engagement, and boosting attendance and literacy and numeracy. There is significant investment from this government of around $128 million. The plan identifies 55 actions at a national, systemic and local level. It has been endorsed by COAG. I think the key thing about the plan is that it is not just a bunch of words that governments have agreed to; it is a set of specific actions, which we need to see every single school that has a proportion of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander students attending, apply themselves to. It is my intention, under the National Plan for School Improvement-the response by the government to the recommendations of the Gonski review-that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Action Plan will be given greater focus. I am disappointed that in some states we have not seen school systems apply themselves specifically to that plan, given the amount of work that went into it and the fact that it identifies the range of components that you need to have operating at the same time in a school setting over a consistent period in order to increase Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander student attainment. As the members listening would know, we have investments in Stronger Futures in the Northern Territory, and that includes some school attendance measures which are described. And we are providing an additional 200 teachers for literacy and numeracy support. Of course, we have maintained support for the school nutrition program at a cost of around $9 million per year in the Northern Territory. People and members listening would know that this government-and governments in the past-have provided support through ABSTUDY. As well, we have provided opportunities for students to attend school through boarding facilities. I want to speak briefly about attendance, because attendance is one of the greatest challenges in making sure that young Aboriginal students can progress through their school careers. Regrettably, attendance is poor from day 1 in year 1, and it gets worse by year 10. I can see, in Western Australia for example, government schools recording a gap of 13 per cent between year 1 Indigenous students and others. And that gap goes up to 24 per cent by year 10. The figures are actually worse in the Northern Territory. My School reports attendance rates for all schools. For schools in Indigenous communities that have a 100 per cent, or almost 100 per cent, Indigenous school body, there is a year-onyear tracking of attendance. But the fact is that without attending school consistently, young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students will not develop the skills and education levels necessary to effectively operate in the job market so that they can take care of themselves over time and support their families and their communities-nor will they reach their full potential. It is something that requires urgent attention. I know that it is on the minds of education ministers, teachers and others working in the regions but it is something that requires commitment by communities and families, as well, recognising that a good education for a young Indigenous student is a passport out of poverty. We do now have schools and teachers who are ready, willing and able to teach, but it is important, now, that the kids are at school. I attended the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Education Conference in Darwin in 2011. We had a range of presentations, including by principals of schools where they had succeeded in bringing their kids through both primary school and secondary school by doing a number of things. They underscored the priority areas: readiness for school; engagement and connection with community; attendance, which I have referred to; leadership in quality teaching and workforce development; and consideration of the post-school opportunities. Where these six areas have been addressed by leadership in schools, through the principal and the teaching community, and where the community and family-and, where necessary, local authorities-are engaged, then we start to see a difference in education outcomes. When I look at a school like Bega Valley Public School in New South Wales, where students are benefiting from strong leadership and evidence based whole-school processes monitoring performance, I see targeted support at the school, personalised learning plans and the employment of an Aboriginal school learning support officer-just those things. This is not that far from here-just down the coast-and what have we got? We have NAPLAN results show an increase in the proportion of students who achieve above the national minimum standards in year 5 in reading and numeracy by 26 per cent and 21 per cent respectively over 2008 and 2011. As well, the proportion of highest performing students in year 5 reading and numeracy have increased by 30 per cent and 20 per cent respectively. Another example that is well known to some of us is Cairns West State School in Queensland-again, concerted case management, a teacher coaching program underpinned by high expectations, and significant improvements in results in the school. At the end of the day, we will continue to commit ourselves to closing the gap. In this parliament, that is amongst our most urgent tasks. Some progress has been made. We acknowledge it and we welcome it, but we recognise that there is a great deal more that we need to do. member for Grey and certainly the member for Kingsford Smith, the education minister. I know the work he has done through his music, with Midnight Oil, to help the Indigenous cause in singles such as The Dead Heart, Beds are Burning, and Truganini. We can all sing along-as I often do when I am driving to Canberra on a Sunday night-to Midnight Oil. I do not always agree with the member for Kingsford Smith, but certainly his music touched the hearts of many. At a time when Indigenous issues were far more controversial than they are now, he helped in some sense to close the gap before Closing the Gap really became a common phrase in Australia. I know he has worked as a parliamentarian since 2004, and I acknowledge him for that-for doing what he can to help bridge that divide between Indigenous Australia and the rest of society. In 2008 the Council of Australian Governments committed to six targets to help close the gap for Indigenous Australians. These targets relate to life expectancy, infant mortality, education and employment. Closing the gap-Prime Minister's report 2013 outlines that there are still serious gaps across the board. Even the Prime Minister herself has stated her personal disappointment that it appears that they are failing to close the gap. I commend the Prime Minister for her words in opening this particular-I will not call it a debate-series of speeches. It is not a debate; it has bipartisan support, for something that really is important to all Australians. I also recall the fine words of the opposition leader, who goes out of his way each and every year to live amongst Aboriginal communities to see how tough they are doing it. I know that if the coalition is fortunate enough to be voted in as the government and he becomes the Prime Minister he will do some fabulous work in this important area for all Australians and particularly for Indigenous Australians. Currently Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders live substantially shorter lives than the rest of the Australian population-up to 20 years less in some cases, with the current gap generally estimated at 11½ years for males and 9.7 years for females. That is not acceptablenot in this day and age. It is simply unacceptable. Over the past 30 to 40 years there has been a decline in Indigenous mortality rates while life expectancy has increased, and that is good. While the rise in life expectancy is good, it will be challenging to meet the target. Whilst working towards increasing Indigenous life expectancy, non-Indigenous life expectancy will",246,Ministerial Statements
216,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (21:50,"It is a pleasure to follow my colleague thealso be on the rise. The 2013 report says that the target of closing the gap on life expectancy will not be met until 2031, and that is still a long 18 years away. Health outcomes also need to be achieved to help combat mortality rates, with circulatory disease, cancer, injuryincluding, sadly suicide-respiratory disease, and endocrine, metabolic and nutritional disorders being the leading causes of Indigenous mortality between 2006 and 2010. The target to halve the gap in mortality rates for Indigenous children under five years of age by 2018 is on track, thankfully, and can be achieved, based on mortality rates between 1998 and 2011 declining at a rate of 29 per cent, faster than the decline in non-Indigenous mortality rates. Ensuring access to early childhood education for all Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities by 2018 is set to be achieved this year-and that is fantastic. The target sets the benchmark at 95 per cent. It is a shame it is not 100 per cent, but 95 per cent at this stage, given what would have been the case perhaps even only a decade ago, is still certainly a staggeringly good statistic. Data from the new National Early Childhood Education and Care Collection showed that 91 per cent of Indigenous children in remote areas were enrolled in preschool programs in August 2011. The Prime Minister's report states this target will be met, based on the latest available data and the commitment by state and territory ministers to the target. Progress on halving the gap in reading, writing and numeracy achievements for Indigenous children by 2018 has been only mixed, based on NAPLAN data. Currently, only three of the eight literacy and numeracy outcomes are on track to be reached by 2018. That is unfortunate. The data also revealed that Indigenous students in metropolitan areas are achieving significantly higher results in literacy and numeracy than those in rural areas. We all know that the tyranny of distance is such a factor in that regard. Seven per cent of constituents in the member for Grey's electorate are Indigenous and I know how remote some parts of his electorate are. I have visited those areas of the Northern Territory and Western Australia and even New South Wales and outer Queensland where the great distances are certainly a factor in disadvantaging Aboriginal children. There is promising progress on halving the gap for Indigenous students in year 12 or equivalent attainment rate by 2020, with the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians closing by 4.3 per cent, whilst attainment rates amongst Indigenous students grew faster than amongst non-Indigenous students. However, to meet the target there will need to be continued rapid improvements from 2011 to 2016, according to the Prime Minister's report. The 2011 census data shows the gap in total employment outcomes has widened since 2006 by 2.2 percentage points, which is due to a decrease in the proportion of Indigenous Australians aged between 16 and 24 against a rise by non-Indigenous Australians in employment. This data works against the target of halving the gap in employment outcomes between Indigenous and other Australians by 2018. My electorate of Riverina had almost 7,000 Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander persons identified in the 2011 census, with a very young median age of 20 and an almost 50-50 split between men and women. I spoke with Roger Penrith, who is the Indigenous community liaison officer at the Griffith City Council, to ask him what outcomes he would like to see achieved under Closing the Gap. BeforeI talk about Mr Penrith's comments, I should commend also the member for Gippsland on his extraordinary contribution to this series of speeches earlier this evening, in which he spoke of his personal experiences but also of the outcomes that they are achieving in his Gippsland electorate. It was, as I say, quite a remarkably good speech. The member for Gippsland always makes good speeches, but this one was of particular relevance. Anybody who is perhaps reading these words should backtrack in the Hansard to a bit earlier in the evening and read that contribution by the member for Gippsland. It was quite a wonderful speech. Mr Penrith identified four key areas which need further attention in his local community. These were health, housing, community and aboriginality. Whilst there are some key improvements amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, Mr Penrith mentioned that there are still a number of ongoing health issues that Indigenous persons in his area are struggling to overcome. Many people are still not seeking medical treatment for matters relating to the eyes, ears, nose and throat and in Griffith there are a large number of Aboriginal children who are not being treated for otitis media, an ear infection which can have long-lasting effects on hearing. Many Aboriginal people are also not seeking dental treatment, which has the potential to create further health issues. Oral health is such an important issue amongst all Australians, but it is particularly important for Indigenous Australians. Whilst a simple filling may not seem like a life-and-death matter, the risk of infection increases and, in turn, has the potential to make someone extremely ill. If Aborigines were accessing dental care, this may be able to circumvent later medical visits for illnesses related to the initial problem. The issue of child mental health, which Mr Penrith raised with me, has also been brought to my attention by many other Griffith organisations. People of Griffith would love to see a headspace organisation in their region. I have spoken to the member for Reid about a petition I have received with almost 2½ thousand signatures and he is helping me to ensure that it is tabled in parliament, because Griffith and the entire Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area needs such a facility to help give children, particularly Aboriginal children, a place to go to seek assistance in a friendly and safe environment. There are serious concerns about access to emergency housing for clients. Mr Penrith signalled that whilst there are houses designated for Aboriginal people these are also being offered to non-Aboriginal persons. A wealth of talent and experience is held by many Aborigines within the business community. The Griffith City Council would like to see more enterprise opportunities made available by both state and federal governments for Aboriginal business, as well as more consolidated funding and better funding opportunities. Griffith is an extremely multicultural city-it puts out flags for 100 different nations on Australia Day. I believe it is the cradle for multiculturalism in Australia. There are concerns about non-Indigenous persons getting access to assistance reserved for those who are Indigenous. There is a feeling amongst the local Indigenous community that a more stringent process needs to be put in place to ensure that funding which is directed towards only those who are eligible and need it the most actually reaches that particular group of people. One organisation in the area which is making great progress in helping Indigenous students gain year 12 qualification or equivalent attainment rates by 2020 is Tirkandi Inaburra, located between Coleambally and Darlington Point. Tirkandi Inaburra is managed by Anthony Paulson and is a community-run development and education centre offering Aboriginal boys aged between 12 and 15 a residential program aimed at reducing future contact with the justice system by strengthening cultural identity, self-esteem and resilience. I heard a lot of the speakers earlier this evening talking about the higher than proportional incarceration rates for Indigenous people. This is something that really needs addressing, not just by people in this place but by our state parliamentarians as well, to ensure that those incarceration rates are substantially lowered. To be eligible to apply to become students at the wonderful Tirkandi Inaburra centre, the boys must live in communities located between the Lachlan and the Murray and between Balranald and the western side of the Blue Mountains. The boys must be prepared to make a commitment. They must be first time and/or non-serious offenders who are willing to make the shift to change their lives. They may be dropping out of school and are catching the attention of the police. If successful, the boys embark on a threeto six-month journey where they engage in educational, sporting, recreational, life, living skills and cultural activities which have been developed especially to develop their skills and abilities. The shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs and Deputy Leader of the Nationals, Nigel Scullion, has visited this centre and believes it is so good it should be replicated across Australia. It is unfortunate that this is currently the only centre in Australia offering this particular opportunity. We should be promising more such centres in an effort to help achieve the goal of more graduates by 2020 and, in doing so, to help close the gap. Australia is on the way to closing the gap, but there is still significant work to be done by governments right across the country. Speaking of Tirkandi Inaburra, I had a visit on 20 February with the Clontarf Foundation's Chief Executive Officer, Gerard Neesham, its Chairman, Ross Kelly, and also Brendan Maher, who is in Parliament House tonight for a dinner for the foundation. It is an education and mentoring program for Indigenous youths to discuss plans to help better their lives and provide educational outcomes. I know the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, Julie Bishop, has had a powerful influence over the years in helping to promote and fund Clontarf, which exists to improve the education, discipline, life skills, self-esteem and employment prospects of young Aboriginal men and, in doing so, equip them to participate meaningfully in society. It has certainly played a great part in helping realise some of the Australian Football League dreams of young Aboriginal boys and it is now trying to branch into rugby league. If Aboriginal boys see that there is a pathway for them to a better life through sport such as football it helps their educational outcomes as well. The foundation believes that failure to experience achievement when young coupled with a position of underprivilege can lead to alienation, anger and more serious consequences. As a prelude to tackling these and other issues, participants are first provided with an opportunity to succeed and, in turn, to raise their self-esteem. Gerard Neesham is a wonderful fellow. He is a former AFL coach. He is a wonderful motivator of people and he has a particular love and passion for improving the educational outcomes for young Australians, particularly young Aboriginal Australians. I commend him for his wonderful work with Clontarf. I hope the government sees fit to give Clontarf the funding it requires to help replicate this right across Australia. Gerard Neesham had important meetings in Wagga Wagga and throughout the Riverina to help develop the sort of program that is needed there. I commend Gerard for his work and I commend Clontarf for its involvement with Aboriginal youths. It is certainly helping to close the gap. Finally, can I say that improving the health outcomes for Aboriginal people is a wonderful initiative and we as parliamentarians should be doing everything we can to help that cause. Debate adjourned. Federation Chamber adjourned at 22:06 Visas (Question No. 1306) Ms Gambaro asked the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, in writing, on 27 November 2012: What process does the department have in place to advise and inform permanent residents before leaving Australia of the requirement to have a valid permanent visa should they want to re-enter Australia. Mr Brendan O'Connor: The answer to the honourable member's question is: Permanent residents have several channels by which they may be informed prior to their departure, of the need to obtain a Resident Return visa (RRV) to allow them to re-enter Australia: (1) The visa grant notice issued to successful applicants for permanent visas outlines the initial entry expiry date, the travel facility (multiple entry), and the 'must not arrive after' date. It also states that the permanent visa holder is able to remain in Australia indefinitely. Permanent visa holders are also generally given information in that notice about their ability to travel out of and into Australia until their specific 'must not arrive after' date (five years from the date of grant of the permanent visa), and the need to apply for an RRV should they wish to travel internationally and re-enter Australia after that date. (2) The department's website provides information for Returning Residents by following the links provided at: www.immi.gov.au/migrants/residents/ (3) Clients contacting the department through the client service phone line (131881) seeking clarification of their eligibility to return to Australia on their current permanent visa, are advised to check the expiry of the travel facility on that visa, and where required, provided with advice about the RRV. Where a permanent resident has a visa label evidenced in their passport, the valid travel facility is indicated by a ""must not arrive after"" date stated on that label. Alternatively, a permanent visa holder can check the details of their visa (including any expiry dates) using the Visa Entitlement Verification Online (VEVO) service at: www.immi.gov.au/e_visa/vevo.htm (4) There are two Resident Return visa (RRV) related system prompts used at the border for departures. These prompts appear on a Customs and Border Protection officer's screen when the travel component of a passenger's permanent visa has expired or will expire within 14 days. The Customs and Border Protection officers are trained to advise the passenger that the travel component of the visa has expired, or will be expiring, and that they must hold a valid RRV before returning to Australia. They are also asked to advise the passenger that they may be unable to board their return flight if they do not have a valid RRV. Where a passenger requires further information they are referred to an officer of the department. AusAID: Tertiary Scholarships (Question No. 1308) Ms Gambaro asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 27 November 2012: In respect of tertiary scholarships awarded by AusAID, in (a) 2011-12, and (b) 2012-13 (to date), (i) how many scholarships were awarded per country of origin of student, (ii) what was the total dollar value of scholarships per country, (iii) what were the areas of study of the scholarships for each country, and (iv) how was each scholarship relevant to the development priorities for the respective country.

2012: In respect of advisers and consultants that formed part of AusAID's Overseas Development Assistance to Vietnam for the period between 1 December 2007 to date: (a) what was the total sum of money spent on AusAID advisers and consultants for the delivery of incountry programs (b) would the Minister provide the details on (i) the sum of money spent for each individual adviser and consultant, and (ii) the list of services provided by the individual adviser and consultant (c) how many were paid under the Adviser Remuneration Framework (ARF), including details as to individual grades or classifications, and (d) how many still have contracts or service agreements that pre-date the ARF. Dr Emerson: On behalf of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows: (a) Attempting to answer this question fully would cause an unreasonable diversion of resources due to the very broad nature of the question and the fact that the relevant information would need to be extracted and collated from multiple sources – including paper-based – over the time period in question. Therefore, the scope of the answer has been narrowed to cover the amount spent on international advisers and consultants funded from AusAID's bilateral program of development assistance to Vietnam during the period from January 2011 to June 2012 inclusive, drawing on the three six-monthly adviser stocktake reports AusAID has published to date, and according to the definition of advisers set out in the ARF, including both remuneration and support costs.
