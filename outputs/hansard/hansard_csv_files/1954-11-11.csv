I do so, because almost all of the dried fruits industry in Western Australia is situated in the electorate IhatI represent, and I bave .a very intimate knowledge of the unfortunate circumstances under which tbe poraons who are engaged in. that industry arc operating at the present time, and under which they have been operating for some time. I feel that honourable members opposite will be sympathetic ' towards those persona when I tell them that.the growers, because of the cavalier treatment that has been accorded to them, not by any government but as a result of the policy of the nation as a whole, are as near to the breadline as it is possible to get. When circumstances weTe all in their favour, when they thought that they miglit obtain a good reward for their labour, and when prices were good, they met the demands of the people by providing them with a very necessary commodity at a price that has come to be accepted as the home consumption price. Most of the growers in Western Australia operate on a) very small scale. That is a disadvantage, I agree, but, nevertheless, it is the basis upon which they operate. Many of them have been forced to go to financial institutions to obtain assistance to live and, in addition, to prepare their land and their vines for the crop that they are about to harvest. Some of them will find it impossible to obtainfinancialassistance to cover the cost of harvesting. doing about it? leave that matter in the hands of a very capable and very sympathetic Government, which I should not be willing to do if the Australian Labour party were still in office. These people have made an unusual request. They have suggested that the Government, with confidence in the knowledge that their fruit wiU be disposed of at a reasonable price, and in good time, should give them temporary ' advances against their crops. It is not a'question of asking for a subsidy, or of asking for something for nothing. Opposition, members interjecting, honourable members have had a hearing themselves, and they should give a hearing to another honourable member who remained quiet while they were speaking. a request for a subsidy, or a request for something for nothing. One honorahle member asked, "" Will the banks not do it ?"" I , too, ask, "" Will the banks not do it ! "" Perhaps thc honorahle member who asked that question was listening to his colleagues, rather than to me, when I was explaining that many of those persons who are engaged in the industry are . already so deeply committed financially that they have no further equity, except the crop, on which to secure financial assistance to enable them to harvest the crop. Costs have an important bearing upon their subsequent operations. does not believe in socialism. respect one who is making a plea on behalf of those people. They are in need",6,Setup

8,Member For Wannon ( Mr Mcleod) To,"of assistance to enable them, not only to carry on until the crop is taken ofi, but also Lo cuuilaue operations thereafter.' They have been obliged to meet, tremendously increased costs. It is estimated that costs have risen hy approximately 800 per cent, since before World War II . , afford to continue to do so. I tender although the return for the products has risen by only 160 per cent, or 170 per cent. The growers have been carrying additional costs over the years, in the expectation that the losses that they suffered by selling their products to Australian consumers at the Australian consumers' price would be more than offset by the prices that they obtained on the overseas market.. They are not receiving the prices that they expected to receive on the overseas market, and thoy will not receive them in the fliture. They have no control over the additional costs that have heen incurred, although T assure honorahle members that the cost of their own living has been cut to the lowest possible level. There are two forms of' assistance that honourable memhers who wish to speak. may he extended to the people who are engaged in the industry. One would be the giving of'immediate assistance, but not as a gift or as a subsidy, to enable them to harvest their crop, and to continue their uurnj.nl operations. The second form of assistance that could he rendered would he a survey of the costs that the industry has to boar. If these people are to provide thc Australian market with fruit at a. price that has been demanded of them as the result of an established policy, and as the result of interference hy governments in essentialhome requirementSj it is only reasonable to expect that their costs of production should be met. It would, he neccsary to make a survey before their costs could he ascertained.' The honourable member for MaUee has already stated that a survey was made in 1949-50, but costs have changed since then. To ensure that the growers would not he required to face another year during which they would literally subsidize the Australian consumer to a substantial degree; such a survey of costs, should he put in hand immediately In spite of anythingthat honourable members may think about those they call thc wool barons, the wheat barons, ot any other kind of. barons,, the persons who Mr Leslie. are engaged in. this industry cannot afford to subsidize the consumers. They have not really been able to afibrd the privilege, if one likes to call it that, of subsidizing the consumer over the past few years, and they certainly cannot my ful l support to the requests that have been, mado hy the honourable member for Malleo -on behalf of thatsection of Australian primary producers that is suffering the lowest possible standard of living as the result of a policy that has been, dictated by the nation.

It also has passed two hills ta help the. wheat industry: the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill and the Wheat Export Charge Bill. It has also passed legislation to help the meat industry, in the Meat ExportCharge Bill, and the sugar industry, in the Sugar Agreement Bill. It has passed, the Flax Fibre Bounty BiU, the Sulphuric Acid Bounty Bill, the Gold-mining Industry Asaistaneo .Bill, and the Rayon Yarn Bounty Bill.

14,Mr Whkclam (Werriwa) [1,"9.11to assist the great primary industries of this country. It is to the shame of this Government that, during a session in which it has received very patient consideration from honourable members on both sides of the House, it has not given assistance to two small but vital primary industries of this country. I refer to the dried fruits industry ancl the poultry industiy. The dried fruits industry does not receive any assistance from the Government because it is confined to electorates where the party representation would not be changed however scurvily the electorates were treated. The honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) is impregnable in his electorate, however badly this Government treats the fruit-growers who reside in it. Even the honourable member for Moore( Mr Leslie) is, I believe, impregnable in his electorate. The dried fruits mdustry is an important one in this country. It has grown from an industry which brought the country £239,000 from exports in the last year before the war, to an industry which returned £617,000 in the last fiscal year. of some importance. is an industry in which, particularly after World WarI . , returning members of the forces were encouraged to engage in order to assist our export markets and help feed Australians. Many of them settled in the Murray Valley, in respect of which this House passed legislation last night. The other primary industry for which I wish to make a plea is the poultry industry. It is. significant that, seven months ago, before the general elections, in the dying, stages of the previous Parliawe did not export at all, but we could not ment, the Government hurried through a subsidy of £250,000 for the poultry industry. There were two electorates in New South Wales in which the poultry farmers were very important, and their feelings had to be placated. As a result, two honourable members opposite were returned to this House with a majority of less than 100 votes, in one case the majority being due to the distribution of the preferences of the Communist party candidate. That subsidy was made for the very good reason that, as a result of this Government having, speculated on the United Kingdom market, there was a loss of £500,000 to the poultry-farmers of this eountry. So far this financial year, the results of the egg export season which has now been under way for approximately two months, appear likely to be more disastrous than they were last year. Although this Parliament will rise later to-day, no assistance has been given to the'poultry industry, which will mean that no assistance can be given to it until at least next March, when the Parliament will reassemble. That is, no assistance can be given before the export season concludes. In the meantime, the poultry-farmers will bear all the losses on the export market. Although tlieir losses are likely to be twice as great as they were last year, there is no indication that they will receive any assistance at all. It need not be thought that the industry is not an important one. It produces a basic food. In order to obtain sufficient of that basic food during the low production season in autumn, it is necessary for a great surplus to be produced in the spring and early summer. The only other way in It is, therefore, an industry wliicli we can have sufficient eggs for the Moreover, it Australian, population in autumn and winter is to put in cold storage the sur^ plus eggs which are produced in the spring and early summer. That is, the poultry farmers must either indulge in restrictive practices and cut down the number of their present flocks, or they must have an overseas market.. This Government professes to believe, as governments of a Labour or socialist complexion have always believed, that the country cannot rely solely on exports of wool. We might be able to subsist if live very well. We cannot have any butter on our bread unless we export, and our future will not be certain unless we export more than wool. A-t the moment, exports of wool account for half the value of our total exports. Every additional commodity that we can export, therefore, will increase the prosperity and stability of the country. Poultry farming is practised extensively in my electorate, and on behalf of those poultry farmers I make the final. plea to the Government that, on this last day of the sessional period, it should at least make some contribution, as it did last year when the need was only half as great, to an industry which benefits the prosperity of the country and promotes the health of its citizens. the Navy and Minister for the Army) [12.19 a.m.]I wish, at this stage, to reply to some of the speeches that have been made. the debate? Air. SPEAKER-No. speeches have been made, and like other honourable members, I am allowed only ten minutes to speak. I wish to say to most honourable gentleman who have spoken to-night, that I shall direct the attention of the respective Ministers to the matters raised by them.. I want to reply, first, to the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) and then to the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr ber acknowledges that the Brighton camp Ward). The honourable member for Bass has directed attention to the fact that a cadet camp held recently at Brighton, in Tasmania, was abandoned. acknowledge the fine and unqualified tribute that the honourable member paid to the efficiency of the cadet units and to the cadet training staff in Tasmania. I share his view that the Australian Army Cadet Corps, which is now more than 35,000 strong, is an efficient organizamental to the health of the cadets a camp tion. I have always taken a very active interest in the well-being of the corps, because serviee in the cadets is the basis on which to develop in Australia's youths a respect for service in defence of their country. It enables them early to tako an interest in service training. Most of the senior staff officers of the Australian Army are men who themselves served iu cadet units. I am sure that their inspired work in the interests of Australia's defence and their rise to high rank in the Army are in no small measure attributable to the service foundation laid by their training in the cadet corps. In relation to the Brighton camp, I should like to point out to the honourable member that when this Government tools office many camps were in a deplorable condition. £350,000 has been spent on the Brighton camp. excellent condition. the honourable member's acknowledgment that the camp is in excellent condition. eadet camp able member is out of order. has already spent £350,000 on the Brighton camp and, with the co-operation of the Minister for Works( Mr Kent Hughes), another £30,000 will be spent on it in the current financial year. I am glad to know that the honourable member does not complain about the condition of the camp. Apparently, lie complains about the curtailment of a cadet camp as a result of rain. The lionorable memis in good condition. It is used by national service trainees and Citizen Military Force units and, consequently, I some of the 800 cadets who attended the camp had to go into tents. It is my experience that cadets prefer tents if the weather is suitable. I have given specific instructions that no risk is to be taken with the health of cadets, and that if continuous rain is likely to prove detriis to be abandoned. My instructions were observed on this occasion in the interests of the cadets. The 800 cadets in the camp came from a number of schools. It is now four months since the camp was held, but the complaint made by the honourable member for Bass is the first that I have heard. None of the parents complained to the schools, the officers who conducted the camp, or myself. I have made inquiries and have ascertained that no complaint was received at Army Headquarters in Tasmania or in Melbourne. I assume that the honourable member suggests that another camp should be established near Launceston. suddenly to abandon a camp on which",13,Thursday 11 November 1954

26,Mr Feancis,"It is not practicable£350,000 has been expended and on which a further £30,000 is to be spent. I am happy to say that requests for the establishment of cadet units have been received from schools all over Australia, and if it is possible to enlarge the cadet forces I sliall give consideration to the suggestion that a camp be established at Evandale. I shall now answer the honourable member for East Sydney who, in his usual careless fashion, made all sorts of rash and wild statements and innuendoes. He stated that he has reliable evidence that a breach of the law has been committed by a former member of the Russian embassy staff, Mr Petrov, whom he alleges imported large quantities of whisky into Australia for re-sale on the black market. I challenge the honourable member who, as a member of this House, has a duty to uphold the law, if he knows that the law has been broken to present his evidence to the Minister who is acting for the Minister for Trade and Customs (Senator O'Sullivan). E give the honourable member an assurance that the Minister will have the matter thoroughly investigated. ment to make an investigation. ber said that he has no doubt about the reliability of his information, and it is his duty now to give that information to the Minister. It is of no use for him to make wild and rash statements. I invite him on behalf of the Government to give his information to the Minister, who will prosecute if a prosecution is justified. I wholeheartedly support the representations that have been made by two other honourable members on behalf of the grape industry, tbe product of which Omar Khayyam loved so much. My interest this evening is in tobacco. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) gave an undertaking that all the tobacco produced in Queensland would be sold at world prices and that the entire crop would be sold. At the sales held in May the highest prices in tinue to ignore the Government's plea to the world were received for 'Queensland tobacco and all the leaf on offer was sold. tobacco and prefer to import tobacco from However, at the last sales, prices were 20 per cent, lower than they had been in May, and only one-third of the tobacco on offer was sold. I might mention that the sales in May coincided with the general election campaign. However, since the election, the manufacturers have declined to buy Queensland tobacco and the price offered has fallen by 20 per cent. The tobacco-growers, like the grapegrowers, are working on a very narrow margin of profit. They have heavy financial commitments and obligations. Previous speakers have mentioned many industries that the Government has assisted, and I assume that its policy is to assist primary producers wherever they require assistance. The Government's failure to give assistance to the growers of grapes and tobacco, and to poultry farmers, may be only an oversight. The debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House this evening has served a very good purpose in enabling honourable members to bring these matters to tbe notice of the Ministers concerned. In relation to the tobacco industry, it is important to remember that the more tobacco we grow the fewer dollars we shall have to pay to the United States of America for tobacco from that country. At the present time dollars are an important factor in our economy. I do not want to make a very long speech about the matter. I merely want to impress on the Government the need to honour the Prime Minister's undertaking and to ensure that the manufacturers purchase all the tobacco offered and pay prices comparable with those paid for imported tobacco. Although a successful tobacco-grower must pay continuous attention to his crop, I point out that, from a five acre farm, he can make a decent living provided he can sell all his produce at reasonable prices. It should be possible to settle many ex-servicemen and other persons on the land to grow tobacco. The Queensland Government is at present constructing the Tinaroo dam, which will irrigate tens of thousands of acres of land which is suitable for tobacco-growing. However, the Australian tobacco industry will not prosper while the manufacturers conthem to buy all of the Australian-grown countries which employ black labour in",15,Thursday 11 November 1954

Secondly, undoubtedly, New Soutli Wales must have had substantial cash reserves. We know that, without being able to put a figure to tbem. I took the opportunity at the last meeting of tbe Australian loan Council to suggest that that might be so, and it was agreed that there were substantial reserves accumulated in one way or another before the end of the financial year. Thirdly, I can say quite definitely that no action on tbe part of tbe Australian Government has resulted in a shortage of cash, for the purposes mentioned by tbe honourable member, to the Government of New South Wales. On the contrary, the practice that we bave followed for tbe last two or three years has assured that Government of tbe whole of the casb provided under tbe loan programme, quarter by quarter, throughout the year.

LAND SETTLEMENT OF EX-SERVICEMEN. Minister for the Interior deals with war service land settlement at Clare, in Queensland. Isi t a fact that some time ago, as the result of a report submitted by a committee appointed for tbe purpose, tbe Commonwealtb authorities announced that tbey would be prepared to pay half the cost of writing down the capital value of farms at Clare? If that is a fact, is the Commonwealtb still preposes to proceed to tbe United Kingdom pared to do so? I point out, by way of explanation of tbe second part of my question, that the men on those farms wbo grew tobacco, used an arsenical spray on tbe advice of the Department of Agriculture and Stock and, by so doing, completely ruined tbeir whole crop for the We have followed year. Will tbe Minister inform me whether tbe Commonwealtb was concerned witb that matter in any wayl Ts there any way in wbicb tbe Commonwealtb can assist those men wbo have lost tbe whole year's crop ? considerable time, if I remember rightly, since tbe committee to wbicb tbe honourable member for Bowman refers, sat. It was an officers' committee, wbicb made cerbain recommendations, and I tbink tbe lionorable member is rigbt when he says that tbe Commonwealth authorities stated that they were prepared to pay half of the write down of valuations made by that committee. However, tbe Queensland Government refused the offer at that time, on tbe ground that it was not necessary to write down the valuations of those blocks. Since tben, I tbink, no further action has been taken on the matter. I am not able to give tbe honourable member any information about the use of tbe arsenical spray. I bave a faint recollection of that matter, but Queensland has been operating in tbe war service land settlement sphere as a principal State, and therefore, matters of that kind come under the immediate direction and administration of fche Queensland Government. The Commonwealth would become involved only if a writing off was asked for. The committee recommended it, but tbe Queensland Government did not ask for it to be completed. whether it is true, as reported in the press, that the Prime Minister intends to visit tbe United Kingdom in order to attend a meeting of Commonwealtb Ministers during tbe coming parliamentary recess.

The invitation was issued by tbe Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. As the honourable member for Sturt knows, it is not usual to have any agenda for such meetings, wbicb deal with affairs of current interest; but it bas been not uncommon to receive, some time in advance, an indication at any rate a matter wbicb must be dealt with by of some of the subjects that might be disthe Prime Minister, the Premiers of the cussed. At tbe moment, I have not bad any such indication. I have merely said that I shall be willing to attend and I think that the honourable member will agree that sucb is proper. Tbe other Prime Ministers bave indicated their willingness to attend, and the meeting will occur. Beyond that, I cannot say anything at this stage. SEE VICES. Health inform the House of the latest position witb regard to making provision for mentally sick people? the honourable gentleman refers to Commonwealth participation in dealing witb tbe mental diseases problem. Tbe position is that in January last, tbe Prime Minister wrote to the Premiers of the States, and suggested that a complete investigation should be made of the whole matter by a specialist. We desired tbe Victorian Governinent to second to us a psychiatrist highly specialized in this matter, wbo had been in the employ of the Eepatriation Department, and wbo was at that time in tbe service of tbe Victorian Government. Tbe State Government agreed to tbe request, but four months passed before we could get all tbe States to agree to tbe investigatained in the report of tlie Broadcasting tion. Tbe specialist bas been carrying out his researches, and some two or three months ago, tbe Victorian Minister for Health, Mr Barry, who, I notice, made certain statements in tbe Victorian Parliament last night, requested that the gentleman be further seconded, so that be might attend a conference of psychiatrists at Washington. Tbat will be a very valuable thing, but it will necessitate bis absence from tbe country for two or three months. As a result, the investigation bas been delayed. When tbe Victorian Minister for Health complains about tbe matter, surely be does not remember what bas taken place at bis own instigation, or he does not consult bis own files. As soon as tbe information 13 obtained, a conference of representatives of various governments-becaus e it is States and tbe various Treasurers rather tban by tbe Ministers for Health-wil l be convened to examine tbe question so we sball not bave a stupid, retrograde hospital benefits agreement which will result in the treatment of mentally sick people being put back for nearly 20 years, as happened when the Chifley Government was in office. to tbe Prime Minister.

Since tbe unfortunate occurrences at Telefomin, tbe strength, of tbe post bas been increased in a very significant manner. Special action bas been taken to improve in every way possible tbe relations between tbe Administration, of tbe Territory of Papua and New Guinea and tbe native people of the newly controlled Telefomin area. Only last month, tbe Administrator of tbe Territory paid a performation in relation to recent developsonal visit to tbe area. I bave received from bim a very reassuring personal report wbicb persuaded me, as I tbink it would persuade any one else wbo read it, that conditions in that area are .now satisfactory and that no further trouble or new danger to tbe oflScers tbere is expected. So far as Australia's international reputation in relaCan the Minister inform the House of tion to its administration of New Guinea is concerned, I sbould like to remind tbe House and tbe honourable membeithat tbe United Nations Trusteeship missions to tbe Territory. The report made by -the last mission to visit tbe Territory reflected credit on tbe Australian administration. As to tbe first part of tbe honourable member's question, [ am sure that every member and supporter of tbe Government and all otber honourable members feel tbe greatest personal sympathy for the parents and otber close relatives and friends of tbe two officers wbo gallantly gave tbeir lives in the service of their country. ""We can also understand and appreciate that, in tbe poignancy of tbeir personal grief, tbey may feel that certain events were significant. Tbe honourable member himself, during tbe adjournment debate last nigbt, referred to a series of events and made a series of statements, some wellfounded and some not well-founded. But we bave examined every one of the complaints and suggestions that bave been two officers. We bave examined tbem witb meticulous care and have tried to find whether tbey had any significant relationship to the deaths of the two patrol officers.

In replying to that question, the Minister for External Affairs agreed that he would supply a copy of the statement to eacb member of the House. Tbat copy was accordingly supplied. As yet, I have not bad an opportunity to go into the question of whether it should have been left on honourable members' seats or put in their pigeon-holes. Vice-President of tbe Executive Council and Minister for Defence Production) [3.40] I lay on tbe table tbe following paper:Copper-Tariif Board's Eeport-Ministeria l requirements. Tbe bill does not involve Statement. Tbe board's report is a somewhat voluminous document. In tbe main it traverses tbe question whether assistance sbould be accorded for the production of basic copper in Australia. The board bas found that there would appear to be no need, on tbe basis of evidence tendered at the inquiry, to impose duties or employ public funds in tbe form of bounty payments, so long as producers of basic copper can obtain a price of £250 a ton or more for their copper. On unrefined copper duty-free admission from all sources is recommended by tbe board and on refined copper a duty of £4 a ton from all sources is recommended. coppers, whether refined or unrefined, have for some considerable time been admitted free of duty from all sources under by-law provisions of tbe tariff. There are, however, several issues assosections wbich tbe bill seeks to repeal. ciated with this report wbich tbe Government feels warrant careful examination. Tbis examination is being made but tbe time factor is inadequate to enable these issues to be determined before tbe close of the present parliamentary sitting. Moreover, the industry itself is anxious to know tbe outcome of the board's report as early as possible and is pressing for its release. It is in the light of these considerations that tbe Government has decided to table tbe report. Tbe existing tariff position on copper, and the existing practice in relation to exports of copper products from tbe Commonwealtb will not, bowever, be disturbed until the issues arising from tbe board's findings bave been resolved by tbe Government. I move That the statement be printed. adjourned. Minister for the Interior and Minister for Works) [3.43] I move That the bill be now read a second time. Tbe purpose of this bill is to repeal the existing Lands Acquisition Act 1906-1936, and to replace it witb an act that is more in keeping witb present-day practice and any question of policy. It deals almost entirely witb administration and methods of administration. Some sections of the existing act, wbicb experience over the years bas shown bave now no practical application, will not be re-enacted. Tbe reason for tbe omission of those sections will be explained later. The bill seeks to amend other sections of tbe existing act in order to bring both tbe principles and administrative action into line with modern ideas and methods. Some of tbe proposed amendments will affect a large number of people and certain organizations. Many of the These clauses are highly technical in a legal sense and, therefore, I do not propose to proceed with tbe bill beyond this stage.

96,Mr Kent Hughes (Chisholm,"measure before it passes to the committee stage. In such, a discussion agreement may be reached on many clauses and, in that case, we shall require to discuss only those clauses on which no agreement has been reached. At this juncture I shall explain the bill so that it can be examined thoroughly before the debate is resumed. The measure is of a kind that will lend itself to consideration in committee in more detail than is usually the case. Copies of my second-reading speecli and a circular explaining each clause in detail will be made available to any honourable member who may require them. Many of the amendments will, I am sure, be readily accepted. An attempt has been made to. arrange the provisions of the bill in a more convenient and logical manner. Some changes are sought to be made in definitions which are selfexplanatory. It is proposed to enlarge tbe Minister's powers in relation to the acquisition of iand or interests in land and their disposal. This enlargement is designed to avoid executive council action in many instances in which the amount involved is small. This provision does not apply in any instance to the compulsory acquisition of land. In that respect, the Minister's powers will not he enlarged. At present, the Minister is authorized to deal with acquisitions involving a maximum value of £50. That provision was first enacted in 1906. Under this measure, it is proposed to increase that sum to £500 and also to empower the Minister to deal with leases of a maximum duration of three years. Those are the only respects in which it is proposed to increase the Minister's powers in respect of the acquisition and the sale and lease of land. As in the existing act, the bill provides that all the more important acquisitions and disposals shall be referred to the Executive 'Council. The bill General. The bill, wbicb sbould effect will make it clear that an acquisition will be effective upon the publication of tbe notice in the Gazette. Tbe rights and liabilities of persons in respect of land, under contracts of sale, &c, will be clarified. Tbe value of land compulsorily acquired will, under the bill, be determined as at the date of acquisition, and not, as in the present act, as at the lst January preceding tbe date of acquisition. At present tbe value of. land that has been acquired bas been determined at tbe lst January preceding the date of acquisition, but that procedure will be altered by tbe measure and tbe value will be determined on the actual date of acquisition. If tbe Commonwealtb acquires land on the 30th December, its value will be reckoned as at that date. It is proposed that a claimant may institute proceedings if be is not satisfied with an offer, without waiting for the expiration of 60 days as at present. He also will be given a rigbt to go to tbe court if bis claim is not settled in six months, whereas under tbe present act be cannot go to court if tbe Minister bas not made an offer or notified bim that be disputes tbe claim. The provisions of tbe present act making tbe determination of tbe court final and conclusive and without appeal, bave not been included in tbe bill. There seems to be no good reason why any available rigbt of appeal sbould be barred. Under the Constitution, the acquisition of property by the Commonwealth must be "" on just terms "". Tbe existing legislation bas been beid by tbe High Court to comply witb this requirement, and every effort bas been made to ensure that tbe bill will also provide just terms. Tbe functions of the Attorney-General will be transferred to tbe Crown Solicitor. The clauses relating to mortgages have been redrafted to clarify tbe position of a mortgagee. Tbe power to issue a warrant to obtain possession of acquired land will be given to a court of summary jurisdiction instead of to a justice of tbe High Court of Australia. Provision bas been made investing State courts with federal jurisdiction, and a general provision as to costs bas been included. A limited power of delegation is proposed for tbe Minister and tbe Attorneymany urgently needed improvements in administration, is commended for tbe favorable consideration of tbe House. I desire now to take a course that is perhaps a little unusual, and I ask tbe House to bear witb me while I make a few comments upon tbe clauses of the measure. Clauses1 and 2 are purely formal. Clause3 (1.) will provide for tbe repeal of tbe existing lands acquisition acts, and I draw attention to tbe saving provision. Where, before the commencemen""t of the new legislation, a notice has been published in respect of land Tmder section 15 (2.) of the present act, it is proposed that compensation will be determined and paid in accordance with the present act. If we were to merely repeal the present acts, and start a new system while all sorts of business transactions were in progress, there would be a considerable amount of complication, and many difficulties and anomalies would arise. Tbat is wby tbe Government bas inserted this saving provision. Clause4 shows tbe set-up of the new measure, and an attempt bas been made to arrange the provisions in a more convenient and logical manner. 5 (1.) provides for interpretations, and Clause5 (2.) indicates that when tbe Commonwea'ltb acquires land by compulsory process under the new act, all interest in the land, for example leases, rights of way and so on, will be extinguished under sub-clause 9 (3.). Those interests can hardly be said to be acquired by tbe Commonwealth, but their owners are entitled to compensation. Tbe sub-clause will ensure that tbey will be so entitled. Clause6 (1.) provides for the metbod of acquisition, and Clause6 (2.) will prohibit tbe Commonwealth from acquiring public parks in the States or Territories, whether by agreement or compulsory process. If a State government should wish to dispose of a public park to tbe Commonwealth, tbe State would first bave to revoke tbe dedication or reservation. Tbe Government believes that anybody wbo wants to protest against any such revocation should be given a full opportunity to do so. If the Commonwealth were given the right to acquire land that had been set aside for public purposes without tbe State revoking its declaration, tbe acquisition might take place so quickly that interested parties would not bave an opportunity to protest about it before tbe whole matter bad been concluded. Section 14 (2.) of the present act has been divided into two sub-clauses in the bill, namely sub-clanses 7 (2.) and (3.), and tbe limits on tbe powers of the Minister have been slightly increased. Tbe increase is designed to avoid Mr Kent Hughes. Executive Council action in many instances -where tbe amount involved is small. Clause7 (4.) makes it clear that limited interests, sucb as easements over land, may be created hy agreement in favour of tbe Commonwealth. Clause8 (2.) is completely new matter. It will ensure that where a State sells to tbe Commonwealtb Crown land wbicb bas been dedicated or reserved for a public purposq, tbe Commonwealtb will not be restricted as to tbe use it may make of tbe land. If tbe State revokes tbe dedication as a public park, and tben tbe Commonwealtb acquires tbe land, tbe Commonwealtb is entirely free to use tbe land in any way that it thinks fit. Clause Clause9 (2.) is section 15 (2.) of tbe act re-expressed in more appropriate language. It is made clear that acquisition shall take place upon tbe publication of a notice in the Gazette. Clause 10 (1.) is a re-expression of section 17 of the act. It provides that upon tbe compulsory acquisition of land, tbe interest of every person in tbe land is converted into a rigbt for compensation. Tbe present legislation is not clear by any means on that point. Clause 11 follows section 19 of tbe act, and tbe provision has been re-expressed and gives the Parliament tbe power to avoid acquisitions if it considers it necessary to do so. Clause 12 is a new provision. Subclauses (1.) and (.2.) of this clause empower tbe Higb Court of Australia, or a supreme court, to adjust tbe rights and liabilities of persons in connection with land that bas been acquired, or with transactions affected by the acquisition. Clause 12 (-4.) provides that tbe rigbts and liabilities as adjusted are to be taken into account in determining compensation. These provisions are desirable in view of tbe uncertainty that may exist in certain cases of the effect of tbe acquisition of land on the rigbts and liabilities of persons interested in the land. For example, problems may arise where tbere is an existing contract of sale of the land under which part of tbe purchase price only bas been paid. In sncb a case doubt may arise whether the purchaser is entitled to recover tbe money paid under the contract, and whether he is obliged to make any further payments under the contract, including payments already accrued due. Until these questions are settled, it is not possible to determine the way in which the compensation representing the value of the land should be distributed among the various claimants. It is difficult, howeveryto lay down rigid rules on the effect of the acquisition in every case. In practice, most of those questions are settled by agreement, but there must be a legal method of settlement available. It is therefore considered desirable to give the High Court of Australia, or a supreme court, tbe power to examine tbe exact circumstances of a particular case and to adjust the rigbts and liabilities of tbe parties so that no injustice is done and so that a firm basis upon wbich the compensation can be determined is established. Clause 12 (3.) also empowers a supreme court, or tbe Higb Court, to declare tbe basis upon which compensation is to be determined in order to do justice in tbe special circumstances of a particular case. Tbe court may see fit to exercise that power where it has adjusted contractual or other rigbts under sub-clause (1.). It is also possible that the rigid provisions of the bill with respect to tbe basis of compensation, for example tbe rules as to mortgagors or mortgagees, may not give a satisfactory result in tbe special circumstances of a particular case. The sub-clause will operate as a "" safety valve "" in such cases. interest. Tbe proceedings are for the Tbe clause as a whole also enables tbe omission from tbe bill of certain provisions in the present act, namely sections 54 and 55, dealing witb encumbrances otber tban mortgages-for example, rent charges-and section 56, dealing with cases where part only of tbe land comprised in a lease is acquired. These provisions are not considered to be satisfactory and, indeed, it is doubtful whether it is practicable to lay down rules of universal application in sucb cases. It is considered better to leave tbe matter to agreement or, in tbe absence of agreement, to determination by a court in the light of the particular facts. Clauses 13 to 21 inclusive do not require explanation. Tbey are mainly R -[100 ] re-expressions of sections in tbe original act. [Quorum formed.] Clause 22 combines two sections of the present act and value is to be taken as at date of acquisition instead of on the lst January last preceding that date. Tbis change is considered to provide a more just basis for compensation, wbicb I mentioned in tbe general outline I gave at tbe beginning of my speech. Clause 23 is a new provision, wbicb enables tbe Minister to agree as to price with tbe owner notwithstanding that tbe land is compulsorily acquired. Under clause 25 a claimant may institute proceedings if be is not satisfied with an offer made by tbe Minister without waiting for tbe expiration of 60 days. Also, he is given a rigbt to go to the court if bis claim is not settled in six months, whereas under tbe present act he cannot go to court if the Minister bas neither made an offer nor notified him that he disputes tbe claim. I hope that this provision will lead to a much more speedy settlement of claims, some of wbich are still years behind. We bave done our very best to try to speed up settlement of some of the old outstanding war claims, but some of tbem bave not yet been settled. Under tbe clause, a court will deal with the particular interest in respect of wbicb a claim is made, unless another plaintiff Ls joined in respect of another determination of compensation and tbe function of the court would be to determine tbe compensation in respect of the interest claimed, without examining title, and not to give judgment for the amount determined. Tbis would leave the way open for the examination of tbe title by the Crown Solicitor before making payment. .Sub-sections (2.) and (9.) of present section 37 appear to be unnecessary and have not been included. Subclause (9.) makes it clear that the Commonwealtb is obliged to apply for removal of a case either to the High Court or to a Supreme Court. Under clause 26, the Minister may institute proceedings where bis offer bas not been accepted within 60 days, without waiting for six months as under present section 3S. In this case, the Minister is to be given the same right as the person who claims compensation. In cases where no claim has been made, provision is made in sub-clause (3.) for the Minister to request tbe court to deterMany of the alterations to the present mine the person's entitlement. Tbis clause again deals with each interest in the land separately. The provisions of sections 38 and 39 making tbe determination of the court final and conclusive and without appeal bave not been included. Tbey do not appear in existing section 37 and there seems to be no good reason wby any rigbt of appeal available sbould be barred. Tbere is no corresponding provision in tbe present act to clause 28. Under tbe Commonwealtb Constitution, tbe acquisition of property by the Commonwealtb must be "" on just terms "". Tbe existing Lands Acquisition Act has been held by the Higb Court to comply witb this requirement, and every effort bas been made to ensure that tbe new bill will also provide just terms. However, tbere is always tbe possibility that, on tbe facts of a particular case, tbe specific provisions as to compensation will fail to do complete justice to a particular person. This provision would enable a court assessever, tbe mortgagee proceeds to make a ing compensation in sucb a case to award whatever amount was necessary to do complete justice, notwithstanding any otber provision of the act. Clause 30 (2.) is a new provision. This bas in fact been done in practice. Tbe provision enables outstanding liabilities to be paid to local authorities. In clause 31, tbe functions of tbe Attorney General bave been transferred to tbe Crown Solicitor. Tbe provision for payment out of tbe Treasury upon an order of a court, in accordance witb section 45 (1.) (b) of tbe present act, bave been embodied in clause 32. Part VI. is the next provision to which I sball refer. Tbis part corresponds with Division1 of Part V. of the present act. Tbe present provisions are in some respects obscure, and tbe object of tbe new provisions is to clarify tbe respective rigbts of a mortgagor on tbe one band and one or more mortgagees on the other, witb little substantial change in their rights as they are at present Sir. Kent Bughes. interpreted. Tbe present act applies in relation to tbe acquisition of land for the purposes of tbe War Services Homes Act, subject to adaptations and modifications made by regulations under tbe act. act that are embodied in this part are founded on modifications to tbe present act made by regulations under tbe War Service Homes Act. Tbe new provisions are, however, thought to be more generous to tbe mortgagee as against tbe Commonwealtb in the matter of interest. Clause 38 is a new provision. It enables tbe Minister to require the owner to furnish particulars of mortgages and further provides that if tbe owner fails to do so tbe Minister may agree witb the person claiming to be a mortgagee as to the amount due under the mortgage. Clause 39 also needs a brief reference. Where land subject to a mortgage is acquired compulsorily, tbe acquisition frees the land from tbe mortgage, but does not, at that point, discbarge tbe mortgage debt itself. Tbe mortgagee may therefore continue to receive or even to sue for and recover, amounts under the mortgage, whether accrued due before or after tbe date of acquisition. If , bowclaim for compensation against tbe Commonwealth, the mortgage debt, as at tbe date of acquisition is, speaking in general terms, discharged from the date of acquisition to the extent of tbe compensation payable to the mortgagee. Tbe purpose of clause 40 may be stated briefly. Where both mortgagor and mortgagee claim compensation, it would not be just for either of tbem to be able to affect tbe claim of tbe otber by agreeing witb the Commonwealtb as to the value of tbe land, nor would it be just for either to be affected by a determination by a court of tbe compensation payable to tbe other unless be was represented in the proceedings. Tbis clause provides accordingly. Clause 41 corresponds witb section 51 of tbe present act. It sets out the manner in which the compensation payable to the mortgagee is to be arrived at. Under sub-clause (1.), the mortgagee gets the principal, interest, &c, due at the date of acquisition, but not exceeding ""tbe compensation payable to the mortgagor "". This expression is explained in sub-clause (2.) and is, in the ordinary case, the value of the land. The only substantial difference from tbe present act is that the mortgagee is entitled to interest at the mortgage rate up to tlie date of payment of the compensation, whereas, under the act, interest at the mortgage rate is payable for a period of six months after tbe date of acquisition. Tbe present provision for six months' interest is considered to be arbitrary, and it seems logical to provide for interest simply to tbe date of payment of compensation. Tbis change is an advantage to the mortgagee where more tban six months elapse between tbe date of acquisition and the payment of compensation. If , however, compensation is paid within six months, tbe mortgagee is still fairly treated under the bill, because, if the mortgage was not due for repayment, provision is made for compensation for costs of re-investment, and for any loss of interest upon re-investment. Clause 48 corresponds witb section 63 of the act. It enables tbe Commonwealtb land to be disposed of where it is no longer required, or to be leased where it is not immediately required. Tbe present section does not clearly authorize tbe leasing of Commonwealth land wbich is not immediately required for a public purpose. seek leave to have bis statement incorporated in Hansardl formerly a member of a State parliament, and, when a Minister was obliged to deai witb an intricate bill like this one, be explained it fully so that outside people who were interested, and wbo picked up a copy of Hansard, would be able to understand most of tbe amendments for which provision was made. Very often, in this House, honourable members are inclined to take tbe opposite view. Although tbe explanation that I am making may be a bit dull to listen to, it is highly technical General are of rather a formal characin tbe legal sense. I am making it so that those wbo are likely to be affected may have an opportunity of making representations, if tbey wish to do so, to honourable members. TJnder both tbe present section and tbe proposed new section, tbe Governor General may authorize the disposal or lease. TJnder tbe present section, tbe Minister also bas power to authorize a lease for not more than three years where tbe annual value of tbe land does not exceed £50. Tbe proposed new section slightly extends tbe powers of the Minister. He will be able to dispose of land where the value does not exceed £500, and to grant a lease for a term not exceeding three years at a rental not exceeding £500 per annum. In view of tbe change in tbe value of money since 1906, when tbe present section was enacted, these increases in tbe powers of the Minister are considered to be fully justified. Clause 50 is new. It provides that tbe Minister may pay rates and otber charges upon land that bas been compulsorily acquired, and that any sucb payment sball be taken into account in determining compensation. Where several lots of land in tbe one subdivision are acquired together, it is convenient for the Minister to be able to pay tbe whole of tbe rates owing in one payment, and to set off the amounts paid on behalf of tbe individual owners against tbeir respective claims to compensation. Clause 51 is also new. Tbe position of persons remaining in occupation of land after its acquisition by tbe Commonwealtb has, in tbe past, been uncertain. This clause will enable the Minister to enter into an agreement witb sucb a person under which he may remain in possession on definite terms and conditions, and not, as at present, mainly on very indefinite terms and almost no conditions. Clause 52 provides that the power to issue a warrant sball be given to a court of summary jurisdiction instead of to a justice of tbe Higb Court. Clause 59 enables tbe Minister or the Attorney-General to delegate bis powers and functions under tbe act. Honourable members will probably want to examine this clause. Tbe powers of tbe Attorneyter. Tbe powers of the Minister to acquire and dispose of land are also extremely limited, in relation to wbich I direct tbe attention of honourable members to clauses 7 and 48.

That does not, however, relieve the Minister of any responsibility. The sections of the act to which. I shall now refer have been omitted from tbe bill, for the reasons that I shall outline. Section7 is not considered necessary. The effect of section 12 is not entirely clear, especially having regard totbe fact that "" land "" may be any estate or interest. The section does not appear to bave any practical value. Section 25 is not considered necessary. There appears to be no reason wby fencing should be mentioned especially. It will be covered by clause 17 of tbe bill. Section 26 bas been omitted, because a rigbt to compensation is now conferred by clause 10 of tbe bill. Section 30 bas been omitted, because tbe production of documents is thought to be covered sufficiently by clause 29 of tbe bill. Section 34 is omitted also, as tbe bill provides a different procedure for dealing witb claims for compensation. Section 36 has not been reproduced, because tbe bill provides a different procedure for the settlement of claims, and for bringing claims before a court. Section 41 is obsolete. unnecessary. Tbe Treasury would deal with moneys deposited in tbe Treasury under tbe provisions of tbe Audit Act that relate to tbe trust fund. Section 48 applies only in tbe case of acquisition by agreement. In sucb cases, the invariable practice is for tbe agreement to require ibe owner to obtain a discbarge of tbe mortgage. Section 50 bas been omitted because tbe general provisions relating to tbe making and determination of. claims for compensation will apply to claims by mortgagors and mortgagees. The operation of section 5S is exhausted. Tbe Acts Interpretation Act will preserve the operation of that section. Section 64 is not necessary. The powers of disposal given by section 48 are not confined to land acquired under tbe act. I commend tbe bill to honourable in embers. adjourned. Mr Kent Bughes.

Opposition supports thia measure, which represents something new and important in tbe provision of social services benefits, because its introduction is an underlying principleof tbe establishment of a welfare state, and also a point of tbe gospel of the Australian Labour party. Tbe Opposition is pleased-and I make this statement without being cynicalthat the Government bas recognized tbe urgent need for legislation of this kind. Tbe Minister for Social Services( Mr Section 44 appears to be McMahon), in his second-reading speech, dealt most sympathetically and with great understanding witb this new problem that will confront him in bis administration of tbe Department of Social Services. Tbe purpose of the measure, as enunciated in tbe bill and propounded in tbe Minister's second reading speech, is simple enough. It is to provide homes for aged people. Tbat is a most praiseworthy objective. Tbe machinery by wbicb that objective is to be achieved is simple. Tbe provisions of the bill are not difficult to understand. Tbe need for legislation of this type bas been apparent for many years. We pay subsidies and pensions in many fields, and in building up the welfare state perhaps we have not paid as much attention as we sbould bave paid to tbe needs of persons, especially those wbo are aged and sick.

This measure, which is approved by both the Government and the Opposition, will introduce into. the social services structure a new and beneficent influence to assist the members of church, organizations, welfare workers and volunteers who labour without profit in the service of tbe sick poor members of tbe community, and, in particular,, of aged persons. especially have given yeoman service in helping aged people. Those workers have carried heavy financial burdens, at tbe same time as they have found happiness in rendering service, and tbe subsidy will help to ease those burdens. Tbis scheme promises to grow as its benefits are seen, and an expansion will be all to tbe good. As tbe welfare state has developed comes that they cannot live witb tbeir and freo medicine, pensions and other families, tbey bave to seek accommodawelfare schemes bave been introduced in tion from charitable organizations, accordance with what I consider is the whether conducted by tbe churches or Christianapproach to these problems, a not. Tbey then feel that they are left degree of callousness towards those wbo out of things, and tbey become lonely, are in need has arisen in tbe community. miserable and unhappy. Tbis measure Tbe welfare of elderly persons has become will enable tbe church organizations and somuch tbe responsibility of tbe State other bodies that give service to the that sometimes-onl y sometimes, but, elderly members of tbe community to unfortunately, too often-the close relachange all that. First, a subsidy will be tives of elderly people take tbe view that paid £1 for £1 in respect of homes now tbe State should do tbe entire job of being built and to be built for tbe accomcaring for aged citizens. Every honourable, modation of aged people.. Since tbe taxmember, wherever his electorate is. payer, through tbe Government, will situated, knows that one: of tbe most pathetic groups in tbe community is tbe elderly people wbo are forced to live in back rooms, constantly under thethreat of eviction, and of ransom if pensions are increased, because tbey are exploited by those wbo rent back rooms to age pensioners. If tbeir position can be relieved slowly, it will be all to tbe good. tbe better. If we, in this Parliament, evolve a scheme that will provide care for tbe vulnerable aged members of tbe community, wbo have not much, further to go on life's journey, so that tbey may find a little pleasure, comfort and security intbe declining years of tbeir lives, we shall have done something well worthwhile.. Tbe plight of age pensioners and other elderly people is very unhappy. It was keenly pictured by tbe poet who wroteSet is the sun of my years. And over a few poor aslies, I sit in darkness and tears. Tbat view is not an exaggeration. Tbe minds of elderly people wbo do not own tbeir own honies and bave tbe fear of going over tlie hill to tbe poorhouse, are conditioned to tbe nineteentb-century way of thinking of these things. The average rnature man, and even tbe young man, to-day considers that tbe Government owes him something, and the Church organizations thought of bis pension does not give bim tbe mental twinge that a similar thought would give totbe pioneers wbo had a different outlook, and a more rigid appz-oach to both tlieir own and tbe Government's responsibilities. Many of those people suffer a great deal of anguish even in so simple a matter as applying for tbe age pension. When tbe time: pay the subsidy and will be required to put his hand in his pocket once again, we must ensure that we do not have too many community settlements, too many swallow's nests, as it were, and too many groups of aged people huddled under the one roof. ""We must preserve the individuality of elderly -people as far as possible. The ideal method of doing this would be to accommodate them in cottages. Sucb a scheme would be expensive in the long run. But I refer the House to the experiment made in England by the Attlee Labour Government, which centres in park-like areas. The Minister for Social Services has probably seen something of those centres. That scheme has been magnificently successful. Although this bill does not profess to make provision for such schemes, the Minister has specifically stated that the role of tbe Government is to provide the money and not to intrude any more tban is necessary into tbe work of the religious and other benevolent organizations that provide homes for aged people. At tbe same time, a little background assistance in tbe way of advice about the best way to spend tbe money provided, perhaps as a consequence of investigation by committees, would, in the long run, enable us to evolve a scheme of which we might well be proud. In tlie beginning, this measure will result merely in a sort of band-out. Tbere is a deep humanitarian basis for tbe bill, wbicb will assist tbe people wbo, of tbeir own volition and without any thought of tbe financial cost or of a subsidy from the Government, bave done a magnificent job for the community in caring for aged people. The capital expenditure required to give that advice would be very small, although tbe upkeep of old people's homes is usually very costly. If we evolve a formula by wbicb it can become tbe practice for governments to assist with money and witb advice in tbe construction of homes for elderly people, we sball strike at tbe root of the trouble that afflicts our elderly citithe institutions are their homes! . zens. Australia's bousing problems are grievous indeed. Tbey affect tbe young, tbe middle-aged, and especially tbe elderly people, wbo, witb tbe burden of tbeir years heavy upon tbem, bave to cast Mr Haylen. about for a place in wbicb to retire. In homes especially provided for tbeir care, tbey sbould be able to find comfort, rest, companionship and relief from loneliness. The community's responsibility for a citizen sbould not be thought to end once he becomes old. Perhaps throughout bis life tbe elderly person bas been so engrossed in tbe task of earning a living that be bas not been able to do tbe things of wbicb be bas dreamed. In bis retirement in an old people's borne, in wbich be would pay for bis upkeep out of bis developed community pension as an independent citizen, be sbould be able to pick up tbe threads of community life in a simple way and enjoy much more of the gracious life that he might have yearned for. He sbould be afforded an opportunity to do tbe things that he wanted to do when he was earning bis living in tbe harsher days of bis youth and young manhood. Eor that reason, we approve of tbe legislation. However, tbere is one weakness in it wbicb we believe can be remedied, and we intend to move an appropriate amendment at the committee stage. Having examined clause 3 and clause 6, we have, witb tbe help of tbe Clerk of tbe House, prepared a simple amendment, wbicb tbe Leader of tbe Opposition (Dr. Evatt) will propose. The object will be to include provision for tbe aged sick in tbe plan that tbe bill will ratify. Tbe Minister bas referred to the difficulty of separating organizations which should receive tbe subsidy from those wbich already enjoy some form of government help, such as hospitals for aged people. Tbis bill represents a fine basic piece of common sense, as well as good social service, but I submit that we should start the scheme rigbt where the anxiety strikes hardest in tbe community. There is nothing more grievous than the plight of tbe chronically sick old person. If sucb a person happens to be in an institution wbicb is described as a hospital, tbe subsidy for which tbe bill provides will not apply. But these are bed cases, and Tbe Anglican Church and other organizations have institutions wbicb are homes as well as hospitals but wbich, because tbey receive payments under the hospital benefits scheme, will not qualify for subsidy under this bill. Well, in my grow is inevitable, but we sbould not bilk opinion, the people in these hospital tbe issue. In fact, we sbould be proud homes are tbe very people for wbom this to do all that we can to help to provide bill should provide, and I hope the Minisnew homes for those long queues of aged ter will accept the amendment I bave and sick people wbo need assistance. One foreshadowed. I know that great difficulof the most harrowing aspects of tbe bousties exist, but I do not think they are ing problem will be relieved by this legisinsuperable.

How tbey some way of achieving tbe result that I live on tbeir pensions is another problem have indicated, and we must find that that one could ponder for a long time. way if this legislation is to be really worthwhile. I know that honourable members on both sides of the House wish to discuss this measure, and therefore I for tbe aged posed a problem that was shall try to discuss the remaining aspects both social and economic. The Opposiof the bill which I have in mind as briefly tion agrees witb that statement, and it as possible.

We sbould this Parliament, can now supply the casb. be proud of tbe fact that we can Tbe Opposition would like the Minister help tbe churches in tbeir great efforts to clarify the basis on which tbe subsidy to provide care and sustenance for the will be payable. He referred in bis speech aged. That the cost of tbe scheme will to an institution which has a mortgage Honourable members no doubt will be Honourable members can We must face tbe fact that tbe amount of subsidy to be paid will increase as tbe Tbe Minister said in bis second-reading speech that the task of providing homes and which tben borrows money by other means and also .raises, say, ;£20,00.0 by public subscription. Tbe subsidy in that -case, I assume, would be payable only un relation to the money raised by public -subscription, not on ithe total collections including tbe borrowed (money. I can understand sucli -a provision. Nevertheless, tbe Minister should make tbe situation clear to tbe institutions wbicb bave already applied to tbe Government for assistance. I sbould also like ""tbe Minister to explain the categories that will be created under the scheme, wbicb will be administered by the Director-General of Social Services. How soon will we know, witb more or less exactness, tbe conditions that an applicant for subsidy will be required to fulfil? Tbe situation at present is vague. It should be 'brought down to a particular basis. ""When tbe people wbo seek this subsidy on a £1 for £1 basis know exactly where tbey stand, I am sure that we sball begin to go places rapidly. My own view in relation to tbe subject, in which I have been personally interested for some years, is that there sbould be both State and Commonwealtb subsidies for homes for tbe aged. Some of tbe weight should be taken -off tbe shoulders of tbe Commonwealth. Einance should be provided on tbe basis of one-third by the Commonwealtb, one-tbird by tbe appropriate State, and one-third by tbe institution concerned, instead of on the 50/50 basis for which the bill provides. However, that is by tbe way. Tbe salient fact is that tbe scheme for wbicb tbe bill provides is good. It may be criticized, perhaps unduly, because it does not deal witb tbe most serious problem in connection witb tbe housing of aged members of the community wbo need shelter. However, tbe amendment wbicb will be submitted by the Opposition in simple terms at tbe committee stage, can remedy that defect. I hope that all honourable members will give earnest consideration to it -recess. The Treasury, of course, can Tbe bill will bave far-reaching effects, because it will encourage tbe social workers of -churches, welfare societies, and organizations like Legacy, wbo voluntarily devote themselves to tbe help of fche vulnerable members of tbe commattnity, particularly tbe aged. public purse can properly be tapped to Jfr. Haylen. -aid people wbo are trying to do something constructive, instead of merely sitting back and asking .for a subvention from tbe Government. Therefore, I believe that the scheme will assume great proportions. We may, in our time, see a wide swathe cut in tbe tangled problem of bousing tbe aged of Australia. Because of the .depressions of recent memory, tbe problems 'of unemployment and seasonal industries, and a lot of otber economic pressures inseparable from a young -economy sucb as ours, tbere have been many grievous cases -of men and women who have worked through the whole of their -active lives only to conclude, in the evening of tbeir days, that there is no place for tbem except tbe industrial scrap -heap, or tbe road over the hill to tbe poor house. There will -be nothing -like that under this sclieme. Tbere will be, instead, voluntary effort supported by 'a government subsidy. That is a common sense arrangement. Schemes for tbe care of tbe aged are already in existence in our large cities. All we liave to do is -to give tbem -strength, and encourage tbem to develop. I believe that the bill will achieve that .resultAsI bave said, £1,500,000 is a .flea-bite, economically speaking. Tbe costs of .administration and .upkeep are always .the bugbears of these institutions. Tbe .bill represents .a happy begmning to a good scheme, and for that reason tbe Opposition supports it. I again request tbe Minister to give .tbe most careful consideration to the amendment that I have foreshadowed, which bas been designed to help .a .scheme that is close to our hearts and runs parallel with our policy for a welfare .state. I hope -that tbe Government will not allow itself to be per.Buaded to reject tbe amendment by difficulties of draftmanship, or Treasury objections, combined with tbe need to pass the bill quickly before we go into always think up something to stultify a good scheme, no matter 'wbicb government happens to be in power. I say that without being harsb to tbe Treasury -officials, but tbe fact is that ithey bave an immense vocabulary of .negatives which Tbe tbey can apply to an immense number of problems. Well, tbe Opposition does not want them to apply any of their negatives, in this case. If the fact, that some of the institutions which care, for aged people already receive, assistanceunder the hospital benefits legislation 13 likely to thwart their subvention under this bill', we must find a way around the difficulty. Many of these splendid homes shelter, rest, and care for tbe aged and sick with tbe most loving sympathy. Those are the institutions wbich deserve our financial help. If tbere is some ethical objection to the granting of two kinds of payment by tlie Government, let us devise some way of revising our code of financial ethics. Let us amend tbe bill to achieve our purpose and set. the scheme rolling as it should roll. It will, take up the slack of a. grave social problem, wbicb is at its worse when a man and bis wife are. both old and sick. Tbe future holds no: Darby and Joan existence for tbem.

[4.45] -The honourable member for woman, and more particularly the aged Parkes( Mr Haylen) has generously and reasonably on this ticularly to tbe interests of tbe aged measure. I join witb bim in congratulatr ing. tbeGovernment on this welcome, piece of progressive legislation. Like thei honourable member for Parkes, I look, upon tbe bill only as a start, of what, I believe, will be a very considerable part, of our social services structure and,, indeed, in many respects, tbe best part, of that structure. We sbould all congratulate tbe Government and tbe Minis^ on having started something wbicb is not,, perhaps, complete in itself but will grow. It provides a solid foundation on wbicb advances can be made. I , personally, take tbe greatest interest in this measure because it follows along tbe lines wbich I have been endeavouring to advocate during tbe last six, or seven, years. For some particular group of individuals' this or that problem may be tba mora important, and tbe problems may vary witb individuals, but, looking at the picture as a wholes accommodation is the. most urgent problem wbicb faces aged 1 persons in this category. This bill does something to meet tbe needs of the aged and also a need of tbe nation. I sball develop those two preliminary As tbe honourable member for Parkes. Their problems cannot be sohred only in terms of money. Beyondtion to translate that sympathy into earlier days but wbicb tbey now find (Mackellar) to be rather a burden. Theaged man. or spoken couple, becausethis bill is directed par-",33,Mcmahon
101,Mr Wentworth,,38,Mcmahon
102,Ter For Social Services ( Mr Mcmahon),"couple, need simple and convenient accommodation in wnich they can maintain the decency and comforts of life without incurring too much expenditure of their own limited faculties. They need something which is easy to run. I have had the opportunity to read a number of technical reports which have been compiled on this subject in Great Britain. Those reports feature tbe kind of lay-ovrt which would be helpful to these people to make them as comfortable as it is possible to do. Those features may appear as small architectural things. Tbey seem small, and, individually, each of them is small; but proper lay-out, the proper absence of stairs, particularly certain bathroom and kitchen arrangements wbicb do not cost any more to put in tban normal arrangements, make all the difference between good and difficult living. In tbe next place, these people need interests and companionship. People are accustomed to find companionship in great part among people in their age group. Nobody wants to segregate tbem. We believe that these homes sbould be a part of tbe wider community. No one wants to separate tbe grandfather or tbe grandmother from the company of children or that of young people. Sucb segregation is inhuman. In addition to playing tbeir part in tbe normal life of the community, it is a great satisfaction to old people to observe tbe progress of the normal life of tbe community which is to be their successor. For tbem, sucb observation is in a way a participation in tbe life pf tbe particularly young people with young community. Besides that, they need tbe companionship of people selectively in tbeir age group. I hope that the cottages and homes wbicb will be provided under this scheme will not be built in very tralization. TJnder this scheme, we sball big groups, because we do not want this thing thousands placed in one group, but rather that it will be possible to group them sensibly and reasonably in small groups properly related to the community wbicb these old people have helped to create in tbe life wbicb is, for them, drawing to a close. However, whilst we do not want tbem to be placed in groups that are too big, where tbey will be institutionalized, Mr Wentworth. at tbe same time we do not want tbem to be entirely scattered under conditions in which it will be difficult to provide tbem witb tbe specialized service wbicb old people need, or to deprive tbem of tbe companionship wbicb tbey need selectively among people in tbeir age group. If individual homes are properly and reasonably built in accordance witb tbe best practices, this scheme will serve tbe special needs of aged people. It will serve also tbe needs of tbe nation. Tbe old people are a part of the nation. By serving their needs in that sense, we sball serve tbe nation's needs. A nation will not be healthy unless it meets this particular need. Housing is in short supply not only for old people but also for young people, particularly young couples. Often, by reason of inertia and because people do not like to give up a home before something more convenient, or as convenient, becomes available for them, an old couple will continue to occupy a large home wbicb is a burden to tbem, but which would be a source of great pleasure and happiness to a young married couple with a family. We should not, in this scheme, seek merely to get tbe best value out of tbe new accommodation which is to be provided with our existing physical resources. I do not ask honourable members to regard it as being as simple as that; but, even on that basis, we sball serve tbe interests of tbe nation and, at, the same time, help people wbo, themselves, have not yet reached old age. Tbis may well be a means of making more accommodation available to young people, families. Turning more directly to the bill itself, it is based on three main principles. The first of tbem is tbe principle of decenget away from tbe big state institution. to be institutionalized with Secondly, the measure is based on tbe principle of flexibility. Tbis is an experiment. We do not see clearly, at this moment, tbe full range of tbe difficulties that lie ahead in operating tbe scheme. Tbere will be many catches in it wbicb can only be worked out in practice. Tbe Minister is wise in incorporating flexibility in tbe bill at least at this stage and for tbe next few years until we see how the thing works out in practice. We are all alive to the necessity to do the best with the resources available to us. Thirdly, the bill is extendable. It is only a start. It takes only one part of the problem, and no honourable member on this side of tbe House would believe that it solves the whole of tbe problem. But it is an approach to a solution of the whole of tbe problem and provides a foundation upon which tbe Government can, and I am sure will, extend tbe scheme. It is a first and proper step; it is not the end of tbe road. Decentralization, flexibility and extendability are tbe characteristics of this bill. I sball deal witb them in detail. Decentralization is more tban a word. In this instance, in place of inhuman, bureaucratic and impersonal administration, tbe people wbo will operate under this scheme will be small groups of individuals wbo bave come prepared on the basis of goodwill to give personal service in addition to material service wbicb the bill will help tbem to render. Reference has been made to tbe work of tbe churches. I believe that that may well prove to be one of the most vital features of tbe scheme. In past times, in Europe and Great Britain, tbe churches maintained homes for the aged. Tbere can be no greater service that a cburcb can render to its members than to give tbem security, spiritual as well as material, in tbe closing years of tbeir lives. We pay tribute to thc gallant work wbicb bas beeu done and is still being done by churches of all denominations. We hope that tbe work will be expanded, and that this bill will be tbe means of expanding it. If I may express a personal opinion, one that may not be verified by future events, may I say that I believe that tbe groups wbicb will take the greatest advantage of this measure, and wbicb I hope will be most helped by tbe provisions of tbe measure, are the church groups wbicb are operating so splendidly in this field. I believe that we can get back something of the tradition of tbe church conducting spiritual as well as material services for the aged in tbe final years of tbeir lives. This is a personalized bill, under wbicb scheme, tbe men of goodwill in the community, bility, and I commend him for doing so. wbo have been banded together in groups during tbe whole of our history, will get more power to do more good. We hope that the administration of tbe homes will not be rigidly controlled by any government decree, and we bope that tbe scheme will draw its motive power from tbe goodwill wbicb brings together tbe groups that I previously mentioned in charitable-althoug h that is a word wbicb only partly explains what I bave in mind -organizations , wbicb are directed to tbe better existence of this increasing section of our population. The next point is that tbe bill is flexible. You will notiee, Mr Speaker, that tbe Director-General of Social Services will be given great powers under tbe measure, although it will not be possible, in my view, to satisfy immediately all the people wbo need assistance. I believe that the scheme proposed by tbe Government is so good, and that it presents so many opportunities, that we sball have to ensure that it does not get out of band. Tbe scheme sbould be allowed to grow as quickly as possible-consisten t witb sound growth-and we sbould be careful that no abuses creep in to ruin or prejudice popular support for what I am sure will be a splendid scheme. It will be allowed to grow at a proper rate, if it is carefully controlled in these vital early stages of its life. We kuow that although this scheme is directed to tbe support of aged persons, tbere is a possibility of flexible operation. For example, sick bays may be run in conjunction witb it. It may even happen that a person wbo is not within tbe age groups contemplated by tbe legislation may still be treated as an exception -o r tbe case that proves the rule-and receive assistance under this scheme. When assistance bas been accepted under tbe measure, tbere will be no reason why tbe institutions which bave accepted tbe assistance sbould not be able to receive into tbem the odd persons who are not fully qualified under tbe age provisions of tbe bill. No doubt it will be possible to give grants to homes, wbich are, effectively, homes for aged persons, even though tbere should be in those homes some people wbo do not fully qualify under tbe bill. The Minister bas very wisely, at this formative stage of th» retained the principle of flexiHowever, the bill is inflexible on one point, and I believe that it is .a proper matter to be brought to the notice of the House. Sub-clause (1.) of clause 3 readsThe purpose of this Act is to encourage and assist thc provision of suitable homes Tor aged persons, aud in particular homes at which aged persons may approaching as nearly as possible normal domestic life, and, in the case of married people, witli proper regard to the companionship of husband and wife. I believe that the House will particularly commend the Government, and the Minister, for inserting that provision in the bill. It has been a standing and justifiable reproach in Australia, and in other countries, that we have tended to tear husband and wife apart in the closing years of their lives. That is a wrong and unChristian thing to do, and the Minister, in taking the action indicated in the subclause that I have just read, has recognized a great and grand principle which I think all honourable members will support. ""We ""believe that husband and wife should not ""be separated in the closing years of their lives, and I might well remind the House of the definition of "" aged person "" which appears in clause 2. The definition is"" aged person"" means a nuui who i as attained the age of sixty-five years or a woman who has attained the age of sixty years and includes the wife or husband of an aged person residing or desiring to reside witli the aged person; Of course, tbe latter part of the definition is tbe most important part, and I believe that tbe Minister bas been wise in drawing up tbe definition in those terms, because it means that when one of a married couple is aged and is qualified in terms of the legislation, and tbe otber party is not so qualified, nevertheless tbey are botb eligible persons under the measure and can both be recei vied into a borne which will obtain assistance under this bill. Tbat is certainly a humane and progressive provision. I sball not mention particular cases, but we all have visited some old people's homes-gigantic institutions-where one group of buildings, and tbe women perhaps miles away. We have seen married couples who have lived together foT very many years, puzzled and at .a loss at being parted towards tbe end of Mr Wentworth. tbeir lives. That is not tbe kind of thing envisaged in this bill. I do :not wish to cast any reproaches on the institutions and I do not want to criticize tbem. J simply say that ""this measure bas put f orward a better .scheme. Obviously, this bill is making an exreside in conditions periment, and is not laying down a final scheme. It does not deal witb the whole problem of tbe aged, and we may as well admit that. Tbe Government is trying to deal properly witb a part of tbe problem., rather tban witb tbe problem as a whole. If we attempted to do everything at once., we sbould probably become confused, and fail on all fronts. It is for that reason that I believe that we should be ill-advised at tbe present stage, and 1 emphasize at tbe present stage, to extend the provisions of tbe bill to include hospital services, except where tbey are incidental to tbe operation of tbe main part -of tbe measure. I am sure that if we did extend tbe scheme to hospital services, although what we sbould be trying to do would be a worthy thing, nevertheless, we might, by confusing the issue, prejudice tbe simple, clear, and constructive thing that we are trying to do in this bill. I agree with the honourable member for Parkes that the problem of the aged sick is a cumulative problem. It is, in itself, a much more complex problem tban tbe Minister bas laid before the House in this measure, because in addition to the problem of bow we are to help and serve sick persons, we also bave the aspect of bow we are to .serve and help tbe occasionally sick wbo, because hospital beds are occupied by cbronic cases, cannot get attention. .1 bave been told on good authority, and 3 bave learned for myself, that .the nursing and specialized services required for full hospitalization of a healthy person wbo happens to fall sick and perhaps needs an operation, .are of about twice the magnitude of tbe hospital services required for a cbronic case, if the person chroniState cally ill could be separated from bospital the men may be in routine. One of the next things that the Government might turn its rnind to is the problem of dealing witb the chronically ill . Tbat is not as big a matter as the one dealt witb in this bill, but nevertheless it is a large matter. I do not believe that we should approach the clear and simple issues in this bill by confusing them with any otber problem, but that is not to say that I do not agree with tbe honourable member for Parkes that tbere is another problem to be dealt with at present. I hope that next year, or in the near future, the Government will turn its attention to that other problem in the same constructive and successful way that it bas turned its mind to tbe problem that it has dealt with in the bill before tbe House. We cannot do everything at once, but here we are taking what I believe to be tbe most signincant forward step that has been taken in the social service affairs of Australia during our generation. I commend the bill to the House, and I am sure that it will receive unanimous support. particularly appropriate, that as we are approaching tbe Christmas season we are considering a. bill that has in it tbe real spirit of Christmas. I commend the Minister for Social Services( Mr (he bill, in wbich the hope is expressed McMahon) for introducing this measure, wbicb will bave tbe enthusiastic support of all honourable members of the House. It represents, as has already been said, the breaking of new ground, and it is a move by the Government to assist, to some degree, tbe organizations wbicb are prepared to take'care of the old people of our community. Tbe number of old people wbo will be qualified under tbe measure is increasing, as, indeed, is our total population. A representative of one of tbe churches wbicb is concerned ( Mr Haylen), I am concerned about tbe witb homes for the aged, said in Brisbane fact that there is a section of tbe comduring last week-end that it has been munity for which no provision bas been estimated that by 1957 tliere will brmade. I sball be kind enough to say 105,000 persons over 65 years of age in that everything cannot be done at once, Queensland, which will be almost 10 per and that-tbe Minister is doing an excelcent, of tbe population. At tbe present lent job in breaking new ground with this rate of increase of population in that bill. It is easy to say that a bill never State, it is anticipated that the number of goes far enough. I sball not bc so persons who will be over 65 years of uncharitable as to make that statement; age in 1972 will be 135,000. So it is I merely moke a suggestion to tbe Minisparticularly appropriate that the Comter in tbe hope that on some future monwealtli is proposing to assist organizaoccasion, when the scope of this legislations wbich take care of tbe aged, because tion is to be extended, he will be able the need for more and more homes is to make accommodation for tbe section apparent to each ono of us; and I am of the community about wbom tbe honorsure that each one of us is also well aware able member for Parkes bas spoken, and of tbe huge expenditure wbich is incurred to wbom I wish to make some reference. by organizations that do this most important work. I suppose that tbe body which does most for tbe aged in Queensland is tbe State Government, but it is excluded from tbe provisions of this bill. Tbe Queensland Government provides a series of eventide homes in various parts of tbe State. One of the good things which came out of the last war was tbe acquisition by tbe State Government of the Royal Australian Air Force establishment at Sandgate, and its conversion to a borne for the aged. Eventide homes are dotted about tbe principal cities in the coastal areas of the State, and it is the policy of tbe Government to extend them. .Various religious bodies, too, bave played a notable part in establishing homes for the. aged in Queensland. One of the most outstanding homes in the city of Brisbane is that conducted by the Methodist Church at Chermside. This home does fulfil tbe spirit of clause 3 of that the marital state of tbe inmates may be maintained. At tbe home at Chermside, little cottages are dotted over a large area, and couples live in them. Tbey obtain their meals at a central point. It is an ideal place. There are many otber organizations which, over the years, have been looking after tbe aged. I am sure that each of those organizations will be very happy witb this bill. Like tbe honourable member for Parkes",38,Mcmahon
103,Mr Coutts (Griffith) J 6.13j,"It isOne of the really sad experiences in life is to find some old people who have reached the stage when they have become incurably sick. They are not in such a condition that they can be permanently accommodated in a hospital, and as each honourable member knows, it is the normal thing in all States, though perhaps to the least extent in Queensland, to find that hospital accommodation is acutely short, and that many of these people simply cannot be accommodated in hospitals. An organization established in my division of Griffith proposes to take care of this section of tbe community, so far as its scope will permit, and a contract has been let for tbe estabhome, so that it may receive a Commonlishment of an institution called tbe Mount Olivet Hospital for tbe Incurably Sick and Dying. The estimated cost is £354,000, and tbe place will bave 150 beds. Honourable members will see from those figures the enormous cost of providone, and bears all tbe evidence of a spirit ing a home of this kind. It will be on the basis of £2,300 a bed. Tbe Queensland Government will provide £150,000, and the balance of the money must be raised by appeals tp the general public. Under this bill, assistance cannot be granted to an organization of this kind. However, I hope that when amending legislation is introduced, as it must be introduced in the future, an organization such as I bave mentioned will be included in its provisions. I am not bappy about clause 9 of this bill, wbich deals witb tbe amount of grants. The Minister bas made it clear in his second-reading speech, that tbe grant which will be made by the Director General of Social Services will be on a £l-for-fl basis with the amount raised by an organization wbich is building a home for tbe aged. It appears from tbe Minister's speech that tbe directorgeneral will not make a grant to subsidize money obtained by an organization by way of overdraft or mortgage. Tbe position in Queensland is that an organization arranges financial accommodation with a bank, and a home for tbe aged is built. Organizations are formed in association witb tbe home, and they continually appeal to the general public for assistance, so that funds must be raised to pay off the bank overdraft. Mr Coutts. Under clause 9, tbe Commonwealth will not give assistance in sucb a case. It appears that tbe only assistance which will be given under this bill will be to an organization wbicb bas raised money, and bas funds in band to commence tbe erection of a home. Tbat is a weakness of the bill. I hope that the Minister will be prepared to admit that to be so, and make provision, when amending legislation is introduced, for the granting of a certain sum of money to organizations vvhich are prepared to finance the construction of homes on overdrafts. If an organization is compelled to raise funds before it can commence to construct a wealtb grant, we may rapidly reach the position that a grant made by tbe director-general will merely make up the depreciation in the value of money. SoI suggest to the Minister, in all seriousness, that whilst this bill is an excellent of kindness, he sbould consider a provision to enable sums of money to be granted to organizations which finance tbe construction of homes for tbe aged on overdraft. Sbould he do so, the cost to the Government will be no greater, because the amount of the Commonwealtb grant is limited to £1,500,000, but it will mean that the homes for the aged, which are so urgently required throughout tbe Commonwealth, may be built with greater rapidity tban tbey are being constructed to-day. I commend the Minister for having introduced this bill. I am sure that it will bave a speedy passage through the House. I believe that in the heart of every man in this place tbere is a spirit of kindness, and that no honourable member can object to the principles embodied in this legislation. [5.27] I agree entirely witb the last few words of the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Coutts), when he stated that no one would wish to delay the passage of this bill. I do not propose to speak at length, but I wish to state a few points which I consider are apropos the occasion. Eirst, I echo the remarks of those honourable members who have congratulated tbe Minister for Social Services",42,Mcmahon
104,Mr Drummond (New England),,43,Mcmahon
105,( Mr Mcmahon) And Tbe Government,"upon this bill. I bave found that tbere is a general agreement between the various political parties upon measures wbicb advance tbe social welfare of tbe people. It is not always that we agree on tbe amount which should be expended at any given time, but there is a general agreement among honourable members on both sides that money sbould be spent upon these worthy objects, and that tbe public purse sbould be made available for that purpose. I consider that one of tbe wisest decisions that this Parliament, or any parliament, bas ever made has been to make contributions to cultural and charitable objectives allowable deductions for income tax purposes. Even when we look at the matter in the strictest possible suitable wings to hospitals. Tbere are light, we must agree that the Government, if it does not induce people to make contributions for sucb purposes, must sooner or later find tbe whole amount itself. But that is not the greatest loss that occurs. Tbe greatest loss is tbe loss of the voluntary and willing endeavour on the part of people to assist those wbo may be less fortunate than themselves, or, alternatively, to give to tbe community cultural institutions for wbicb tbe public might otherwise have to wait a long while. I entirely agree with one of tbe main principles of this bill. Tbe Commonwealtb is to make available £1,500,000 to encourage otber people to build homes for tbe aged. Co-operation between the Government and tbe community sbould be encouraged to a greatei"" degree. Griffith stated that churches and otber organizations bave made provision, and in some cases substantial provision, for aged persons. That is all to the good, but I sbould like to see, not only the Australian Government, but also the State governments, assisting in this very excellent work. Over the years, I have seen much social services legislation introdticed, and I have seen honourable members, irrespective of wbicb party has been in office, exercise tbeir minds in relation to sucb matters. For instance, free milk has been made available to school children largely as the result of Oommonwealth assistance to the States. Honourable members on both sides of tbe House have supported tbe bill, although some honourable members thought that, even at this stage perhaps, tbe Government could bave gone a little further. I tbink it is wise, when launching into entirely new social services schemes, to make baste slowly at tbe beginning so that tbe weaknesses of tbe schemes may become apparent, and later adjusted. I bave observed many of the problems associated witb the care of aged persons. Some aged persons are sick, not in the sense that they have been suddenly attacked by pneumonia, or a similar kind of illness, but in the sense that, over long periods of time, wbich may extend to years, they need tbe kind of care that only a hospital can provide. Tbat problem is one that could be met by attaching also aged and feeble persons who are susceptible to various ailments. Eveni f they were placed in an institution where tbey could live more privately tban tbey could in a hospital ward, the fact remains that tbey must be fairly close to expert nursing and medical services. Those cases present their own particular problem, and a slightly different type of accommodation is necessary, if we are to obtain tbe best results. Tben there are otber aged persons wbo are without resources, and who have no children or friends to support them. Tbey may be childless couples, or couples who bave lost tlieir children, wbo, by force of circumstances, find themselves without friends. I understand that the Minister has that group, in particular, in mind. Tbe honourable member for That is the interpretation of clause 3. wbicb refers specifically to married aged persons. The best form of accommodation for that group of aged persons is the small cottage. If it is impossible to furnish tbem witb that kind of accommodation, they should be furnished with accommodation in the nature of flatettes, in wbicb tbey may live in reasonable privacy. One of tbe wisest statements in relation to social services benefits that I have heard was made by a retired black tracker, an Australian aboriginal. A t tbe time be made the statement, there was a movement afoot to place all aboriginal people on a relatively small reserve adjacent to a large country town. The old man said to me, witb perfect courtesy, wbicb characterizes most of the aborigines, "" Mr Drummond, it would be well if otber people realized that black people are like wbite people, in one respect. They do not all like each otber, and some of tbem prefer to be at a considerable distance from others"". Tbe same thought applies to aged persons. They do need a certain amount of privacy which, unfortunately, in spite of tbe magnificent work that bas been performed by churches and otber organizations, including governmental agencies, tbey bave not been able to obtain. I make a special plea for poor, aged persons in rural areas. Aged persons who have their own homes in town aro witbin easy reach of medical assistance. I have in mind an aged couple wbo live in an old mining district. Both of tbem suffer from heart ailments, and both should be witbin ready access of medical and nursing assistance, but tbeir financial circumstances do not permit them to move. If tbey were to sell tbeir little borne, which is quite weatherproof, and which is a humble place, as many of such places are, but which is very dear to them, they could not obtain accommodation, lighting and beating for tbe nominal cost at wbicb tbey are able to live at present. Such cases could be multiplied. I tbink they constitute a special challenge. Tbere are also single men and women, and widowers and widows, who bave very few friends, or no friends worth speaking about. Circumstances bave caused such persons to be cut adrift from tbe community, and tbey need perhaps a slightly different type of accommodation from that which married aged persons need. Tbey, also, are entitled to sympathy from the community. I refer now to an administrative problem wbicb I tbink tbe Minister, in fairness to the great number of people wbo are prepared to give of their labour instead 'of money to assist aged persons, will have to face up to. I have in mind a large country town in which people are busy collecting money, and in wbicb they were collecting money before the proposal now before the House was referred to by the Prime Minister( Mr who would be able to certify to the value Menzies) in his policy speech. have approached people wbo bave money, and those people have given of their money. Mr Drummond. others wbo conduct saw-mills, wbo have agreed to provide and deliver timber for tbe erection of accommodation for aged persons. In my opinion, that is a splendid gesture. In addition, no fewer than 70 tradesmen bave agreed to give up tbeir week-ends so that tbey may assist in the work. Any one wbo knows anything about the wages that tradesmen are paid to-day will realize the value of tbe labour that tbey bave offered. Doubtless, many of those tradesmen could bave worked overtime in tbeir ordinary employment and bave been paid for it. I hope it will not be stated that tbe services that those men will render are not as valuable as tbe donations that bave been given by tbe people wbo were able to write out cheques. Moreover, surely tbere are persons, sucb as chartered accountants, wbo are willing to give of their time so that tbey may certify to tbe value of tbe time that bas been devoted by tbe tradesmen to tbe work. Money is a very fine thing to bave and to give, but surely the voluntary personal service that the men to wbom I have referred, and countless others, are prepared to render ought to be regarded in tbe same light as tbe casb donations that are made by people wbo are unable to give of tbeir labour. If tbe Government were to recognize the efforts of those who give of their time and labour, it would encourage voluntary work, wbicb is tbe finest manifestation of civic spirit tbere is. Such people would be encouraged, and be willing, to do something for others without any return other tban tbe satisfaction that they derive from doing something to help less fortunate members of tbe community. I suggest to tbe Minister, and to officers of tbe Department of Social Services wbo may be listening to tbe debate, that it sbould be possible to arrive at a formula that cotild be supervised by public officers wbo are willing to be at least as generous in tbe giving of tbeir time as are these labourers,bricklayers and carpenters, or wbicb could be supervised by men of bigb character and standing, sucb as chartered accountants, They of the labour rendered, so that that effort may be subsidized in tbe same manner as tbe Government subsidizes donations Tbey bave also approached by cbeque. It remains for me to say only tnat I wholeheartedly endorse the principle of this bill. I have only one fear-that the immediate demand for assistance, will exceed the limit of £1,500,000, and that applications will have to be carried over to another period. I commend to the Government the needs of aged married couples. They are the people who should be the first to receive help-. An inadequate allocation of funds should not be allowed to delay the granting of subsidies where tbey are needed. I congratulate the Government upon introducing tbe bill, and tbe Opposition upon its attitude to this measure, wbicb is one of tbe most worth-while advances in social services that we bave seen for some time. Sitting suspended from 5.J/6 to 8 p.m. [Quorum formed.] -This is tbe first time in five years that my conscience bas allowed me to congratulate tbe Goverament on any measure that it bas introduced. AlthoughI congratulate tbe Government,. I sbould like to state that this bill is ten years too late and provides for financial assistance that is £10,000,000 too little. Nothing bas been done in. tbe last ten years by tbe Labour Government or by this Government to assist towards tbe provision of homes for aged persons. It was not until tbe policies of tbe Government and of tbe Oppositiou at tbe last general election were enunciated that any thought was given to tbe need of poor aged people for homes. Tbe Minister for sympathy. I realize that. be will do bis best to do justice to aged people during the next twelve months, but be will bave a bard job to do all that is necessary. Although tbe amount of £1,500,000 is too little to do all that is necessary, all of it will probably not be expended within tbe next twelve months, because the Government will pay a subsidy of only £1 for £1, and consequently any organization that proposes to build an aged people's home will bave to provide 50 per cent, of the capital cost. Tbat is where tbe trouble will begin. Nevertheless, this measure is a start in tbe rigbt direction. I trust that by next year the Government will, haveconvened a conference witb tbe State governments and formulated a plan to take co-ordinated action witb tbe States on tbe national, level to provide accommodation for elderly people. Some of tbe money to be advanced will be expended in areas where tbere are organizations that wish to provide homes for tbe aged members of tbe community, but in districts where sucb organizations do not exist to sponsor tbe construction of homes, tbe aged people will continue to go without accommodation,, although tbe Government might be willing to subsidize the construction of tbe necessary homes. Tbis Government sbould take co-ordinated action with tbe State governments to construct aged people's homes throughout Australia, and especially in country areas, so that elderly citizens may be able to continue to live in the districts where tbey bave spent their lives. Otherwise, tbey will drift to tlie cities where homes are available. I bave seen tbe Eventide Homes in Queensland, wbich are of marvellous benefit to elderly people. But I understand that many more sucb establishments are needed. In New Soutb Wales, also,, homes for aged persons are sadly lacking. In some country centres, such as Bathurst, homes that are ideal for tbe accommodation of aged people bave been established, but many country areas bave no such institutions. An organization that desires to construct a borne will have to pay 50 per cent, of tbe capital cost. It will be in a position somewhat similar to that of a man who wishes to buy a home and wbo must himself provide 50 per cent., 60 per cent, or 70 per cent, of tbe price as a deposit before be can obtain an advance. Church workers are willing to dedicate tbeir lives to tbe care of aged people. This Government, not satisfied witb that alone, demands that they must also collect enough money to pay 50 per cent, of tbe capital cost of tbe homes in wbicb tbe aged people are accommodated. The Government sbould not insist on that requirement, and I trust that it will give tbe Minister plenty of latitude in dealing witb applications for assistance. I have in mind particularly a borne in Sydney",43,Mcmahon
106,Mr Minogue (West Sydney) [8.2].,,46,Mcmahon
107,Social Services ( Mr Mcmahon) Has My,"in which. I am particularly interested, and for which I have worked for the last seven years. The church organization that conducts the home was formerly established in England, but was bombed out during World War II . The members of the organization to which I refer worked for the national emergency services in England. After the war concluded they came to Australia, and took over the conduct of a home at the corner of Buckingham-street and Clevelandstreet, near Central Railway Station, in Sydney, at which they care for 105 aged people. Approximately 200 persons are on the hooks of the home awaiting admission. Doctors and many other people from time to time ask me to use my influence to get people into the home, but it is impossible because vacancies do not exist. The Minister should bave discretion to give financial assistance towards people from providing tbe necessary tbe construction of homes of that type, especially in country areas, so that aged people who prefer to remain in tbe country in tbe districts where tbey bave spent tbeir lives may do so. I suggest to the Government that in tbe northern suburbs of Sydney-tb e so-called blue-blood areas -tb e citizens of wbicb it is sometimes suggested bave no care for pensioners and persons in need, church organizations and other bodies would be ready to care for aged people if buildings were provided for tbe purpose. The Government, in effect, states that organizations that wish to accommodate elderly people must provide a total of £1,500,000 before it will £1,500,000 for tbe benefit of aged people. Tbis Government bas pegged tbe basic rate of pension over tbe last two years at £3 10s. Tbat amount is not enough. Every church organization that I know of leaves witb pensioners accommodated in its homes a proportion of tbe £3 10s for tbe purchase of tobacco and otber necessaries and comforts. With tbe £2 or £2 10s. that those organizations take, they must provide food, clothing and accommodation. In those homes, some of tbe inmates are in good health, but others require hospital treatment. that provision sbould be made for aged persons wbo are in need of hospital attention, and the Minister should have discretion to advance money for tbe buildMr Minogue. ing of homes in wbicb sucb people might be cared for. Tbe Government certainly is moving in tbe rigbt direction, but it would do well to adopt tbe Australian Labour party's policy. I suggest that it ought to enter into an arrangement with the State governments under wbicb tbe Commonwealtb and tbe State concerned would advance £1 each for every £1 provided by the organization that wishes to construct an aged people's home. At present, you make it almost impossible for organizations without considerable financial resources to provide homes in wbicb to accommodate elderly persons. You bave pegged the basic pension rate at £3 10s. and you now intend to peg tbe amount of assistance to be given towards tbe construction of homes for aged people in such a manner as to prevent organizations that wish to care for those buildings. able member sbould address tbe Chair. to tbe Government tbe impossible task that it bas set organizations that wish to care for aged people. The honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond) stated that elderly persons could be cared for by voluntary labour alone. If the Government thinks that there are enough persons who prefer voluntary work on Saturday afternoons to the races, football matches and other diversions, it must tbink again. Finanadvance cial assistance towards tbe provision of accommodation for aged people should be provided without any ties. An organization that is willing to do the work should be given tbe necessary money and allowed to get on with its good work. If tbe elderly members of tbe community are not accommodated by this means, tbey will bave to be housed by some otber means at far greater cost tban is incurred by the church organizations wbich largely use voluntary labour to care for elderly persons and make tbem comfortable in their old age. I suggest I ask you, Mr Speaker, if you have any influence witb tbe Government-and you should bave-a t least to advise it and to help the Minister to do something really tangible for elderly people wbo are",46,Mcmahon
108,Mr Speaker,Order! Tbe honor,47,Mcmahon
109,Mr Minogue,"I am pointing outseriously in need of accommodation. The sum of £1,500,000 is merely a drop in the ocean. If the amount is not increased next nnancial year to £10,000,000, aged people -will suffer from a continuing lack of accommodation. Government supporters praise the Government for giving money to Asiatic countries. This Government, in peace-time, has expended £200,000,000 yearly on preparations for war, but it will not help the aged people whose efforts have made Australia tbe nation it is. I trust that this bill is merely vice wbicb, in my opinion, is sadly needed, a forerunner of greater things,, and that, before the next budget is brought down, the Commonwealth will confer with representatives of the State governments and, as the National Government, sponsor in every State a scheme to provide accommodation for aged people. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Minogue) to-night, for the first time in his four and a half years as a member of this Parliament, congratulated the Government on one of its actions. I am sure that we are all very glad of his generosity. I think, too, it was the first speech in wbich he failed to mention me. I am grateful for that, too. His forebearance was appropriate to the spirit of this last night of sitting before we begin our Christmas recess. It is particularly appropriate that this wonderful measure to provide for assistance towards the provision of homes for aged persons should be one of the final bills passed by the Parliament before the Christmas recess, because it will bring great benefit to many hapless people wbo need help. The benefit will not become evident immediately, but it represents a fine Christmas box for many deserving Australians. Although tbe honourable member for West Sydney congratulated tbe Government, he also made some extravagant statements. I am sure that all of us would like more money to be appropriated for tbe benefit of old people, because we know their need is great. But this is something new. Tbe plan bas just been initiated, and we bave to find out bow it will operate in practice. At any rate, tbe Government bas made a beginning. The honourable member for West Sydney speaks so often about pensioners in this House that some of us make jokes on the subject, but I pay him tbe compliment of saying that his heart is in tbe rigbt place. is a part of tbe Christmas spirit. Tbis bill will blaze the trail for a fine new branch of our social services programme. As tbe honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) bas said, it will inevitably develop a new type of social serand it will greatly benefit many people wbo are unable to help themselves. The nature of tbe bill indicates the attitude of tbe Government to its responsibility to tbe unfortunate people in our community. Sucb legislation, of course, is not unusual when a government like tbe present administration is in office. Many Australians do not remember that much legislation of this type bas been initiated by previous governments of the same political colour. Sucb governments were responsible for the introduction of invalid and age pensions, for the child endowment that so many families enjoy, for the great building society movement that thrives throughout Australia, and for tbe war service homes scheme. Tbey have shown always that their aim is to blaze the trail towards a better civilization, and tbey bave invariably taken a special interest in tbe welfare of old people. We are not yet giving old people as much as we should like to give tbem, but we are giving tbem more than any other government in history has given tbem. I pay a compliment to tbe Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), who initiated this legislation, and to the Minister for know, will administer it as it should be administered, because be also has his heart in the right place. Tbe bill will provide a sum of £1,500,000, to be paid in the form of subsidies on a £1 for £1 basis, for the construction of homes for aged people. I emphasize that tbe money will be given for that purpose. There is no thought of repayment. It will assist voluntary organizations which are providing homes for aged people to double tbe accommodation that tbey would otherwise be able to provide. Fundamentally,",47,Mcmahon

Tbere are many of tbem, but even so tbeir numbers are too few. Tens of thousands of Australians could well lend a helping band. I refer particularly to tbe churches, whose auxiliary organizations bave done most of this charitable work. Ex-servicemen's organizations also will qualify for assistance. Tbe enactment of this legislation should encourage people to come forward and help sucb voluntary bodies. If tbey do so, future governments will doubtless increase tbe amount of tbe annual grant, and tbe problem of providing care and accommodation for old people will finally be solved. Up to tbe present, the only real encouragement that has been given to voluntary workers wbo have struggled to raise money for homes for tbe aged bas been tbrougb the tax relief which is given to people who make donations for sucb purposes. Tbe addition of straight out grants to qualified organizations should be of great help. Tbe honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), who spoke first for the Opposition in this debate, announced that the Opposition proposed to move an amendment at the committee stage so as to include in. clause 3 a reference to tbe aged sick. All of us, of course, want to help tlie aged sick, but this bill has been designed to achieve a particular purpose and I deplore any effort to introduce an amendment merely for tbe sake of its human appeal.

Tbe proposed subsidy of £1,500,000 will be only a drop in tbe bucket. But tbe idea will grow, and, as tbe years pass, larger sums will doubtless be provided for tbe same purpose. Tben, we can tbink of extending tbe scheme, if an extension sbould be found necessary in practice. I emphasize tbe fact that tbe scheme is not intended in any way to take tbe place of tbe work in connection with hospitals which is now the responsibility of State governments. Tbe suggestion that provision for people wbo are both old and sick bas been deliberately omitted from tbe bill tends to create a false impression. The bill, I repeat, bas a specific purpose, and we should not let tbe matter become confused by tbe introduction into tbe debate of side issues connected with otber matters that are not tbe responsibility of this Government. I take my cue from tbe honourable member for West Sydney and the honourable member for Parkes when I say that it would be wrong to relieve tbe State governments of their responsibility to provide hospital services. If we were to add millions of pounds to tbe proposed expenditure, and to widen the purposes of tbe bill so as to provide for hospital treatment, tbe only result would be to relieve State governments of certain responsibilities to wbich they aTe now committed, so that no greater benefit would accrue to the people whom we are trying to help. Tbe Government has no To everybody, I tbink, the word What are we all striving for in this world, after all? Are we not striving to attain peace and tranquillity? The main purpose of the bill, therefore, is to bring peace of mind and comfort to some of our aged citizens, wbo may not bave known for many years tbe joy of living in a homely atmosphere. One of the cruel features of our civilization is the neglect of old people. Sucb neglect is frequently due to thoughtlessness, of wbicb younger people in all walks of life are guilty. There are thousands of lonely old people in Australia, and tbere is nothing more terrible tban loneliness in old age. Therefore, anything that can be done to relieve tbe situation of sucb people will be a welcome innovation in our system of social .services. Tbe people will always thank this Government for having introduced this scheme. Many old people have not bad a chance throughout tbeir lives. Probably, tbey bave been obliged to struggle against adversity in bringing up tbeir families and having fallen upon mischance are now unable to work out tbeir problems for themselves. Tbey will be helped under this scheme. The responsibility rests upon civilization to take up this challenge. Every community owes a. particular debt to its old people and also to its very young. Tliat is a responsibility wbicb we should not, and cannot, avoid. Talk about success in life and about material progress is all very well, but if we forget tbe need to preserve the contentment, love and affection wbicb is engendered in tbe borne we shall make a fateful mistake. It is in recognition of that principle that the Government bas introduced this bill. For the past three, or four, months the Parliament has been considering matters of great importance to the nation, including economic matters and foreign affairs, which, no doubt, are of vital importance. At tbe same time, we sbould realize that we sball not succeed as a nation if we are not prepared to accept tbe responsibility of assisting the old people wbo are unable to look after themselves. Mi-. CRAMER -It may be; but what I have said cannot be said too often because many people in every community tend to forget these vital matters. As bas rightly been said, this measure is only a start. I trust that as experience is gained in tbe best way of administering this scheme, tbe Government will provide more money for this purpose because, undoubtedly, it will be needed. However, I bave no doubt that this Government, inspired as it always is to assist tbe needy, will be tbe first to do whatever it may be required to do in the interests of tbe old people so that tbey may find happiness in their declining years. It is a wholesome thing that the Parliament should consider the problems of tbe aged and legislate for tbeir welfare. From a welter of debate on a wide variety of matters, the Parliament has now turned its attention to tbe needs of tbe aged, tbe pioneers of this country. Tbe introduction of this scheme will certainly be a cause for tremendous joy and satisfaction to the community, particularly to tbe aged people themselves. It will also be eagerly welcomed by those in the community who do not merely give lip service in this matter but, at great sacrifice, work in the interests of the aged. They will be delighted at the fact that the Parliament is legislating to do something for the welfare of the pioneers of this nation by enabling them to live under conditions befitting those who made possible the conditions that we now enjoy. I am delighted to support the bill and I shall also support the amendment foreshadowed by tbe honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen). The object of that amendment is that special medical provision shall be made for chronic cases of ill-health among the aged. Every honourable member will agree that it is necessary, not only to provide suitable bousing for the aged, but also to make special provision for aged persons whose health requires attention although tbeir complaints may not be sufficiently serious to justify tbeir being hospitalized. I should be less tban faili f I did not say a word of thanks to tbe Minister for ' has introduced this measure. Tbe Parliament accepts it and honourable members are delighted that it has been introduced. The aged people who will be enabled to live at a reasonable standard of comfort, free from tbe difficulties that now beset them, will thank the Parliament for",48,Mcmahon

116,"Social Services ( Mr Mcmahon), Who","giving consideration to their needs. After having dealt with a wide variety of subjects, for the most part related to finance and profits, the Parliament has now turned to a consideration of the needs of the aged. I ask honourable members generally to recall the history of this country and to contemplate the work that our pioneers have done since Governor Phillip arrived at Botany Bay 166 years ago. We think of the great physical development that has taken place since that time. We think of the crossing of the Blue Mountains and. the great mining development that took place in the early days. We recall how the pioneers penetrated into the heart of this continent. We remember too that many of them fought in defence of this country and kept Australia free. We think with pride and satisfaction of those who made our present-day conditions possible and enabled U3 to live in a period of relative prosperity. Having regard to those facts, we might pause to consider that from a magnificent national income of £3,700,000,000 the Parliament should be allocating only the sum of £1,500,000 for the purpose of housing the aged. Those in the community who engage in charitable works will be required to supplement that sum by raising a similar amount. The responsibility for making this scheme work will really rest upon tliat section of tbe community. In addition, the responsibility for maintaining these homes after they bave been constructed will fall directly upon those charitable persons wbo will also be asked to accept the task of providing medical services and foodstuffs for the aged occupants of these homes and, generally, to attend to tbe needs of these people. I join most heartily with those honourable members who have said that this form of assistance to tbe aged should be decentralized. I believe that the Minister will look fairly at this matter and ensure that these homes shall not be centralized in the capital cities and larger centres of population, but sball also be established throughout country so that aged persons will be enabled to spend their declining years in the localities in which they have lived for the greater part of their lives among their relatives and friends and comforted Sfr. Luchetti. by thoughts of tbeir boyhood and girlhood. It is important that tbe aged persons sbould be enabled to live under such conditions. I agree with tbe honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer) that it is terrible and ghastly to think of the aged without friends and with nobody to care for them, living alone in a world that has gone ahead of them and which concerns itself with tbe development of atomic energy, tbe attainment of flight faster than sound and with all the inventions that occupy tbe mind of the average person to-day. At the same time, those wbo pioneered tbe country are left with their memories of days which, perhaps, were more stabilized and during which, perhaps, life was more honourable and more decent. The aged must be enabled to live under decent conditions in the communities to which tbey belong. Tbere are many reasons why that situation should be made possible. The families of aged persons have a great responsibility in this matter. It is not wholly tbe responsibility of the State. Those families should accept this responsibility and do everything in their power to keep father and mother together. The family that fails to do that will do something that is anti-Christian and anti-social, and will fail to do something which even the primitive aborigines would not fail to do. The Australian aborigines under their tribal' code care for their aged and assist them in their last days. Therefore, the families of the aged have a responsibility in this matter. We are aware also of tbe kindly hearted people in the community wbo are engaged in charitable work and are ever re -idy to look after those who are unable to look after themselves. Upon those people will fall tbe responsibility of building up organizations either through local government authorities, or through the churches, to match £1 for £1 the money that is being made available by tbe Government for this purpose. Tbat will be a community effort. I bave no doubt at all that the the people as a whole, although they may be finding it difficult to live in tlie face of rising costs and raging inflation, will honour that responsibility. The churches, at present, are carrying an almost unbearable burden in their endeavours to maintain their organizations. Priests and pastors, brothers and nuns are playing an important part in tbe development of this country in keeping tbeir charitable organizations going. We bear much in this chamber about the horrors that prevail under totalitarian regimes, and the fact is emphasized that we strive for a better way of life and that we are not pagans but God-loving and God-fearing people. Upon the churches, in the main, will f a l l the responsibility of matching f l for £1 the money that is provided by the Governnient for tbe building of homes for the aged. Those organizations will also have the responsibility of maintaining those homes and caring for the aged. For those reasons, I wholeheartedly support the foreshadowed amendment of the honourable member for Parkes. As I bave said, tbe amendment seeks to provide special medical attention to aged persons in chronic ill-health whose complaint, however, would not j u s t if y their being hospitalized. I trust that as this measure is just the beginning of this scheme and is blazing tbe track as it were, the Government w ill give further consideration to that request. It must not allow the matter to rest where it is. Clearly, the sum of £1,500,000 to be promatter w ill deal with it in a sympathetic vided for this purpose under this measure way, and I sincerely trust that there w ill will not be adequate other than to match be no delay in giving f u l l effect to its finance that w ill be raised by Christian provisions. It is urgently necessary to and patriotic members of the community build homes for aged people, and I sugwho are prepared to co-operate with the gest that immediately various groups and Government in this matter. One organiorganizations bave made out satisfactory zation in my electorate bas raised over cases, money should be made available to £S0,000 for this purpose and has been tbem to enable them to provide as many awaiting the Government's decision. homes as possible as quickly as possible. Organizations in every district have been I have addressed myself only briefly to waiting for tbe Government to introduce the matter, but I know that the nation a measure of this kind. I trust that when appreciates this progressive measure that the bill becomes law and the demand for has been introduced by the Minister. I these facilities is made known, tbe Goknow that he will be remembered and revernment w ill not restrict this for m of spected for pioneering such a progressive assistance, but will give every aid to those piece of legislation, but I plead with him who want to help aged persons who to give very favorable consideration to have been lef t -without relatives and tbe proposal of tbe honourable member for friends and are practically unwanted in Parkes to extend the measure to embrace society. Those people have served this persons suffering from chronic illnesses. country so well and, consequently, this I ask the Minister on my own behalf, and is a responsibility, not of the State goon bebalf of a great number of pensioners, vernments, but of the Australian Governto ensure that as soon as possible the Goment. It is idle to contend that this is a vernment w ill match £ 1 for £1 tbe money State matter simply because the States raised by local groups for expenditure are responsible for bospitalization. Aged on homes for the aged. people sbould not be abandoned to livein shabby conditions under which many of them bave lived in tbe past. . Onlyi n to-day's press it is reported that a person on a chance visit looked into a. tent and found the corpses of two aged persons who had died as a result of neglect. They had been dead for some time. People whom I have known, have died in similar circumstances, and others, because of their feebleness, bave allowed candles or lamps to f a l l , which have set their humpies on fire and burnt the occupants to death in the general conflagration. All that has happened because those old people had no one to help or care for them. Adequate assistance to those people cannot be measured in pounds, shillings and pence. It must be measured in human kindliness and feeling for one another. In this day and age it would be a tragedy for us, and Australia would be regarded as a backward nation if we failed to realize tbe f u l l significance of the plight of many elderly people and did not act along the lines laid down in this measure. A f t e r the bill becomes law I know that the officers who w ill have charge of the very gratifying to note tnat the Opposition is supporting this bill, which will provide funds to enable homes to be built for aged persons. This measure is a social services measure in its widest sense. There are all sorts of theories about social services, and some of thern bave been put forward in the House to-day to show that there are different methods of reaching the same objectives. We believe that the true Liberal objective is to foster the family unit as the basis of society. It has always been tbe true British custom to give the citizen and his family as much freedom as possible in bis home, his work and his social life. Therefore, it has been interesting to see honourable members opposite, led by tbe honourable member for Parkes( Mr of the proposal. It bas been stated that Haylen), jumping on this very popular band wagon. The freedom of life that I mentioned is in some ways contrary to the objectives that honourable members opposite have expressed for a number of years. All too frequently they have asked people to rely on the welfare State, and have promised, in accordance with their socialist philosophy, that tbey will look after the people from the cradle to the grave. [Quorum formed*] I am quite aware that the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), who bas just called attention to the state of the House, does not like what I am saying about the socialist objectives of the Labour party. The Australian socialists have promised that, they will look after the people from tbe cradle, totbe grave, but I suggest that nothing would more easily destroy our moral fibre, initiative and national character. The socialists want us to wait like animalsin our cages for the State keeper to come round and feed us. However, the welfare of the citizens is one of the first duties of any government, and, during the past decade, there has been a realization among the thinking people of the community that vve have a responsibility tothose wbo are growing older and those who are unable properly to look after themselves. As a consequence of that state of mind, the Government has stepped in and considerably widened the avenues of governmental assistance to the people. Through tbe measure at present before tbe House, the Government is now adopting a new approach to our social welfare scheme.' The Government now proposes to subsidize on a £1 for £1 basis the money raised by groups in the community to provide homes for elderly people. But, following the true Liberal philosophy, the Government is providing some money while expecting independent groups in the community also to provide money. As the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) said previously to-day, this measure lays the basis for much greater progress in social services. A l though bonorable members opposite have supported the bill in a general way, they have forecast that the Opposition will move an amendment to widen the scope the Opposition will seek to amend the bill to provide for chronically ill people. In that regard I support tbe argument of the honourable member for Bennelong ( Mr Cramer), who suggested that we should not confuse the issue before us. The bill sets out to do one thing only and that is to assist those who are at present j>roviding homes for tie aged. After this measure has been disposed of, it will be a matter for further consideration whether we can give some assistance to tbe chronically' ill. But do not let us confuse the issue, because the provision of homes for aged' persons is a most necessary service, and it is dealt with clearly and definitely in the bill at present before us. Even now, before tbe measure has become law, the Government has received applications from organizations for assistance which, if granted, will perhaps use up the amount of money that is to be made available. Consequently, it is apparent that there is a great need for homes for the aged, and we should therefore concentrate on this measure and not allow tbe issues to be confused. The bonorable member for Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti) maintained that it was idle to say that the States were responsible for hospitalization. It is certainly uot idle to say so, because the fact is that except to the degree provided for in. the Constitution, hospitalization is quite definitely a State responsibility. The Commonwealth is the tax-gatherer of",50,Mcmahon
117,Mr Dean (Robertson) [8.48],"It isthis country and it raises money under the authority of the Australian Loan Council, hut one of the functions of the States is to spend some of that money on hospitalization. Therefore it would not be for tbe good of the people if we were to relieve the States of that responsibility. Of course the States could voluntarily forego tbeir rigbts and privileges and make hospitalization a Commonwealth matter, but they have never shown any desire to do so. In deed, it is very hard to persuade them to take back their taxing powers. The States have received all the loan money that they have required for their various undertakings, bnt they bave not been able to spend all the money they liave received. At the end of the financial year before last the States had £6,000,000 of such loan moneys left over, and last year they could not spend £3,000,000 of the money supplied by the Commonwealth. Therefore, although the address of the honourable member for Macquarie was quite interesting, he was not right when he said, that the States are not fully able to assume responsibility for hospitalization. This measure stresses that aged couples should not be parted, and consequently it will. make a great contribution to the social welfare of the nation. I believe that one could say that the measure is co-operative, and gives social services while preserving the freedom of the individual. This is a bill to deal witb human values and human relationships; but while we are considering the needs of married couples, let us not forget the aged widowers, spinsters and bachelors. I hope that when consideration is being given to various applications by organizations, the Minister and tbe Department of Social Services will also consider giving monetary assistance to those organizations which are providing homes for aged single persons. I believe that such persons are tbe really essentially lonely people of tbe community. I am glad that the bill will provide money for the provision of "" homes"" for aged people, and not institutions. The word "" institution "" has a cold and lonely sound about it, and has become associated witb a certain amount of regimentation and discipline. The Government apparently has no desire to set up institutions, because, according to tbe bill, it will not interfere in any way with the organizations that are at present providing homes for the aged. The Government will provide the money, and tbe organizations will carry on the good work. Those matters explain why this bill excites the interest and sympathy of honourable members. I sbould like to mention to tbe House that my colleague and friend, the bonorable member for Mitchell( Mr Wheeler), desired to speak on this bill. He and I have talked about :'t a good deal, and I know that be shares my views on this matter. I point out that be cannot be here to speak on tbe measure, because he is representing the Government at Remembrance Day celebrations. One matter that I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister is in relation to clause 5 (2.), which reads as follows:A trustee ov trustees undeia trust established for charitable or benevolent purposes shall, if the Governor General so approves, be deemed to be an organization referred to in the last preceding sub-section. There is a particular case, of wbicb 1 have some knowledge, that I desire to mention in this connection. A sum of money bas been left to an organization which has been considered suitable, within the definition of the will, to provide homes for tbe aged. A t present, it seems that tbe agent for setting up a trust will be the shire in wbich this home is to be established. However, I find that clause 5 (3.) provides as follows:An organization conducted or controlled by, or by persons appointed by, the Government of the Commonwealth or of a State or a local governing body estalished under the law of a State, is not eligible for assistance under this Act. In the case which I have in mind, the shire will only be the agent or channel through which the money left by the will, will pass. The shire will set up its own committee, or trustees, to build and manage tbe homes. The committee is to consist of one or two representatives of the shire, and representatives of various local organizations, both men's and women's groups, for example, the president of the Country Women's Association and the president of the Old Age and Invalid Pensioners Association. This committee will be appointed for tbe specific purpose of providing homes for aged persons. I hope that it ""will come within the scope of clause 5 (2.) and will not be debarred by the next sub-clause, because the channel through which the money will come to the committee happens to be a shire council. I join witb bonorable members on both sides of the House who have congratulated tbe Government and tbe Minister on tbeir vision in this matter. I also express my thanks to the officers of the department for the assistance which tbey have given in making available to this country such a humane measure. Mr W. M. BOURKE (Eawkner) 19.4] -This very important and desirable piece of legislation provides a happy note upon which the Parliament should finish its labours before going into recess for Christmas. Everybody in tbe House supports tbe general principles of this legislation. Most of tbe ground bas already been covered by previous speakers, and there is not a great deal more that can be said of tbe matter. Up to date, we, as a Commonwealth, in our social services legislation, bave accepted tbe principle that the people as a whole should make some contribution to the happiness, contentment and well-being of tbe aged people in the community. We have made that contribution by means of our general social services legislation in the way of pensions, medical benefits and so on. But I believe we all recognize the further principle that, in this matter, as in life generally, it is not merely a matter of money. Tbis vexed question of money, which causes all of us a certain amount of concern at times, is something which we must have if we are to meet at least our minimum requirements to enable ns to live; but we all have had enough experience of life to realize that money alone cannot purchase happiness. Indeed, it is a wellaccepted fact that, in many cases, too much money can be detrimental to tbe attainment of happiness. It is essential that the minimum requirements of our aged people, in the monetary sense, shall be met. We consider that people who have to rely entirely upon the base rate pension for their livelihood, because tbey have no otber income, are not receiving, sufficient to enable tbem to maintain those minimum standards. But I think this bill recognizes the principle, to which I certainly subscribe, that merely to increase the pension, and merely to look at this matter from the economic orfinancial point of view, will not solve the problem. Tbere are other matters in respect of the welfare, happiness and well-being of our aged people that need attention. I believe that many elderly people,, assuming that the basic financial requirements are satisfied, regard tbe provision of adequate bousing facilities at a nominal rent as the greatest necessity in their lives, to make them really happy. Some people in receipt of a pension areadequately housed. Tbey own their houses. But quite a number of otber people live under deplorable conditionsAll honourable members bave bad experience, in tbe course of their duties, of assisting the aged people with their problems. In my experience, this section consists mostly of elderly ladies-widow s or unmarried ladies-som e of whom have no relatives to help them-and some of whom, unfortunately, seem to have been forgotten by their relatives. Many of them struggle along as best they can. They pay higb rents-as much as 30s. a week and even more-ou t of their small pensions. Sometimes they are unable to care for themselves adequately, and are unable to cook for themselves. They experience great difficulty with such simple little problems as obtaining firewood, because of the economic burden of it, or, if tbe firewood is obtained, they are not able to have it chopped, and prepared for the fire. That is a very simple little matter which we would not give a thought to ourselves, but for elderly women who spend a lot of time in their rooms, the provision and preparation of that fuel sets quite a problem, which causes them a lot of hardship and distress. Eeligious bodies of all denominations and charitable institutions have played a great part in meeting tbe emergencies which come into the lives of many of our elderly people, and I sbould like to add my tribute to those paid by otber bonorable members to tbe fine work that the various religious bodies bave done in providing for the welfare of the aged people. A good deal of experience has been gained in recent years in this country, and in otber countries, of the type of housing which is most suitable for the needs of our elderly citizens. Two general types of housing seem best to fit tbeir needs. In some cases, small independent cottages in little groups, each one completely self-contained, witb a little garden., are considered most satisfactory. That type of accommodation bas been provided mainly by religious bodies and charitable organizations. In otber cases, larger blocks of buildings are established, in wbich flatettes with bed-sitting rooms are provided. Communal facilities, such as dining-rooms and recreation rooms, serve quite a desirable purpose. It is an undoubted fact that among the peculiar problems wbich face many old people are the sense of loneliness, the sense of being left on their own, and tbe sense of frustration. These problems are met, to some degree, in these particular types of homes, wbere tbere are communal recreation rooms. A further basic fact which definitely should apply, and does apply in the case of homes which are conducted by religious organizations, is that the payment to be made by the aged persons should be a very moderate or even a nominal amount. Those seem to me to be the general principles upon which this problem of homes for the aged have been tackled, and it is along those lines that I think development will take place in tbe future. The Minister for Social Services( Mr will become a very important piece of McMahon) has made an important point clear in bis second-reading speech, and that is that the Government does not propose to interfere in any way with the internal workings of tbe religious and charitable bodies wbich will be the main beneficiaries under this legislation. It is for those bodies to carry on the work in the manner in which they, from their knowledge and experience, think fit. The Government does not propose to interfere, or tell them how to conduct their business. It proposes to make this financial assistance in the form of a subsidy on a £1 for £1 basis to enable the religious bodies and charitable organizations to expand their activities. I , personally, am pleased that tbe Government has chosen this form of assistance-to help .to solve this very important problem so that this country may be able adequately to meet its obligations to its elderly citizens. Some people have suggested that governmental assistance sbould be provided in tbe form of governmental homes, and that the Government should actually build and conduct such homes as government concerns. I could not support a proposal of that kind. It is very doubtful whether the constitutional power resides in the Commonwealth to provide such a form of assistance, but quite apart from that fact I feel that it is much preferable, and much more desirable for the assistance from the Government to proceed in the maimer proposed in the bill, to help tbe established institutions, most of wbich are tbe religious and charitable bodies conducted by various denominations, to increase their activities. When we examine the bill, we realize that this legislation breaks entirely new ground. This is something that has never been done before in this country, and, as such, the legislations is necessarily of an experimental nature. We shall learn much as the scheme progresses. One honourable member who spoke earlier in tbe debate said that be regarded this bill as the most signincant piece of legislation in the social services sphere that has been introduced in this generation. I think that view is taking the matter too far, but I feel that if this scheme develops in the manner and to the extent that most of us hope and feel it will, it certainly legislation in the social services set-up of Australia. This bill is breaking new ground, and tbere will be a certain amount of trial and error as the scheme proceeds. The scheme will undoubtedly develop quickly, and I hope and expect this problem to be tackled effectively in the near future. I do not take exception to the fact that tbe amount of money to be provided under the bill is limited to £1,500,000. Some honourable members say that the sum is not enough, but I consider that it is a reasonable start. That amount of money is provided for the rest of this financial year, and. it is a reasonable start for legislation that is entirely new. We sball be able to see bow tbe sebeme works out, and wbere we go from bere in tbe. next financial^ year. However, .1 feel that clause 9 places an unnecessary restriction on tbe payment of moneys. It provides that tbe maximum liability that tbe Commonwealtb may incur sball be one-half of the capital cost of tbe home being subsidized. Up to that liniit, tbe Commonwealth will match only moneys that the institution or charitable body bas spent on tbe project, or money that it actually has in hand. That meansthat tbere is specific provision that the Commonwealth will not match moneys that the institution: intends to borrow. The result ia that, if a religious or otber charitable body proposes to erect a home, or a series of bomeo, costing, say £100,000, tbe maximum amount that tbe Commonwealth would contribute towards tbe capital cost would be £50,000. If that body were toraise only £30,000 in cash, ' and if it proposed to borrow the remaining £2-0,000, the Commonwealth would subsidize only the amount of money in hand. In otber words, it would subsidize tbe £30000, but it would not match the. £20,000 that the institution proposed toborrow. That limitation on the scope of the legislation dictated, doubtless, by financial prudence* narrows the good work that will be done, because the Minister stated, and it is expressly set out in the bill, that recognized religious and charitable bodies will be the main beneficiaries. By reason of their very nature* those bodies bave to battle hard to get their money. They are obliged toraise it by public subscription. The general method by which they finance their very desirable and worthwhile projects is to obtain bank accommodation and assistance by way of overdrafts and loans. If these institutions that are carrying out tbe desirable and necessary work envisaged by tbe bill raise money themselves,, and if , in addition, they borrow money, tbe Commonwealthshould be willing to subsidize, on a £1 for £1 basis, tbe full amount that they are prepared toinvest in the project. Et is a minor machinery matter, but it is 1 one that tbe Minister should re-examine ilr. W. M. Bourke. so that the legislation may operate in. aB wide, and as beneficial, a manner as possible. I suggest also' that the Minister,, when workingout the details' of the scheme*, should re-examine clause. 2, which defines tbe capital cost of. a home. It is proposed, that tbe Commonwealth, shall pay up to one-half of tbe capital cost, of tbe home, but, for some reason, that I confess. I do not understand, the capital cost is defined, in the case of a. home that is being erected,, as the. cost of erecting it, including the cost of necessary fixtures in tbe home,, but not including tbe cost or value of any land. That seems to be an unduly restrictive and narrow definition. I cannot seeany reason why such a. restriction should be imposed. Surely it is common practice, and common sense, to assume that, in tbe case of a home that is bought by a private person, or i : i the case of a series of homes or a large block of buildings, including a number of flatettes, for the aged, the capital cost is the cost of tbe land,, plus the cost of the building, and plus the cost of the fixtures. I suggest that, when the details of this scheme are being ironed out later, tbe Government sbould remove that restriction. The only other machinery matter towbich I direct attention is that which is coveied by the amendment that has been, foreshadowed by tbe honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen). I think most, honourable members will agree: that: the most pressing need is for the provision of: some form of hospitalizationfor aged people whose health has broken down,, and' who are. not able to care for themselves, and bave. nobody else to care for tbem. Unfortunately, public hospitals, generally speaking, are not willing toadmit such people, and it is only in thespecialized institutions, most of wbich are conducted by religious organizations thatcare for aged persons, that there is any prospect of obtaining a bed. There is an alarming shortage of beds for agedpersons who are ill . It seems to me that for tbe Commonwealth to providemoney for the establishment of homes foraged persons who> are in good health when' the. need of those who are ill is greater 1 is to make a narrow approach to the question. I suggest that, as the scheme develops, and as we learn more about it, a greater proportion of the money should be devoted to the provision of assistance fbr aged people who are ill . There are,, of course, some machinery difficulties associated with that aspect of should be provided at reasonable cost. the matter. The question of the jurisdiction of the Department of Social Services on the one hand, and of tbe Department of Health on the other, arises. The Department of Health administers the payment of hospital benefits and, in the case of institutions that are caring for elderly persons in particular, the Department of Health would be paying hospital benefit. In other words, it would be monwealth may assist the aged would be making a contribution towards the cost of maintenance.. It is proposed now that the Government shall make a contribution towards tbe capital cost of homes, but that it shall not make a contribution in the case of institutions that are caring for aged persons wbo are ill . Perhaps that restriction arises from the fact that both departments would be involved. At times I find it difficult to justify, in my really pressing problem. Although the own mind, the existence of the Department of Health. After all, health administration, in its broadest aspects, is not. a function of the Commonwealtb. It is a function of tbe States. The Commonwealth Department of Health, carries out some important functions, but it is continually impinging upon the activities and functions of the Department of Social Services. The power of the Commonwealth Department of Health to engage in most of its activities is derived lation and that we should regard it, not from the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to provide social services. I think it is desirable that most of the functions of tbe Department of Health should be brought under thc jurisdiction of the Department of Social Services. To do so would prevent a lot of overlapping, and probably it would eliminate what I think is the reason for tbe restriction to which I have referred. I have put forward these objections to the bill, not as being fundamental, but as matters that should be considered as the scheme develops. The bill is a good bill. It establishes an entirely new and novel principle in this country. It recognizes that the Commonwealtb has an obligation to help our elderly people, the pioneers of this country, to obtain adequate housing, and it clearly implies that those adequate housing facilities In its broad and general principles, the bill is very, very sound, and I hope that, if the Minister is not willing to accept the amendment that has been foreshadowed, he and his departmental officers will give thought to these matters I bave raised, as the scheme develops. As I stated earlier, perhaps the most important direction in wbich tbe Comto ensure that the alarming and growing shortage of accommodation for the aged sick is overcome. In Melbourneand I imagine that the position is the same in other cities-it is almost impossible to have an aged person who is ill admitted to a suitable institution or hospital SO' that he may receive adequate medical and nursing attention. It is a bill does not cover that position, I suggest that the Minister should give serious thought to it, and that, later, the Commonwealth should contribute financial assistance, not merely by providing finance for homes for aged persons who are well, but also by financing proper accommodation for aged persons wbo are not well. I tbink that this measure will go down in history as being a worthwhile and desirable piece of legisas being final in itself, but as a step forward towards bigger things and towards a. greater recognition of our responsibility to tbe aged persons of this country. With very great respect to those honourable members wbo may express the opposite point of view, let me state that, in my opinion, it is unfortunate that this very great piece of social legislation should have been introduced at the end of this sessional period. There is some haste for tbe House to rise. I have been absent for some considerable time, and I have no cause to take any exception to that, but, because of theimportance of this measure,",53,Mcmahon
118,Mr Roberton (Riverina) [9.26],"and because of the haste to which I referred, I fear that some honourable members will be deprived of the opportunity of expressing their personal satisfaction at the introduction of it, and of seizing the opportunity to emphasize its salient features and its great advantages to the social scheme in general. I listened with very great interest to the remarks of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr ""W. M . Bourke), who always makes a valuable contribution to debates, and I agree very largely with his statements. doubt that there are other honourable members opposite who share his views, and I know that every member of tbe Australian Country party would like to have the opportunity of expressing his own personal satisfaction at the fact that the Government, at last, has brought down a measure of this description to serve such a splendid purpose. I should like to offer my sincere congratulations to tbe Minister for the tenor of his second-reading speech. I have listened to a great number of speeches in this chamber covering a great number of important bills, some of which have dealt with social services benefits in, general terms, and some in particular terms, but I do not think that I bave ever listened to a speech that has been pervaded by a similar degree of compassion and understanding, or by a greater sense of proper social justice, than the speech of the Minister when he introduced this measure. He stated that the purpose of the bill was to set up machinery so that the Commonwealth may make grants to recognized charitable bodies and institutions to assist them in the provision of homes for aged persons. Every honourable member will agree that that is a very laudable purpose, that it is something that needed to be done, and that it needed to be done urgently. The Government is to be congratulated on taking the decisive action that it has having divided his kingdom into three taken. I congratulate the Minister, also, parts-in contrast, most of our aged on the introduction of this very important people have no kingdom to dividebill. The sum of £1,500,000 has already sought to ascertain the affection in which been appropriated in the budget for tbe he was held by bis three daughters. He current financial year to meet expendiasked them to indicate in some way the ture and grants towards the provision of measure of tbeir love. You, Mr Speaker, itr. Roberton. homes for aged persons. The question of tbe inadequacy of that amount does not necessarily arise. The cold fact remains that it is £1,500,000 more than has ever been provided before for this purpose by an Australian government in the 53 years since federation. That provision is a gigantic step forward. I support the other bonorable members wbo have expressed the view that the expenditure of £1,500,000 must help considerably towards tbe solution, of tbe vexed problem of accommodating aged I have no people. As tbe effect of that expenditure comes to be appreciated throughout the community, the responsibility to increase the appropriation will surely be recognized and accepted generally. No previous administration has had tbe same kind of social conscience that this Government has. No other government has attempted to introduce a measure of the social significance of this bill. Tbe Minister stated that it breaks new ground. That was an apt statement of the position. The attitude of Australians to aged people has always depressed me, so that I often wonder where our social standards have gone in the last few years. There was a time when aged people were respected throughout the Australian community, and retainedtheir personal identity and respect, but in the last few years their position has greatly changed. [Quorum formed.] There was no need for the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) to call for a quorum. I should not have detained the House much longer. I wish merely to express my appreciation of the introduction of this bill and my hope that it will be unanimously passed by tbe House. I had reached the point of saying that the attitude of Australians to aged persons has always depressed me. Indeed, Australians bave what might be described as a Goneril attitude to aged people. I remind tbe House of that wretched old man, King Lear, who,",58,Mcmahon
119,Social Services ( Mr Mcmahon) Upon,"will recall that that termagant of a woman, Goneril, expressed herself in these termsSir, I love you more than word can wield the matter, Dearer than eye-sight, space and liberty; Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare; No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour: As much us child e'er lov'd, or father found. A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable; Beyond all manner of so much I love you. The sentiments of that senseless woman have sometimes been expressed in precisely tbe same way by our young people in tbe expression of their attitude towards the aged members of tbe community. There was a time when our aged people occupied a unique place in the community, and I hope that this bill, if it does nothing else, will restore them to that rightful place. The greatest thing that our aged people can bave, altogether apart from good health, is personal dignity. During the last generation, I have watched a general depreciation in the personal dignity of our aged people. I bave watched grow old men and women who have served the community faithfully and well, and have toiled and slaved to improve the positions, in the first place, of their own families, and in the second place, of the community. Because of a great many of our senseless industrial laws, they have been thrown on the scrapheap, women at the age of 60 years and men at tbe age of 65 years. Those people bave been taught to believe that at those ages they have reached the end of their lives, that they cannot expect to retain their rightful place in the community, and that they are an obstruction to tbe younger members of the community whom they keep out of their rightful places in society and in the hearts and minds of others. We have watched, in recent years, the gradual approach of this dreadful state of affairs and the disappearance of the respect and affection that should rightfully belong to our aged people. As my electorate would indicate, I am undertaken those onerous responsibilities. a country man. I represent a rural Where sbould we be to-day without our constituency. Country citizens bave a churches and charitable institutions? greater regard for aged persons than have Unfortunately, it has now become people in the urban communities. I fashionable tn bold th« churches and know that the old men and women of the religious institutions generally up to Riverina electorate would much rather live in the Riverina, under any conditions, tban be moved elsewhere. I have seen men and women who have reached the age at which they can no longer obtain gainful employment, establish humpies on common ground at public watering places near villages where their friends live. Tbey occupy those humpies with much personal satisfaction and retain tbeir personal dignity and stature in the community. They hold the personal respect that they bave always enjoyed. The old men are still addressed in the village by the title of M i . and tbe elderly ladies continue to receive tbe respect that rightfully belongs to the ladies. As a consequence, nothing would drive those people away from the country villages where they have lived. That is an excellent thing. It is nothing short of criminal folly to move people who are above a certain age from a town where they have had long and pleasurable associations to institutions in far-distant metropolitan areas. I tbink the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), wbo led for the Opposition in this debate, was tbe first bonorable member to make reference to the welfare state. I hope tliat the time will never come when our aged people shall be left to the mercy of the welfare state. I can conceive of nothing more terrible than the spectacle of the aged being marched into great, gaunt institutions in the centres where tbe population is most concentrated, to be tended by uniformed attendants. That is the conception of their duty to the aged people that is held by the servants of the welfare state. This bill is certainly necessary in order that the work that has been done so competently and so well, though within strict financial limits, by the churches and other welfare organizations, may be continued. It provides for the extension of that work. I wonder what would have happened in our community if the churches and other charitableI make no apology for using that word-organization s had not violent -criticism and derision, and to hold out to destruction conventional society, as conventional society is known to those institutions. It will be comparatively easy for a generation that was born into conventional society, -and enjoyed Christianity as we knew it when we weTe young, to retreat hack into Christianity and enjoy its standards as we knew them when we were children. But our children w ill not be able to do that so easily, and therefore we should recognize tbe very great work that the churches have always done for the aged and the infirm, for whom they have -worked industriously. I am very proud fhat this Government has been the first in Australia's political 'history to assist tbe churches in their valiant work for elderly people. Our aged people are really our important people. Our attitude towards them in recent years has ""been entirely wrong, and it should be changed forthwith. I believe that life can ""begin at 60 or '65, and that there are no limits to what a person can do so long as be has the requisite health and strength. I have --recently had the opportunity to visit other countries, and the most profound impression gained in my travels relates to this very .subject. In tbe United KingdomI met again men .and women whom I had not .seen since T was a boy. Some of tbem are now 80 or 90 years of .age, and still hold the important place in the -community that they occupied -when I was a child. And they deserve -to hold it. They are still honoured in their own homes and retain the respect of the «ommunity in which they live. Their families pay tbem respect witb .a regularity that is indeed touching in the eyes of a stranger from a country such as Australia in which one does not have that delightful experience with any degree of regularity. During my travels I saw all sorts of artistic and cultural organizations, and -a great leavening of the aged was in every one of them. orchestras, and the average age of the musicians was over 55 years. The aged were still playing in the orchestras. I listened to .some of the finest choirs in the world, and the average age -of the .singers was aibout 50 years. Again the aged were .still playing their part. I saw pictures painted by aged people. I read books written by aged people. I bave .seen work of every description done by aged people, and so I say it is a delusion to imagine that, because pensions are provided for women when they .are 60, and for men when they are 65, that represents the end of their lives. It ought to be the beginning of their leisure. Limitless opportunities are available to each .one of them to live splendid lives right to the very end. I want to end my speech by referring a.gain to the excellence of the Minister's speech, and, with your permission, Mr Speaker, I sball quote a few .sentences from it. He said, for instanceTie Commonwealth is anxious ""to provide leadership jn .assisting to nnd a solution of what is a delicate human problem-the care and companionship of aged people. That, coming from a comparatively young man, and a bachelor-if I may be permitted to reveal tbe fact-surel y demonstrates just what kind of a man he is, and I am very glad that he bad the opportunity to introduce this bill. Later in bis speech, he said so succinctlyWe should be wrong if we thought that elderly people are concerned only with income That is a delusion that has ""been shared by too many Australians for too longand that .an increase in ^pension .will cure all the troubles of the aged. There are thousands of people who believe .that. He went onIncome is not 'the only problem. .Loneliness, rboredom, and the sense of not being wanted .are .also'""among the problems of old people. In my opinion, they are the greatest problems of -all. ""We cannot 'discharge our responsibilities to the aged with £1 notes any more than Goner.il could discharge her responsibilities to her father with senseless words. We have to try to restore our old people to the sanctity of -their own homes and give them the I listened to respect that is their due. I knoAv that what I bave said is not easy for those who share the opposite view to take. Their idea of helping the aged could be summarized in .this way: "" Give them £5 .a week. Give them the basic wage. To -bell with them as long as we give tbem",59,Mcmahon
120,Mr Roberton,".enough"". That would not discharge a single responsibility. I make one final quotation from the Minister's speechAll of us would like older people to he able to remain contentedly in their own homes, and to have the feeling of independence. The family remains the most important unit in our society and the stronger the family unit with its mutual ties of love, companionship and care, the stronger will be our nation and our Commonwealth. These are sentiments that honourable members of tbe Australian Country party share absolutely. paying a visit to the aged people of Europe with the aged member for Riverina( Mr Roberton), I think it might be a good idea, Mr Speaker, if we returned to the bili. I acknowledge, of course, that the honourable member kept to the bill at least when he read passages from the second-reading speech by the Minister for Social Services( Mr present pension is the bigbest in our McMahon), but that was his only contribution to the debate that was of any value to the liouse. I assure you, Mr Speaker, that, unlike the honourable member for Riverina, I sball not endeavour to recite poetry during the short time for which I shall address myself to this measure. However, before I discuss the bill, I must refer to one statement by the bonorable member. He spoke of his hatred of the welfare state and expressed t.he hope that he would never see a welfare state in this country. But, at the same time as be mouthed those sentiments, he gave his support to the bill and congratulated the Minister for introducing} it, and it is another step towards the welfare state. I welcome it because it is a step towards the welfare state. I remind the honourable member for Riverina that an earlier step taken towards the welfare state was the introduction of the age pension. This bill represents only a very hesitant step in the same direction, unfortunately. Tbe idea behind it is very laudable, and I should like to congratulate tbe Government as otber bonorable members have done, but I am unable to do so because, although I frankly admit that the introduction of the measure is a step in tbe right direction, I regret that the Government has been so nervous and hesitant in its approach to the matter, rt -[107] The plight of the aged poor of this community in relation to bousing is worse to-day than it has been for many years, and that is due very largely to the fact that we are somewhere near the top of an inflationary spiral. Living costs have increased to such an enormous degree that the improvements that we have made since the pre-war years in the provision that we make for tbe aged have not kept pace witb the spiral. Although this Government is providing the highest weekly rate of age pension that has been paid in tbe history of the Commonwealth, the maximum pension of £3 10s. a week, does not provide as much comfort for the aged as did the pension of £1 10s. a week fifteen years or so ago. Certainly it is not providing as much sustenance or comfort as did the pension of £2 2s. 6d. which was provided by tbe Chifley Government in 1948. The unfortunate truth is that, although tbe bistory, in terms of money, its actual value is very small. able member said that he was going to stick to the bill, but be has not done so. point, Mr Speaker. Tbe value of the pension is so low that aged people are finding it hard to obtain living accommodation. That is wby it is necessary for tbe Government to make a gesture, at any rate, towards providing housing for them. Aged people were able to rent a room for 5s. or 7s. 6d. a week fifteen years ago, but to-day tbey must pay £1 5s., £1 10s., or £1 15s. a week for a room. They just cannot afford to pay such, amounts for accommodation, and something must be done for them. Therefore, I welcome the first step that the Government has taken in this direction. As I have said, it is a hesitant, nervous, and very short step. a movement in the right direction. Tbe first point to be noted is that the bill provides for the appropriation of £1,500,000 for assistance towards the cost of housing tbe aged poor of tbe community. But this is governed by the",61,Mcmahon

123,Mr Brysoni Am Coming To The,,62,Mcmahon
124,Mr Bird,It is just a shuffle.,62,Mcmahon
125,Mr Bryson,"Yes, but at least it isproviso that charitable institutions, organizations of former members of the defence forces, or Governor General must also provide £1,500,000 towards the purchase of the necessary homes. Unless those organizations come to light with that amount, tbe bill will be meaningless. It will not serve to provide even one home for an aged person unless such an organization provides half the cost of that home. Even iso, I welcome the measure as the first hesitant step towards the proper care of the aged poor. something, and I hope it will be improved upon. The provision of £1,500,000 to assist the provision of housing for the aged on a £1 for £1 basis sounds all right, but we find, when we examine the bill, that the scheme is hedged around to such a great degree that it will be exceptionally hard for religious or charitable organizations to take full advantage of it. I do not want to repeat unnecessarily anything that has been said before, but I wish to enlarge on some of the statements of the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr home it will have to pay the full cost W. M. Bourke), who pointed out some of the apparent weaknesses of the bill. I shall refer to some of the details which the honourable member skimmed over very briefly. I refer first to clause 2, which provides a definition of the expression "" the capital cost"" in relation to an approved home. The honourable member for Fawkner pointed out that the cost of tbe necessary -fixtures in a home would be included in tbe capital cost, but that the cost or value of the land on which it stood would not be included. Well, if a religious organization wants to build half a dozen small houses for aged people, it must first acquire a piece of land, and, in order to do so, it must pay the f u ll market price for it. The cost of the land would probably equal half the cost of the homes to be built on it. Therefore, in that instance, the Government would contribute not £1 for £1, but £1 for every £2 which the religious organization provided. That is the effect of the first part of the definition of ""the capital cost"". The religious institutions, second part of that definition also is rather peculiar, and, I submit, should be reconsidered. It provides that tbe capital organizations approved by the cost, in relation to an approved home, means the amount which the Director General is satisfied is(6) In the case of an approved home purchased or to be purchased by an eligible organization-tli e cost of purchasing the home and of making any necessary alterations or additions to it and installing any necessary fixtures, including the cost of purchasing the land on which the home is erected, less the value of any part of that land that is not required for the purposes of the home; Under that provision, if a religious or charitable organization desires to house, say, twenty aged persons, and it has in hand sufficient money to purchase a suitable house for that purpose for,say, £30,000, tbe Government would provide £15,000 of that amount provided that the organization had tbe other £15,000 in hand. The point I make is that in that instance the total purchase price would include the cost of the land. Therefore, tbe second part of the definition of "" the capital cost"" is at variance with the first part of it. The position will be that if an organization decides to build a of the land and half the cost of the building, but if it purchases an existing building the Government will pay half the total purchase cost as it will pay noi only half the cost of the building, but also half the cost of the land on which the building stands. Clearly, that is anomalous, and I should like the Minister to explain that provision fully. In those circumstances, organizations which are interested in providing housing for the aged, but which, necessarily, are obliged to obtain the requisite finance from sources other than from direct charitable donations will, in order to take full advantage of the assistance being made available under this measure, prefer not to erect new buildings but purchase existing buildings. If many of these eligible organizations follow that course, the result will be that instead of small homes being provided for the aged on a community basis, less suitable accommodation will be provided for them in existing buildings. I repeat that under this provision an eligible",62,Mcmahon
126,Mr Ward,It is a pittance.,63,Mcmahon
127,Mr Bryson,"Yes, but at least it isorganization which erects a new building w ill be required to pay two-thirds of the total cost, including the cost of the land, whereas it w ill be required to pay only 50 per cent, of the cost if it purchases an existing building. In those circumstances, an organization w ill prefer to acquire an old family home capable of accommodating, say, twenty aged persons, instead of building a modern structure which would ensure complete privacy and comfort for aged persons. The ultimate result w ill be that many aged persons w ill be accommodated under mate-shift conditions, or at least under conditions that w ill not he nearly so satisfactory as would be provided in new structures. I again urge the Minister to reconsider the definition of "" the capital cost"" with a view to rectifying the anomaly that I have indicated. The Government has a definite responsibility to make provision for the well-being of tbe aged poor. Some honourable members bave said that this is a State responsibility. I do not agree witli that view. National Parliament is empowered, and acts upon the authority, to provide pensions for the aged. That being so, this Parliament has a moral responsibility to make available funds to enable them to Hvei n frugal comfort. Although, under tbe Constitution, the National Parliament is not specifically given power with relation to housing, it has a moral responbe amended having regard to the prosibility to make provision for the housing for the aged poor. To some degree it is accepting that responsibility in this measure under which religious and charitable organizations w ill be obliged to bear half the cost of providing homes for the aged. I bave no doubt that those organizations will be only too happy to co-operate with the Government in this direction. Nevertheless, that fact sbould not relieve the Government of its responsibility. Therefore, it should be as generhand, it would go ahead immediately with ous as it possibly can. Indeed, charitable and religious organizations would be making a great contribution if tbey were required under this measure, not to make any funds available, but to supervise the operation of this scheme, to maintain the homes proposed to be built for the aged and to care for tbe aged persons who occupy such homes. When the Government is prepared to make available the sum of £1,500,000 for the purpose of providing homes for the aged it should ensure that those organizations which w ill be required to provide a similar amount for this purpose sball be given every opportunity to do tbe best they possibly can in the interests of the aged. I suggest that in that respect the bili as drafted is too restricted. Tbe honourable member for Fawkner also referred to clause 9 which deals with the amount of the grants to be made available. Tbat clause reads(I.) Subject to this section, the amount ot a grunt under tliis Act in respect of an approved home shall be nn amount not exceeding(a) one-half of tlie capital cost of the home, as determined by the Director General; or That is quite satisfactory (6) the sum of the moneys (if any) expended, and the moneys presently available for expenditure, by the organization towards the capital cost of the home, being moneys which thc Director-General is satisfied did not become available ns a Under the Constitution, the result of the borrowing of those moneys or any other moneys by the organization and were not received by the organization from the Government of the Commonwealth or of a State or from a local governing body or otlier authority established by a State Act, whichever is the less. I suggest that that provision requires to cedure that is usually followed by charitable and religious organizations in financing the building of benevolent institutions, including homes for the aged, hospitals and orphanages. The practice followed by the majority of those organizations is to proceed with tbe erection of a building long before tbey raise the total cost of it . For instance, if an organization decided to build an orphanage at a total cost of £.)0,000 and it had £5,000, or £10,000, in construction and arrange finance to cover tbe balance of tbe cost wbich might not be paid off for a period of 50 years. The important point is that in the meantime the organization is enabled to carry on its charitable work. Under this measure, if an eligible organization decided to build a home for the aged at a cost of £50,000 it would be required to bave actually in Land half that sum before the Government would make the other half available to it. The Government should reconsider that clause and amend it to provide that it will make available 50 per cent, of the capital cost and thus enable tbe organization to go ahead with the erection of tbe necessary building and allow the organization to spread the payment of the balance over a period of years. If that were done, the position of eligible organizations in respect of this assistance woulcl be improved at least by 50 per cent. In any event, as the Government is undertaking to make available the sum of £.1,500,000 for this purpose, it sbould prescribe conditions that will enable eligible organizations, wbich will provide a similar amount in the aggregate, to follow tbe procedure wbich tbey are now accustomed to follow in the provision of buildings for charitable purposes. The Government should have no objection to iMiiciiding clause 9 along those lines. Jt should attack the problem from that viewpoint. If tbe Government waits until the various organizations raise £1,500,000 th rough donations, and by fetes and by otlier means, it will take tbe organizations three or four years to raise the money, and aged people will consequently be deprived of homes for that time. It would not cost tbe Government anything to make it easier for the approved organizations to go ahead immediately and provide homes for the aged people who are greatly in need of them. The Government should remember that whenever charitable and religious organizations accept a responsibility of any kind to raise money, they always manage to raise it ; consequently, there will be no risk to the Government if it adopts my proposal, but tbere will be a great benefit to aged, homeless people. Clause9 (2.) roadsTlic Director-General sliall not make, or nj-rec tu make, a grant under this Act to n eligible organization in respect of an approved the meaning of the legislation. home unless he is satisfied thnt the sum of tlie moneys (if any) cxjK'nded, and the moneys presently available for expenditure, by the orgiiiiizntion towards tlic capital cost of the homo, together with thc amount of the grant, will not bc less than the capital cost of the home. That seems to me, although I may be wrong, to be more or less a repetition of paragraph (b) of clause 9 (1.), and Mr Bryson. therefore it needs simplification. If the matter is not further examined it will cause more delay in the provision of homes for the aged. I am very pleased to see that the Government, in this measure, is taking another step towards tbe welfare state to which the bonorable member for Eiverina( Mr Eoberton) so violently objected earlier in the debate. We must accept responsibility for the care of the aged, but I believe that during past years this country has neglected that responsibility, and much more should have been done to help those deserving people. We are providing pensions for them, wbich, although only pittances, they have paid for during their working years. Similarly, they have paid for the homes that tbey should be living in at present. We should do everything possible to make tlieir declining years happier than they are now, and if we can do that we can say that this Parliament has been of some use to tbe aged people who are unable to fend for themselves and who deserve every consideration. [10.19] I desire to say something about tbe nature and magnitude of tbe problem of caring for tbe aged, and I want to relate those remarks to the remarks made by tbe honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen) when he was foreshadowing an amendment to this bill. amendment in the committee stages of the bill. stand that the substance of the honourable member's amendment will be that homes for the aged should be provided in conjunction with hospital facilities. concern the provision of a subsidy to institutions that care for aged, sick people, but which are not hospitals within [Quorum formed.'] stand that the honourable member for Parkes intends to move that some special provision be made for aged, sick persons.

132,Dr. Donald Cameron,"I underI misunderstood the honourable member. I point out to the House the undesirability of adding to the magnitude of the problem of caring for the aged, or of adding a provision to the bill which might restrict it to people for whom provision is made in other legislation. I intend to put some figures before bonorable members, which relate to the size of the aged population in proportion to the general population, and indicate the rate at which that proportion is increasing. They refer to tbe population of England because I have not tbe precise figures for Australia, but I suggest that that will make no difference to my argument because the problem in Australia is the same as the problem in England, and tbe proportion of old people in Australia to the total population is increasing at almost the same rate as the proportion of old people to the total increasing. In 1891, 5 per cent, of the English population were over 65 years of age. By 1951 the percentage bad risen to 11 per cent, and it is estimated that by 1980, wbich is not so far away, the percentage will have increased to 20 per cent, of the population. In other words, by 19S0 one-fifth of our population will be composed of persons over 65 years of age. Therefore, honourable members will appreciate the magnitude of the problem of providing sufficient homes for up to one-fifth of the people, though of course not tbe whole of this one-fifth will n?ed to be accommodated in them. The increased proportion of older people in the population is due to a falling birth-rate in England, which factor is also present in this country, and ibe increasing efficacy of general health measures which are prolonging life and altering the pattern of old age. Those measures are altering it by substituting for acute terminal illnesses, more longdrawn out terminal processes. Tbe result of that will be that the duration of incapacity in the otber groups of the population will increase. It has been estimated that to about the age of 70 people are potential donors to the common effort, and after 70 years they are potential debtors to tbe common effort. Therefore, the problem is R -[108 ] not only one of providing homes, but also of doing something to defer the incapacity of old age. I believe that the present is a relevant time to point out to the House some of the measures which can be taken to help to diminish this problem of incapacity of old age. Some of them are extremely simple. Eor example, it has been discovered that the two most effective measures that can be taken to keep people in employment, and keep them active in their old age, are the provision of suitable spectacles and the provision of 'suitable hearing aids. As age increases, a greater stimulus of the sensory mechanism is required in order to produce the same results. Therefore, in addition to passing the legislation at present before us, we should realize that we can deal with the age problem not only by providing shelter for the aged but also by attempting to population of England is diminish the size of the debtor group relevant to tbe rest of tbe community. In other words, we have to defer, if possible, the onset of old age. I believe that this measure, which is an excellent one, is based on proper principles. It does not approach the matter on tbe basis that it is primarily or -wholly a Government responsibility, and it is in line with tbe social services legislation that established the health scheme of this Government, which takes as its basis the belief that the community sbould make some effort and some contribution to social services and that the Government should assist that effort. That is the supremely important factor in this legislation. The bill is not designed to set up institutions controlled by tbe Government, or chiefly supported by government finance; it is designed to assist the people to help themselves. It is very important, for two reasons, that the legislation should be designed on these lines. The first is that it is immensely important that OUT social services legislation should not absolve the family from its responsibility, and the second is that it is doubtful, in the light of what I have said about the increase of the aged element of the population, whether the problem can be solved by tbe family alone, the State alone or institutions of tbe kind mentioned in tbe bill alone. It will require a common effort from all tliree groups to deal with this matter, and therefore I join with other honourable members in commending the Minister for having approached it on the basis laid down in the bill. I am sure that the measure will be effective legislation, because it does not lay the primary responsibility on the State for the provision of homes for the aged. -with other honourable members in expressing satisfaction at tbe introduction of this bill. I bave no doubt that the reason for its presentation to the House is that the social conscience of the community bas been disturbed by tbe fact that adequate provision has not been made in the past for the care of aged people. Honorable members will need to realize that this Parliament will have to accept to an increasing degree tbe obligation to provide suitable housing, and to make provision for the general happiness and well-being of that worthy section of the community. The sum of £1,500,000 which is to be made available this financial year to assist religious and other bodies to build homes for the aged, is not a princely amount. approximately that sum each day if it were waging a war. Therefore, we should not be tempted to think that we have satisfied all the demands of this problem by the provision of £1,500,000. Our responsibilities in this matter are increasing. People are now living longer tban they have at any previous time in history. As the result of the immigration programme, our population is also increasing rapidly. So, in future years, we must expect to be called upon to make provision for tbe care and well-being of increasing numbers of a'ged persons. I have some knowledge of the responsibilities that are involved in this matter. In the electorate of Sturt, which I have the privilege to represent in this House, there are institutions which make special provision for the care of aged persons. Certain religious organizations have done magnificent work in caring for them. Any one who has a knowledge of the splendid work that has been accomplished at the Felixstowe-road Aged Folks Home, sponsored by tbe Central Methodist Mission of Adelaide, cannot fail to be impressed with the marvellous standard that has been attained. That achievement is worthy of the highest commendation. So greatly has it commended itself to the general community that railway workers in Soutb Australia have made weekly contributions which, in the aggregate, bave financed the erection of two new wings to accommodate aged persons. In those homes, husband and wife are not separated. Tbe greatest care, and the most sympathetic consideration, are given to those who are in the eventide of life. This lead is followed by many otber religious bodies and charitable organizations in South Australia, but it is time that some assistance is given to them to enable them to carry on the worthy work that they have undertaken. I believe that this kind of work, to j m increasing degree, must be accepted as a Commonwealtb responsibility. The State does not adequately or satisfactorily make provision for the care of aged people. The Old Folks Home at Magill is totally inadequate for the purposes that it sbould serve, and does not provide the comfort that should be availAustralia would expend able to elderly people. What is most regrettable is that, in that institution, husband and wife are separated. I consider that accommodation of a better standard, more in keeping with modern developments in social care in otber countries, should be provided at that place. Honourable members who represent other electorates in .South Australia are aware that the shortage of accommodation for elderly folk is so acute in that State that arrangements have bad to be made to house them in the mental asylum in Adelaide. It is deplorable that people who are in the eventide of their lives, have the prospect of spending the remainder of their days in an' institution established for the care of mentallyafflicted persons. That is totally inappropriate and unsatisfactory. Tbe splendid accommodation that has been established by religious bodies for the care of aged people is a pattern that the State should copy with its institutions. I hope the Government realizes that it is at the beginning of a substantial",65,Mcmahon
133,Mr Makin (Sturt) [10.30],"I joinprogramme which will have to he undertaken if we are to provide the care which aged persons need. They have given the best years of their lives in work and service in Australia, and have thereby brought to us the well-being, advancement and general prosperity which exist in the Commonwealth to-day. We should be prepared to share some of our advantages with those who have made it possible for us to enjoy them, because we have a great responsibility to them. I feel that, in this legislation, there is an acknowledgment and acceptance of that responsibility. I support the amendment foreshadowed by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr only £1,500,000. Buti f that small sum Haylen), which makes provision for the payment of a subsidy to institutions which care for aged sick people. Some folk in their declining years require special care and medical attention, although tbeir condition does not warrant their admission to a hospital. Accordingly, they are accommodated in the sick bay of the institutions in wbich they live, and I believe that the benefits of tbe Commonwealth medical scheme should be available to them. For that reason I strongly support the amendment. As was generally anticipated, this bill has given satisfaction to honourable members on both sides of the House, and some very generous commendatory remarks have been applied to it. Of course, we have had the odd, jarring note, that tbe amount of £1,500,000 provided for this financial year was not enough in some respects. Well, in my experience, any move of this description always brings forth the objection that the accompanying financial position is not enough. As long as we try to do something for one body of people, whether by way of subsidy, bounty, or any other form of assistance, another person will claim that he is equally entitled to the benefit, and, fresuggestion may not be satisfactory to tbe quently the result is that nobody gets anything. It is true that only £1,500,000 is provided for this financial year, but it is £1,500,000 more than has ever been provided before for a purpose of this kind. Tbis is only tbe beginninga beginning which, I believe, will grow with the passing of the years, and it should be regarded from that point of view. -Some bonorable members believe that the bill does not go far enough, and that certain other worthy institutions are being neglected. I point out again that this is only a beginning, and that the Government cannot provide for everything in Australia at the commencement of any scheme. The cost of meeting all the demands wbich some honourable members seem to consider should be met, would run into £50,000,000 a year, and I hope that no government would provide such a colossal sum for an experiment of any kind. The Government is to be highly commended for making this beginning, even though the amount i/i were distributed among all the States to subsidize hospital schemes and to help the sick, the effect would be so negligible that nobody would know that there was any benefit at all. Spent on tbe purpose for wbicb it is provided, and that is to build homes and cottages for old people to live in, tbe money will do a magnificent job in all parts of tbe Commonwealth, in the country districts as well as in the cities. For that reason, I rather regret that a jarring note bas been introduced, and that an amendment must be moved to a bill which all speakers have commended as a generous piece of legislation. The institutions which the amendment is designed to benefit are worthy institutions, but if they do not come within the ambit of this legislation, why do Opposition members try to delay the passage of the bill, or introduce a jarring note by saying that it is not enough, and that provision should be made for this, that and the other thing? If , in the experiment, we discover that certain worthy institutions are neglected in this legislation, let us register the vow that we shall see that they are included in a much larger allocation in the future. That institutions concerned, but if this bill had not been introduced, the £1,500,000 would not have been available this year, and they would still be no worse off tban tbey are to-day. I hope that the Minister will resist any attempts to use this money to subsidize large institutions. I hope, too, that he will ensure that country districts will",67,Mcmahon
134,Mr Bowden (Gippsland) [10.40],"be treated on an equal footing with the cities, at least in proportion to their respective populations. I seldom refer to my own electorate in this chamber, but I think that, on this occasion, I am entitled to do so, because the Anglican Church has commenced a scheme for the construction, in very pleasant surroundings, of a group of cottages known as Clifton Waters village. It is proposed to build cottages that will cost no more than £1,000 each, each cottage to consist of three rooms including a bedroom, a large lounge and dinette, and a large electrically-equipped kitchen. The cottages will be detached, and each will have its own vegetable and flower garden. The vUlage will he a credit to Gippsland, and to Victoria as a whole. Encouragement will be given to aged persons, who have £1,000 or £1,500, to expend that money in the erection of a cottage for their own use. All facilities, including sewerage, will be provided. Those persons will be able to own tbeir own little cottages and live in them until they pass away, when they will become available for somebody else. I think it is a splendid scheme, and that it is one that the Government, or any other institution, sbould seek to help. It is proposed that there shall be a daily visit by district nurses, .who will attend to these persons in tbeir own little cottages. The village is not very far distant from the general hospital. If tbe nurses think that, when, those persons become ill , they should go to the hospital, they will be sent tbere. Otherwise, they will be treated in their own homes. I have made an appeal to the Minister on behalf of this organization, and I know that he has registered that appeal, together with others. Tbat is why I make a plea on behalf of country districts. To provide such persons with detached cottages, where they may potter about and grow their own flowers and vegetables, is very much better than to herd them together in flats in the cities. I wish to commend, those who have had the foresight to establish that village in which aged people will be able to enjoy the society of one another amidst picturesque surroundings. The proposed provision of £1,500,000 Anglican Church and the Methodist is for the purpose of providing cottages Church. Those homes receive, chronically of that description, not elaborate instisick aged persons such as diabetic cases. Mr Bowden. tutions, tbe cost of which will run into tens of thousands of pounds. It is intended that tbe cottages at Clifton Waters shall be built with local labour. The scheme that is envisaged by tbe bill will provide such cottages on a maximum scale. The proposals that are envisaged in the amendment that has been foreshadowed may be implemented by the allocation of a greater sum of money on another occasion. The proposed allocation of £1,500,000 is too small to cover everything at once. I hope that the proposed scheme will develop from year to year so that many more people may be able to enjoy its advantages. My main purpose in rising was to make a plea for the Clifton Waters village. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In committee: Clauses1 and 2 agreed to. Clause 3(1.) The purpose of this Act is to encourage and assist the provision o£ suitable homes for aged persons, and in particular homes . . . There seems to be some misapprehension about the amendment that bas been foreshadowed, and probably it arises from the fact that reference was made to it during the second-reading stage. I move That, in sub-clause (1.), after the word "" persons "" first occurring, the following words be inserted:--"" and aged sick persons "". An examination of the bill reveals that, probably, it could be interpreted as including aged sick persons in addition to aged persons. Tbe Opposition desires to bave the position clarified, and it is for that reason that the amendment has been moved. Tbe honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron), who is a medical man, seemed to be alarmed because be feared that tbe clause, as amended, would cut across the question of hospitalization, and that social services health schemes wonld be involved. Let me clarify the position by quoting an example. In tbe electorate that I represent, there are certain homes that are conducted by, I think, tbe",68,Mcmahon

Tp all intents and purposes, tbey are homes for aged persons, but they are sick aged persons. According to tbe statement of the Minister, and the provisions of the bill, such institutions would be excluded from the benefit conferred by tbe bill, because, I understand, they receive some form of bospital benefit. homes. In tbe case of my own electorate; Nobody would be foolish enough to think that the proposed subsidy of £1,500,000 would go very far. The bill has been introduced for the purpose of formulating some sort of scheme upon wbich we may build, both by increasing tbe amount of tbe subsidy and by inducing various organizations to find tbe funds upon wbich the subsidy is based. If our first contribution to the scheme is to apply a rather harsh exclusion to aged sick persons, we will not achieve the desired result. There is no need to canvass tbe amendprogress is being made in the various ment. Either it is a good amendment, or it is not. Either it is acceptable to tbe Government, or it is not. It is not a question of attempting to have hospitals covered by the clause, as tbe bonorable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) seemed to fear. Let me illustrate the point in another way. Aged persons are received into many of the big homes, and are cared for in those homes. Such persons are healthy within the limits that ment, but, if he is not willing to do so, are imposed by tbeir age and physical condition. But attached to those home3 is a bospital annexe where they may receive treatment without leaving the home. Such institutions are covered by the clause, but if a cottage that is purfor it in the future. Organizations that chased by some religious organization happens to be a mile along the road, and if the same sort of medical treatment is given at that home as is given in the former home, where sick aged persons are treated and rested, it is excluded from the subsidy. Let me urge upon the Minister for urgency of this matter. It is necessary that aged sick persons be provided with accommodation as quickly as possible, and that this very good measure be implemented as soon as it becomes law. Tbe first call upon tbe subsidy should be for the benefit of the aged sick persons. Tbat sick persons. is obvious. As every honourable member knows, the problem is one of getting sucb persons into homes, because there is a long waiting list. They are a cause of anxiety to the Government, to themselves, and to their relatives if they have any. It is for that reason that very many religious organizations have been concentrating on the acquisition of small they may buy a home at Burwood or at Strathfield, furnish it very quickly, and wait until later to make general alterations. Tben tbey receive aged sick persons who have nowhere else to go. The State hospitals are full. Chronically sick people of any age are not received into many of the larger hospitals. These small institutions are easing the agonisingly desperate position. In fact, tbe Minister will be opening one such home in my electorate next Sunday. I am not making that statement as an advertisement, but in an effort to illustrate that suburbs of the capital cities in tbe provision of homes for aged sick persons as well as for aged persons. The amendment is. not intended to cut across anything for which provision is already made in the bill. The Government is laying the basis for something big, and I am prepared to say so. I hope that the Minister will accept the amendbe sbould be able to explain to us whether the clause applies to homes for aged sick persons. There will not be an immediate demand for assistance in the provision of such homes, bnt there, will be a demand are interested in the erection or purchase of such homes are in need of the subsidy, so that they may erect more and more such homes: They have first priority in the care of aged people. A consequential amendment to clause 6 is implied, but I shall leave the position at that. I ask the Government, for the sake of the efficient implementation of the scheme, to include provision for aged sick persons. On the other hand, I ask tbe Minister to inform the committee whether there is implied in clause 3 provision for the payment of a subsidy upon the building of homes, or the purchase of existing homes, for aged",69,Mcmahon

But I do not tbink it is proper to attained the age of sixty five years attempt to solve it by amending tbe bill. or a woman who has attained the age This measure is a far-reaching one, and of sixty years and includes the wife or husband of an aged person residing no comprehensive amendment in it should or desiring to reside with the aged be made now. Theb ill is designed for a person. The definition does not make any achieve also the objective that the bonorreference to the aged person being sick or able member bas in mind. I do not sughealthy, or anything of that description. gest that that objective is not worthy. It Social Services does not take that view. doubt that the term "" aged persons "" in clause 3, not only is capable of including, but also must include, tbe aged sick person. My view is that the inclusion of the words proposed in the amendment could add nothing to the clause. I fear that the inclusion of them might detract from the effect of other clauses. I know that, very often, questions of interpretation must come before the courts, but I do feel that, if tbe Government were to insert in clause 3 something which implied that "" aged persons"" did not include aged sick persons, except where specifically mentioned, it might well seem that a contrary intention appeared in other parts of the bill. AgainI state that those matters of legal interpretation are difficult. I want to make the thing as clear and as plain as possible. The bill, as it is drafted, is clear on the point that the expression "" aged persons"" always includes aged sick persons, and there is ho reason to amend the bill in relation to that matter. I think that the (Mackellar) honourable member for Parkes should be If u l l y appreciate word "" homes "", and that he is under a The expression "" aged persons"" in looked closely at the drafting of the bill. am in entire agreement w i th the honorproblem in relation to that matter is the honourable member has stated it to good purpose, and we sbould not confuse the issue by attempting to make it is extremely worthy.

Persons who are accommodated in aged people's homes w ill , in the unhappy course of nature, naturally f a l l sick as they grow older, and therefore I hope that auxiliary hospital bays w ill be provided.

The amendment moved by tbe honourable meniber for Parkes detracts from rather tban adds to tbe force of clause 3, which, in its present form, will allow to be done the things that tbe bonorpeople it would not merely specify aged able member wants to be done. Por tliose reasons I am inclined to oppose the amendment, although I wholeheartedly agree with the honourable membeiabout the great and pressing problems that be has mentioned. No doubt tliose problems will receive the attention of the Government as .the opportunity occurs to attend to tbem. The bill does something clear and definite, and it constitutes a great forward step. We should not confuse the issue by trying at the same time to do something else. Finally, let me say that clause 3, as it is drafted, and quite apart from the provision of bospital accommodation, is wide enough to permit an ample number of applications which will absorb the entire £1,500,000 that will be made available for the purpose. Also-and this is much more important-it will enable the complete administrative resources of the Department of Social Services, at this experimental stage of tbe scheme, to be utilized to the full. We shall have to go slowly. The provision of hospital accommodation, which is apparently desired at. this stage by the honourable member for Parkes, although his amendment does not in my view further his purpose, can be made only at the cost of restricting tbe operation of the bill in other spheres. Since the bill is in a sense a lever to introduce social change, and carries with it great hope for beneficial changes in the long run, we should not restrict its operation at this stage by diverting some part of our monetary and administrative resources to an attack on the other problem that the bonorable member for Parkes has mentioned. AgainI emphasize that I am in entire agreement with the honourable member about tbe existence of that problem and about the need to turn our attention to it next. Opposition) [11.6] -The point made by ments. Apparently the draftsman conthe honourable member for Parkes( Mr siders that tbey are not included in the Haylen) is simple. It is true that, in a term "" aged persons "". I ask the Minisgeneral way, the term "" aged persons "" ter whether I am right in thinking that includes persons who are aged, whether the draftsman takes the view that homes or not they are sick, but that is no answer to the arguments of the honourable meinber for Parkes. If tbe bill were intended to make provision for aged sick persons. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) agreed that tbe purpose of the bonorable member for Parkes is worthy, but be stated that be was inclined to oppose the amendment, apparently because in bis view the purpose could be best achieved by the passage of another measure. The honourable member sbould bave listened to the arguments of tbe honourable member for Parkes if be intended to participate in the debate on tbe amendment. I put it to the Minisplainly that aged sick persons are a distinct class of people. Tbe provision of homes for them as such is not quite the same thing as the provision of homes for aged people. A different type of agreement would have to be entered into for the purpose. The honourable member for Parkes has referred to the controversy over that matter. The deaconesses of the Church of England have pointed out that the buildings proposed to be constructed at Liverpool and Ashfield will be for the accommodation of aged people who are ailing, but are not, in the strict sense, hospital patients. They need something more than a home. They need a degree of additional attention, and they might properly be described as aged sick persons. They should be brought within the scope of the provisions of the bill. Either they are included in the term "" aged persons "" or they are not. If tbe Minister's intention is to exclude tbem, let bim say so. The Opposition takes the view that they should be included and that the matter should be put beyond doubt. That is the purpose of the amendment, and it can be achieved easily. There is no reason why homes for such persons should not be included in tbe scheme. They could be included merely by a specific reference to aged sick persons in tbe clause and by a slight adjustment in the requisite agree-",71,Mcmahon

A time will come when persons who occupy homes subsidized under the bill will be no longer able to look after themselves and, unless they can secure admission to hospitals, tbey will rapidly grow weaker and the homes will quickly deteriorate. It is natural, and I believe recommended by geriatricians, that in such circumstances aged persons sbould transfer to homes where those things which tbey can no longer do for themselves can be done for them.

The honourable member for Oxley (Dr. Donald Cameron) suggested that these institutions might be hospitals.

Eor that reason I again urge him to accept the amendment. hesitate to enter this discussion at such a late hour, but it seems to me that the members of tbe Opposition, and particularly the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), who moved the amendment, have failed to appreciate fully the intentions of the Government. Tbey are not completely aware of tbe situation in relation to the problem of bousing old people. Only £1,500,000 is to be made available under the bill for this work in the current year. £1,500,000? the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) to interject critically. Tbe honourable member for West Sydney( Mr thwarted and many homes which are Minogue) said earlier to-night that this work should have been undertaken ten years ago, and, at that period, of course, tbe honourable member for Melbourne was a member of a Labour government wbich showed not the slightest consideration for aged people. I believe it would be fair to say that, even at this stage, the Departour aged people. Tbe essential requirement of Social Services has received applications for subsidies under this legishave only £1,500,000 available this year, lation amounting to at least £1,500,000 for the current year. Probably the applications exceed that figure. Tbat means that, if the amendment were accepted, the applicant organizations would receive less from the total of £1,500,000 tban tbe Government wishes them to receive. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) clearly do not appreciate the main circumstances associated .with the task of providing homes for aged people. Earlier to-day the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Coutts) mentioned an outstanding example of an aged people's home, which is situated at Chermside in the electorate that I represent. Tbe matron of each section of that' home is a qualified nurse, and every resident is able to obtain proper nursing attention for illnessess such as influenza and other complaints which last for a few days. The Government intends this bill to provide for the needs of institutions such as that, and, if it does not serve that purpose, my understanding of its terms is completely astray. I maintain that when old people reach a stage at which they cannot be nursed in such a home, a hospital is the best place for tbem. hospitals. What rubbish to talk! delay in obtaining admission to public hospitals in Queensland. This Government's record of providing assistance to people, whether they be aged or not, is outstanding, and it cannot be said truthfully that it has failed to give adequate consideration to the needs of all sections of the community in relation to the treatment of ilhiesses. I believe that, if the amendment were accepted in order to make provision for tbe aged sick, the principal purpose of tlie bill would be badly needed would not be provided. Tbe most urgent necessity of aged people in our community is adequate housing. We have often been told that we should give them a larger income. I do not believe for a moment that a higher income would meet the principal need of a majority of ment is accommodation. As we shall it would be a pity to draw upon that amount merely to cover a few special cases-and I maintain that they are very scarce-wher e a special hospital is set aside for the treatment of people who are old and sick. -The Government has not carried out its election promise in regard to this matter. The Government promised to subsidize, on a £l-for-£l basis, all institutions which care for the aged. Now we are told that people who are aged will be able to get something, but that, if they happen to be sick as well, tbey will get nothing under this legislation. In any case, tbe amount made available is to be limited to £1,500,000. Wby, heavens above, Australia spent £1,000,000 a day during World War II ! This Government now proposes to spend a day and a half's war expenditure in one year to look after old people.",74,Evatt Tha T Is Different I Sliall Shortly Describe Would Not Be

163,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [11.26].,"The Minister for Social Services( Mr the Italian. Australians far too often McMahon) knows that there will be many applications in tbe files of the department very soon. The Government will have to conduct a lottery or use some other such method to determine wbich applications shall be successful! Perhaps the decisions will go, like kissing, by favour! Tbe CHATEMArJ Order! The honourable member must refer to clause 3. members have discussed the proposed provision of £1,500,000 and bave praised the Government. I say that tbe amount is too small and that tbe Government had better come up to date. Tbe Minister bas saidI think the House will agree that the Commonwealth . . . has made a generous but a necessary gesture towards the solution of one of our great human problems. . . . We look forward to the day when the principle of Government assistance to self-help and voluntary effort will be more widely accepted. The Liberal socialists bonorable member return to the subject of clause 3 and tbe amendment? The Liberal socialists and the Country party socialists applaud this clause, and so do the Labour socialists. We are all socialists, more or less. But I say that the purpose of the bill is not the same as the Government promised at the time of the general election campaign. The purpose, according to clause 3, is to encourage and assist tbe provision of suitable homes for aged persons, and, in particular, homes at which aged persons may reside in conditions approaching as nearly as possible normal domestic life. Tbat is not good enough. I know the Australian community as well as most people do, and I know how the people within the British Commonwealth behave badly, in many instances, towards their aged parents. The provision of homes of the sort described in clause 3 will not solve the problem as it should be solved. The people of the British Commonwealth do not behave towards their aged as well as do the Germanic, the Nordic, the Teutonic, tbe Slavonic, tbe Greek and put their old people into homes when times are good and take them out when times are bad so they can live on their pensions. Sitting suspended from 11.80 p.m. to 12 midnight. Friday, 12 November, 1954. poses that the money to be provided will be expended on tbe provision of homes for married couples. If that is not so, the final words of the clause are meaningless. I should hope that the Government would build flats on the European model in order to do everything possible to help the old people to lead a leisurely life. I make the suggestion to the Minister that, if ever flats are built under this provision, perhaps an aged couple who live in the building and who come within the ambit of this measure could be caretakers of the building. That would be in accordance with the European custom. The great tragedy is that many old couples cannot live with their families. Because of age and other considerations tbey are obliged to live in rooms and lodgings. They are finding it most diflicult to do so. Many may not be able to obtain accommodation in homes of the kind that are to be provided under this measure. The most tragic cases of all are those of people who are being exploited by' harpies who live on them and, on every occasion on wbich the pension or the basic wage is increased, raise the rental payable by old people. The condition of these unfortunate people grows worse. All honourable members desire to do something for tbe aged. The Opposition does not object to this bill. We support it. Buti f the Government is going to do something for the aged, it should set up an all-party committee along the lines of the old social services committee, with a view to finding a solution of this problem whicli confronts old people in the evening of their days. A lot of pharasaical talk is being indulged in throughout Australia on this subject. Old people to a large degree are a problem because medical science bas prolonged tbe average life span. Old people are not able to earn tbeir living,",75,Evatt Tha T Is Different I Sliall Shortly Describe Would Not Be

167,Mr Calwell,"This clause proand they must be provided with assistance of this kind. However, only the working section can provide all the requirements for the community, and I am a little afraid that unless we do something novel and striking in the way of looking after the aged this measure will not be sufficient. The Minister has said that the measure is a step in the right direction. It is too short a step. If the Minister has already received tbe number of applications which I believe he has received, and which, probably, would involve an expenditure of £6,000,000, he should introduce an amending bill when the Parliament re-assembles in order to push this matter further forward. By our treatment of the old we shall be judged. the young bird does not feed the old bird. Unfortunately, in our civilization, quite too many young people are set in the heresies of materialism and are neglecting the interests of tbe aged. Whilst the Government is to be commended on introducing this measure, it is perhaps giving an opportunity to that class of young persons to avoid tbeir responsibilities further in this matter. I should like to see a change in the attitude of the community towards the aged and tbe introduction of something that would more approximate tbe spirit that prevailed in this country twenty or more years ago. To-day, our people do not look after their old as most Europeans and Asians look after theirs; The Asian people adhere to ancestor worship which also really means caring for the aged in the battle of life and, honouring their memories when they are dead, they at least make some return to tbose who reared them. [Quorum formed.] Social Services) [12.6 a.m.] -The honourable member for Parkes( Mr ing, that home will be automatically Haylen), in . a constructive speech, raised certain points which should be answered. Most of them were answered effectively, and accurately, by my colleague the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) who, if I may say so, gave a perfect explanation of the clause now before tbe Chair. In the light of what has been said, the Government rejects the amendment for several reasons. We have to ask ourselves what the puipose of the clause is. What does it mean? Quite clearly, it means two things. First, it relates not to hospitals but to homes; and, secondly, it relates to aged people, that is to women over the age of 60 years and males over the age of 65 years, or the husband or wife of persons of tbose respective ages. In each case, we have to determine tbe essential nature of the scheme. If it is to provide homes for aged people, we must apply that test. If an application for assistance under this measure relates to a home for aged people, that application will be considered. We must ask ourselves, first, whether the money is reI n the natural order, quired for a bome; and, secondly, whether it is required for aged persons. If the answer to those two questions is in the afiirmative, an application for assistance will be considered. That is the whole purpose of the measure, and it is demonstrated by applying that simple test. Honourable members opposite bave lost their sense of perspective in arguing about this matter. I assure the committee that the bill will be generously administered and that the Government will do whatever it considers good to do within the terms of the bill. It will exert itself to the maximum to ensure that good shall be done. Honourable members opposite are a little unrealistic when they endeavour to interpret the clause literally and, perhaps, a little extravagantly. I again assure them that the measure will be interpreted in a sensible way and that it will be administered to the satisfaction of most of the people concerned. Looking at the general definition, the test to be applied is whether the building is a home and whether it is a bome for aged people. Tbat does not mean to say that if a few sick people happen to be accommodated in the buildexcluded from the operation of this measure. departmental officers that such a bome would be excluded. are a few sick beds, or something that is incidental to the main purpose of the",76,Evatt Tha T Is Different I Sliall Shortly Describe Would Not Be

170,Mr Mcmahon,"If, in a home, therehome, it still remains a home and, therefore, would come within the scope of this .scheme. I shall mention three other facts of importance in helping the Government to make np its mind in the matter. The first of them is that in a scheme of this kind it seems desirable to go slowly at the beginning. It would be wrong as a matter of practice, or principle, to endeavour at this stage to cast our net too wide, because, if we did so, we should soon get into trouble. The amendment would add absolutely nothing to the clause as drafted. A common-sense rule in legal interpretation is that the whole includes the part. If , as is proposed under tbe amendment, the adjective "" sick"" were inserted in the clause, making its purpose to assist in the provision of suitable homes for aged sick persons, the clause, obviously would thereby be restricted. I repeat that the amendment would add nothing to the bill as drafted. On all scores, therefore, the Government rejects tbe amendment. It may be possible that what honourable members opposite had in mind was to apply the provisions of this measure to hospitals. Such an amendment, if accepted, would change the wliole purpose of the bill. For that reason the Government cannot accept the amendment. I am disappointed that tbe honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam) misrepresented my attitude in tbe case that he cited. The Government has said that it is not prepared at this stage to commit itself in an individual case. If an individual makes an inquiry, as the honourable member's friend did when he rang uie up and asked whether the bome whicli lie mentioned would come within tbe scheme, he will be told, as I told that gentleman, to put in his application and it will be dealt with on its merits and 'n accordance with the law. I was not familiar with Hammond's Pioneer Homes. I did not know their scope, or whether tbe organization conducted homes «r hospitals. Tbe honourable member should recommend his friend to put in bis application. If that is done, the application will be dealt with. I am sorry thai the honourable member's friend told bim that I had turned down his application. That is not the case and no one knows better tban tbe honourable member's friend that his application was not turned down. I repeat that tbe amendment would add nothing to the bill as drafted. It is unnecessary. It would merely clutter up the clause and, possibly, cause confusion in the future. Is tbe Minister for Social Services assurance in respect of a specific case. On next Sunday be will open a home for sick aged persons. In performing that duty, will he be able to tell bis bearers that that home will be eligible for subsidy under this clause? He will not be able to do that.' Therefore, tbe whole of his explanation was not valid but evasive. Amendment negatived. Clause agreed to. Remainder of bill-by leave-take n a< a whole and agreed to.

173,Mr Calwell (Melbourne) [12.15,"of members of tbe board sbould be increased. Wben tbe board was originally establisbed there were three members on it. The board was charged with the responsibility of co-ordinating commercial and national radio networks, supervising the general interests of broadcasting and making reports to t.he Parliament. Indeed, honourable members received one of those reports yesterday. The personnel of the board has changed during the years, and the gentleman wbo was once the third member of it is now the chairman. A second member has been appointed from outside the Public Service, and I believe that the present third member is a member of the Public Service. Tbe Government is apparently not too pleased with the membership or competence of tbe board, because it now desires to add two members to the original three members while the board is inquiring into the important matter of the allocation of television licences. We do not know who the two new members will be. Will they be persons wbo have some competence in tbe science of television or radio telegraphy? Are they to be required to know anything about those subjects, or will they be people who have been faithful servants of the Liberal party? I raise that point because tbe Postmaster-General who is ill-and I greatly regret that illness-remove d several members from another board and placed members of the Liberal party in their places. He found a place for Dame Enid Lyons at the expense of a woman Labour appointee. Sir PHILIPMOBEIDE very good appointment, too. jection of the Minister for Defence( Sir Philip McBride), it seems that the Government has a few more suitable appointees in view. If so, tbey will be appointed to ensure that television licences when granted will go to good supporters of the Government. The policy of the Labour party provides for the nationalization of radio services, and although it is too late to do anything about commercial broadcasting stations which aire operating on the medium wave band, we can at least prevent television from becoming a menace in the home if the motive force in obtaining television licences is to make a profit and is not to provide information or decent entertainment for the cultural advancement of tbe people. If honourable members on the Government side want to know more about this matter, they should read Lord Reith's recent book on the subject, in wbich they will find what members of the present Government said about broadcasting in earlier days. The name of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) is also mentioned. However, I do not propose to read from that book at present. All I want to say is that there is much opinion in this country to support the view that we should not worry about television when we have much more to do to make Australia safe. If we are to be attacked in a few years, we should not be diverting labour and materials to provide television services for a couple of capital cities. TJnder this measure the board will be charged with the duty of bearing evidence about licences to be granted in Sydney and Melbourne. Now. Australians are a small people occupying a vast space. America is wealthy, and Great Britain is relatively wealthy. Let tbose countries conduct experiments on ( Mr Anthony), television, and we can enter the field later and obtain, through the results of their research, the latest methods of telecasting-as the term is-instea d of making the mistake of adopting a particular system and having to scrap it later. I cannot understand the insensate That was a haste of the Government to get commercial television established.

ADERMANN -The people will have to pay for television wherever the stations may be established. the Chifley Government intended to conduct its particular experiments only to a certain stage, and at a later time it was to be decided what we should do about the whole matter of television. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board, which is to be the inquiry authority in the terms of the recommendations of a royal commission, only yesterday recommended that we should have frequency modulation broadcasting in this country. Apparently we shall soon reach a stage here when we shall be loaded down with all sorts of luxuries that we shall not be able to afford if Australia's position is as allowed to happen in this country. Teledangerous as we believe it to be. One thing that the press interests will not want is facsimile broadcasting, wbich is a method by which newspapers can be transmitted to people's homes over the radio in the same way as television programmes. I have an unhappy feeling Sir PHIL IP McBRIDE -S o you should. unhappy feeling when a wealthy man like tbe Minister for Defence is in charge of this move to give benefits to bis friends. I have an unhappy feeling about an article that I read in a newspaper recently in which it was stated that a combine in Sydney representing the Sydney Morning Herald, the Macquarie broadcasting network and other interests, was applying for a television licence. I do not believe that it is a good thing for the community to have monopolies of any sort in this country, and if we are to allow a big group of radio stations and metropolitan newspapers to have a television licence we shall be adversely serving the public interest. If we are to have television licences operated on a commercial basis I should like to see the Government make provision in this legislation for universities, schools, churches and all those authorities that cater for tbe intellectual and spiritual life of the community to be given an important interest chance. in tbe licences-if necessary completely free-in order that tbey may counterBritish Labour party has a better chance balance the grossly materialistic elements of winning the next British general and interests that will become associated witb television for the purposes of exploiting some of the worse things that happen in human life.

I do not know which newspaper the Minister referred to.

The Columbia network in America obtained permission a few years ago from the Federal Communications Commission to operate colour television, -but that permission was subsequently withdrawn. There are experiments with colour television going on all the time, and if we want it here-and it is better than black and white television-le t us wait until the experimental stage in the United States has been passed. But there are unseen forces operating behind this Government, and pushing it into television. I do not believe that it will be in tbe public interest any more than I believe tbe British experiment will be in the public interest. The British Labour party has stated that when it is returned to office it will repeal the relevant British commercial television legislation, and the chances are that that party will win the next British election.

I suggest that this Government should not take a step wbich will make it difficult for subsequent governments to annul if they find it in the national interest to do so, to alter or scrap whatever may be done, and to start all over again. Television will not be a money spinner in this country. The experimental stage will be costly, and I believe that a number of private interests will come to tbe Government after a wliile and ask for subsidies on the ground that they are performing some great public service. Of course I do not believe that they will be performing such a service, because television would not be operating in country districts; it will be confined to the cities. This Parliament should not pander to those who are fortunate the 800 square miles of Australia which is occupied by more than 4,000,000 people. live in that area are not the only good Australians, and it is far better that we sbould basten slowly on this matter and try to do more important things first. We have not been badly served without television, and I am not sure that we shall be well served witb it. But I am concerned that television should not., fall into the hands of those who are more concerned with making profits for themselves and those behind them, than in teaching the children of Australia more about tbeir country, and the people of Australia bow to enjoy a better and fuller life.

Therefore, while allowing this legislation to go through, we register our protest and give no. assurance about our future attitude towards any licences that may be granted by the board, three members of wbich we know and two prospective members of which we do not know. The Government itself will probably remain ignorant about tbe identity of tbose prospective members until somebody comes to a Cabinet meeting and says, "" These two people are highly recommended by the Melbourne Club, or tbe Union Club, or the Sydney Morning Herald, or the Daily Telegraph, or tbe Melbourne Herald. They will be useful and acceptable to us, so put tbem on the board. They will do what our friends want, and we shall get all the support we want on the radio, by television and in the newspapers in the next general election "". I oppose this bill. I protest also at its introduction so late in tbe session, and The people who at such a late hour. I believe that the Government bas bad plenty of time in the last few months to bring in this legislation. The bill seeks to increase the membership of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board from three to five by the appointment of two part-time members. The Minister for Defence( Sir Philip McBride), who is in charge of the bill, has not given a reasonable explanation of tbe need for the proposed increase of membership. I recall'that when the original board was 'appointed, members of the Liberal party, and tbe Australian Country party occupied the Opposition benches in this chamber, and they protested strongly against the proposal to appoint a board of three to control the members claimed at that time that a board of that kind was quite unnecessary, that the Labour Government was overMelloading tbe broadcasting system with boards, and that more people than necessary were controlling broadcasts. They also objected to tbe existence of the Parliamentary Broadcasting Committee. When the wheel of fortune turned and the Liberal party and the Australian Country party became the government, the Postmaster-General( Mr Anthony)",80,Philip Mcbride

186,Mr Bryson,"The honourable memhave found that the Government has beenI asked a question in trie House on Wednesday afternoon, and, in faet, I asked a similar question some time ago, about tbe provision of telephone services in tbe metropolitan area of Melbourne. What applies to the metropolitan area of Melbourne applies also to other capital cities and, possibly to every town throughout Australia. I have been informed by the Minister representing the Postmaster General that more applications for telephone services are being received than the department is able to handle, and that the waiting list is growing every week. In the metropolitan area of Melbourne alone more than 15,000 people are waiting for telephone services, and I have been informed by tbe Minister that one of the reasons why the lag cannot be overtaken is tbe shortage of skilled technicians. Tbe work on the installation of new telephone exchanges and telephone services in general is highly skilled. The erection of television stations is technical work of a somewhat similar kind, and a technician who can do television work can also do work on telephone services. If six television stations are to be built, the demand for technical workers will be very great, and the provision of essential telephone services will be further delayed. We cannot have everything. When we are in that position, it is only sensible to decide to bave essential things first, and allow the luxuries to wait. Television in Australia is definitely a luxury. It is an expensive luxury for a small section of the community. So far, I have only referred to the provision of television stations. The next matter is the provision of television sets. We are told by tbe people who are eager to manufacture television sets that the cheapest sets will cost at least £140, and that a good set will cost about £200. So television at tbe present time is an expensive luxury wbich tbe majority of the Australian people cannot afford. vision sets. men will be on the doorsteps, and unthinking people will buy the sets, as they have bought expensive luxuries over the years, and got themselves into trouble in doing so. The introduction of television to Australia at the present time is too expensive a luxury for the whole community. We cannot afford a luxury of that kind when we are short of essential services of a somewhat similar nature. Television is still in the experimental stages. Tbe Government has not told us whether Australia is to have the English system or the American system of television. Colour television, which is more expensive than black and white, is in operation to a limited degree in the United States of America. I suggest, as the honourable meinber for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) has suggested, that it is a very good idea from our point of view to allow other people to continue with experiments until such time as they have this system perfected. When that day comes, Australia may be able to afford television. I know that advertising agents are clamouring for the introduction of television, and are endeavouring to form public opinion in favour of it, but as I see the position, the only people who are eager for the introduction of television in Australia in the immediate future are those who think that they can make a profit out of it. Combines are clamouring to obtain commercial television licences, and advertising agents are looking for a new field of business. Certain manufacturers see the possibility of making great profits from tbe sale of television sets, because some broadcasting receiving sets are lasting longer than the manufacturers bad. anticipated, and tbeir sales are not so big as they would wish. Those manufacturers tbink that they will have a ready market for television sets, and make big profits. I am not interested in the desire of profit-making organizations to exploit the public with the sale of articles that the people can do without. I am definitely opposed to the immediate introduction of television in any form. I believe the Government should proceed very slowly even witb the introduction of government-controlled television stations; but I am convinced that it is essential that commercial interests be kept entirely out of the television field. We have had sufficient experience of commercial broadcasting to be fully aware of the whole position.",82,Philip Mcbride

We bave been obliged to surfer tbem for many years, and I do not wisb to see a similar state of affairs exist when television is introduced. Commercial interests sbould be kept entirely out of the field when television is introduced. honourable member think about colour television ? to experiment with colour television. The present intention of tbe Government is to introduce a black and white system, but, by the time it is introduced, the colour system probably will bave been perfected. The black and white system will then be out of date. Australia is able to do without television at the present time, and I suggest that it should continue to do without it. While we are doing without it, we can definitely do without additional members on the broadcasting control board. It is my belief that two part-time members would not take any weight of work off the shoulders of the existing members, but that they would add to tbeir difficulties, their troubles, and their work. I suggest that the bill should be withdrawn. It is one that we do not need. It has been introduced too late in tbe session. It should never have been introduced. I definitely oppose it.

I should like to offer to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), to all other members of the Opposition, and to all other honorperhaps a little earlier than is usual for it able members my warm good wishes for a merry Christmas and a happy New Year. As I have had occasion to remark before to-day, many people perhaps have a false idea of the happenings in the Parliament. I have heard it said that members of the Parliament should be paid for their work at so much for each day of sitting. That is all nonsense, because the work of the Parliament has become infinitely more rigorous and continuous than it was when I first entered this House. I have no doubt that bonorable members on both sides of the House devote their talents and energy unremittingly to the interests of their electors, as they respectively see them. I should fail in my duty if I did not offer Christmas greetings to the whips, who, at all times, are whips and occasionally, no doubt, scorpions. I should like to offer our thanks and good wishes to the Clerk of the House and his assistants, and to the gentlemen of Hansard, who are at present under the threat of having to publish tbe reports of our speeches within a day instead of after the lapse of a fortnight, and who, at all times, do us perhaps rather more than justice. special message for the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) ? that question. I should like to offer our thanks and good wishes to the officers of the Library, to the attendants of the House, to the refreshment-room staffs and to all those who cater for our requirements and attend to our needs as we discharge our duties. I am not at all sureI have been reminded of it by some onethat, if it is not a breach of the Standing Orders to do so, I should not offer our goodwill to our elder brethren in another place, because, by some remarkable dispensation of providence, tbey have, during the current Parliament, found it with the Government. Therefore, I know that my friend the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard) will agree with me that we are greatly indebted to them. We go into recess on this occasion is now only the middle of November. We shall, nevertheless, look forward to tbe work of the Parliament in a new year. We have had many exciting battles. We have had many differences of opinion. There have even been times, Mr Speaker, believe it or not, when some members of the House did not agree with your rulings. what fewer than half the members of tbe House have found it possible to disagree most heartily with anything that I might say. But I always like to feel, and I say this after 26 years' experience of parliamentary life, that though we carry our differences with us, because we believe in tbem, we are able to go to the end of the year feeling that there is in this House a great deal, of goodwill and mutual respect. We may, therefore, all wish to one another a merry Christmas and the happiest of good new years. On behalf of the Opposition, in the unavoidable absence of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Calwell), I take this opportunity to thank you, Mr Speaker, the Chairman of Committees and the Temporary Chairmen for the service that has been rendered to us all, and to extend to you and to tbem, Christmas greetings and best wishes for a very happy recess.

222,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [3.19 A.m.],"every member of tbe otber staffs of Parliament liouse. Tbe Prime Minister bas spoken of tbe arduous session that we bave experienced and of the hard work which is the lot of members of this Parliament. It is true that the Ministers and the officers of the Opposition work strenuously with the usual expressions of appreciation indeed, but, in my opinion, tbe work of the average member of this Parliament is not comparable, when one takes differences of remuneration into consideration, with the work of the staffs of the Parliathe expressions of the Prime Minister, ment, whether they work in this chamber, in the kitchen, or elsewhere in the buildtbis chamber. I say, with all sincerity, ing. The Prime Minister has said that this bas been a memorable session. That is true. There bave been some cheerful occasions, and there have also been incidents which have incurred my resentment, which still smoulders. One thing for which these sittings has been memorable more than for anything else has been tbe indecent haste with which members bave hurried into recess. It has also been particularly memorable for the disgracef u l application of the gag by the Governwhat I describe as a very human underment. I daresay, if tbe records were examined, it would be found that an alltime record bad been set for this procedure. Those remarks, uttered in all seriousness, do not detract from the sincerity with which the Opposition wishes everybody-Governmen t members and others alikea very happy recess. I hope that tbe comments I have made on the subject of the curtailment of the right of members to speak in this place will have some impact on the Government in our sittings in the new year. I find myself this morning in the very privileged position of representing the Australian Country party in associating its members with the remarks which have been made by tbe Prime Minister( Mr members by the Hansard staff. As was Menzies) and by the bonorable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), who spoke on behalf of the Opposition, in expressing appreciation and Christmas wishes to all tbose wbo have.been concerned with the work of the Parliament during the sittings that are about to conclude. It is well known that the privilege has fallen to my lot because our leader, tbe Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Eadden), and our deputy leader, the Minister for Commerce and on urgent national business. Both right honourable gentlemen, realizing that they would be absent on this occasion, bave asked that they be particularly associated and goodwill wbich are offered at this time of the year. I ask you, Mr Speaker, to accept on bebalf of the members of the Australian Country party, in support of our great appreciation of your work in that we have a great admiration for the way in which you have treated us during these sittings. We know that you bring to your task a very wide knowledge of the Standing Orders and of the traditions which guide the deliberations, not only of this Parliament, but also of the Mother of Parliaments. We know also that you have brought to your task an obvious impartiality in dealing witb the many problems that confront you. A t the same time you have shown on many occasions standing of the frailties that all of us exhibit from time to time. We appreciate that, and this is the time when we express that appreciation. That expression of appreciation is offered not just to you yourself, but also to tbose associated with you in your office, that is to say, the Chairman of Committees and tbe deputies who assist you from time to time. We convey also our appreciation to the Clerk of the House and his assistants. We have good cause to know at times exactly -how valuable is tbe advice they offer to us from their deep knowledge of tbe procedures of tbe House. We have a great appreciation of the services rendered to all honourable stated a few minutes ago, we deliberated within the last few weeks on the possibility of some improvement in the reporting of the proceedings of' the House, but it is well realized by all honourable members that those deliberations did not in any way constitute any criticism of tbe actual work of the Hansard reporters.

We press a button in front of us and we get quiet but effective service. To the attendants also we offer our thanks. The Prime Minister referred to the whips. As I am a whip, it may be felt that it would not be fitting for me to make any reference to them, but I think I should say on this occasion that I bave found there is a collaboration between the whips in this House to which I ought to pay tribute. We bave worked together as a team and have done our best to assist in the proper conduct of the Drummond. D. H. work of the House. I take this opportunity to thank the other whips for the work they have done. That remark applies, not only to the Government whip, but also to my colleague on the other side of the House, with whom I have bad much association and whose decency and straightforwardness I appreciate very much. I know that that feeling is shared by the Government whip. Finally, on behalf of the Australian Oountry party, I say that, at the end of the first sessional period after tbe last general election, a period in which affirmative. every promise made during the election campaign has-been honoured, we of the Australian Country party reiterate our allegiance to the Prime Minister, in whose sented :leadership we have the most complete confidence and whom we shall continue to support, as we have done in the past. I join with my colleague, the honourable member for Lalor( Mr Pollard), in expressing sincere thanks to all employees of the Parliament who have assisted it to function smoothly.

226,Mr Menzies,"On the 26th October,is meeting in Canberra, that he always wel-comed discussion with the federal executive of that organization in relation to matters which affected their membership, and that he has extreme confidence in every one of their federal -officials. If that is so, has his attention been -drawn to the resolution that was carried by the Federal Congress yesterday, which seeks clarification of section 47 of the Repatriation Aut, allegedly because tlic Repatriation Commission has failed to carry out tlie expressed intention of the act? If so, will the right honourable gentleman give consideration to the setting up of an all-party parliamentary committee to examine the Repatriation Act and, in particular, decisions that have been made by the Repatriation Commission in relation to section 47, and thereby show in a practical way that hc is really sympathetic with the problems of the members of the Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia? The honourable member w ill recall that the setting up of just such a committee as he now advocates was debated in this House during the passage of the Repatriation B ill last month. Indeed, the honourable member participated in the debate. I have nothing to add to the reasons which were then given why the Government is not prepared to accept the suggestion. the bonorable member for Shortland ( Mr Griffiths) asked the following question:Can the Prime Minister inform me whether Australian citizens when visiting the United Kingdom for the purpose of extending their education, industrial or otherwise, are liable for military service after twelve months' residence in the United Kingdom? In such circumstances can Australians be compelled to join the Army in England for a term of two years? If so, does this mean that such persons are unable to return to Australia until after their period of service has expired? If these are facts, are Australian citizens made aware of them prior to leaving this country for England? The United Kingdom National Service Act 1948 provides in Part 1, section 1 (1) that "". . . every male British subject ordinarily resident in GreatB r it a in who has attained tbe age of eighteen years and has not attained the age of twenty-six years . . . shall be liable to be called upon to serve in the armed forces of the Crown. . ."". In regard to the phrase "" ordinarily resident"" section 34! (4) of the same act provides as follows:For the purposes of this part of this Act, a person who is resident in Great Britain shall be deemed to be ordinarily resident there unless(a) Ee is residing there only for the purposes of attending a course of education; or (6) The circumstances of his residence in Great Britain are otherwise such as to show that he is residing there for a temporary purpose only; or (e) Being a person who is, under the provisions of any Act in force in any part of His Majesty's dominions outside Great Britain, a national or citizen of that part within the meaning of that Act, or a person who was born or is domiciled in any such part of His Majesty's dominions or in a British Protectorate, a Mandated Territory, a Trust Territory or any other country or territory being a country or ' territory under His Majesty's protection or suzerainty, he has been resident in Great Britain for less than two years. Australian visitors to the United Kingdom for the purposes referred to by the honourable member would not therefore be liable for military service under the United Kingdom National Service Act.

Have Poulton's solicitors indicated whether or not they intend to appeal to the Privy Council? 3. Have the Commonwealth's costs in the High Court ibeen taxed? 4. Will the Attorney-General examine the possibility of coming to an arrangement with the firm of Wilcox Mofflin Limited, in Western Australia, which has contracted in any event to pay the money to the wool-growers concerned, so as to avoid any further delay in payment of their money? honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. Despite our best efforts the matter has not advanced far since the High Court gave its decision in the Poulton case on the 16th December last. Future action depends upon the decision of the plaintiff whether to appeal to the Privy Council. It appears that the plaintiff has still not decided whether to seek leave to appeal, and Privy Council rules do not fix any time limits. Until the matter is disposed of, the Government cannot safely make a final distribution of wool profits, and we are therefore unable to say",89,Eepatriation

I shall be happy to see that the honourable member gets a copy of this reply. A ir, u p o n notice1. Isi t a fact that some life assurance companies do not accept any responsibility under life policies held by members of the Royal Australian A i r Force in the event of their deatli in an air crash, although the policies were taken out before they joined up? 2. If so, is there any procedure by which tlic Minister, or his department, or the Commonwealth Insurance Commissioner, could protect the interests of dependants in such cases? 3. Isi t a fact that in the United States"" f America all servicemen are insured by the Government itself? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Policies issued by most life insurance companies in Australia before 1051, either do not contain a clause restricting benefits on death whilst flying with the Royal Australian Air Force or carrying a clause which has, in most instances, been waived. Since 105.1 most of the larger companies have inserted an air risk clause only if the applicant for insurance stated in his proposal that he intended to engage in service flying. Other companies, however, have inserted this clause in all policies. In all coses the insured can obtain f u l l cover by payment of an extra premium. 2. There is no provision in the Life Insurance Act to compel an insurance company-(a ) to issue a policy to a particular individual, or (b) to vary tlie terms of a policy which is otherwise in compliance with thc act. 3. I am advised that since 1950, United States servicemen are insured to a maximum sum of 10,000 dollars free of cost to the servicemen. This is distinct from private insurance policies taken out by thc individuals themselves. I am informed that these policies contain aviation risk clauses and f u l l insurance cover can be obtained only by the payment of additional premiums by the servicemen themselves. representing the Minister acting for tbe Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, upon noticeWhat was thc tonnage of flour shipped from the States of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, respectively on Australian Wheat Board orders during the period the 1st September, .1953, to the 31st August, 1954? answer has been supplied by the Minister:For the period from the 30th August, 1953, to the 28th August, 1954, flour exports from State.

Doctors, like other members of the community, have increased their fees to meet the altered economic conditions. tions in fees are made by the local associations which form part of the British Medical Association. The Commonwealth Parliament has no constitutional power to fix medical fees. 2. Medical charges throughout Australia have always varied in different districts. The customary charges throughout Australia are 15s. per consultation at the surgery and £1 ls. for a visit at the home. In several areas the fee at the surgery is 17s. 6d. Members of the British Medical Association attend pensioners at concessional fees under tlie pensioner medical service. 3. In the opinion of the medical profession, the increase in consultation fees, which were mostly made before the introduction of the Commonwealth medical benefits scheme, are fully justified. 4. See the answer to question 3. Mr ""WIGHT asked the Minister for Labour notice1. Is action contemplated to improve the numerical strength of the labour force engaged in the building industry, especially, in regard to that section engaged in the production of material for building? 2. Does the immigration policy being pursued take f u l l cognizance of the shortage of labour in the building industry? able member's questions are as follows:1. Whilei t is difficult to assess precisely the including the timber industry, tha clay prodimensions of the labour force engaged in the building industry, the Commonwealth Statistician's latest quarterly survey of building activity showed that at the end of June, 1954, the 107,795 persons engaged on the construction of new buildings represented an increase of some 0,500 during the previous six montlis. Precise information concerning the number of Department of Labour and National Service, that over the nine months ended September, Commonwealth Employment Service, will continue to do everything possible to assist these member's questions are as 2. In planning the immigration programme for the current financial year, the Government has given special consideration to the labour needs of the building and allied industries and, under the various Commonwealth assisted These alterapassage migration schemes, substantial provision has been made for the recruitment of workers for these industries. All categories of workers have been provided for-skilled , semi-skilled and unskilled. senting the Minister for National Development, upon notice1. What positive steps have been taken by this Government to encourage or promote an increase in the production of building materials ? 2. What -increase in the production of the basic materials required for the construction of residential type buildings has occurred during the terms of office of this Government? 3. What are the materials which are principally causing delay in the construction of residential buildings to-day? able member's questions are as f o l l o w s : 1. The two major problems which beset the building materials industries when this Government came to power were a shortage of black coal and a shortage of labour. The production of black coal has been lifted from 14,900,000 tons in 1948-49 to 19,400,000 tons in 1953-54 and supplies are now adequate. Although there are still labour shortages the Government's migration policy has contributed more than 300,000 workers to tlie Australian work force since 1949. Migrant labour has been made available to essential industries ducts industry and the cement industry.

Have tests recently been carried out at Iron Range, Cape York Peninsula, to establish the potential of iron ore deposits in this area? 2. If so, did the tests indicate the existence of deposits of size sufficient for continued mining? 3. Was evidence found to warrant further testing in the area? able member's questions are as follows:1. Officers of the Department of Mines, Queensland, investigated the deposits l a t e ' in 1953. 2 and 3. Although conditions for surface observations are not ideal, this work has shown with reasonable certainty Uiat the deposits consist of discontinuous and collectively too small to justify development. Silica-an undesirable impurity in iron ore-is present in the form of quartz veins and as a constituent of bands of micaceous hematite and "" slate"", resulting in an excessively high average silica content estimated to be of the order of 25 to 30 per cent, in the "" iron slates"" as broken. It is considered that the silica content could be reduced by any simple method of More detailed information deposits may be found in the report on the investigation which was published in the July, 1954 issue of the Queensland Afining Journal. the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) asked the following question :Has the Prime Minister any knowledge of an Corrugated. organization operating in Australia known as the American Investigation Agency, which has its head office in the United States of America?

W ill the Prime Flat, organization, and also furnish information in what the honourable member described as the organization known as the "" American Investigation Agency"".

When interviewed this young man stated that he has no office in the United States and has no official recognition by the United States Government, nor has he had made available to him any facilities by the Commonwealth Government. He went on to say that in the whole of its two and a half years of existence the agency had done only two small private assignments, both for an American organization describing itself as the "" Master Detectives International Service Organization ""-whic h incidentally charged him 10 dollars as a joining bodies, individually fee-eac h being an attempt to locate a missing person.
