We will have a better underthe Canberra Times of yesterday. There are standing of how those breaches have octwo items which honourable members ought curred and what excuses are being mounted to look at. One is an article by Dr Keating, in relation to the issue. It goes to the very the head of the Department of Finance. The point that I am raising. If we are serious heading reads, 'Purpose rather than procabout public accountability, those who are ess-now the bureaucratic creed'. He talks at the pinnacle have a responsibility to enabout the new management style that we are sure that that accountability is given to the getting in the Public Service. We have heard Parliament. We, as parliamentarians, are ena great deal about letting the managers mantitled to know whether there is real accountage. He makes these statements about public ability. I should not have to ferret around at accountability: public hearings to find out what is intended Much greater emphasis is being given to improving by a clause in a Bill. It should not be a program performance and effectiveness. Public acmatter of somebody having to raise an issue countability is being enhanced through the upgrading because it was not mentioned in the Minisof departments' annual reports and explanatory notes ter's second reading speech.
