Whitelaw, Of Tas","manio, with reference to the recent election of a member to serve in this House for the electorate of Tasmania, which I believe was., sent to you, Mr Speaker. The petitioner, a candidate, claims that Mr Hartnoll,. who was returned, was not eligible for election, because, under the Tasmanian Electoral Act of 1896 it is provided that there shall be written at the foot of thenomination-paper a statement under thehand of the person nominated declaring his consent to become a candidate, and that:, the consent of Mr Hartnoll was not so given in writing. He prays that it may therefore be determined that Mr Hartnoll was not duly elected and returned, and that he may be returned, and may have such further or other redress as the circumstances may warrant. I move That the petition be received, and be referred at once to the Committee of Elections and Qualifications for inquiry and report. posit been made by Mr Whitelaw? a deposit has been lodged with the Supreme Court of Tasmania, but none has been received by the officers of this House.

6,Mr Barton,"I wish to explain thatclunks that I am the person who ought to present the petition. I take it that the question whether the lodging of a deposit with the Supreme Court of Tasmania is sufficient is one to be determined by the Committee of Elections and Qualifications. blind to the fact that, even supposing the objection taken by Mr ""Whitelaw be avalid one-and I am not sufficiently versed in the electoral law of Tasmania to say whetheii t is or is not .accordance with the proprieties, or permitted by the standing orders, that an honourable member should proceed to discuss a question which it is proposed to refer to a committee of this House which is in the nature of a legal tribunal, and is supposed to determine the matter in dispute according to the justice of the case? ber is entitled to speak upon the motion before the House; but I trust that the practice which will be adopted is that such questions as this will be referred to the Committee of Elections and Qualifications .as a matter of form, and that honourable members will wait until the committee brings up its report before raising any discussion upon them. be shown that there is some very solid reason for lodging a petition, I do not think the House should receive it. The matter is -entirely within the control of the HouseI f I entertained any portion of the doubt The objection taken to the return of Mr which apparently influences the mind of Hartnoll appears to be that his signature was not attached to a certain document, and it appears to mo that it is for this House to say whether a quibble of that sort should be allowed to defeat the expressed will of the people of Tasmania as shown by the returns of the voting at the recent election. I should hold that view even if the honourable member who has beeu returned belonged to the party which sits on the other side of tlie Chamber. Therefore, I should like to see the petition referred to the committee, with a direction which would prevent the time of the members of the committee from being wasted over a purely' technical difficulty. If the petition be referred to the committee without any direction from the House, it may happen, if the members present are persons of an extremely technical cast of mind, that they will be inclined to come to a determination which will defeat the desires of the people of Tasmania. My reading, of tbe law is that in a matter of this kind it should be interpreted so as to carry out the will of the people as declared as nearly as possible, and one of the dangers which must be guarded against is that of overlooking the spirit of tlie law, and being entirely guided by its letter. However, as honourable members seem to think that the matter will be safe in the hands of the committee, perhaps it will be as well to wait uutil its report is received before dealing with it further. I I rise to order. Tsi t in trust, however, that all speed will be taken by the committee in coming to a conclusion, because I hold thut the moment a member's seat is challenged the objection should be investigated as speedily as possible, and I think honourable members have sufficient of the judicial temperament to agree with me in that. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I wish to An y hononable memask the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward .Braddon, if, after the strong statements which he made against Mr AVhitelaw during the recent election campaign, he intends to sit as a member of the Elections and Qualifications Committee upon this cose? ber cannot, at this stage, formally ask such a question j but if the right honourable member for Tasmania chooses to reply to the question, as part of the discussion, he can do so. the honourable member for Kennedy as to my qualification to sit upon this case, and to deal honestly with the petition which it is proposed to refer to the Committee of Elections and Qualifications, I should im-. mediately request that I might be relieved of the responsibility of my position as a member .of the committee; but I am perfectly satisfied that my mind will not be in the slightest degree biased by anything that has gone before or' any party interest that I may take in the result. member say that, after having said that he would sooner see the man hanged than a member of this House? that any pro-Boer is more eligible justice because he holds opinions of that sort?",14,Election Petitio N

Last week I again It was promised most urged the department to procure the information for me, because I wished to include it in the papers to be laid before the Senate when they are dealing with the Tariff.

The information can be furnished only by questhe Customs department, and I am afraid that the staff in Western Australia is not too large, and that it is probably not accustomed to doing this class of work. They have so far given me the totals only; but I hope they will soon be able to furnish the details.

Whether the latter is aware that, prior to tlie taking of the Federal Referendum poll in AVestern Australia, the present Deputy Postmaster-General at Perth conveyed by telegram to officers on the gold-fields his opinion that their positions in the service would not be improved by Western Australia entering the Federation ? 2. Whether the Minister will obtain a copy of this message, and lay the same upon the table of the House1 honourable member's questions are as follow :1 Tlie Postmaster-General is not aware of the action referred to. 2. He does not think it desirable to obtain and lay upon the table of the House copies of messages that may have been sent by tlie Deputy Postmaster-General at Perth prior to the transfer of the Post and Telegraph department to the Commonwealth. Sir EDWARD Attorney-General, upon noticeWhether, having regard to section 87 of the Constitution, it is permissible to the Commonwealth Government to deduct from duties of Customs and Excise levied in or on behalf of any State any portion of the rebate which has to be returned to manufacturers of sugar by white labour ? vided in the Excise Bill, it is permissible. Debate resumed from ISth April (vide That the Bill be now read a second time. I have no intention of following the right honourable the leader of the Opposition in his elaborate discourse upon the work we have done in Committee of Ways and Means, or upon the principles of Tariffframing. I think there is a general feeling throughout the House that we ought to have an armistice, and, therefore, the speech of the right honourable gentleman might have been a little less aggressive. It might also have been expected to reveal more indications of a modification of view in consequence of recent trade developments andchange of policy, even in England. I wish to particularly refer to a matter which has not been touched upon by the leader of the upon Opposition. Clause4 of the Bill prescribes that the time for the imposition of uniform duties of Customs is the 8th day of October, 1902. I adhere to the view I expressed during the discussion upon the CustomsB ill that this attempt to anticipate the moment of imposition of uniform du'sies will be utterly , futile for the purposes of the Constitution. There is a crucial moment which the Constitution contemplates, namely, the moment of the imposition of uniform duties. That moment will not be reached until this B ill becomes law, and I fear that nothing that which we can do in any Bil l under the Constitution can make that moment anterior to the actual time of the Governor General's signature. I was one of those who warned the Government of this difficulty when the Customs Bill was under discussion. I should not like it to be said that this measure passed through this Chamber without some one dissenting from the mode adopted by culty presented. I admit that it is a grave difficulty, but, in my judgment, the Ministry have not been successful in meeting it . I wish also to refer to clause 7. I was astonished to find in this Bill a provision which is aimed at trusts or ""combines,"" as they are called in America. AlthoughI quite I think that, as proappreciate tbe view which the Minister for Trade and Customs has adopted, I entertain grave doubts whether under section 55 of the' Constitution that provision will be of the slightest use. Section 55 says that any law which imposes Customs taxation shall deal with the imposition of customs duties only. Therefore, any measure dealing with other matters would be inoperative. I do not speak of this clause, however, with the same confidence that I speak of clause 4. I seriously question whether it is competent for us to include a provision of this kind in a Customs Bill. separate measure. in a separate measure. Assuming, however, that it is valid it will not be effective in its operation. The Minister for Trade and Customs in this Bill professes to deal with combinations of importers or of manufacturers.

I fail to see, therefore, what hold the Government will have over .the importers. To say the very least, there is as much likelihood of combination on the part of importers as there is on the part of manufacturers. Honourable members who know tlie history of the reaper and binder will realize this. It has often struck me that there is no country in the world where conditions are more favorable to the establishment of combinations amongst importers than they are within the Commonwealth, seeing .that we possess such a h uge territory and so smallapopulation. Minister for Trade and Customs), In reply A few importers by combining would be able to rule the market, and to dictate terms in regard to any commodity. It would be well if clause 7 were embodied in a separate Bill, and I do not think that clause 4 has solved the difficulty of determining the period of the imposition of uniform duties. worth) -In view of tlie state of public business, and of thenecessity which exists for closing this session, the length of which has already exceeded the expectations of all who contested federal honours, I think it is desirable that the debate upon the Tariff should terminate. There were many things which I wished to say, but in view of the circumstances surrounding the position I intend to forego my opportunity for so doing. I believe there are others who intend to take a similar course, but I want the Ministry to clearly understand that we do so with the object of facilitating the transaction of public business, and because it is strongly felt by honourable members upon this side of the House that the tour of inspection of possible sites for the federal capital should be undertaken without any further delay. reasons which actuate the acting leader of the Opposition, the section of this House to which I belong intend foregoing their right to speak upon this occasion. Another opportunity may possibly be afforded us at a later stage of bringing forward arguments with even more force than they could be presented now. A t present there is a desire amongst-the labour section of the House to conclude the Tariff debate as early as possible, and to proceed with other work. bane) I wish to place upon record my appreciation of the remarks which have fallen from the acting leader of the Opposition, in regard to the desirability of bringing this session to .a close. More than twelve months have elapsed since I left my home to attend to my parliamentary duties in this city. That fact sufficiently indicates to honourable members my feelings in regard to this matter. As the honourable member for Wentworth has said, there are very few candidates indeed who. when they entered upon the federal campaign, ever dreamed that the session would exceed four or five months. I should like in tlie first place to acknowledge the courtesy of honourable members in the decision that has been arrived at. It reflects the greatest credit upon their public spirit. I know what a temptation it is to some of us-and I am taking myself as a typical example-to talk, although I confess that in the debate upon the TariffI have not indulged in talking many times when I was provoked to do so, because I felt that the time would be better spent in arriving at a division. Now, however, that the House is in the humour to give practical effect to the sentiment which then animated me, I am only too delighted. I appreciate the remarks which have been made by honourable members, and I think it is very pleasant to reflect at this time that, in spite of all the little worries which we have had in committeeincluding the times, of course, when heat was naturally imported into the debatesthere should be such a general feeling of goodwill animating honourable members. The Government reciprocate the feelings of honourable members opposite, and desire to speedily send this B ill to another Chamber, hoping to receive it back at as early a date as is compatible with its proper consideration. I trust that when it is placed upon the statute-took it will reflect credit upon all sections of both Houses. After the example which has been set to-day I do not know that I should have troubled to speak, but the remarks of the leader of the Opposition were such that it would be hardly complimentary for me to pass them by unnoticed. As I have a few observations to make in reply to them, I am sorry that tlie right honourable gentleman is not in the chamber, because, in his absence, one is naturally impelled to refrain from saying what perhaps.",18,Braddon Asked The The Government For Overcoming The Diffi

53,Mr Kingston (South Australia,"would be justified were he present. I take exception to the criticisms in which he indulged regarding the conduct of the Prime Minister, and whicii, I venture to say, were altogether unfair. The right honourable gentleman took it upon himself to complain of the frequent absence of the Prime Minister from this chamber. We all know perfectly well that whenever it has been possible the Prime Minister has been either in this chamber, or available upon tlie premises in case any necessity arose for his immediate presence. I have yet to learn that when two Ministers have charge of a Tariff the presence of a third-wh o is less familiar with its details than are those whose business it has been to make a special study of its minuthe-is absolutely necessary. Surely such a course of action would be absurd. Is a third Minister to sit here asafigure-head to be jibed at ? Certainly not! I venture to think that when two Ministers are in charge of a Tariff, the time of the Prime Minister can be better spent in attending to those matters of pressing public business which occup3' his every moment, so long as he is within call of the House. I trust we shall hear no more of these complaints. There is one thing about which I am very sorry. The leader of the Opposition has too often exhibited a desire to condemn those members of the Government who are representatives of his own State. It would seem that the local jealousies, dislikes, and quarrels of the old State Parliaments are being transferred here. I hoped, however, we had come here animated by a sincere desire to do our best for Australia, and to forget old party quarrels. I had my share of party quarrels and sectional strife in the State from which I come, but I am happy to say that I have buried every fraction of the old ill-will which might temporarily have arisen, and that the representatives of that State, with others, are working single-handed for the benefit of United Australia. I hope we shall not have these statements repeated. The leader of the Opposition talks about peipetual absence, indeed ! If there is one subject upon which he ought to be dumb, it is that. Out of the 164 days which this Parliament has sat, how often has the Prime Minister been absent? I have the figures here. He has been absent for ten days, and we know and regret some of the circumstances which caused his absence. The right honourable member for East Sydney, who censures the Prime Minister for his absence, makes this admissionUnfortunately. I have been compelled to be absent on more than one occasion. Now what are his figures ? I am sorry that he is not here to-day. I should be able to say a good deal more than I am now saying if he were I regret the cause of his absences. mystery about it . no mystery about it. Professional pursuits are the cause. In matters of this kind we should extend every mutual courtesy. I am well aware that the necessity for attending to professional pursuits imposes' a heavy strain on honourable members like the leader of the Opposition. I sympathize with him. I should like, indeed, if it were possible, that the remuneration which is accorded to the members of this House should be a more fitting recompense-of course I am expressing my private and personal opinion-for the responsibilities which are cast upon them. But when the right honourable member takes it upon himself to accusethe right honourable the Prime Ministeri n the terms he has used, I have a right tocall attention to this fact-that whereas the Prime Minister was absent for only ten days, how often was the leader of the Opposition absent? Eighty-seven days! "" I have unfortunately been compelled to be absent on more than one occasion."" Eighty-seven days; and yet this is the same gentleman who indulges in this criticism and finds fault with the Prime Minister. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN The leader of the Opposition was complaining that the Prime Minister, although in the building, was not in this chamber. ber says the leader of the Opposition finds fault with the Prime Minister because, when he was here, he was not in his place. How many Ministers are required to be actually in the House? One or two. What necessity is there for all to be present ? Does any honourable member feel himself slighted because five-sixths of the Ministry, or a due proportion, are not here now ? Nothing of the sort! We must arrange the public business as best we can.

56,Mr Kingston,"The honourable memhe has come into the House and done what was necessary. So much for that matter. It is the only personal matter to which I am going to refer, and I am sorry that the occasion was given to necessitate the reference. I listened with the greatest care to the figures given by the right honourable the leader of the Opposition, because I have occasion very frequently to scrutinize the working and financial results of our. Tariff. There are few things which are more interesting. favoured us with some particulars upon the subject. this-that faction that those figures are utterly unreliable and untrustworthy. positively shocked, when I came to examine them, to ascertain their Knowing what I did of the facts, I did not hesitate, the moment the right honourable member sat down, to step across to him and mention to him personally, in a friendly way,. that his figures were ail wrong. I knew it. They were so utterly inconsistent with my recollection of what Since FridayI have had an opportunity of looking fully into the matter, and I have been daily expecting some withdrawal by the right honourable member after the words I spoke to him in regard to the figures referred to. I am astonished that he has not yet made one. The figures are of such an extravagant and misleading character, that I do not believe that the right honourable member ever looked through them before using them. He is pressed for time in a variety of ways, and there seems to me but one solution in regard to the figures which he presented for our acceptance: that is, that they were placed in his hands by some one in whom he had greater confidence than, in this particular instance, he ought to have had, and that he accepted them blindly, used them rashly, applied his best intellect-as intellect it is-to the advocacy of the conclusion desired to be drawn, and drew a remarkable picture of the results. picture, so far as the canvas ou which it is painted is concerned, is rotten to the core. I would ask honourable members to apply their common sense to the consideration of these matters. subject with the glamour which was cast around it by the eloquence of the honourable member temporarily dispelled. with such force, such strength, and such Mr Kingston. elegance of diction that one's mind is temporarily withdrawn from the value of the argument in admiration of the attributes with which he presents it for our consideration. In this connection he has presented figures so inaccurate that honourable members, when they come to analyze them, will be startled at their absolute absurdity. Let me take one instance. Mr O'MALLEY I think they were Brother Hirsch's figures ! I want to tell honourable members the main, anyhow. N honourable member's figures ""go bang,"" I have been what becomes of the conclusions which he bases upon'them? He drew attention, true nature. amongst other things, to the fact that the right honourable the Treasurer had shown that the figures with regard to the results for the year were £600,000 in excess of the estimate which he had previously presented. I think £584,000 Was the original sum the right honourable member were the facts. mentioned, but he afterwards said £600,000 roughly. for the twelve months. Opposition said that calculation was based upon the experience of about five months. In making an estimate with the later knowledge possessed by the end of February as compared with the knowledge we possessed when we introduced the Tariff, the Treasurer showed that he would get £600,000 more than had at first been estimated. Let honourable members recollect that that was for the entire year. The Treasurer was making a calculation at that time with the extra knowledge before him, and bringing the calculation up to the end of the year, he calls the excess £600,000. The leader he always does, and a brilliant of the Opposition entirely loses sight of the fact that the calculation is for the end of the year. He adds another £200,000 on That to that sum. He says that the calculation was for nine months, and that therefore you have to add a sum for tlie remaining quarter-£200,000 . He does that simply for the purpose of further shaking I ask them to look at the our calculation. Let honourable members see what the leader of the Opposition saysThis calculation is based upon the experience He speaks of about five months, but the statement of the Treasurer, taken by itself, shows an increase of £5S0,000 over and above his estimates.",20,Braddon Asked The The Government For Overcoming The Diffi

I will read what the right honourable gentleman saidTaking the period of five months from October to February as a basis, the Tariff will probably yield-leavin g out Western Australia£9*271,000. The Treasurer's estimate for a normal year for the same States was £8,230,000; so that upon the basis of the actual facte in an abnormal year The right honourable member was referring to tlie present year as an abnormal one, and of course it is characterized by many features peculiar to itselfwe have an excess of £1,000,000 sterling-if the receipts continue for the full period of twelve months us they have been coming in-ove r the estimated revenue for a normal year. Just think of it! According to the leader of the Opposition, the receipts for this abnormal year will be £9,271,000, of those from Western Australia. honourable members know that that is preposterous 1 State receipts from Western Australia. very statement of the matter would drive honourable members to seek some solution of it . I have been seeking it. The statement staggered.me at the time. I have been poring over it ever since. I cannot get away from it . Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN the Opposition did not exempt the oversea receipts in Western Australia. leader of the Opposition excluded the receipts from that State. I will go a little further in my quotation from the right honourable gentleman's speech, and make the point much clearerThe case of Western Australia is very exceptional, and I have, therefore, eliminated it from the comparison. Let us, however, add the figures for Western Australia. Adopting the same basis of calculation, we find that the receipts in Western Australia will probably amount to £1,250,000, and that the Tariff will yield a total of £10,500,000 in the six States in an abnormal year, instead of £8,940,000 estimated for a normal year. The honourable member for North Sydney will see that the words I have just quoted dissipate the force of the suggestion made by him. The leader of the Opposition rejected not only the Inter-State receipts of Western Australia, but the whole of the receipts from that State. Without a penny being credited in respect of Western Australian receipts, he made the total revenue for the year amount to £9,271,000, and inclusive of the receipts from Western Australia, to £10,500,000. That is preposterous. Any honourable member who looks at it can see that my statement is correct. I am dealing with the matter in all sincerity. I spoke to the leader of the Opposition immediately after he' made these statements, and told him the figures were wrong. I feel sure some one had put into his hand figures which he had not time to investigate, but in the accuracy of which he believed. I know that he would not dream of presenting to the committee figures which he did not believe were warranted, but it was impossible for him to go through them in detail. He accepted that which was unreexclusive liable. He accepted it , not knowingly, but Do not believing it , and that explains what was almost incapable of explanation before in regard to the way in which he has voted in certain directions at different times. He always put revenue first, and, when we find that figures presented by him conscienI knew that the tiously are so far from the fact, although we blamed him before, we sympathize with him now. He has been misled by these figures. If we were receiving revenue to the extent of £10,250,000 per annum out of Australia to-day-bu t we know that we are not doing anything of the The leader of kind-it would constitute a case for the alteration of the Tariffi n many features, in order to relieve the burdens of the people. But when we see that a calculation of that kind is £2,500,000 wrong, we come to a conclusion very different from that which would be forced upon us if the figures were correct. ister still exclude from his calculations nearly £10,000,000 in respect of the imports for 1899 1 . In the first instance the Minister took off £5,000,000, and subsequently made a further reduction. £5,000,000 for the displacement of imports by local manufacturers on a normal year.

Other matters then intervened which do not bear upon the point, but further on I interjectedCan the right honourable gentleman give us a rough idea of the date of that calculation t BecauseI wanted to see if there was something to be considered as regards the heavier duties being on at the time. The right honourable gentleman went on to sayI should like to give the actual date. tion made Y My basis of calculation is this : I take the actual federal receipts for the period from October to February inclusive. That is a period of five months. . . I calculate from the 9th of October to the 28th February. The revenue received in that period is the basis. I apply that basis to the period of twelve months. Applying that basis for five months to the actual receipts for the whole year at the same rate-estimated , of courseI bring out, as I have said, the result that the receipts, exclusive of Western Australia, would be £9,270,000, instead of £8,230,000, on the estimate of the Treasurer for a normal year of £8,942,000. I ask honourable members do they believe that we are going to get £10,500,000 this year ? Sir thing is a misapprehension. gentleman is speaking of the financial year of whicii nine months have run, and the leader of the Opposition was speaking of 1902, of which only three months have run. the leader of the Opposition used. words he used, and they are compatible with that explanation. all. I venture to think that they leave no room for doubt that the leader of the in taking the premises upon which I started. Opposition was speaking of the current year. But, making every merciful allowance in the "" the .current financial year,"" but "" the ment indulged in, there is still such a current year."" the current financial year of which nearly likely to be achieved, so far as we know the ten months have already passed. 1902. language he used leads to a very different conclusion. Do honourable members believe that the results to which the leader of the Opposition refers, even if calculated for the whole of the year 1902, are likely to be achieved ? value of imports has to be considered. I have come to a very different conclusion. As regards a normal year, as honourable members know, in the old time we put it that we should get a revenue of £8,900,000. I put this further, that if honourable members look at the receipts of the first three months of this calendar year they will see that we have got, say, about £2,250,000. Multiply that by four, and what do we get? A revenue of £9,000,000, approximating to that given by the Treasurer under the circumstances to which I refer. I say that for the leader of the Opposition, speaking as he did in connection with the second reading of this Bill, drawing an immediate result, as opposed to a forecast for a long distant future, whether it was for the year ending June 3Cth, or the year ending December 31st, 1902, a forecast of £3,397,000 from New South Wales; an increase of £800,000 in the Victorian revenue for 1900, and £205,000 in the revenue for South Australia for 1900, which was one of her best years, I say turns as these for the purpose of guiding our judgment in connection with a Bill of this description, seems to me to be altogether unwarranted. If his predictions were for the financial year, they were preposterously wrong; and if they were for the calendar I can give the words year, they may be more nearly right; but they are still very far from the mark, and are outside it to an extent which I venture to consider is altogether misleading.

Where is it ? gentleman is getting entirely away from the second reading of. this BillI must ask him to confine his remarks to the question. pleased to bow to your ruling, sir. When honourable members speak of free-trade, I ask them to look round, and see what the world is doing. The whole civilized world is against free-trade. What is the position of the dear old mother country, to whom I wish every success ? There they do not term the recently imposed corn law a duty -the y speak of the charge as a registration fee, but it is really a duty of 5 per cent. Remembering the British objections in the past,to the imposition of duties upon food, I venture to think that the views which were held when Britain went in for complete free-trade have been modified by subsequent events, and that now there is not that determined opposition to protection of the local market which previously was undoubtedly the watchword of the country. Mr Baucis SMITH -The duty to which the right honourable gentleman alludes is a genuine revenue tax. for war purposes. a protective incidence. Perhaps the time may come-and speed the day if it be to the mutual advantage of both !-whe n reciprocal arrangements can be entered into between all parts of tlie Empire, and we can reap the advantages of mutual trade. On the subject of free-trade I ask, what is the position of New South Wales' She has the lowest manufacturing rate of any of the States. If she manufactured goods at the same rate as Victoria, she would produce at least £2,000,000 worth more than she does. She is not to be compared with Victoriai n regard to those industries which making and fashioning of those things which 1 compete against the importing industries. She has a population one-eighth greater than that of A ictoria, and on the basis of popuT lation she ought to 'have an advantage of 12£ per cent. Her territory comprises natural advantages, her coal mines, and the extent of her other resources. Her wealth is God-endowed. We envy her none of her resources, though few countries have been more blessed by Providence. We would, however, wish that they were shared by the other States. We know her temporary difficulties, and we sympathize with them, as we sympathize with the difficulties which equally affect Queensland. We know, how ever, that Queensland has in the past overcome similar troubles, and will in the future overcome the difficulties which now beset her. The sooner she can do so the greater will be the delight of the people of her sister States. Returning to the comparison of New South Wales with Victoria, I say that, while in the industries which, compete with the importing industries, New South Wales should have an advantage of 12^ per cent, as regards the number employed, Victoria has really an advantage of more than 50 per cent. We, on this side, desire to look to the future of the Commonwealth. We have seen the developments which have taken place in other parts of the world. We notice with regret that British trade with Australia is not increasing in the same ratio, or anything like it, as the trade of other countries, and we ask-I s this country to be exposed to the competition of the world ? Are we to be compelled to struggle for our own markets, unaided in the contest, with people who protect their markets, and give no share to us? The right honourable member for East Sydney saysI hope Australia will never sink so low with its labour that it can compete with the .labour of Belgium, Germany, or France. He says that it cannot compete, and never will be able to compete. ' If that be true, without protection Australian manufactures are dead, because the countries to which he refers are great manufacturing countries, and there is hardly an industry in the civilized world which cannot be found there.

We know how bhey have been fostered in other places-and even in the dear old mother country for years-and what the children have learned at the knee of the old mother, they intend to practice by protecting their people as. she has protected hers. Question resolved in bhe affirmative. Bill read a second time. In Committee : Clause 4Tlie time of the imposition of uniform duties of Customs is the Sth day of October, 1901, at four o'clock in the afternoon, reckoned according to the standard time in force in the State of Victoria, and this Act shall be deemed bo have come into operation at that time. the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has already drawn abtention bo bhe doubts which exist in regard to the effect of certain clauses of the Bill in view of the provisions of section 55 of the Constitution Acb. We have already passed clause 2, which incorporabes bhe whole of bhe Cusboms Acb of 1901, which contains many provisions, such as those prohibiting the importation of indecent or blasphemous literature, and others wholly unconnected with bhe imposition of taxation. The clause with which we are now dealing relates to a subject which has engaged the attention of honourable members on more than one occasion. I do not suppose bhab any one is prepared bo say definitely that it is incompetent for this Parliament 1 to date back the imposition of duties for the puipose only of validating their collection, but if the clause is inbended bo fix a date to satisfy the terms of the Constitution I am clear that it is beyond our capacity to do that. The Oonstitution fixes a certain event as the point from which certain consequences should spring, and it is incompetent for this Parliament to say that some other event shall be the event prescribed by the Constitution. Of course, it is for bhe Government to say whether they desire to bake bheir chances wibh bhis clause; bub I feel ib incumbenb upon me to point out that legal members are of opinion that a doubt exists. Minister for Trade and Customs) I think it is a highly convenient thing to declare the date upon which bhe imposition of the duties book place, though, of course, we cannob alber, and we do not attempt to alter, the terms of the Constitution Por our purpose all we do is bo declare our view in regard bo bhe mabber, bhough bhe clause may be of convenience in assisting the courts of law in interpreting the Constibubion. nob be helped by bhis clause in bheir interpretation of the Constitution. thought by both sides thab we should bring bhe Tariff into force immediately, so far as we could, and pub an end bo the imposition qf bhe Inber-Sbabe duties. There might have been any amount of trouble in regard to the collection of bhe Inter-Sbabe duties if we had not declared the time of the imposition. of bhe Constitution clearly provides that laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation. The effect of clause 4 is to determine something in accordance with section 92 of the Constibubion. Section 55 refers more particularly to provisions like clause 7, and the subclauses therein contained, and I quite see how, by the drawing round of the argument, ib mighb be made to apply to clause 4. Now that attention has been drawn to the matter, however, I do not see that there is any necessity to deal with it more fully. I think that we should try to keep out of the Bill-the first taxation measure to be sent to the Senate-al l extraneous matters, and in this case we have not done bhat. can doubt bhab the Government have very carefully considered the very serious quesbion raised by bhe honourable member for Indi, bub I bhink bhab, where a possible error of judgmenb mighb lead bo very serious consequences, it is due bo bhe committee that the Attorney-General should explain why he has allowed this matter to pass.

It is a law antedating a law imposing taxation, but whether it is in itself a law imposing taxation is a question which seems to call for very careful consideration. WhilstI do not, on a mere cursory examination, set my opinion against that of the Attorney General, who has no doubt given the matter careful consideration, I think he should explain to us why be does not share pur misgivings. worth) I take it for granted that this clause is really in keeping with the form in which we have considered the schedule. We have allowed certain provisions to stand as from a certain date, and we have fixed subsequent dates for the operation of reduced or increased duties. The whole basis upon which we considered the schedule was that ib should begin to operate on the Sth October. If it does nob operabe from bhab dabe bhe whole of our proceedings have been absolutely irregular. set of the schedule that it should come into operation on the Sth October. Sir WILLLIAMM c MILLAN I know nothing about the constitubional aspecb of bhe mabber, but it seems to me that the clause is necessary in view of the peculiar character of the schedule and the way in which we have dealt with the amendments of it . MrL . E. GROOM (.Darling Downs) I should like to learn from the Attorney General whether this and a subsequent clause are intended to meet the case of a possible action for a refund of duty. The question has been raised in some of the States, whether, on an action for a refund of duty it would be possible for the Commonwealth to make a successful defence? I aril leaving out of consideration the question whether there is any form of procedure by which at the present time actions can be successfully brought against the Commonwealth. MrL . E. GROOM I am nob so sure bhab bhe question can be answered off-hand. If clause 4 and clause 6 are intended to validate illegal acts of the Customs officers who have already collected the duties, it may be questioned whether they can be properly inserted in a Bill for an Act to impose taxation. Ballarab) -The posibion in regard bo bhis measure may be looked ab from bhe standpoint of the constitutional practice in all the States with which we have been familiar, or as to the further issue whether restrictions to which we have not been accusbomed are imported into that practice by the Constitution. Particular abtention has been paid by honourable and learned members who have been considering bhis quesbion bo bhe 5 bh section of the Constitution, to which, upon the second reading, bhe honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne first directed attention. gard to clause 7. the honourable and learned member to refer to section 55 of the Constitution, in connection with his criticism ' of clause 4. On the contrary, so far as I followed his argument, it was that no exercise of the legislative power of the Commonwealth could, in his opinion, render clause 4 legal, whether ib book place in connection with a Taxation Bill, or any other B ill ; but that is a distinct issue. If I may be permitted to allude to an interjection with reference to Yes . clause 2, I would say that it appears to me to be clearly in its place, because without it there would be a lack of machinery to give effect to the Bill. All that clause 2 does is bo provide that the collection of customs duties shall be by means of the machinery provided in the CustomsA c t and embodies the provisions of that Act so far as they relate to the collection of duties. There are many""matbers in bhab Acb entirely beyond the scope of the Bill now before us; but such provisions as are necessary in imposing taxation require to be annexed to bhis Bill. All clause 2 adopbs from the Cusboms Bill are bhe provisions necessary for bhe carrying oub of ibs purposes.

138,Mr Deakin,"I did not understand the established constitutional practice and authoritative principles which must be followed in interpreting both the Constitution and this Bill. to clause 7, there is, perhaps, more matter for consideration, but, on the whole, I contend that, inasmuch as clause 7 is a condition of the imposition of duties, it is in its proper place. MrL . E. GROOM -It is a condition of the imposition or removal of duties. imposition of duties in this sense, that the schedule says duties shall be imposed at certain, rates, and clause 7 provides that, in certain cases, the duties so imposed may be reduced. That seems to be a provision so bound up with the imposition of taxation that it would be extravagant to say that it involves the introduction of foreign matter. I admit that the matter is open to argument, but it was better that the provision should be inserted here, so that tlie attention of the committee might at once be directed to it . Whether, as a matter of policy, it had better be incorporated in this Bill, or whether it should be brought down in a separate Bill, is another question. I admit that the arguments urged in favour of the latter course are grave and worthy of consideration. We can accomplish all we require by plasing it in a separate Bill, and can thus remove doubts which, though they may not imperil the Bill, should be avoided if possible. I amvery farfrom disputing the emincntconvenience, from a parliamentary point of view, of this proposal, if it be right, and I hope that the doubt which has been raised may prove to be unfounded. I am afraid, however, more serious difficulties than those now suggested may arise in a few years, inasmuch as the time fixed for the imposition of uniform duties is a dividing line for the purposes of finance. We are to adhere to the bookkeeping system between the States for a period of five years from the imposition of uniform duties, and from the expiration of the five years we are to begin the payment of monthly surpluses to the different States as this Parliament may prescribe. It will be very awkward if we become involved in a quarrel with the States as to the date on which the bookkeeping period is to end, and the distribution of surpluses by votes is to begin. 33 x been raised. W it h regard may very fairly hold different views upon the more imminent question whether any duty which was not levied in a State on Sth October will not have to be refunded if collected between Sth October and the time at which the Governor attaches his signatureto this Bill. Our finances may be very much upset by the decision of this question. It is a condition of the I particularly rely for my view upon this point upon section 108 of the Constitution, which provides that every law in any State is to remain in force until provision is made by the Federal Parliament to the contrary, and until such provision is made hy the Federal Parliament the State is to have the power of repeal or alteration. Therefore, if the State Parliament of New South Wales, had not imposed a tax upon shoes, prior to the 8th October they would beable to alter the law with regard to the duty upon such goods until the federal law was passed. I feel that we were justified in. pointing out this doubt at an earlier stage,, when there was a possibility of retreat, and' ]' can only hope now that every thing will go. smoothly, but I have very grave doubts. not think that the time devoted to the present discussion is wasted, because it is quite possible that we may pass these clauses without the consideration they deserve. Clause4 involves some other considerations. We know very well that, during the progress of the Tariff debate,, a great many changes were made from time to time in one direction or another. When the matter first came before the House doubts were expressed as to how people who had paid duties upon articles which were afterwards exempted from taxation would be treated. The object of this clauseis to throw back to a particular date the operation of the Tariff, as it emerges fromthis committee. It would be very interesting to the public to know how the Government propose to act in cases where duties. have been collected upon goods which havesince been placed on the free list. I understand that the Attorney-General admits that it might be better to remove any doubts as to the wisdom of including clause 7 in this Bill, by putting it in another measure. policy.",29,William Mcmillan Th E Whole That For Him To Draw A Prospect Of Such Re

""We are anxious that there shall be no possibility of the determination of one case governing hundreds of others. The Constitution is very clear upon the point at issue. It saysLaws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no eflecb. pose taxes only."" that ; clause 4 really involves the ante-dating of an Act which imposes taxation, but it is not in itself an imposition of taxation. -deals with the imposition of taxation. Attorney-General say the matter is so absolutely clear that no doubt can exist in regard to it? We know that in this Chamber questions have been raised regarding which there has been a good deal of doubt, although both sides seemed very confident of their particular positions. If there is any doubt about the matter, would it not be better to introduce the purpose of clause 4 into the Bil l which contains .clause 7 ? .remain where it is. MrM c C AY (Corinella) I am inclined to agree with the last remark of the Attorney-General. If we included clause 4 o n l y in a Bill, would that provision con.stitute a law imposing taxation? It would have necessarily to refer to the duties which have been imposed by this Bill, and would make them payable as from the Sth October last. It would, therefore, be a law imposing taxation. By putting clause 4 in a separate Bill we shall be 'faced with the same diffi-cnlty-if a difficulty exists-as will be experienced if we retain it in its present place. It is a law declaring that certain taxes shall be deemed to have existed as from the 8th October last, and constitutes an attempt to legalize that procedure, if it would otherwise have been illegal. The section of the Constitution referred to does not say that the measure shall impose taxation only; it declares it shall deal only with the imposition of taxation. That implies that we are at perfect liberty to add any other provision which is necessary for the collection of taxation. More danger would result from the omission of clause '4 than from its inclusion in the Bill. hardly be any doubt that, as we are now placed, this clause must be retained. A t an earlier stage of our deliberations, there were two paths possible. One was to pass an Act providing that when bhe Tariff proposals were laid upon the table, they should have the force of law. That would have It does not say "" shall imimposed taxation as from that moment; the other course was that which the GovernI quite admitment have adopted. tically impracticable. It is something which Attorney-General thinks was politically impracticable was not adopted. The other course was to bring down Tariff proposals in the way ordinarily associated wibh consbibubional government Now we have bo bake up bhe position bhab bhese duties, which werecollecbed upon Executive aubhoriby, were righbly collected. There is no other way 1 know of than that now suggested, namely, to ante-date the imposition as far as we can, and to validate, as is done in a subsequent clause, the collection of these duties. If that be not the right way of dealing with this matter, bhere can be no righb way. TheI think that clause 4 must fixing of bhe time for bhe imposition of a tax forms pait of rt Bill imposing taxation. If we make no sbabemenb upon bhe subjecb, ib means bhab bhe bax was imposed from bhe time when bhe Royal assenb was given. If we wish bo fix any obher time for bhe commencement of the imposition, we must state it ; it may be either before or after the Royal assent is given. I do nob wish any confusion bo exisb in regard bo bhis matter. While I bhink bhab bhe course which has been taken is effecbual so far as ib relates to the Commonwealth, it will most probably not satisfy the conditions of section 90 of the Constitution, which says thabOn the imposition of uniform duties of customs, all laws of the several States imposing duties of customs or of excise, or offering bounties on the production or export of goods, shall cease to have any effect. Thab, however, is quite a different question. Whilei t is possible for us to say that for our own Commonwealth taxation purposes we may ante-date the imposition of a tax, the actual date of its imposition is when the Governor General gives his assent.

Where duties, afber bheir paymenb by importers, have been abolished or decreased, I hold bhat some consideration should be given in the way of refunds. I am quite aware thab very sbrong objection can be taken to the practice of allowing refunds under all conditions. It is not contended that, immediately a duty is reduced or abolished, those who have paid it are entitled to a refund of the difference, irrespective of whether they have parted with the goods or not. There may be a very proper objection taken by the Minister for Trade and Customs to giving up duties which will never reach those who finally paid them, namely, bhe consumers. I propose to take advanbage of bhe promise of bhe Minisber bhab an opporbuniby would be afforded honourable members of deciding bhis mabter at bhe presenb sbage, and bo submib .a proposition which is absolutely jusb as between the Custom-house and bhose from whom duties have been collected.

Take bhe case of an importer of a large quantity of machinery.

In New South Walesi t has always been the custom to refund, not merely on goods in stock, but also on those not then in bhe possession of the party paying the duty.

Look ab bhe position in whichimporters are placed in New Soubh Wales. There was no intimation bhab bhe old cusbom was bo be departed from.

Under this Bill, it is proposed to deny to a man the right not to cheat the Customs, but to get back what legally belongs to him. It may seem hard language to use, but it appears to me that in those States of Australia where protection has been in force, a kind of justice is rampant very different from that in other States. It seems to me that the whole spirit of the CustomsA c t and its administration is that every man who imports goods into Australia is a rogue. An importer, as an honest citizen, has just as much right as has the manufacturer who makes goods here. I do not speak as an importer, because I am largely connected with both manufacturing and exporting interests. As a matter of common justice, it seems to me that it is wrong for a strong Government with millions at its back to refuse rights to private citizens who cannot fight them, It is all very well for honourable members to talk about the right of a man to go to the High Court of Australia for redress ; but what mercantile man would fight the Government if it were possible to avoid doing so? The ingenious way in which this matter has been delayed has been very inimical to the interests of the importers. Every day that passes makes it more difficult for a man to prove his case and obtain redress. The committee ought to declare clearly and precisely.that it will not see an injustice done in this matter. able member carry the principle ? Let us suppose that 20 per cent, has been paid on certain goods by an importer ; and that he has sold some of them to storekeepers who still have portion of the stock in hand. The honourable member says that if the duty has been reduced the importer should obtain a refund in respect of the portion of the stock he has on hand, but that no refund should be made to the storekeepers. the simple reason that the Government enter into the contract with the man who imports and who pays the duty. I hold that in this case the Government ought to makea refund to every man who imports goods, whether the goods go into comsumption or not. I waive the other point. The only man recognised by the Government is the one who makes the contract with them, and they have nothing to do -with his business. Because Yes. substantial justice cannot be done all round, owing to the intricacies of the case, that is no reason why we should refuse justice where we can give it . That seems to me to be a very good principle. I am surprised that the Government should refuse to take up this position. Isi t a matter of revenue ? It can be nothing else, because there is no question about cheating the Customs. Great difficulty has been experienced in connection with the section of the CustomsA c t referring to regulations, and there is a matter which has come up lately to which I should like to refer. I do not know how the Minister for Trade and Customs has decided it, but I will put the case in a few words: Certain people imported tea into New South Wales at a time when it was liable to a duty of I d . per lb. under the State Tariff. That duty was paid, but it is said that because there is no duty at the present time, those people are not entitled to obtain any drawback when they export the tea out of the country. I give this illustration simply to show that we are not asking for an act of grace, but for a refund of what in each case does not belong to the Customs. In the case of the tea the duty was paid on the understanding this the article was to be distributed in Australia;. but the Customs authorities allow a man to take goods out of bond in order that commerce may not be harassed, and they say to him inferentially "" If you do not dispose of all those goods here, but send them out of the State, we will give you a drawback."" That is the principle for which we are asking now. I am told that a large quantity of machinery for the development of Kalgoorlie has been imported into Western Australia, and that duty has been paid upon it there. Isi t fair that a refund should not be allowed when, by the common sense of the committee, the duty has been reduced ? The man who brings in his machinery at the present time is better off to the extent of 10 per cent., or whatever the reduction may have been, than the man who, trusting to the honour of the House, imported the machinery before the alteration was made. If it had been imagined for one moment that the House was not going to deal fairly with these individuals, nothing would have been imported while the Tariff was under discussion. We commenced the discussion of the Tariff on the Sth October last, and inferentially, we I said to the whole commercial and mining",33,William Mcmillan Th E Whole That For Him To Draw A Prospect Of Such Re

171,Sir William Mcmillan,"No ; forcommunity of Australia"" You can go on with your commercial relations. If we find that the duties which are now arbitrarily imposed are not sanctioned by law, we will make refunds to you to the extent of the duty wrongly paid."" On the faith of that understanding, millions of pounds worth of machinery and other goods were imported into Australia during the Tariff debate. It was believed that if after discussion the committee did not approve of any high rate of duty proposed by the Government, a refund would be allowed in respect of the excess duty paid. I am not using language one whit too strong when I say that if the Government do not consent, and if the committee do not force them to consent, to a clause similar to that proposed by my honourable friend, there will be a huge breach of public faith. prised by the observations of the acting leader of the Opposition. We have been asked repeatedly whether the Government intend to make any refunds, and if there is one thing which I have made as clear as clear could be from the earliest days of the Tariff debate, it is that we are against such a system. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN said that the Government would give the House an opportunity of deciding the matter. Buti t is absurd to say that we did not at the same time make it as distinct as could be that our policy was against refunds. I referred to the New Zealand and Victorian practice, which had been not to allow refunds. To say that, when I stand here calmly advocating the course which I said before I should advocate, I am guilty of a breach of faith, is a little too strong. I may remain in stock after the duty has been am sure that honourable members will not altered. sympathize with such a suggestion.

The acting leader of the Opposition says that we look upon importers as rogues. We do not do anything of the sort. ber did not make that statement against the Government. He said that there was a tendency in that direction. there is anything of the sort, but if there is, I hope it will not continue. Of course there are class prejudices. Sometimes we hear a manufacturer abusing an importer, and an importer abusing a manufacturer, but their business relations go on just the same, and they do not intend to cast any reflection upon each other. The importer looks after himself very well, and so does the manufacturer. generallv. people who carry on a particular undertaking know their business better than do others. Naturally they are able to bring greater skill to bear upon it, and so the general public are placed at a little disadvantage if the business people desire to take advantage of them. But they do not. It suits an importer, or anybody who brings goods into the CommonT h e Minister wealth, to take the goods out of bond; to pay the duty on them. He knows that the Tariff is being altered from day to day. in the possession of the Customs for ever. just as much as suits his purpose. He says "" All ! the Tariff may be raised. I will take these goods out of bond."" He sells the goods, and adds to the price the amount of the duty. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN But a portion I did not make back and find out what stock the man held at a certain time ? It is not a question sold a great many of these goods at a profit increased as soon as a duty was imposed.

I have been a little too clever, and have paid duty on goods which are now free. Will you be good enough to make a refund V Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN ment prevent a man who is in that position from recouping himself to the extent of the original duty by the'declaration in the Tariff that the duty has been reduced. time. There is no great difficulty about the refusal to refund because of any alteration in the Tariff. What is the effect where a duty is placed upon goods which have previously been admitted free ? The importer gets the benefit, and when, on the other hand, a duty previously imposed has been reduced, I venture to think that he makes a poor case for the refund, and we do not propose to grant it . the right honourable gentleman has referred as making money through the imposition of a duty upon goods previously free may not be the individual who has paid duty upon goods the duty upon which has been reduced. It is folly to say that we should have mercy upon a man because he has tried to protect himself against the Government by removing something from Customs control which it would have been better for him to have left under Customs control. If he has lost in that way we propose that he should bear the loss. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) -As I understand the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney, it is intended to provide that when a person imports goods, and has paid the higher duty upon them, and can prove to the satisfaction of the Customs authorities that he has a portion of those goods still in his possession, he shall be allowed upon them the difference between the duty he paid and the duty as reduced by Parliament A t the first glance it appeared to me that there was a great element of justice in that, and that it was a fair and reasonable proposal. But upon thinking it over I do not very well see how the amendment can be accepted without creating an injustice. Take the case presented by the acting leader of the Opposition of a man who imports £1,000 worth of has something to do goods, upon which he pays a duty of 20 percent. He sells £500 worth of these goods and. has still £ 5 0 0 worth in his possession, and can prove that they are the goods upon which he has paid the higher duty. The honourable gentleman says that he should be entitled to a refund of theThe Governdifference between the higher duty which he has paid, and tlie lower amount to which the Legislature reduced the duty. But suppose he sold the other £ 5 0 0 worth of the goods, as he would have done in almost every case, to a retail storekeeper. That storekeeper may still have the £ 5 0 0 worth of goods on his hands, and the importer would then be able by reason of having to pay a lower duty upon them to compete against him at a reduced value upon tbe £500 worth of goods he held. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN He does not compete with the retailer. MrA . McLEAN -The importer could, sell the other half of the shipment of goodsto another storekeeper at a lower price. act of this committee. MrA . M c LEAN I admit that, and I admit that so far as the importer is concerned there is a great element of justice in the proposal made. If we could give a refund all round I am sure that honourable members would approve of it, but it appears to me that that is impracticable, and that to redress where 'we can redress would create another injustice to persons who have the goods on hand, who bought them for purposes of resale, and who would have their value reduced by competition with the person who will get tbe refund. not think the Minister for Trade and Customs has approached this question in thatjudicial frame of mind which would enablehim to deal with it in a thoroughly impartial way. Wbat the committee are asked to do by the Bil l is not to compel the importer to pay duty, but. to bar an existing legal right which he has. I think the Minister might have approached this question in-.something less of the spirit of an advocate, as if trying to defend the Treasury from an unjust claim made upon it . There is no injustice about this claim. If honourable members consider the question carefully, they will see that the honourable member for North Sydney is really trying to modify an attempt to bar a certain existing legal claim which persons have under this measure.

It is the duty of the committee to approach this question in a thoroughly spirit, and with a desire to deal fairly with the public; and honourable members should remember that the Government have the whip hand. The Government by this clause can say : "" We refuse to pay."" If wo pass this clause, of course, no one will have any right, because it antedates the duty, and any claims that at present exist will be entirely gone. The honourable member for North Sydney has no more interest in the matter than has any other member of the committee, but he sees in this clause an engine of injustice. have imported certain goods and cleared them at a time when certain duties were assumed to be about to be placed upon them. They have not been placed upon them -the resolutions have been laid upon the table, but, of course, until the Bill is passed the duties are not constitutionally The House has determined that those goods shall not be subject to the duty first proposed, and the honourable member for North Sydney says, in effect-"" You are now asking us to pass a clause, the effect of which will be to debar people having existing rights from insisting upon those rights against the Government and recovering this money."" perly says-"" I justified that resistance to a certain extent. -ought to be returned to them upon the goods they have sold, because they have had the benefit of the duty from the retailers or -other merchants to whom they have disposedof the goods. But upon those goods which remain in their possession at the time when the lower duty was determined, they are entitled to have a refund of the excess duty which they have paid."" I remind the Minister for Trade and Customs of a case I brought under his notice prior to the date at which machinery of a certain class was determined to be free. I pointed out to him that Ritchie Bros., a large firm of manufacturers, had imported certain machinery connected with their manufactures and upon that machinery they had topayduty to the extent of about £3S0. Mr Bruce Smith. we determined that that class of machinery should be admitted free. This machinerywould be imported not for sale or to be disposed of in any way, but for use in connection with one of the industries which we have been that for many months trying to encourage, and although it is included amongst the list of exemptions in this Tariff, duty to the extent impartial of about £ 3 80 had to be paid upon it. The manufacturers are told, "" Y o u importedyour machinery for the p'urpose of pushing on your industry. There is no duby on these goods, but in your anxiety and enterprise you have withdrawn them from the Customs before Parliament has considered the question. You have paid £380 in duty, and you must forfeit that amount although you may come into competition with men who have imported the same machinery at a little later date, and who will, therefore, escape that imposition."" I He knows that certain men would ask the Minister for Trade and Customs to consider this question in bhe light of the broad principles of justice. Why is this clause being submitted bo us now ? Because there is an existing legal righb. Nobwibhsbanding what the honourable member for Wentworth has said, imposed. although it is not a law hy which these duties are collected before a Tariff is passed, it has the effect of law, because we know the courts of the different States, and the English courts-althoug h there is some doubt about bhe decision of the courts at home-hav e determined that the moment the resolutions are laid upon the table of the House the Tariff shall be taken to be in The honourable member very proforce. that point worked up to that point, and that is the law.

191,Mr Bruce Smith,"They haveasked to say that these existing rights are not to be recognised. We are being asked practically to antedate an Act of Parliament. How does Parliament generally deal with existing rights 1 The imposition of a duty, as every one knows,is a tentative thing; it is a supposition that a dutyis going to be cannot do complete justice, we shall not imposed. It has not been imposed, and as a consequence there is a right outstanding on the part of these people. We are asked as a Parliament to say that we shall not recognise their existing rights; that we shall antedate this Act of Parliament, and make the money paid by them the property of the Crown. and have no interest whatever in the matter, but I do say that when it is thoroughly realized by the public that we have deliberately deprived the citizens of the Commonwealth of the lawful right they had to recover money paid upon a misapprehension, the utmost astonishment will be expressed by all just and right-minded men from one end of Australia to the other. We are being asked to force these men who, prompted by business enterprise, have withdrawn their goods from the Customs control at an early date, to make a gift to the Government of the excess duty they have paid, and which may amount to hundreds of pounds. It would be a very bad beginning if we were to take this step without some such reservation as that proposed by 'the honourable member for North Sydney. The honourable and learned member for In d i asked how about this person, and how about that person. If we could reimburse the retailers who have paid duty which should not have been levied it would be fair to do so; but although it is impossible to give back to every grocer, draper, and ironmonger throughout the country what he has paid in duty, that should not prevent us from doing justice to the man who has £ 5 0 , £100 , or £500 worth of goods in his store, upon which duty has been paid, although similar goods have afterwards been made free. only would the retailer not obtain a refund of the money which he has paid, but the goods upon which the refund was given would come into competition with the goods upon which he had paid duty. that is so; but to go into such fine distinctions would require a differential Tariff; to meet the case of every trader throughout the country. We cannot give complete justice, but where a man has a distinct moral right to get back what he has paid under a misapprehension, it is a rather drastic thing for us to say, "" We shall deprive you of that right, and, because we do any."" Our attitude towards the retailer is this : We admit that he paid more for his few lbs. of tea, or cheese, or his few vards of. cotton or calico, because at the time he bought it a duty which was afterwards removed was in force; but it would cost the country much more to find him out I am not an importer, and repay him, if it were possible to do so, than the amount actually involved. The amendment of the honourable member for North ""Sydney does not raise a party issue, and if a division is taken upon it, members of the three parties in the House will be found voting on his side. I have mentioned an instance in which Messrs. Ritchie Bros., agricultural machine manufacturers, imported, for the purpose of their business, six machines, on which they paid in duty over £360. These machines are now free, but the importers are handicapped by the duty which they have paid on them. I suppose that ultimately the}' will pass the duty on to the consumers of their manufactures, but that should not happen. We should enable them to make an entry on the credit side of their books of the amount they have paid by refunding it to them. read in connection with the provisions of clause 5 1 cerned with the principle involved than with the actual wording of the amendment. In my opinion, it should apply not to the goods now in hand, but to the goods remaining in hand; to the remainder of any importation of which part has beeu disposed of. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN B y the time the Bil l gets through the Senate there will probably be no remainder. tion of morality involved in our action today. The people of Australia will be shocked to find that the Government are grasping moneys to which, morally, they I admit that are not entitled, and upon which they would have no legal claim were it not for this provision.

We should let the country see that, although the Government may think it their duty to grasp everything they can, impartial justice will be accorded by Parliament wherever their rights and those of the public conflict. amendment will not be .carried. It is true that we are bound to offer substantial justice to the community in matters of this sort, but, while we have heard a great deal of pleading for the importer, not a word has been said in favour of the reimbursement of the consumer. I know that a number of firms in New South Wales which were heavily stocked in a variety of lines, did very well in regard to A , B, and C, but made a loss upon D, and they now wish to be recouped their loss upon D, although there is no intention on their part to turn over to the Government the profits they made on A, B, and C. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN cases in which people have imported machinery upon which they were required to pay duty, although the Committee of Ways and Means afterwards remitted the duty. cases, but I do not know of them. If the claim of the importers is allowed, it seems to me that the merchants in Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia, who were compelled to pay comparatively high duties under their State Tariffs prior to the imposition of the Commonwealth Tariff, should be reimbursed the difference between the State duties and the Commonwealth duties. Then, too, what about the consumer? In New South Wales the consumer in a great many cases has had to pay higher prices for goods upon which no duty at all. was levied. That is easily seen by comparing the prices which have been enforced with the amount of Customs revenue received in New South Wales. I believe that about one-half of the quantity of cotton piece-goods imported between 4th December and 5th Apri l last came in free of duty; but since then a duty of 5 per cent, has been imposed upon such goods. Isi t proposed that the merchants who imported free of duty shall share their profits with the consumers ? We know,.as a matter of fact, that they will do nothing of the kind. The people of Australia have had the fullest notice of the intentions of the Government in this matter. If that were not sufficient to convince them that refunds would not be allowed, it should have made them especially careful about not taking from bond more than their immediate requirements. the less to pay in refunds. ought to have done away with the necessity for any such provision as the honourable member suggests. On the 21st November the honourable member for North Sydney asked the Minister for Trade and Customs a question as to refunds, and the Minister answeredI cannot answer the honourable member's question with reference to refunds, beyond repeating' what I have already said on this subject; but the policy of the Government is against refunds. It is true that he said that before the Tariff was disposed of an opportunity would be afforded to the committee to come to a decision on that point; but there was the But there are statement of the policy of the Government, which, I contend, should have been sufficient notice to the commercial community that they would run very great risk indeed if they took out of bond more goods than were absolutely necessary to meet their requirements. I cannot agree with the honourable and learned member for Parkes in his assumption that the whole community of Australia will receive a shock if refunds are not allowed. It must be remembered that in Victoria, and I think in some other States, no refunds have been allowed. shocking statement. could never see the justice of allowing refunds, seeing that in the main they helped the trader only, and not the consumer. There are some inequalities and perhaps cases of injustice, and some of these will remain whether we pass the honourable member's amendment or not. Moreover, looking at the difficulties under the bookkeeping clauses of the adjustment of payments of the States, and tbe absolute impossibility of following out to the consumer the benefits of any remission of duty, I think we shall do better if we leave the clause as it stands.

203,Mr Higgi Ns (Northern Melbourne),"principles upon -which he argues that a grave injustice has been done. understand, the honourable and learned member contends that we should make refunds of duties p i i d during a period in which (according to the final decision of the committee) a lower duty, or no duty at all, should have been paid. A t first sight, and without regard to what we have done, there appears to be strong reason to support the honourable member's position, but I think that he has been arguing under a misapprehension. I am not sure that the amendment is even in order. Clause5 has been passed providing that duties are to be collected as from the time of the imposition of uniform duties of Customs, and at such later dates as are mentioned in the schedule. bound to give 'the honourable member for North Sydney an opportunity of testing the feeling of the committee. to show that there is no injustice whatever. There has been no such taking away of the rights of individuals as the honourable and learned member for Parkes seems to imagine. Take a concrete case. In the case of methylated spirits, the duty was fixed "" at 3s., and on and after 18th April, 1902, at Is."" Assuming that the schedule is passed in this form, why should a man who has paid the legal duty as between the Sth of October and the 18th of April claim a refund ? What was the object of amending the Tariffi n that form 1 Wasi t not to provide that tlie duty as first proposed by the Government should be collected up t ill a certain date, and that from that time Onwards a lower duty should be levied. Now an attempt is being made to entirely alter the schedule. It is always open to honourable members to discuss every word in the schedule or other part of a Bill, and the correct course for the honourable member to adopt would be to propose alterations in tlie schedule which would carry out his object. Clause5 adopts the schedule. Sir WILLIAM form of dealing with the schedule, to which the honourable and learned member has referred, adopted as a matter of convenience, and without any idea that it would bar any rights 1 ment was adopted for convenience in the collection of the duties, and because it was not convenient to make refunds. I admit As I that if one looks at the case put by the honourable member for North Sydney by it self, without regard to other complications, the honourable member has established a very strong position, but the more I look into the matter, the more I feel that the honourable member's proposal'will raise a larger number of ghosts than it will lay. We cannot do justice to the importers unless we are also prepared to extend our consideration to the consumers and retailers. If we make restitution to the importers we must do it all round. In imposing a Tariff we cannot avoid inflicting hardship, and at the same time conferring undeserved benefits. The case put by the honourable member for Bland was exceedingly apt. I know of instances in which men have made a handsome profit upon two or three lines, and have perhaps lost upon another, and unless the honourable member for North Sydney can show that he can do ideal justice all round, his proposal should be withdrawn. If we make a special exemption against the schedule in favour of one class, we shall have other classes asking us to do the same for them. dozen criminals were involved in a crime, and only two were caught, the honourable and learned member would not punish the two because he could not extend the same treatment to all. of putting it. If we find numerous classes affected by hardship, and we t r y to remove the disabilities under which only one class suffer, the rest will be clamorous for similar relief, and with very good reason. It was well understood in connection with the amendments made in the Tariff that the lower duties should take effect from tlie date mentioned in the schedule, and that up to the time of the alterations the duties first proposed should be collected. something in the point raised by the honourable and learned member for Northern may be, as he says, that by passing that clause we have assented to the imposition of all duties from the Sth of October, and that we have a varying Tariff providing that the duties should be enforced from the Sth of October until the various dates on which they were altered. It may be also that this was the intention of the committee, but if",39,William Mcmillan Th E Whole That For Him To Draw A Prospect Of Such Re

Within a fortnight we placed a large number of the articles upon the free list, and the indentor thus found himself in the position of having paid £150 where he should have paid only £30. goods, and he had to dispose of the rest of them in competition with importers who were able to take their goods out of bond without paying the duty. Is it to be ai-gued that the indentor should have to bear the loss which resulted from the alteration of the duty 1 Upon the goods with which he had already parted he could not expect a refund, but if the man who bought them from him were able to prove that they had not passed into consumption, he would be entitled to a refund of the duty. now told, however, that although duty was charged without the assent of Parliament, those who paid it are not entitled to a refund. I do not think that was the intention of the committee, and I am quite sure it ought not to have been, because it is not in accord with those principles of justice to which it is the duty of Parliament to conform. Clearly, where a man can show that he has been called upon to pay a duty which has not been assented to by Parliament, he is entitled to a refund, and it is idle to say that, because we cannot do justice in every case, we must not do justice in any. It is argued that, because we cannot catch all robbers, we ought not to catch an}'. I am surprised to find in this Chamber men who regard our Parliamentary Acts as of no importance. In my judgment it is sometimes more important that those Acts should seem todojustice than that they should actually effect it.

There is no doubt that the Commonwealth has power to antedate duties to the period mentioned, but I claim that we ought to do so specifically in this Bill.

I have done my duty in drawing attention to it, and I think it will yet be seen that I have acted in He had only sold £200 worth of the interests not of a party, but of the whole House. In this case the consumer has been used as a sort of red herring, and honourable members have been asked why he should be denied a refund of the duties which he has paid, seeing that we wish to make a similar concession to importers. But even that inquiry does not put the case in its proper light. We have to remember the very large body of people to whom that We are argument is in no way applicable-peopl e who import for their own purposes only. Why should they not be allowed a refund of the duties paid? Upt ill the other evening monstrous duties operated upon machinery of all classes, but the committee happily decided to reduce the bulk of them to 15 per cent. Are people who have paid hundreds of pounds in excess of the present rates of duty to be denied any refund whatever ? Are they to be penalized for their energy in pushing their various industries ? perfectly sure that when the honourable member for North Sydney submits an amendment he has not only common sense but justice behind it . In this instance I know that he has substantial reasons for adopting the attitude which he has assumed.

I am not astonished to find that a Victorian system of dealing with the question of refunds has been adopted. But if by the adoption of any system her own people would lose heavily in comparison with those of the other States, I would be much more astonished did we not hear strong protests from the Victorian representatives in this Parliament. That is the position. The course of action adopted by the Government will inflict injustice upon some of the other States by preventing their importers from competing with the Victorian importers upon level terms, as the system adopted is a Victorian one, for which the Victorian importers were prepared. The only reason advanced why a refund should not be made is that it is impossible to do justice to everybody in the community, although it is admitted that justice can be done, to a great number. Is that tlie sort of British law which is to be applied in the Commonwealth? I thought that British law laid it down that we should right a proved injustice, though in attempting to do so we conferred an undue advantage upon some individuals. I can quite understand the objection against giving to an importer something which the consumer has paid, and which cannot be refunded to him. Buti t must be remembered that as soon as the duty is reduced the effect passes on to the consumer ; because there are plenty of competitors who, not having to pay the higher rate of duty, will compete in the market, and thus reduce the price. It has been said that what I propose will not be of any benefit to the retailer. I absolutely deny that. The Tariff is being framed and administered without due regard to the ordinary course of business. W ill it not be an' advantage to an enormous number of retailers who indent goods to get a refund of the higher duty which they have been compelled to pay ? That will be their advantage. An instance has been given where a retailer has bought from an importer; and it is said that while the importer will get tlie rebate on what he has in stock the retailer will not get it on what he happens to have in stock. But are not those who know anything of business aware that immediately a Tariff has been inrposed retailers-excep t as regards anything they are committed to by contract or indent-refus e to buy except from hand to mouth, because they know the possibility of an alteration of the Tariff in Parliament ? Consequently they would be affected very little in that direction, whilst on all contracts and indents they would get a benefit. The mere name of an importer, although he may only be an importer for a day-throug h having purchased a plant, or machinery, or cement for building purposes-is sufficient to induce many to refuse that full justice that will be readily given to manufacturers. We have frequently heard it urged that justice should be done to a single manufacturer. Here is a case where justice ought to be done to a great many importers; but no consideration is to be given to their case. I am sorry there has been any warmth over this matter, and I regret if I have said anything to ruffle the Prime Minister.",41,Mcmillan Was Not That Melbourne As To The Effect Of Clause 5 I T

It could have been settled in the sections of the Customs Act. We should have intimated, at the very beginning of our deliberations, that we intended to give no refunds with regard to goods upon which duty has been paid. That would have been honest. The honourable member for Bland has quoted certain words used by the Minister for Trade and Customs, which, of course, he did say. But I am satisfied that the matter was left in absolute uncertainty. It was practically said to the importers-""Rely upon the justice and honour of Parliament, and your case will be met."" Many honourable members who were favorable to the granting of refunds stated, that they would not agree to a refund where it was proved that the goods had gone into general consumption, but I was of opinion, gathered from interjections or remarks slightest demade in the committee; that there would be a refund in all cases where it could honestly be shown that the goods remained in the possession of the importer after the lowering of the duty. Furthermore, there was an almost universal consensus of opinion that in the case of machinery a refund would be made to the importer. If the Government had made up their minds on the question they should have made a declaration earlier, or they should have had it placed in the Customs regulations that ""could prove it line the course now proposed would be pursued. It has been said that the public understood, but the public know very little of what goes on here. The words used by the and on and after "" Minister may not have been reported throughout Australia.

231,"Is He Prepared 'To Make Them, Mr Macdonald","PATERSON (BrisI have had ' to beg very much in order to obtain an honest and truthful statement of their views on the subject. 1 believe that Ministers generally, and especially those who have devoted themselves to the highlyiuiportant duty of passing the Tariff through this House, have desired from the first to give honourable members on either side, who represent interests such as I represent, truthf u l replies to all questions submitted to them. One evening, while the committee was sitting, I handed certain correspondence to the Treasurer. It related to the question of refunds, and some days later-n o doubt after the matter had been considered by the Cabinet-it was returned to me by the right honourable gentleman, with a minute on it to the effect that the Government had come to the conclusion that it was a matter entirely for the discretion and decision of Parliament. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN the reply. am sorry that my private secretary is not within call, otherwise I should produce the original minute; but honourable members will accept ray word. When I received the letter from the Treasurer, I inquired whether I was at liberty to convey the terms of the minute literally, by telegram or by letter, to my correspondent, and I received an answer in the affirmative. A similar statement had been mentioned here frequently, and my mind was in a state of preparedness to receive whatever hints were given either by the Minister for Trade and Customs or the Treasurer. I was perfectly satisfied with the answer, and, in reply to my correspondent, I put the statement referred to by the acting leader of the Opposition in inverted commas"" Thati t was the impression of all members of this House that the matter was to be dealt with by Ministers as an open one."" The conclusion I arrived at from the answer given me by the Treasurer was that Parliament would have an opportunity of pronouncing upon the question of refunds, and that tbe matter would be dealt with, not from the Ministerial point of view, with all the strength of Ministerial support behind it, but as an open question, without any party feeling on either side. Having the permission of the Treasurer to convey to my constituents, verbatim et literatim, the minute made by him ou the letter in question, I did so. And what is the result t I am battered about like a dirty old sparrow on the house-tops. All my representations, given in good faith, as coming from the lips of responsible Ministers, are set at nought, and a proposal is put before us which is intended to unite all those who are against any refunds to commercial men, who, from the first, have expected that the precedents of the past would be followed and that refunds would be allowed. The Government have not kept faith with the written statement given to me. I have reason to remember that statement well, because owing to the fact that some of it was written very badly, I was unable to transmit it on the night that I received it, and had to request the Treasurer to be good enough to interpret it. I hope that the Minister for Trade and Customs has made a note of my observations. The Minister has always acted towards me and other honourable Yes , that was members with the greatest good faith, and I have had pleasure in transmitting to my constituents from time to time the statements given to me by members of the Government. The result of this will be that, whilst I shall not be regarded as a cypher in the position I have had to occupy, Ministers will be looked upon, in view of my representations, as having failed to keep faith with the people of Queensland. MrL . E. GROOM (Darling Downs) I have paid very close attention to the debates, and have watched the observations of the Minister for Trade and Customs on this particular point. The impression made on my mind by his utterances is certainly very different from that which the acting leader of the Opposition as well as the honourable and learned member for Brisbane say was conveyed to them, although the particular words to which the honourable and learned member for Brisbane refers are quite in conformity with the expressions which have been uttered by the Minister for Trade and Customs. This matter first came up in the House so far back as the 5th November last, when, in answer to a question by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, in regard to refunds of duties, the Minister for Trade and Customs saidThe answer to the honourable and learned member's question is as follows :-The Government cannot give any undertakings in this matter, on account of the difficulty of securing any rebate to the person really affected by the duty.

He gave the arguments p r o and con upon the whole question, a nd then he saidThe importer takes his chance. When he clears goods out of bond he does so as a businessman thinking that the best course to take. And in many cases he risks an increase of duty. An importer may take goods out of bond before the Tariff is imposed, and as has been done in some cases may charge the consumer with the duty subsequently imposed, although no duty has been paid.

The honourable member for Wentworth said that these people have had no notice of the matter, and that to retain the higher duties now would, therefore, be a gross breach of faith. But, within a few weeks of the first collection of duties under the Tariff, all the merchants in the Commonwealth were possessed of the facts. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN tion which could have been definitely settled at the beginning. MrL . E.

From the 8th November to the present time the matter has been before Parliament, and the public and merchants have been aware of the facts. member coolly slips os'er the previous period when a large amount of duty was paid. MrL . E. GROOM -It was a period of only about a month. If the honourable member had worded his amendment so as to make it apply only to excess duties collected during that month, there would have been more justice in his claim than there is when he proposes to extend it over a period of seven or eight months. Merchants have had all this notice of the matter. They have taken their goods out of bond knowing that it was at their own risk, and apparently they have been quite prepared to run it . This is a very difficult proposalto put into practice. Afte r a lapse of seven months how are we to identify goods upon which the higher duties have been paid? Honourable members must see that to attempt to do so would be to give opportunities for the practice of all sorts of fraud. I rose chiefly to point out an injustice done to the Government in the statements which have been made, and I hope the committee will not agree to the amendment. The honourable and learned member who has just resumed his seat has busied himself during the last ten minutes in trying to prove that tbe Government have been consistent in what they have done. I interjected that we have had half-a-dozen statements from them since the dates which the honourable and learned member quoted. 33 Y I am opposed to refunds, and every member of the committee knows it . and learned member for .Darling Downs asked me to quote one of the different statements which I say have been made. I do not think I could do that in five minutes. But there are half-a-dozen answers which have been given by Ministers since those quoted by the honourable T h is is a quesand learned member, and I venture to say that in them there has been no expression on the part of Ministers of an intention to do anything more than to submit the whole matter to the House. That has been the reply which Ministers have given recently to these questions. We are continually hearing, that wo ought to take a. broad view of the question, and each State should consider the interests of the other States. Our position in New South Wales is a peculiar one in this respect. Ourmerchants, believing that the immemorial practice in New South Wales of refunding : excess duty paid would be followed, find themselves handicapped as compared with Victorian merchants, who have been acting upon the Victorian practice, which has been to make no refund. After the declaration of this House that the higher duties should not have been imposed in the first instance, on the merits of the case, it occurs to me that the least the Government can do is to refund the money which has been paid by these people who have taken their goods out of bond in good faith. It is not a matter of whether it is legal -or not. It is a matter of fair play. The House has said that these duties ought not to be imposed. back all round ? How can we get at the consumers who have paid the duties? not get all back is that any reason whywe. should not get back as much as possible * Where a man has paid £100 in duty upon a machine which is still unused, and which concerns only himself, has he no right to come to the Government and ask for a refund of the £100? able member would not let him get it, because somebody else may have sold a machine and passed the duty on.

We only ask that each claim shall be investigated, and where it can be shown that the excess duty has been paid, and the claimant has the goods still in his possession, he should get a refund of the money which this House has declared he ought not to have paid. I am surprised at the stand which the Government have taken in this matter. there is something to be said for the refund of duty paid upon machinery.

I do not believe in attacking the importer any more than the manufacturer, but while I am here I shall look after tlie interests of the consumer, as I represent a constituency of consumers. The honourable member for Brisbane has said that the Government have broken faith with him. That-was news to me, because questions have been asked about these refunds ever since the Tariff was introduced. Ministers were asked whether they would allow a refund upon a certain article, and we always had the same answer, that the matter would be dealt with in the Tariff Bill.

It may be that the amendment, as I read it, limits it to that, but I will not quarrel with the honourable member upon that point. I followed the discussions in committee as closely as possible, and I have been under the impression from statements which have been made, that the Government did not propose to allow any rebates at all. But they intimated that when the Tariff Bil l -was introduced, it would be open for honourable members to discuss the matter. It is true that the honourable member for Parramatta said that the principle of allowing rebates has been recognised in New South Wales, but those of us who have had extensive experience of that principle know that it was open to abuse, and I am not prepared to vote for its repetition.

I have yet to learn that it is possible to discriminate so completely that injustice will not be done on the one hand to the Treasury, or on the other hand to the consuming public. That being so, I am strongly disposed to vote against the granting of refunds. If I thought that the money could be refunded to those who actually paid the duty, I should be prepared to consider the matter, but that was not accomplished in New South ""Wales, and I am afraid that at could not be done in the Commonwealth. I feel, therefore, that in justice to the consumer and to the Commonwealth Treasurer I .should vote with the Government. somewhat unfortunate that this question should have been brought forward at this stage at all. It was the duty of the Government to state at the timeof the introduction of the Tariff whether refunds would be allowed if alterations were made. November that no refunds would be allowed. stated that he was utterly opposed to the granting of refunds, and I understood that 1 the Government took the same position, but, at the same time, he told me distinctly that the House would have an opportunity of settling the matter. Therefore, when I received letters from merchants in Queensland, I informed them that the Government was opposed to the granting of refunds, but that at a later date the House would have an opportunity to decide the matter. am in favour of granting refunds, because I think that, once a duty is remitted or reduced, those who have paid it, or have paid a higher rate than is afterwards collected, should be repaid the amount which Parliament has decided should not be collected. It is unfair and illegal for the Government to retain such moneys. sumer ? deals only with the importers, and only those who paid the duty are entitled to refunds. The reimbursement of the consumers is a matter which must be lef tto the merchants and the retailers. honourable member for Brisbane seems to think that there hny been action on the part o -> OO \ 2 of the Government equivalent to a breach of faith. There can have been no"" doubt whatever as to the attitude of the Government in this matter from the very first. We have always been opposed to the granting ofrefunds, and time and again, when the question has been put, we have told honourable members that the House would have an opportunity to decide the matter. We have refused refunds on all occasions. A number of references have been made to answers given by me at various times. They are all of one tenor, and I should be ashamed if they were otherwise. The honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, asked me, in reference to mining machinery, if any refunds of duty would be given, and my reply wasIf Parliament so decides, we shall do so. Our proposal is not in that direction, but we propose to take'the sense of the House on the subject. Too much has been said in regard to tlie injustice of our action in this matter, but there is just as much justice in demanding what we demand as in the proposal of the members of the Opposition. Are we to stigmatize the Acts of other States as unjust, simply because they are not the same as those of New South Wales1 Victoria has granted no refunds, and I know of no provision for refunds in the South Australian legislation. New Zealand, in the clearest terms, has enacted that no refunds shall be given, and the great Federation of Canada has provided in section 21 of the Duties of Customs Act of 1897-and I am indebted for the reference to the honourable and learned member for Indi-that I Nor shall the person paying it be entitled to any refund or be liable to any further payment of duty by reason of such rate of duty being altered by any resolution introduced subsequent!y to that in accordance with which such duty was paid and before the passing of this Act. troduced with the Tariff. A very different thing. difference. We have the testimony of an honourable member who knows that in New South Wales, where they granted refunds, the system did not operate in such a way as would induce him to vote for its repetition. There has been a form of administration there which seems to have permitted the abuse of power, and if a similar provision were introduced here it might open a door for mischief which it would be",47,Mcmillan Was Not That Melbourne As To The Effect Of Clause 5 I T

275,Mr Bruce Smith (Parkes),"Ithe importer. I suppose every honourable member knows of some such case, and I may mention one regarding which I have had several interviews with the Minister for Trade and Customs. In this instance a large firm of agricultural machinery manufacturers imported some modern labour saving machines valued at about £1,200. They paid something like £ 3 6 0 or £ 3 8 0 duty in order that they might get immediate possession of these machines, and adopt improved methods of manufacture. They are using the machines themselves, and there is no suggestion that any sale has been made to retail buyers. I trust that bhe Minister for Trade and Customs will take the proposal before the committee into favorable consideration. I am not concerned as to the exact form which it takes, but where machinery which has been imported has been taken out of bond promptly, so that it might be made use of with the greatest expedition, the manufacturers who use it ought not suffer for their business promptitude. not consider it his duty to fight this proposal, but will leave the committee and his own party with an entirely open mind, so that they may do what they think is fair under the circumstances. should feel, occup3'ing the position which I -do, and drawing the emoluments which attach to the office, if I evaded all responsibility. In a matter of this sort, ifc seems to me the duty of the Minister to indicate the policy of the Government, and to justify the course which they take. I think we ought not to legislate for special cases. Legislation which is enacted to give certain individuals certain advantages during a limited term is a very difficult thing to justify. We have heard of various systems which obtain. There is the method under which no refunds are permitted, and' that under which they are granted in all cases. Only a few minutes ago the committee divided upon the question of whether a refund should be permitted in certain specific cases, and a considerable majority voted against the proposal. Personally, I feel that as we cannot deal satisfactorily with all cases, it is better to lay down a general rule. could not be manufactured within the ComI f we are now to enter upon a consideration of the question of whether a specific refund should be made in this case or that, we shall open up a discussion which may extend to every item in the Tariff. I do not think it would be fair to give one class terms which we have already decided not to give to people generally. I hope that honourable members will see the force of the arguments which I have used, and vote accordingly. which .now emanates from the right honourable member for Tasmania is one which places honourable members in a somewhat difficult position. I take it that we are legislating for the entire Commonwealth, and that we have no desire to make any special class distinction. The amendment submitted would very materially benefit several mining companies in which I am interested, but I could not venture to ask special consideration for those companies to the exclusion of other interests throughout the Commonwealth with equal claims to a refund, if sucji consideration could not be justified upon principle. I cannot quite see the object of the proposal submitted. A t the first blush ifc strikes me as being an unfair suggestion, which will press unduly I hope that the Minister will upon the people of the continent. I regret that it will be impossible for me to support the amendment. desire to mention one or two matters which I have already brought under the notice of the Minister for Trade and Customs, and which bear directly upon this question. Upon one occasion I represented to him the case of amiller whosebusiness premises were burntdown,and who, as a result, was compelled to import new machinery. Seeing that that machinery could not be manufactured within the Commonwealth, I asked whether, in the event of an alteration being made iu the amount of duty imposed upon it, a refund would be allowed to the miller. There could be no difficulty in tracing that machinery, and honourable members must admit that the miller in question was placed in a very unfair position as compared with others who are engaged in the same calling. I admit that, in some cases, it is very hard to determine whohasultimatelypaidtheduty. Then, again, there is the case mentioned by the honourable member for Newcastle, which had reference to a zinc-refining retort. That honourable member pointed out that this apparatus monwealth, and urged the Government to place it upon the free list.

Sir ""WILLIAM McMILLAN ment admit nothing. of admitting nothing, but of stating something. But as a matter of policy, perhaps, the course of public business will best be facilitated if we withdraw the clause from the Bill, and deal with it subsequently. I trust that honourable members who agree with the policy contained in the clause will be equally desirous of facilitating its passage when it is introduced on a subsequent occasion. with tbe honourable and learned member for Indi and the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, I agree that this Bill is not the place in which to insert such a clause, but it is of no use to discuss whether f t is a good or bad provision at the present time. I believe, from what I learn privately, that the honourable and learned member for Corinella holds the same view, that the clause ought not to form part of this Bill, in view of section 55 of the Constitution. Therefore I am glad that the Government propose to omit it. reason to rejoice at the admission that there is a necessity under a protectionist Tariff for inserting a provision which will remove rings, trusts, monopolies, and combines of all sorts. The truth could not have been better stated from this side of the Chamber. ' I may mention that I had intended to move for the insertion of a clause providing that a copy of this measure, with the schedule attached, should be exhibited in eveiy place where dutiable goods were exposed for sale, my object being, of course, that the public should have an opportunity of knowing exactly the amourit of duty paid for their goods. But I do not think that I can go on with that proposal, as the Government are not proceeding with the clause. clause veiy much, and I trust that the Government, having taken the course of making sure of the matter by omitting it from this Bill, will lose no time in introducing it in a separate measure. TheB ill should be introduced, and come into force almost contemporaneously with the Tariff and the Excise Bills. I also hope that when the Minister introduces his Bill, he will notice that the clause, as framed, will require a little alteration. It provides The Governthat if there is any trust or ringthe latter word more correctly describes the idea-to unduly enhance the price of any particular goods, a report may be obtained from a tribunal, and on that report the Governor General may, On an address from bothHouses of the Parliament, direct that the goods which are the subject of the riDg shall be admitted free of duty, or at a reduced rate. In the case of importers, it would probably be the case that the goods were already being introduced free of duty or at a low rate; and in' the case of a ring of manufacturers the case would not be met by merely saying that the goods should be admitted free. What we need to provide is that if importers make a ring such as we have had in Victoria in the case of reapers and binders, upon which there was no duty, other goods with which they come into competition shall be admitted at a reduced rate, in order to break down the ring. In the case of manufacturers, it may be that a provision will be needed to insure that other goods that will come into competition with them shall be admitted free, or at a reduced rate. The Of course, the Opposition have good clause as at present worded would undoubtedly fail to meet the case fully. Canadian Actt Canadian Act. The Canadian Act uses the term "" l i k e articles."" That may have escaped the observation of the framers of this clause, and that phrase points the direction in which the clause should go.

It is very much easier to legislate in advance to meet such difficulties than to legislate after rings and trusts have got a footing and interests have been created. that seems to have escaped notice is that a clause such as this has been in force in the United States something like fifteen years. But the objection to any Judge deciding such a matter is that Parliament has said that a duty is to be, say, 50 per cent., and the manufacturers affected say"" How can any Judge, when Parliament has decided that'the rate shall be 50 per cent., declare that it is 45 per cent, too much "" ?

That the Bill be now read a third time. were dealing with the Billi n committee, clause 5 rather escaped my notice, but I drew attention to it at a later stage. I do not think that the point was fully grasped at the time, and perhaps it will be necessary for me to deal with it again. Section 108 of the Constitution, provides thatEvery law in force in a colony which has become or becomes a State, and relating to any ' matter within the powers of the Parliament of tbe Commonwealth, shall, subject to this Constitution, continue in force in the State; and until provision is made in that behalf b}' the Parliament of the Commonwealth, the Parliament of the State shall have such powers of alteration and of repeal in respect of any such law as the Parliament of the colony hod until the colony became a State. Therefore, until this Bill has been finally assented to, it will be possible for any one of the States to pass Customs Acts. We know that nothing of. the sort will be done; but it seems to me that, looking at clauses 4 and 5 of the Bill, we have made a slight mistake. By clause 4 we provide thatThe time of the imposition of uniform duties of customs is the Sth day of October, 1901. In view of the section in the Constitution to which I have referred, I do not think that the time of the imposition of uniform duties of customs is the Sth October last. Still we can leave it at that. The point occurs in relation to section 5, which provides thatThe duties of customs specified in the schedule are hereby imposed according to the schedule as from the time of the imposition of uniform duties of customs. If , as I think nearly the whole committee are agreed, the time of tlie imposition of uniform duties of customs is the date on which the Bill becomes law, the fact remains that we have not' inserted a date from which these duties are to be collected, without straining that clause is he\d to be that which many of should the forms of the legal members of the House attach to it, we will not have fixed any date. We can get over the whole difficulty at once by recommitting the Bill and providing thatThe duties of customs specified in the schedule are hereby imposed ""as from the 8th October, .1901,"" or such other later dates as are mentioned in the schedule.

294,Mr Conroy (Werriwa),"When wethere are no laws, and if my suggestion were adopted we should fix a date from which to act. There is no doubt about that point if we consider section 86, as we have executive control over the customs and excise. When we fix the date for the imposition of uniform duties of customs we deal with an entirely different matter, and one which the Attorney-General himself ought to consider. I think that the matter is open to a very strong attack in another Chamber, and our desire is to send up the Bill as perfect as possible. I fail to see why we should run the risk of passing the Bill in this way when the difficulty mighb be overcome at once by adopting bhe suggestion I have made. Of course, it might be argued in the High Court that even if the time of the imposition of uniform duties of customs happened bo be bhe dabe on which bhe Bill was finally assented to by Parliament, still so much of clause 4 would hold good as would make clause 5 refer to the Sth October. As the matter stands, ib seems to be a case of indifferent draftsmanship, and one which might land the committee in difficulbies. If bhe Abborney-General can give me his assurance bhab he has already dealb wibh the poinb, and anticipates no difficulty from it, I do nob propose bo labour bhe mabter any further. I merely place on record my objection, and hope that if the Bill is ""passed in its present form my fears will not be realized. worth) I feel that the kind of informal. compact that we made during the earlier hours of the sitting should be observed on the third reading of the Bill, although,'if I had had an opportunity of following him, the rather bellicose speech made by the Minisber for Trade and Customs mighb have led me inbo a leugbhy oration. However, we have had sufficient time to cool down, and distance, while not in bhis case lending enchanbment bo bhe view, gives bo one's mind a clearer proportion of bhe relative value of spe'eches and acbs. During bhe hours which have passed since bhe Minister's speech was made, I have come to the conclusion thab he said very libble bo which ib is necessary to reply. There is one matter on which, in justification to the leader of bhe Opposition, who is absent, I should like to set bhe Minister light. It is absolutely clear, from the very words of the Hansard report, which is now in my hands, bhab the rather extraordinary sbabemenb attributed to the leader of the Opposition could not j>°ssibly have been bhe statement that he really intended to make. He saidAccording to the Treasurer's estimates for nine months, if we take the same rate of receipts to extend over the full twelve months, we shall receive something like £800,000. I think the Treasurer's statement was that the'revenue would be aboub £600,000 in excess of bhe original estimabe. Thab is nob very material. The sbabemenb made by bhe leader of bhe Opposition may have been made from memory. He gave bhe exact estimate of the Treasurer that at the end of the year, instead of having £8,000,000 of revenue, he would have probably something between £8,600,000 or £8,700,000. That disposes of any possibiliby bhab bhe leader of bhe Opposibion said bhab bhe current year would yield a revenue of over £10,000,000 from all Australia. I do not know what figures were at the disposal of my righb honourable friend, but I have always said bhab no one in bhe universe could tell what would be result of a Tariff such as this in the next two or three years. If bhe Tariff had been, as originally easb, of a highly protective character, there is no doubt that in three or four years' time the revenue would have been very materially reduced by bhe effect of thab protective incidence. But even in bhat case, no one could tell how many years it would take for the full effects of protection to be felt. A t the'present time, when bhe Tariff has been made muck more revenue producing bhan ib was originally, no one can bell what its exact effect will be. We must wait for actual fa cts before we can decide. Certainly bhere are b wo or three things which we can consider. In the first place the Tariff will undoubtedly yield during the current year an amounb far in excess of bhe Treasurer's estimabe. In bhe nexb place the Tariff has been so reconsbrucbed bhab ib will be a much greater revenue-producing machine than it would have been under bhe original proposals. We must recollecb also bhab in bhe original proposals and calculations of the Treasurer a certain statement was made, which was nob in any way supported by facts. In 1899, what are called the external imports from oversea were £32,000,000, and although ib has been impossible bo obbain from bhe Governmenb bhe acbual .statistics for bhe lasb bwo years, I am of opinion, as the result of experience, bhab wibh bhe increase of",52,Pairs
295,Sir William Mcmillan (Went,"population the external importsinto Australia during the last year were probably nearer £40,000,000. If we consider that the Minister for Trade and Customs based his duties in his original proposal upon imports d uring 18 99 interests as I had anticipated. I regret, howamounting to £21,000,000, when really they amounted to £32,000,000, we may be perfectly certain that there is even a greater margin of discrepancy in the estimates of the Government. But I do not think that that is a matter which it is wise for us to labour. We are committing ourselves to a certain Tariff. We know broadly that according to the last estimate the amount of duty to be collected is far in excess of what onght to be the requirements of the Commonwealth. Therefore without referring to what may be done in another place we ought to hold with every judicious alteration that will reduce the enormous burden upon tlie people. I do not think that I need say any more. The other remarks made by the leader of the Opposition were more of a personal character. They were stated fully, and I do not desire to repeat them, although I concur with my right honourable friend. I am very glad that so far as this Chamber is concerned we have now come to the end of our labours on the Tariff. I have to thank many honourable members of the Opposition, who, while I have been acting as leader of the party, have given me a generous support. We have to thank particularly honourable members representing AVestern Australia. If I might single out any honourable member who by common consent has, hy his great commercial knowledge, and by the fairness with which he has dealt with every question relating to the Tariff that has. been brought up, distinguished himself more,. perhaps, than has any other honourable member, I might refer to the honourable member for""North Sydney. That honourable member has shown a knowledge of commercial matters and a grasp of the details of business which have added very much to the information of this Chamber, and his opinions have always been given with a saiivity aud sense of equity, which, I believe, have commended .him to. both sides of the House. I have nothing to complain so far as those honourable members who are opposed to meareconcerned. I think the discussions have been carried on in a way which has reflected credit upon all concerned. In very difficult circumstances, during a discussion extending over six months on matters which must have created considerable heat, the rules of debate as well as the dignity of the Chamber have been well sustained. I hope that the measure will not prove so disastrous to many ever, that it hasnotbeen drawn upon broader national lines. I feel that if more concessions had been granted by the Government so as to make the Tariff approximate nearer to a revenue Tariff, we might have erected a system of finance through the Customs which, so far as both sides of the House are concerned, would have been allowed to stand for many years to come. There can be no doubt that nothing is more inimical to the interests of commerce than the continual change of Tariff' regulations. However, we must hope for the best, and give a loyal support to what may be the result when this-Bill finally emerges into law. I should like to say to my right honourable friend who. has the control of this great department that, whether rightly or wrongly, a feeling is abroad that the department is i nimical to the importing interests. Whether* rightly or wrongly, the opinion is abroad also'that there is too much centralization i i i the department. I know, as a fact, that on many occasions merchants in Sydney have had to wait for days for reference to be made to Melbourne in order to have points adjusted. Therefore, everything that can be done to simplify matters and to create a common knowledge throughout Australia among the different Customs officers, ought to be done. I am sure it ought not to be the interest of the Government, no matter what their principle of taxation may be, to make that taxation irritating to the people. They desire to get the f u l l revenue required for the governmentof the country,but,I take it, they desire also to interpret the law according to its simplest meaning, and with fairness both to the people and the Government. I am sure they do not wish to add to the irritation that must arise out of a system like this, which is new, ab any rate, to one of the great States of Australia, the further irritation that would naturally spring from a sense of wrong if there was a feeling that there was not equitable dealing in the administration of the department. I trust my right honourable and learned friend will make it his business to see that the administration is more popular in the future.

There is not at present any ground for the feeling referred to, and there never will be if I can centralization I should like to say this :Centralization-reportin g to head-quarters sometimes resulting in delay-is very necessary in the first stages of the administration of an Australian Customs department for the reason that without .centralization we cannot get uniformity of administration. We find that in the different States there has been such a difference in the systems of administration, and in the interpretation of Tariffs, that the utmost vigilance is necessary at head-quarters for the purpose of preventing tlie benefits of a uniform federal Tariff being altogether neutralized by a want of uniformity iu the administration of that Tariff. that the department in Sydney is shockingly undermanned. that there has been a strain on the department. There has been a strain upon the Government, and upon honourable members generally. It has been a time of considerable stress, and the officers have been working under pressure. I am afraid I have not strictly observed the eight hours' principle myself.

T think it would be a great disappointment to those who have laboured in the interests of federation to find that while as regards customs, one of our chief objects was to abolish the troublesome Inter-State duties, and consequently dispense with the officers necessary to give effect to them, we were at the same time called upon for such further outlay that there would be no saving in connection with the establishment. 1 am very hopeful that just as we are emerging from a time of pressure, so also are the officers of the department. I have already provided that those who have worked considerable overtime shall be rewarded by holidays altogether in excess of those they have usually enjoyed. We may yet have to consider whether anything further is necessary in that respect. Honourable members may rely upon this : that as regards the effective, prompt, and impartial administration of the department, aud as regards its administration within the lines laid down by/law, no pains shall be spared to attain all that is rightly desired by this honourable House.

ThisB ill follows much upon the lines of the Customs Bill to which we have just given our assent We propose to call it "" the Excise Tariff of 1902."" We propose to provide for the incorporation of the necessary machinery Bills, and to define "" T a r if f "" and "" T a r if f alteration."" We propose to declare the time of the imposition of uniform duties of excise in the same way in which we declared the imposition of uniform duties of customs. We provide that duties of excise shall be levied as from the time of the imposition of uniform duties of excise or from such later dates as are mentioned in the schedule in regard to any particular items. We provide that the duties shall be collected upon(a) All goods dutiable under the schedule aud manufactured or produced in Australia after the time when such duties are deemed to have been imposed : and (1/) All goods dutiable under the schedule mid manufactured or produced in Australia before the time such duties are deemed to have been imposed, and which were at that time subject to the control of the Customs, or to excise supervision, or in the stock, custody, or possession of, or belonging to any brewer, distiller, manufacturer, refiner thereof, and on which DO duty of customs or excise had been paid before the time when such duties are deemed to have been imposed. Then, in clause 6, we validate the prior collection of duties, and in clause 7 we deal with a matter which was brought under our notice by the honourable member for North Sydney, in relation to substitutes for dutiable goods. is altogether original. It is based upon the principle of the substitute clause contained in the Customs Act, with a little alteration. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. In CommitteeCluuse i-(Tim e of imposition of uniform duties of excise.) worth) I should like to ask a question which has cropped up during our recent debate. There will be an amount payable in the way of rebate to sugar planters who use white labour. Out of what' fund will that money be paid 1 W ill it be paid out of the excise fund, or out of the general revenue ? the amount of duty collected. I imagino that the procedure would be to hold a certain amount in suspense, but I should prefer that the Treasurer answered the question. Sir EDWARDBRAPDON (Tasmania). -The Attorney-General said that the payment of the rebate would be legalized by a clause in this Bill. Did he refer to clause 6? ticularly by that part of the schedule which deals with sugar. There is no repayment. What is done is to collect the duty less the rebate. Clause agreed to.
