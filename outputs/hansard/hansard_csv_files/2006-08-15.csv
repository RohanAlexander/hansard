In providing SPBs, Australia Post will give preference to locating them at: regional and strip shopping centres; commercial estates; well used railway stations and transport interchange points; universities; and areas such as CBDs where heavy postings can be anticipated. In rural towns and communities, a SPB will be provided at or near postal outlets. Additional factors to be considered in site selection include: safe access, including good street lighting for customers and Post employees/contractors clearing SPBs; traffic restrictions and local/State laws and/or regulations; customer access to nearby posting facilities; and community views/needs. Consideration will be given to the provision of SPBs in special cases to cater for the needs of concentrations of aged and disabled people, including hospitals. (b) and (c) In relocating and removing SPBs, the policy states: From time to time consideration may need to be given to relocation or removal of individual SPBs where, for example: safety factors for either customers or Australia Post staff have changed and the continued provision of the SPB is considered dangerous (eg changed road conditions or changed traffic flows); the location of the SPB is or has become contrary to Australian Road Rules; the average amount of mail posted per day is less than 25 items and an alternative SPB is available; a postal outlet is relocated; or ongoing vandalism is a problem. Where a SPB is considered for possible relocation or removal, a comprehensive consultation process will be undertaken to ensure community views or special needs are taken into account. Specifically, the local Federal Member and businesses likely to use the SPB will be advised of the proposal and the rationale; other users of the SPB will be informed via a sign on the SPB for a minimum of 30 days a paid advertisement in the local newspaper. any concerns will be discussed with respondents and the local Federal MP; and once a decision has been made, the local Federal MP, businesses and respondents will be advised accordingly, including the reasons for the decision. Other users will be informed of the outcome by means of a paid advertisement in the local newspaper. No relocation/removal action will commence until the consultative process is completed and the decision endorsed by senior management. In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary to expedite the relocation of a street posting box for emergency or safety reasons (e.g. changed traffic conditions). In such cases, local residents/businesses would be appropriately informed. A general notice would also be placed in the local newspaper. (3) (a) to (c) In late 2006, the Riverwood Post Office (2210) will relocate to the Riverwood Plaza Shopping Centre. The gold SPB currently located outside the post office and the red SPB currently located on the corner of Belmore and Cairns Roads, will be relocated to outside the shopping centre. Australia Post (Question No. 3412) Ms Grierson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 30 March 2006: (1) How does Australia Post report to the Australian people on whether it is meeting its performance standards under its Community Service Obligations, as set out in s. 27 of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989.

The ANAO report is included in Australia Post’s annual report. (2) Yes, but not to the level of detail referred to in the question. Australia Post has advised that it’s Customer Contact Centre (CCC) can identify callers by postcode, but not in relation to suburb (because some suburbs share a postcode) or by federal electorate. The calls can be in relation to any of Australia Post’s products, services or operations, and do not relate solely to complaints.

The whole focus in 2002 was preserving Australia’s wheat sales and that is what the Government legitimately did and at no stage did we come across any evidence that there were bribes being paid”. The Government acted promptly to establish an open and transparent inquiry into Australian companies named in the United Nations Independent Inquiry Committee final report. The Government has cooperated fully with the Inquiry.

Australian Wheat Board (Question No. 3415) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 9 May 2006: In respect of his comment on 31 January 2006 that his suggestion that AWB maintain close contact with his Government showed he was doing his job, can he explain how he did not know AWB was paying bribes to Saddam Hussein and breaching UN sanctions if he had been maintaining close contact with AWB. The Government acted promptly to establish an open and transparent inquiry into Australian companies named in the United Nations Independent Inquiry Committee final report.

Telecommunications Industry (Question No. 3426) Mr Laurie Ferguson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, in writing, on 9 May 2006: (1) Is the international call cards (telephone cards) industry regulated; if so, which agency is responsible. (2) Is the Government aware of any unscrupulous operators in the market place. (3) Is there a minimum standard of disclosure required of retailers who sell the cards. (4) Are consumers able to make formal complaints to an agency; if so, to which agency and how. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) For the purposes of section 87 of the Telecommunications Act 1997 (the Telecommunications Act) phone card providers are considered as carriage service providers and as such must comply with service provider rules set out in the Telecommunications Act and instruments made under it. As an eligible carriage service provider for the purposes of section 127 of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999, a phone card provider must also join the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman (TIO) scheme. The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has the power to direct phone card providers to comply with an industry code that has been registered under section 117 of the Telecommunications Act and applies to these providers. Phone card service providers are also subject to the provisions of the Trade Practices Act 1974 and state and territory fair trading legislation. (2) The TIO’s annual report for 2004-05 indicates that the TIO received 463 complaints about phone cards, including international phone cards, during this financial year. The report also stated that the TIO had completed systemic investigations into three phone card companies in April 2005. Following the investigation, one of these companies was formally referred to the then Australian Communications Authority (ACA) for possible breaches of the Billing Code, developed by the industry under the auspices of the Australian Communications Industry Forum (ACIF). The TIO stated that two other companies were informally referred to the ACA for possible breaches of registered codes, including the Customer Information on Prices, Terms and Conditions code and the Complaint Handling code. ACMA has advised that it contacted all state based consumer affairs and fair trading agencies towards the end of 2005 to gauge the extent of complaints against phone card companies. ACMA advised that all agencies reported very low levels of complaint about calling cards, with up to two inquiries per quarter. (3) Retailers of phone cards are considered to be carriage service providers or their agents. Phone card service providers must therefore ensure that they or their agents provide information at the point of sale consistent with the requirements of the Customer Information on Prices, Terms and Conditions code. The Customer Information on Prices, Terms and Conditions code specifies the minimum requirements for carriage service providers to meet when informing customers about the prices, terms and conditions of their products. The code rules apply to information given by providers in advertisements, at the point of sale, in any contract the customer enters into, and on an ongoing basis while",131,Questions In Writing
195,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Artsthe customer uses the products. The code also requires that information be provided to customers in a form that is readily accessible, legible and capable of being understood. Retailers of mobile phone cards are also subject to the Trade Practices Act 1974 and state or territory fair trading legislation. (4) Consumers may complain to various agencies, depending on the nature of the complaint. As stated above, phone card service providers must be members of the TIO Scheme and are bound by the TIO’s determinations. The TIO is an ‘office of last resort’ in that consumers must have sought unsuccessfully to resolve their complaint directly with the provider before the TIO will investigate. Complaints can be lodged with the TIO by phone, fax, email or post. The freecall number is 1800 062 058 and freefax number is 1800 630 614. Where a consumer considers that the phone card service provider has breached the telecommunications legislation, a complaint could be lodged with the communications regulator, ACMA. Such a complaint could be lodged by phone, fax, email or post. ACMA’s phone number is (03) 9963 6800. Consumers may contact the ACCC to inquire about the application of the Trade Practices Act by telephoning 1300 302 502. Alternatively, consumers may lodge a complaint with the fair trading agency in the relevant state or territory. Defence Homes Insurance Scheme (Question No. 3433) Mr Price asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 9 May 2006: (1) Is the Government reviewing the Defence Homes Insurance Scheme; if so, (a) what are the review’s terms of reference, (b) who is conducting the review, and (c) when will the review be finalised.

Australian Taxation Office (Question No. 3449) Mr Fitzgibbon asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 9 May 2006: (1) Will he explain why the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) is outsourcing its debt collection. (2) How does outsourced debt collection compare to the debt collection practices previously followed by the ATO. (3) What does the Government expect to achieve by this change. (4) Is it the case that ATO workers who were previously responsible for debt collection received overtime when engaged on this work; if so, are staff who formally received overtime now not receiving overtime. (5) Have any ATO staff (a) lost their jobs and (b) been redeployed to another department or agency as a result of the outsourcing of debt collection, (6) What is the net financial benefit the Commonwealth expects as a result of the ATO’s outsourcing of debt collection compared to the previous arrangements. (1) The ATO has implemented a number of debt collection strategies over recent years including the Small Business Debt Assistance Initiative. Outsourcing some debt collection activities has extended the ATO’s capacity to contact more taxpayers with an outstanding tax debt. The pilot was conducted from 7 April 2006 until 30 June 2006. (2) The pilot project to refer debt collection activity to an external service provider is being used in addition to current ATO debt collection practices. It is one of a number of new strategies to collect outstanding tax debt and is an attempt to engage with taxpayers who have long outstanding obligations.

Community Development Employment Project (Question No. 3466) Ms George asked the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, in writing, on 9 May 2006: (1) In respect of the new guidelines for the Community Development Employment Project (CDEP) program effective from 1 July 2006, will the CDEP receive participant wages in advance for a specified period of time to enable the resourcing of appropriate training programs for young participants on the new youth participant rates. (2) Should a young participant commence training and subsequently leave the CDEP program, will the Government provide funding to pay for the balance of the training program. (3) In respect of the requirement that CDEP activity supervisors’ wages be funded from activity fees and not CDEP wage funds, what impact will this change have on (a) the ability of the CDEP to fund training programs, workers compensation and insurance costs and (b) supervisors who are currently on the CDEP whose local organisation is unable to provide full time employment. (4) What is the reason for limiting the participation of new participants in urban and regional areas to a maximum of 52 weeks in the CDEP. (5) What is the current unemployment rate for Indigenous Australians in (a) urban, (b) regional, and (c) remote areas. (6) Can he say what the rates of unemployment in part (5) would be if participants in current CDEP programs were registered as unemployed. (7) With the introduction of time limits for new participants, is it the Government’s intention to close the CDEP program in urban and regional areas.",136,Questions In Writing
199,Mr Dutton,The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:,137,Questions In Writing
200,Mr Dutton,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(8) What proportion of Indigenous Job Network participants gained full-time and long-term employment in (a) 2000, (b) 2001, (c) 2002, (d) 2003, (e) 2004, (f) 2005, and (g) 2006. (1) Most CDEP organisations will continue to receive wages in advance on a quarterly basis. However, there may be situations where organisations do not manage their funds appropriately, in which case those organisations may receive funding monthly rather than quarterly. The decision about the frequency of fund releases is made on an individual basis depending on the circumstances. (2) CDEP organisations should take account of funds likely to be available before purchasing training and should ensure that participants complete training wherever possible. Organisations should also consider working with Job Network members who may be able to assist in the cost of training for participants who are registered with the Job Network. (3) (a) The change to supervisor fees that comes into effect from 1 July 2006 will have no effect on training programs, workers compensation and insurance costs which are paid from Activity Fees. The estimated amounts for these expenses have been included by the CDEP organisation in the funding submission. (b) During the negotiation process DEWR and the CDEP organisation will agree on the number of supervisors required by a CDEP organisation and the Activity Fee amount will be changed to reflect the agreed amount for supervisor wages. As with other employers, CDEP organisations have the discretion to employ people full time or part time in supervisory positions. (4) Indigenous communities have called for CDEP to be utilised as a stepping stone rather than a destination. In urban and regional areas in particular there are many job opportunities and support services to assist CDEP participants in the transition to employment off CDEP. For this reason time limits for new participants have been introduced in urban and regional areas. CDEP participants who are subject to time limits will also be required to register with a Job Network member who can provide participants with job search support and other services while they gain valuable work experience and skills through CDEP. (5) The most recent reliable data on Indigenous unemployment by region is the 2001 Census. The 2001 Census reported that the Indigenous unemployment rate was (a) 20.1 per cent in major cities, (b) 24 per cent in regional areas and (c) 11.9 per cent in remote locations. In the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Health Survey released in April 2006, the ABS estimated an Indigenous unemployment rate in 2004-05 at 15.4 per cent, compared with 22.9 per cent in the 2002 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey, which was the most recent comparable survey. (6) I can not comment as CDEP participants may be either counted as unemployed or employed depending on how the person self-identifies. (7) I have publicly stated that I am committed to the future of CDEP with an emphasis on obtaining employment for Indigenous Australians. For Indigenous Australians to obtain mainstream employment, participation in the CDEP programme is not the only option. CDEP is part of a range of programmes to assist unemployed people. Organisations with expertise in assisting Indigenous job seekers also have the option of tendering to provide other employment or employment related services. (8) Information about post labour market assistance outcomes achieved for employment services managed by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations (DEWR) are published quarterly in the Labour Market Assistance Outcomes (LMAO) reports. These reports are available on the Australian Workplace website using the following link: http://www.workplace.gov.au/workplace/ Category/Publications/ProgrammeEvaluation/LabourMarketAssistanceOutcomes.htm",137,Questions In Writing
201,Mr Andrews,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:The Labour Market Assistance Outcomes reports are based on the Post-Programme Monitoring (PPM) surveys conducted by DEWR. The PPM surveys measure job seekers’ outcomes three months after they have left assistance. PPM survey results are an estimate of outcomes levels based on responses from a sample of clients rather than the full population. Outcomes estimates for Indigenous clients who participated in various forms of employment assistance delivered through Job Network are shown in Tables1 to 5. The results relate to clients whose outcomes were measured in the year ending December each year unless otherwise specified. Tables 1-5 include (a) the total proportion in employment and (b) the proportions in (i) full-time and (ii) part-time employment three months after exiting placements. The delivery of Job Network services under Employment Services Contract two ceased on 30 June 2003. From1 July 2003, improvements to the delivery of Job Network services were introduced through implementation of the Active Participation Model (APM). Data are not available for calendar year 2003 because of the introduction of new programmes associated with the APM. Results for the employment services provided under the APM have progressively become available. Reliable outcomes estimates cannot be produced until a sufficient number of clients have received assistance and subsequently been surveyed. Results for Intensive Support job search training have been published since the June 2004 edition of the Labour Market Assistance Outcomes. Intensive Support customised assistance outcome results have been published since September 2004, and outcomes for the Intensive Support stream of assistance since December 2004. Outcomes results for 2006 are scheduled for release in the second quarter of 2007.

(2) For (a) 2002-2003, (b) 2003-2004, and (c) 2004-2005, what were the itemised sums of foreign aid spent on law and order and governance programs in each country which received Australian aid for these purposes. (3) For (a) 2002-2003, (b) 2003-2004, and (c) 2004-2005, which law and order and governance programs were delivered as part of an Australian Government contribution to efforts by international agencies such as the United Nations. (1) The Australian Government spent the following on foreign aid, referred to as Official Development Assistance (ODA): (a) 2002-2003, $A 1830.8 million (b) 2003-2004, $A 1973.1 million (c) 2004-2005, $A 2198.1 million (2) Governance represents one of the key sectors for how Australia’s aid program is delivered and reported upon, and expenditure on law and order is within the governance sector. For the purposes of this response, law and order has been calculated to include expenditure on all activities in the Legal and Judicial Development category and the Narcotics Control category; and relevant activities under the following categories; Government Administration, Economic and Development Planning, Post Conflict Peace Building, Human Rights, Business Services, and Trade Policy and Administrative Management. For example, law and order activities across a number of these categories would be part of the Regional Assistance Mission to the Solomon Islands (RAMSI) and the Enhanced Cooperation Program (ECP) with PNG. Following is a breakdown of Australia’s ODA expenditure on governance per country for the financial years 2002-2003, 2003-2004 and 2004-2005. Included within this breakdown is the estimated sub-total of the governance sector that represents expenditure on law and order. 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 Cook Islands Governance $442,499.92 $417,863.76 $812,802.79 of which, Law and Order accounts for $0.00 $0.00 $256,342.19 Fiji Governance $5,214,180.88 $7,195,154.64 $12,552,249.71 of which, Law and Order accounts for $768,918.37 $4,193,832.51 $6,283,688.40 Kiribati Governance $2,659,408.93 $3,251,622.76 $2,432,070.69 of which, Law and Order accounts for $0.00 $15,891.00 $242,464.74 Marshall Islands Governance $604,480.80 $725,716.85 $910,854.21 of which, Law and Order accounts for $0.00 $0.00 $282,875.53 Micronesia, Fed.

(2) Can he confirm that an attempt was made to contact the Australian Embassy in China, that there was no answer, and the call was automatically transferred to Canberra. (3) Will he provide details of the measures the Australian Government took to assist Mr Gribble. (4) Is he satisfied that everything Australian officials could have done to assist Mr Gribble was done; if so, will he explain why; if not, will an investigation be made. (5) What policy and procedures are in place to prevent this from occurring to Australians working overseas in the future. (1) No. In response to the department’s inquiry, the hospital has advised that Mr Gribble was treated as an emergency patient as soon as he arrived by ambulance at 3.35am local time on 4 February. (2) No. The department’s Consular Emergency Centre (CEC) in Canberra has no record of a call being transferred from China to the CEC seeking assistance for Mr Gribble. (3) Immediately following advice from Mr Gribble’s family that he had been admitted to a hospital in Fuzhou, the CEC tasked our Consulate General in Guangzhou to assist him. Less than an hour later, however, the CEC was advised by the family that he had died. (4) Yes (also see response to 3).",140,Questions In Writing
203,Mr Downer,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(5) The hospital in Fuzhou has advised that Mr Gribble was not refused medical treatment. Notwithstanding this, the department provides travel advice to Australians on health and local conditions overseas. Our advisory for China notes that “the standard of medical care…in China is often limited and that hospitals and doctors often require cash payment, prior to providing medical services, including for emergency care”. Airservices Australia (Question No. 3494) Mr Rudd asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 10 May 2006: (1) What sum did Airservices Australia receive in (a) 2001-2002, (b) 2002-2003, (c) 2003-2004, (d) 2004-2005, and (e) 2005-2006 from (i) the Commonwealth budget and (ii) fees for services to industry. (2) When will budget funding for Airservices Australia next be reviewed? (3) When was the decision made to redirect all aircraft noise complaints to Sydney? (4) Will he explain the basis on which the decision to redirect all aircraft noise complaints to Sydney was made and what community consultation took place prior to this decision being made? (1) ($000’s) ($000’s) ($000’s) ($000’s) ($000’s) What sum did Airservices 2001-02 2002-03 2003-04 2004-05 2005-06 Australia receive in: from (i) the Commonwealth $7,000 $7,000 $7,000 $7,000 $0 budget from (ii) fees for services to $478,293 $496,729 $537,290 $614,417 $661,030 industry Note: the 2005/06 amount is the full year forecast as at 30 April 2006 (2) Airservices Australia is not a Commonwealth budget funded agency. All revenue, with the exception of the $7 million per annum provided in the financial years 2001-02 to 2004-05 for the Location Specific Pricing Subsidy, comes from the aviation industry at prices reviewed by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. (3) The Airservices Australia Board approved consolidation of the Noise Enquiry Service on Friday 26 November 2004. (4) I am advised that consolidation of the Noise Enquiry units to a central location has allowed improved services to be provided by the use of dedicated staff, specifically trained and solely committed to the noise enquiry function. This has enhanced the efficiency and effectiveness of the services to the major airports and their community stakeholders, while also providing a cost saving to the aviation industry. I am advised that Airservices Australia met with the affected airport operators and the airports discussing the proposal with their respective noise abatement committees. Airservices Australia representatives attended the airport noise abatement committee meetings. Additionally, where requested, Airservices Australia provided presentations to local noise abatement committees about the proposal. Most of the consultative meetings were held in February and March 2005.",145,Questions In Writing

206,Mr Nairn,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(b) $3,900 in the Division of Blaxland; and (c) $4,200 in the Division of Fowler. The costs are for: attendance at community meetings within these divisions by Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) staff specific posters in appropriate languages at polling places addressing the formality requirements the production and distribution of reminder sheets to Issuing Officers in all polling places in these divisions, and the production, distribution and display of videos in the applicable languages for electors in identified polling places. The costs do not include the selection of polling place staff with appropriate language skills, as this was not considered to be an additional resource. (2) Videos shown were a continuous tape that included an explanation of the process of voting in both the identified language and in English: (a) there were 13 polling places in the Division of Reid showing videos, 11 polling places with an Arabic/English video and 2 polling places with a Cantonese/English video; (b) there were 10 polling places in the Division of Blaxland showing videos, 10 polling places with an Arabic/English video of which 2 polling places also showed a Vietnamese/English video; and (c) there were 29 polling places in the Division of Fowler showing videos, 21 polling places with a Vietnamese/English video, 7 polling places with an Arabic/English video and 1 polling place with a Spanish/English video. (3) (a), (b) and (c). Community Meetings As part of the AEC’s Communication Strategy for electors from a non-English speaking background for the 2004 federal election, the AEC conducted community meetings with representatives from local ethnic communities at Migrant Resource Centres in southwestern Sydney. Community meetings were held at Auburn, Blacktown, Cabramatta, Canterbury-Bankstown and Parramatta. Issuing Officer Reminder Sheets Issuing Officer Reminder Sheets were developed for New South Wales and Queensland in relation to concerns that the use of optional preferential voting in recent state and local government elections in those states, as well as the option for voting “above the line” on the Senate ballot paper, would impact adversely on formality. They were printed in seven languages – Greek, Arabic, Italian, Spanish, Vietnamese, Farsi and Chinese as well as English. Issuing Officers in polling places in the three divisions used the sheets to reinforce the message on how to vote formal. Formality Posters Formality posters in relation to voting for the House of Representatives and the Senate were produced in English and in 18 languages: (a) the Division of Reid had formality posters (A3 and A4 colour) in Greek, Arabic, Italian, Spanish, Vietnamese, Farsi and Chinese displayed in all polling places; (b) the Division of Blaxland identified ten polling places and displayed A3 size formality posters in English, Arabic and Vietnamese and a sample of other languages in these polling places; and (c) the Division of Fowler had full sets of formality posters (A3 and A4 colour) for both the House of Representatives and Senate displayed in all polling places. These posters were displayed around the polling place, with some polling places displaying full sets of the posters outside the polling place so electors could refer to them whilst queuing. ‘Number Every Box’ Poster As part of a national initiative, an A3 Number Every Box (House of Representatives) Poster (in English) was developed and distributed to all states. Every electoral division was supplied with enough posters for 2 posters to be displayed in every pre-poll voting centre and polling place. All polling places in the Divisions of Reid, Blaxland and Fowler displayed these posters. Polling Place Staffing All polling places were provided with Enquiry Officers. Some polling places were provided with additional staff employed as interpreters. People employed in the Enquiry Officer positions were specifically chosen for their ability to offer a second language. Each Enquiry Officer was provided with a non-laminated set of the multilingual formality posters.

Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) All education authorities have had significant notice of the Australian Government’s intention to require them to implement plain English student reports in 2006. The Australian Government appreciates the efforts of education authorities and schools, and will closely monitor implementation of plain English student reports by all education authorities. (2) The Department of Education, Science and Training (DEST) consulted government and nongovernment education authorities and key national stakeholders, including parents and principals organisations, on arrangements for the new funding quadrennium and the Regulations to the Schools Assistance (Learning Together– Achievement Through Choice and Opportunity) Act 2004 (‘the Act’) throughout 2004 and 2005. (3) Research commissioned by the Australian Government, as well as the Minister’s consultations with parents, teachers and community members, have shown that parents want to receive report cards written in plain language that show their child’s achievement relative to objective standards and relative to the achievement of other students in the class. (4) A-E grades (or equivalent) must be defined against specific learning standards. Determination of these standards is a matter for schools and education authorities. Parents need to know whether their child has achieved well above, above, at, below, or well below the standard expected for their year. An A-E (or equivalent) grading system provides parents with this information for all areas of learning. It is a system that most parents understand and readily identify with, so that they can determine where they need to support their child’s learning and development. (5) DEST has not issued advice that it would be unlikely that eighty percent of students would score higher than a C grade. Provision of A-E grades (or equivalent) is a useful way for parents to identify there may be a problem, however parents have a choice and may wish to withdraw their child from comparative reporting or assessment conditions. (6) Tying the requirement to provide parents with plain English student reports to funding for schools is a mechanism for the Australian Government to enhance the accountability of schools and education authorities and demonstrate its commitment to supporting parents in their vital role as partners with schools in their children’s education. (7) It is intended that the new reporting requirements suit the needs of individual school communities and their children and allow schools and systems to build on their existing reporting practices. The principles for student reports set out in the Act include that they deal with both a child’s academic and non-academic learning. Pensions and Benefits (Question No. 3571) Ms Owens asked the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 24 May 2006: (1) How many people in (a) Australia, (b) NSW, (c) the electoral division of Parramatta, and in the postcode area (d) 2115, (e) 2116, (f) 2117, (g) 2118, (h) 2142, (i) 2145, (j) 2146, (k) 2150, (l) 2151, (m) 2152, and (n) 2153, are recipients of the (i) Aged Pension, (ii) Disability Support Pension, (iii) Carer Allowance, (iv) Newstart Allowance, (v) Youth Allowance, (vi) Parenting Payment Single, (vii) Parenting Payment Partnered, (viii) Family Tax Benefit A, (ix) Family Tax Benefit B, (x) Child care Benefit, and (xi) Rent Assistance.

Global Environment Facility (Question No. 3581) Mr Sercombe asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in writing, on 29 May 2006: (1) Is it the case that the Global Environment Facility (GEF) was founded in 1991 as one of the outcomes of the Rio Earth Summit and is the key multilateral mechanism for financing environmental protection in developing countries and does the GEF facilitate projects covering climate change, international waters, biodiversity, ozone protection, land degradation and persistent toxic chemicals. (2) Are negotiations on the replenishment of the GEF’s finances at a crucial stage ahead of a meeting scheduled for 5 June 2006 (World Environment Day) at which the replenishment of GEF finances is expected to be finalised.",153,Questions In Writing
216,Mr Hockey,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(3) Can he confirm that the United States of America has foreshadowed a reduction in its contribution by almost half; if so, (a) has the Australian Government, as a donor country to the GEF, expressed a view to the United States concerning the reduction in its contribution and (b) what influence can the Australian Government bring to bear so that the United States does not reduce its support for the GEF. (4) Does the Australian Government intend to act with other donors to make up all or part of the shortfall in funding for the GEF if the United States reduces its contribution and burden sharing provisions are invoked; if not, does the Australian Government intend to contribute the difference between its reduced burden sharing contribution and the contribution budgeted for full replenishment to an alternative fund or to other global environmental work. (1) Yes. (2) Preliminary pledging for the GEF 4th Replenishment took place in Washington on 5 June 2006. The 4th Replenishment is now expected to be finalised in August 2006. (3) Until the replenishment is finalised, respective country positions cannot be commented on definitively. (4) As the replenishment process has not yet been finalised, Australia’s position remains open to negotiation. Humanitarian Law Training (Question No. 3584) (1) Will he provide details of the humanitarian law training given to East Timorese troops by the Australian military during its first deployment to East Timor. (2) Will he outline the institution-building aspects of its original reconstruction program which assisted the East Timorese to develop a legislative framework for their security services and build an apolitical, legally restrained Defence Force. (3) What institution-building and humanitarian law instruction is the ADF in Al-Muthanna providing to the Iraqi personnel it is training. (4) Will he provide an outline of the overall plan to assist the Iraqis in developing a stable legal and practical framework for their Defence Forces in order to avoid similar problems to those now being faced in East Timor. (1) During the lead up to the first Timorese elections (2002), the United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor (UNTAET) appointed Falantil troops to assist in providing local security for these elections. These soldiers received basic training in orders for opening fire and detention procedures. This training was authorised by UNTAET’s Office of Defence Force Development and Australian Defence Force personnel assisted in delivering this training. (2) Defence was not responsible for developing a legislative framework for the Timor-Leste security forces. This framework was developed by the United Nations and the transitional Government of Timor-Leste. On1 February 2001, Falintil officially became Falintil-Forca de Defensa Timor-Leste (F-FDTL). As a response, the Defence Cooperation Program with Timor-Leste was established in 2001. It has assisted Timor-Leste to build a modest, affordable and sustainable defence force. Australia has spent approximately $42 million on the Defence Cooperation Program with TimorLeste.",154,Questions In Writing

219,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:As part of the Program, Australia has provided civilian advisers within the Timor-Leste Ministry of Defence on budgetary issues and defence policy. Policy advice has sought to link military planning to Government policy, endeavouring to ensure F-FDTL is apolitical. (3) The Australian Army Training Team in Al Muthanna has provided classroom instruction, demonstrations, seminars, one-on-one counselling and mentoring on detainee management, the law of armed conflict, human rights, the rules of engagement and orders for opening fire to the Iraqi Army 2nd Brigade, 10th Division. (4) A United States Department of Defense organisation, Multi National Transitional Command– Iraq, has overall responsibility for planning to train, mentor and equip the Iraqi Armed Forces and Police Forces. As part of this command, Australia provides Australian Defence Force advisers to the Iraqi Joint Headquarters and Defence civilian advisers to the Iraqi Ministry of Defence. These advisers provide advice to Iraqi defence officials on subjects including personnel, infrastructure, training, capability, governance and strategic policy. Defence has provided training for Iraqi defence officials in subjects including the law of armed conflict, emergency management, defence and civilmilitary cooperation. Cancer Treatment (Question No. 3586) Mr Windsor asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, in writing, on 30 May 2006: (1) Will he outline what research, if any, is being done in Australia on the ‘Cyber knife’ technique for cancer treatment. (2) Will he outline what the process is for having the treatment made available in Australia. (3) Should research into the ‘Cyber knife’ technique for cancer treatment produce positive results, how long will it be before Australians will be able to access this treatment in Australia. (4) Would he advise of the current status of the cancer treatment drug laetrile. (5) Why does access to laetrile require the completion of a TGA Special Access Scheme CategoryA Form, when there is evidence that it may reduce some forms of cancer. (6) Given that many people who have accessed laetrile through the TGA process believe that it has assisted in their battles with cancer, why can laetrile not be prescribed by a doctor, even if it is not eligible for subsidy under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. (1) The National Health and Medical Research Council has not received any applications or requests for funding, and is not presently funding any research into the ‘Cyber knife’ technique for cancer treatment. (2) The product is a medical device and the product sponsor must make application for entry of the device onto the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) prior to supply in Australia. Entry onto the ARTG is dependent upon assessment by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) that the manufacturer holds appropriate evidence of compliance with quality system requirements for the manufacture and evidence to demonstrate quality, safety and performance of the device. (3) Timeframes for the TGA approval process are dependent upon the type of certification held by the manufacturer; if appropriate overseas certification is held, the process would normally take a matter of weeks. If the device requires certification by the TGA, because appropriate overseas certification is not available, the time-frame could be 6 – 9 months, dependent upon the manufacturer’s level of documentation and compliance with manufacturing standards.",155,Questions In Writing
220,Mr Abbott,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Access to the technology through Medicare is dependent upon the procedure being assessed by the Medical Services Advisory Committee and re-imbursement through private health funds is dependent upon assessment by the Prostheses and Devices Committee. (4) Before a prescription medicine can be marketed in Australia, it needs to be included in the ARTG. In order to register a new medicine in Australia a sponsor (usually a pharmaceutical company) needs to submit an application together with extensive supporting data to the TGA. The TGA evaluates the application to assess the quality, safety and effectiveness of the product when used as intended. The TGA also usually seeks the advice of an independent expert advisory committee, the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, before making a decision to approve or reject an application. Laetrile is not registered in Australia. For laetrile to be marketed in Australia, a sponsor would have to make a marketing application to the TGA and supply relevant quality, safety and efficacy data to satisfactorily support its proposed use. (5) There are provisions available under the Therapeutic Goods Act 1989, whereby patients may obtain access to unregistered medicines where such use is required. These provisions include supply of the drug under the Special Access Scheme (SAS) or for clinical trials, and personal importation. Under CategoryA of the SAS, a medical practitioner may notify the TGA of their intention to supply an unregistered drug to a patient who is terminally or seriously ill with a life-threatening condition. The import of Laetrile is restricted under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956. Its import into Australia therefore requires an import permit. An import permit can be issued by an officer of the TGA once an SAS CategoryA notification is received from a doctor. It should be noted that the TGA considers the use of unregistered medicines to be experimental, and people wishing to use these products should bear in mind that no assurance can be given regarding their quality, safety or effectiveness. Patients should discuss the use of any unregistered medicines with their medical practitioner to determine whether such a medicine is suitable for them. Medical practitioners using unregistered medicines need to recognise that there may be medico-legal and ethical implications, including the need for informed consent. (6) See (4) above. Laetrile, via CategoryA of the SAS, has been “prescribed” by doctors in Australia. The drug is sourced from overseas and the TGA assists with import permission if an exemption avenue such as the SAS CategoryA has been used by the prescribing doctor. Nuclear Waste Repository (Question No. 3591) Mr Albanese asked the Prime Minister, in writing, on 31 May 2006: Will he rule out locating a high level nuclear waste repository in the federal electoral division of (i) Adelaide, (ii) Aston, (iii) Ballarat, (iv) Banks, (v) Barker, (vi) Barton, (vii) Bass, (viii) Batman, (ix) Bendigo, (x) Bennelong, (xi) Berowra, (xii) Blair, (xiii) Blaxland, (xiv) Bonner, (xv) Boothby, (xvi) Bowman, (xvii) Braddon, (xviii) Bradfield, (xix) Brand, (xx) Brisbane, (xxi) Bruce, (xxii) Calare, (xxiii) Calwell, (xxiv) Canberra, (xxv) Canning, (xxvi) Capricornia, (xxvii) Casey, (xxviii) Charlton, (xxix) Chifley, (xxx) Chisholm, (xxxi) Cook, (xxxii) Corangamite, (xxxiii) Corio, (xxxiv) Cowan, (xxxv) Cowper, (xxxvi) Cunningham, (xxxvii) Curtin, (xxxviii) Dawson, (xxxix) Deakin, (xl) Denison, (xli) Dickson, (xlii) Dobell, (xliii) Dunkley, (xliv) Eden-Monaro, (xlv) Fadden, (xlvi) Fairfax, (xlvii) Farrer, (xlviii) Fisher, (xlix) Flinders, (l) Forde, (li) Forrest, (lii) Fowler, (liii) Franklin, (liv) Fraser, (lv) Fremantle, (lvi) Gellibrand, (lvii) Gilmore, (lviii) Gippsland,(lvix) Goldstein, (lx) Gorton, (lxi) Grayndler, (lxii) Greenway, (lxiii) Grey, (lxiv) Griffith, (lxv) Groom, (lxvi) Gwydir, (lxvii) Hasluck, (lxviii) Herbert, (lxix) Higgins, (lxx) Hindmarsh, (lxxi) Hinkler, (lxxii) Holt, (lxxiii) Hotham, (lxxix) Hughes, (lxxx) Hume, (lxxxi) Hunter, (lxxxii) Indi, (lxxxiii) Isaacs, (lxxxiv) Jagajaga, (lxxxv) Kalgoorlie, (lxxxvi) Kennedy, (lxxxvii) Kingsford Smith, (lxxxviii) Kingston, (lxxxix) Kooyong, (xc) Lalor, (xci) La Trobe, (xcii) Leichhardt, (xciii) Lilley, (xciv) Lindsay, (xcv) Lingiari, (xcvi) Longman, (xcvii) Lowe, (xcviii) Lyne, (xcix) Lyons, (c) Macarthur, (ci) McEwen, (cii) Mackellar, (ciii) McMillan, (civ) McPherson, (cv) Macquarie, (cvi) Makin, (cvii) Mallee, (cviii) Maranoa, (cix) Maribyrnong, (cx) Mayo, (cxi) Melbourne, (cxii) Melbourne Ports, (cxiii) Menzies, (cxiv) Mitchell, (cxv) Moncrieff, (cxvi) Moore, (cxvii) Moreton, (cxviii) Murray, (cxv) New England, (cxvi) Newcastle, (cxvii) North Sydney, (cxviii) O’Connor, (cxix) Oxley, (cxx) Page, (cxxi) Parkes, (cxxii) Parramatta, (cxxiii) Paterson, (cxxiv) Pearce, (cxxv) Perth, (cxxvi) Petrie, (cxxvii) Port Adelaide, (cxxviii) Prospect, (cxxix) Rankin, (cxxx) Reid, (cxxxi) Richmond, (cxxxii) Riverina, (cxxxiii) Robertson, (cxxxiv) Ryan, (cxxxv) Scullin, (cxxxvi) Shortland, (cxxxvii) Solomon, (cxxxviii) Stirling, (cxxxix) Sturt, (cxl) Swan, (cxli) Sydney, (cxlii) Tangney, (cxliii) Throsby, (cxliv) Wakefield, (cxlv) Wannon, (cxlvi) Warringah, (cxlvii) Watson, (cxlviii) Wentworth, (cxlix) Werriwa, (cxlix) Wide Bay, (cl) Wills. I announced the Terms of Reference for the uranium mining, processing and nuclear energy review on 6 June 2006. The review will contribute to a wide ranging public debate on Australia’s future energy needs and the broad range of emerging energy technologies. The review will consider the following matters: Economic issues (a) The capacity for Australia to increase uranium mining and exports in response to growing global demand. (b) The potential for establishing other steps in the nuclear fuel cycle in Australia, such as fuel enrichment, fabrication and reprocessing, along with the costs and benefits associated with each step. (c) The extent and circumstances in which nuclear energy could in the longer term be economically competitive in Australia with other existing electricity generation technologies, including any implications this would have for the national electricity market. (d) The current state of nuclear energy research and development in Australia and the capacity for Australia to make a significantly greater contribution to international nuclear science. Environment issues (a) The extent to which nuclear energy will make a contribution to the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. (b) The extent to which nuclear energy could contribute to the mix of emerging energy technologies in Australia. Health, safety and proliferation issues (a) The potential of ‘next generation’ nuclear energy technologies to meet safety, waste and proliferation concerns. (b) The waste processing and storage issues associated with nuclear energy and current world’s best practice. (c) The security implications relating to nuclear energy. (d) The health and safety implications relating to nuclear energy. The terms of reference will provide for an informed and thorough examination of the issues surrounding nuclear energy.

221,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:well rounded, highly experienced and balanced Taskforce that will allow for an objective and highly professional review of the complex issues outlined in the terms of reference. The Taskforce will produce a draft report for public consultation in November 2006. A final report will be completed by the end of 2006. The Chief Scientist, Dr Jim Peacock, will support the review, including by facilitating a peer review of the scientific aspects of this review. When announcing the Taskforce, I said that the Commonwealth itself would not be constructing nuclear power stations, rather they are things that are likely to be constructed by the private sector and therefore the call to name where the power stations are going to be pre-supposes a large number of things. I also note that radioactive waste to be managed at the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Facility in the Northern Territory is low and intermediate level waste, not high level radioactive waste. The Facility will be neither designed nor licensed to receive such material. Nor will it be designed or licensed to receive radioactive waste produced by other countries. Furthermore, the Commonwealth Radioactive Waste Management Act 2005 specifically prohibits management of high level radioactive waste or spent nuclear fuel at the Facility. La Trobe and RMIT Universities (Question No. 3607) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister for Education, Science and Training, in writing, on Thursday, 1 June 2006: In respect of (a) La Trobe University, and (b) RMIT University – Bundoora Campus, will the Minister provide details of the impact upon student numbers or service delivery of (i) the recent Federal Budget and (ii) the Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-Front Student Union Fees) Act 2005. Ms Julie Bishop-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (i) Federal Budget (a) and (b) Capital Funding The Government announced in the 2006-07 Budget that it will be providing additional funding of $95.5 million over four years through the Capital Development Pool (CDP) programme to support higher education providers in developing up-to-date infrastructure for teaching and learning in areas that have high infrastructure needs. This represents a 50 per cent increase in the base funding available to the higher education sector through this programme, commencing in 2007. La Trobe University and RMIT University are eligible to apply for this funding in the next competitive round, for which applications will be called in 2006. Commonwealth Supported Places As part of the Australian Government’s contribution to the Council of Australian Governments health workforce and mental health packages, funded in the 2006-07 Budget, La Trobe University has been allocated 40 new Commonwealth supported higher education places (20 for nursing and 20 for mental health nursing) and RMIT has been allocated 5 places at its Bundoora campus for mental health nursing. All of these new places will commence in 2007. FEE-HELP The increase in the FEE-HELP limit as announced in the 2006-07 Budget may result in an increase in the number of domestic fee-paying students at La Trobe University and/or RMIT University Bundoora campus. (ii) Higher Education Support Amendment (Abolition of Compulsory Up-Front Student Union Fees) Act 2005 (a) and (b) An independent assessment, by an organisation chosen by tender, of the economic and other consequences of voluntary student unionism, will be conducted after 18 months of full implementation. To assist with the transition to voluntary student unionism, the Government has committed to a range of funding initiatives. For example, under the Voluntary Student Unionism Transition Fund $80 million will be available over three years commencing in 2007 for the maintenance and construction of sporting and recreational facilities. The Government also announced a $10 million fund to support small businesses on regional university campuses in the 2006-07 Budget. Australian Wheat Board (Question No. 3608) Ms Roxon asked the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs, in writing, on 1 June 2006: (1) In respect of the statement made in the House on 31 May 2006 by the Member for Wentworth, regarding a request from the Government of India for assistance in relation to an investigation involving AWB Limited, to the effect that: “The Attorney-General’s Department, on receiving the request from India, asked the Australian Federal Police to assist in responding to India’s request by obtaining witness statements and documents on a voluntary basis. The Attorney-General’s Department advised India of the Federal Police’s actions on the same day and made it clear they needed to provide Australia with more information for the AFP to be able to investigate further using coercive powers.”, from whom did the Australian Federal Police seek witness statements. (2) In respect of the investigation undertaken by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) into the matter referred to in part (1), (a) were witness statements provided by each of the people from whom they were requested; if not, by whom were witness statements not provided, (b) what were the contents of the witness statements provided, (c) what documents were obtained by the AFP, (d) what documents were sought by the AFP, but not obtained, and (e) were all witness statements and documents obtained by the AFP provided to the Government of India; if not, which statements or documents were not provided. (3) Apart from correspondence between the Attorney-General’s Department and the Government of India or its agents, was there any other communication between the Australian Government and the Government of India in relation to this matter; if so, what are the details of that communication. the honourable member’s question: (1) and (2) The Attorney-General has already made a number of public comments on the assistance Australia provided to India in response to its mutual assistance request (see attached press release). It is not appropriate for me to comment on specific operational matters such as who was spoken to and what was said. (3) I can comment on behalf of the Attorney-General’s portfolio. Apart from the Attorney-General’s Department, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) is the only other portfolio agency that has had communications with the Government of India in relation to this matter. In October 2000, the AFP received a police-to-police request from India, via Interpol, in relation to the same matter as the 2002 mutual assistance request. The AFP subsequently sought the information requested. In February 2001, the AFP replied, via Interpol, to the Indian Police providing the results of the inquiries conducted in response to the request.",158,Questions In Writing
222,Mr Ruddock,"The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to----------Media Release 095/2006 26 May 2006 Australian authorities cooperated fully with a mutual assistance request in relation to an Indian investigation into wheat sales, contrary to claims by the Labor Party, Attorney-General Philip Ruddock said today. In response to India's request, the Australian Federal Police (AFP) sought voluntary witness statements and asked for documents to be provided. Australia informed India of its actions and sought further information for the matter to proceed. The ball was then in India's court. They did not get back to us. If there is sufficient evidence concerning Australian offences, these would be assessed in accordance with normal Australian Federal Police (AFP) processes. As Senator Ellison confirmed at Senate Estimates yesterday: ""There was no evidence to warrant a domestic investigation into possible Australian offences"". Yet Labor seeks to deliberately distort this statement by suggesting it meant the AFP did not investigate when Australia was asked to assist the Indian Government. Labor should know the difference between assisting an Indian investigation in relation to corruption allegations against Indian officials and a domestic investigation into possible Australian offences. This is yet another example of Labor getting its facts wrong. It should let the Commissioner get on with his job, and wait for the outcome of his inquiry. Details of mutual assistance requests are usually confidential between the parties, but in this case it is important to correct the public record to make it abundantly clear the Australian Government did fully cooperate in this matter. The Attorney-General's Department has provided documents to the Cole Inquiry on a confidential basis so the Inquiry can decide whether they raise any issue of interest. Media Contact: Charlie McKillop, Attorney's Office (02) 9251 9303 Security Legislation Review Committee: Report (Question No. 3612) Mr Bevis asked the Attorney-General, in writing, on 1 June 2006: In respect of the appearance of an embargoed Security Legislation Review Committee’s report, or part thereof, in a Sydney Morning Herald article entitled “Ruddock rebuked over outlaw powers”, (a) has the matter been referred to the Australian Federal Police for investigation; if not, why not, and (b) will the outcome of any investigation be made public; if not, why not. (a) The article did not justify a conclusion that the report had been leaked as much of the article could have been based on publicly available material. In addition, the reporting in the article that purported to draw on the report did not, in fact, accurately portray the relevant recommendations. Accordingly, there was insufficient basis on which to refer the matter to the Australian Federal Police. (b) Not applicable.",160,Questions In Writing

(2) Of the frozen assets or economic resources associated with proscribed terrorist organisations, to which proscribed terrorist organisation did each belong. (1) There is only one case in which assets have been frozen under the Charter of the United Nations Act 1945 and the Charter of the United Nations (Terrorism and Dealing with Assets) Regulations 2002. On 27 August 2002, three bank accounts totalling $2196.99 were frozen. (2) The bank accounts were held by the International Sikh Youth Federation. Assets of a Melbourne record store called Shining Path were frozen by a financial institution in December 2001. Upon discovery that the assets did not belong to the Peruvian based terrorist organisation of the same name, the assets were unfrozen by the financial institution.

226,Mr Mcgauran,"The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the ArtsThe honourable member’s question primarily relates to public health issues and is therefore a matter for the Minister of Health and Ageing to address. However, I can inform Ms Ellis that the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA), within the Health and Ageing portfolio, has set a public health standard for exposure to electromagnetic energy (EME). The Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) has adopted the limits of this standard in its regulation of public exposure to EME emissions from mobile phones and mobile phone towers. Advice from ARPANSA is that the weight of national and international scientific opinion is that there is no substantiated evidence that EME emissions associated with living or working near a mobile phone base-station pose a health risk. current advice is that none of the recent reviews have concluded that exposure to EME emissions from mobile phones and their base-stations cause any adverse health consequences. sites will be audited each year. Sites will be selected across all the states. Audits will include the measurement of EME levels from mobile phone base-stations at sites where there is particular public concern. Individuals in Australia who believe they have suffered ill-effects as a result of exposure to EME can lodge a written complaint with ARPANSA to be put on the Electromagnetic Complaints Register. The Government provides $1 million each year to the Health and Ageing portfolio, from a levy on radiocommunication licences, for research into public health effects of EME emissions from radiocommunication devices, including mobile phones, and for a public education program. ACMA and ARPANSA have made available a Mobile Phone Towers and EME Information Pack to further address community concerns about EME. The pack contains Fact Sheets on EME, deployment of mobile phone towers, mobile phone handsets and associated health issues, and information for rural communities on telecommunications facilities.

(2) Does the Government plan to revise the rules that currently apply to prisoners captured by the Australian Defence Force, and which incorporate the principles of the Geneva Conventions. (3) Will he advise the United States that the Australian Government opposes any move to abandon basic international human rights standards from military law. (1) Yes. (2) No. The Australian Defence Force treats all detained persons humanely, with dignity and respect, and in accordance with Australia’s international obligations.

(1) The Australian Government contracts Volunteering Australia to deliver the VWI on a national basis. The contract has been signed for the continuation of the VWI for 2006-2007. Volunteering Australia sub-contracts VWI services through its national network of service delivery agencies. Volunteering Australia is currently finalising sub-contract negotiations with over 50 service delivery agencies nationally for the provision of VWI services for 2006-2007. Within the listed electorates, the two organisations who were sub-contracted during 2005-2006 were Hunter Volunteer Centre and Volunteering Central Coast. Sub-contract offers have been made to both of these organisations to continue service delivery in 2006-2007. These sub-contracts are currently being negotiated with the organisations considering the terms and conditions of the subcontract variations. (2) As noted in the response to question 1 above, Volunteering Australia is currently in the process of negotiating sub-contracts with its national network of service delivery agencies. Under the terms of the Australian Government’s contract with Volunteering Australia, a finalised list of sub-contractors will be provided to the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations by 31 July 2006.",163,Questions In Writing

Both organisations are currently continuing to operate – providing information and referral services to income support recipients – while contracts are finalised. (3) Sub-contract offers have been made to providers by Volunteering Australia for the period 20062007, and they are currently being finalised. While the Government approves the list of subcontractors Volunteering Australia proposes, the negotiation of these sub-contracts is a matter for Volunteering Australia. Smartcard (Question No. 3641) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Minister for Human Services, in writing, on 14 June 2006: (1) Is the estimated cost of $100 million to register Australians for the Smartcard, attributed to consultant Dr David More in The Australian on 13 June 2006, accurate; if not, what is the correct sum. (2) Does the $1.1 billion allocated for the Smartcard project in the 2006 Budget include a sum for Smartcard registration; if so, what sum has been allocated for that purpose. (3) Is the estimated cost of $100 million to provide the Smartcard cards, attributed to consultant Dr David More in The Australian on 13 June 2006, accurate; if not, what is the correct sum. (4) Does the $1.1 billion allocated for the Smartcard project in the 2006 Budget include a sum for provision of the Smartcard cards; if so, what sum has been allocated for that purpose. (5) Is there an intention to allow private businesses use of Smartcard infrastructure. (6) Has he, or the Smartcard Taskforce, received advice to the effect that the creation of a more valuable, single proof of identity instrument will increase the appeal and practice of identity theft. (7) Does he, or the Smartcard Taskforce, plan to endow department or agency staff with the power to (a) confiscate and/or (b) deactivate a Smartcard; if so, (i) who will have that power, and (ii) will the exercise of that power be subject to appeal by the cardholder. (1) The cost of establishing the access card system is $1.09 billion over four years. For commercial reasons, detailed information regarding costs, including the cost of registering Australians for the Health and Social Services (HSS) access card is not publicly available. (2) Yes, the cost of $1.09 billion over four years to introduce the HSS access card includes funding for the registration of Australians for the access card. However, as noted in the response to question (1), information regarding the estimated cost of registration is not publicly available. (3) See response to question (1). (4) See response to question (2). (5) The Government does not intend to build all Smartcard infrastructure such as cards, readers and microchips. This is not core government business. Therefore it is obvious that the private sector will need to service its equipment. (6) Advice that the introduction of the HSS access card will increase the appeal and practice of identity theft has not been received by the Minister for Human Services, the Smart Technologies and Services Taskforce or the Access Card Consumer and Privacy Taskforce. Indeed, as the KPMG Health and Social Services Smart Card Initiative, Volume 1: Business Case notes: “KPMG considers that greater trust in the overall system will be strengthened by consumers being confident that their card cannot be used by someone else.

(3) See response to (1). Additionally, only doctors with unrestricted Medicare provider numbers are eligible to access the Measure. However, overseas doctors subject to Medicare provider number restrictions under the Health Insurance Act 1973 may be granted an exemption under section 19AB of the Act to work in districts of workforce shortage. The Department of Health and Ageing records indicate that as of 4 July 2006, 20 overseas trained doctors have 19AB exemptions to provide services in general practice that attract Medicare benefits for locations within the electoral division of Richmond. Australian Taxation Office (Question No. 3651) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, in writing, on 15 June 2006: (1) Has he read the ATO’s 2005-06 Compliance Program, published on 13 October 2005, which observes, inter alia, that only a small number of people deliberately evade their tax obligations or obtain an improper financial benefit; if not, why not. (2) Which Australian studies has the ATO used to estimate the extent of taxation non-compliance in Australia. (3) How does he reconcile the ATO’s conclusion that only a small number of people evade tax obligations with observations made in an article published in the Sydney Morning Herald in March 2006, titled “Forget top rates – there are holes in the bucket”, to the effect that tax evasion may be more prevalent than assumed amongst high income earners. (1) Yes. (2) The ATO is not aware of any Australian studies that reliably measure taxation non-compliance. The ATO uses risk assessment approach to target taxpayer non-compliance. (3) The article in the Sydney Morning Herald refers to a statement on page 93 of the ATO’s Compliance Program 2005-06, and claims that it states that ‘evasion is confined to a small number of people’. The article goes on to canvass a range of anecdotes regarding the practices that people undertake to evade taxes, and the amount of revenue that might be at risk. No evidence was stated in support of those estimates. The ATO believes that the correct reference would have been to page 89, where the following statement is in fact made: “A small number of people deliberately engage in criminal behaviour to evade their tax obligations or fraudulently use the system to obtain an improper financial benefit.” Relative to the total population of taxpayers, only a small number are engaged in criminal behaviour as described in the Evasion and Serious Fraud chapter of the Compliance Program. The ATO’s Compliance Program demonstrates that the ATO is active and effective in addressing such behaviour.",166,Questions In Writing

BENEFITS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SALARY PACKAGING 2.2 What is Fringe Benefits Tax? Generally speaking, the benefit items which are attractive for salary packaging purposes are therefore limited to those which are exempt from FBT, or upon which FBT is concessionally taxed (e.g. novated lease motor vehicle, superannuation and payments to certain child care centres) or those that are otherwise deductible (e.g. professional membership fees, personal computers). (2.1 page 7) 2.4 Salary Package Items (“The Menu”) Child-care fees are also an attractive benefit to salary package, as FBT does not apply to them in certain circumstances. However, child-care fees are only exempt from FBT where the child-care is conducted on business premises of the Commonwealth Government, i.e. a building owned or leased by any Commonwealth Department or statutory authority. Child-care fees in respect of the Currawong Child Care Centre in the DFAT building in Canberra are also exempt from FBT, because of a private ruling received from the Australian Taxation Office. Salary Packaging child-care fees means that they can be paid from pre-tax dollars. (2.4 page 9) 8. WHERE TO FROM HERE? Step2 Estimate Benefit, Seek Financial Advice The employee should investigate the non-cash benefit (e.g. additional superannuation, novated lease car or child care) they wish to salary package. The employee should consider how much they might be currently spending on the benefit, from after-tax income, and give some thought to how their personal finances might be improved by salary packaging the benefit instead. (8.1 page 21) Attachment B Section 2-Land& Water Australia’s Salary Packaging Policy 2.0 (1) Salary packaging (that is, allowing employees to receive part of their remuneration in the form of non-cash benefits) will be available to all employees as set out below. (2) The only non-cash benefits that will be available are: (a) cars; (b) extra superannuation contributions, via the LWA payroll system; (c) laptop computers (on a basis that provides Land& Water Australia with an exemption from fringe benefits tax); (d) child care on Australian Government property; (e) personal loans; (f) home loans; (g) Otherwise deductible items, examples at Appendix A; and (h) electronic diaries (on a basis that the purchase provides Land& Water Australia with an exemption from fringe benefits tax). (3) All the costs of arranging salary packaging for an individual employee, and any other associated costs (eg fringe benefits tax) will be deducted from that employee’s salary. (4) Employees will not be able to use salary packaging to reduce their income: (a) to enable them or anyone else to access any government-provided benefit (eg income support payments or education assistance); or (b) to affect their liability, or anyone else’s liability, to pay child support (including by removing or creating such a liability). Employees will be required to give written assurances to this effect before being allowed to participate in salary packaging. (5) If an employee participates in salary packaging, the employee’s salary for superannuation and termination purposes is the gross cash salary which the employee would be receiving but for the salary packaging arrangements.
