As there is no Commonwealth stock now on the London market, nor any likely to be placed there in the near future, that Bill was not introduced last session, but it will probably be dealt with this session.

In view of the provision that all elections should be held on the same day, it was plain that the Legislature thought that'was a very undesirable thing to happen."" say whether that opinion was forwarded to the returning officer prior to the date of polling? ask the Minister for Home Affairs to inform the honourable and learned member.

25,Sir John Forrest,"I do not thinkhistory; we have the same ambitions for the future ; we are citizens of the same Empire. Therefore, there is no room upon this continent for six sovereign States with independent Governments. The argument was excellent when we all used it, that union was not only necessary, but reasonable and business like; but it must be a real union, and not one in name only; not a sham, such as our union is at present, and such as it must continue to be so long as we have no means of communication between the great western and the great eastern States, except by embarking upon a four days' sea voyage, for the greater part of the journey far out of the sight of land. States get on before the use of steam was introduced ? but should say very badly. I think that we may judge of our own case for ourselves.

I am glad, however, to be able to say that some real advance has been made in this matter, and that the Governor General's Speech conveys the information that the Government intend to ask the House to approve of a survey being made. that paragraph? Sir JOHN FORREST I did not. ter has decided that the survey shall be made for a railway by way of the Gawler Ranges, and not through Tarcoola? Sir JOHN FORREST cided anything. No doubt a railway could be constructed by the Gawler Ranges route for ^500,000 less than by the Tarcoola route, and as the House is in an economical frame of mind, that consideration may weigh with them. That, in itself, however, is not a sufficient reason why the route should be adopted. the railway constructed, and I am not very particular as to which route it follows. The project for the construction of a railway to connect Western Australia with the eastern States was not received with much favour when it was first submitted to the House; but I am glad to say that it is now viewed with niore favour, and that it has gained ground in the estimation of the people. Even in South Australia-where , for some unknown reason which I could not understand, the project was regarded with disfavourI believe that the people are beginning to see that it would be very beneficial to them, and would confer as great an advantage upon South Australia as upon Western Australia, and I look forward to the time, and that very soon, when any objection that may have been raised by that State will be removed. I have not the slightest doubt that success will attend our efforts, but whether immediately or some time hence must depend largely upon public opinion. We. shall have to be content to wait till Parliament, with f u l l information before it, is able to arrive at a decision in regard to it. There is no use in my saying that it is a good project, that it would prove payable, or that it would impose no burden on the people of Australia. WhatI have to Unfortudo, and what the people of Western Ausi.,ooo miles of practically tralia and all those interested have to do, is to use every effort to induce the House and That the country to view it with favour. I have always been content to accept that position. I have, however, always entertained a very strong objection to a situation in which any State should be able to say"" We shall prevent you people of Western Australia from being connected with the other States by r a i l ; we shall not allow you to be brought into communication with your neighbours by railw/ay, because there is rsection in the Constitution which says that our consent has first to be obtained."" I have no hesitation in saying that that section was not embodied in the Constitution with any idea that it could be availed of for such a purpose. The design of the framers was to prevent the Commonwealth from interfering with the States in regard I have not deto matters relating to inter-communication within their own territory, and it was never contemplated that one State should be able to block another from being connected with the other States by railway.

It would have absolutely no significance whatever. Treasurer say upon the subject? mitting the Treasurer. We only want the railway when Parliament is prepared to grant it. NowI shall have to say some things which are not so pleasant as I might desire, but I am determined to give utterance to them, because I have a duty to perform, not only to myself, but to the people of the StateI represent. Australia who promised-indirectl y if not directly-that Federation would be the forerunner of railway communication between the east and west of Australia was the then Premier of South Australia, the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide. On the 9th April, 1899, when I was Premier of Western Australia, he wrote to me as follows:Our near constitutional connection, resulting from Federation, is in itself a boon of great worth to all included within its sphere. I cannot help thinking, also, that it must, at no very distant date, result in the connection of east and west by rail through the medium, say. of a line between Port Augusta and your gold-fields. There is no mention there about Esperance Bay. This would, indeed, be an Australian work worthy of undertaking by a Federal authority on behalf of the nation, in pursuance of the authorities contained in the Commonwealth, Bill. It is, of course, a work of special interest to Western Australia and South Australia, and I devoutly hope that the day is not far distant when the representatives of Western Australia and South Australia may, in their places in a Federal Parliament, be found working side by side for the advancement of Australian interests in this and other matters of national concern. On the 4th September of the same year my right honourable friend wrote to me as follows. I may say that this was before the referendum in Western AustraliaWith Federation assured, the Federal construction of the railway is in our opinion undoubtedly the best means for carrying out this great Australian underaking. We hope that it will not be long before Western Australians and South Australians are co-operating in the Parliament of the Commonwealth to bring this about, and we repeat that you can rely on South Australia's sympathy and support. Mr O'MALLEY -The right honourable gentleman will obtain sympathy from South Australia, but no support. Federation, without means of comnot been favoured with much of either. gentleman has had both. Western Australia is offered two railwavs instead of one. out to the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide that in the communication which I have quoted no mention is made of a railway from Esperance Bay to the goldfields. It refers only to the projected transcontinental line from Western Australia to South Australia. I repeat that we have had neither sympathy nor support from the latter State. For three years the Commonwealth Government have persistently endeavoured to secure permission from that State for the Among the foremost men in railway to pass through its territory. So far, we have been unsuccessful. The authorities have neglected to give proper consideration to the requests which have been made by the Commonwealth Government. speech which the Minister made in this House contained a threat of disruption and nonsense of that sort. the question of the railway. neglect of the Federal Capital question member will be quite satisfied with my attitude upon that subject. But in connection with the transcontinental railway, I should like to ask what 'the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide has done during all this time. He has done absolutely nothing. He has never asked the people of South Australia to respect the promises which he made. His action strongly recalls to mv mind the old fable of the spider and the fly.

He has never asked the people of what he terms "" My own dear State"" not to dishonour themselves or their country by repudiating the pledges which he made on their behalf. But instead, what has he done? He has done even worse, than nothing.

If an individual pledges himself to do a certain thing, in certain eventualities, and when the time comes for redeeming his promise seeks to qualify it by adding to it a new and objectionable condition, which he knows will not be acceptable to the other party, what can be said of his conduct? Yet that is precisely the position which is taken up by the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide.

If any honourable member can urge that that is fair treatment, I have no more to say. I hold, however, that the new condition which the right honourable member for Adelaide seeks to impose was quite outside the contract. While I The right honourable and was grateful to him for the letters which he wrote me in connection with the transcontinental railway, I should be much more grateful to him if he would keep the promises he made in their entirety and not seek to get out of his promise by' adding to it an impossible condition; otherwise he might just as well openly avow that he is not prepared to f u l f i l the promises which he made. tacking on the new condition. that the estimates of the probable revenue that will be derived from the overland line duced by more than half if the Esperance line be constructed ? orable and learned member, having made a promise, which we acted upon as a bond fide one, is now seeking to impose new conditions. that the estimates which he is putting forward will be falsified by 50 per cent, if there is a line to Esperance? that they will. fected ? be affected at all.

If it is seen in the future that evil, and' not good, results from them, no doubt we shall retrace our steps, or substitute something better.

The right honourable member for Adelaide is my good friend, though he sometimes seems to speak as though he had not that sympathy with me which I desire that he should have: people of Australia that I have no sympathy with the workers of this country. I consider that a gratuitous misrepresentation. I ask any one who wishes to test it to examine the statute-book of Western Australia for the ten years between 1890 and 1900, during which I was said to be an autocrat in that State. If any one does so, he will find there to my credit much more progressive and beneficent legislation than emanated from the Legislature of South Australia while the right honourable member for Adelaide was Premier of that State. In no decade in the history of Australia has more legislation been passed for the benefit and amelioration of the people than was passed in Western Australia in the period I refer to. words. ing speeches here and there, and be a blatant democrat and radical, but. I wish rather to be judged by the work I do. What has been done by many of the men who for years have been in the public life of this country? What measures can they point to and say-""Thes e are my handiwork; I am responsible for them""? When a public man has beneficent and useful legislation to his credit I dislike the term ""democratic,"" because it has been so hackneyed-h e has done good for his country. But those who haveEverynew scheme requires only made a noise, set class against class, and quarrelled with others until the placehas become unfit to live in, have done more harm than they could undo if they lived for 100 years. gentleman's democracy is ever in evidence when he has to bend. to speak in such a way that my hearers shall not understand exactly what I think about the matters with which I deal. When I am in doubt upon a question I may say nothing in regard to it, but once I have made up my mind, I do not hesitate to express my news plainly. Therefore I wish to say that I am entirely in accord with the Prime Minister in the remarks which he made at Ballarat. I shall support again this session the position taken by the Government last session against the application of the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to the public servants of the States. My reasons for doing so are these: In the first place, I think that it is not necessary to extend the provisions of the measure to Last session he told the public servants. In the second place, it is mischievous to unduly and unnecessarily interfere with the Governments of the States in the control of their own servants. Furthermore, it was not intended by those who inserted in the Constitution Bill the provision allowing the Commonwealth to legislate in regard to industrial disputes affecting more than one State, that it should be applied as it is now sought by some to apply it. I am largely responsible for the adoption of that provision, because if I had not voted for it, and used influence which I possessed at the time to get it carried, it would have been rejected by a majority of the members of the Convention. gentleman has no reason to be proud of that Facts speak more loudly than fact. not be proud of it if the provision is made use of in the way desired by some. The clause to which I refer was proposed by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and, in supporting it, I said that I had grave doubts as to whether I was doing the right thing. At that time. I did not know the honourable and learned member as well as I know him now.

The dog, seeing the meat that it was carrying in its mouth reflected in the stream below, jumped in, and by reaching after the shadow, lost what it had. I think a very good motto in all matters of this kind, as it is in many other matters, is "" hasten slowly."" It is always better to get almost all that you require, than by trying to get all you want at once, to lose the whole. slowly in regard to the transcontinental railwav ! going too slowly in that matter. I trust that my honourable friend will assist in increasing the pace. It gave me very great pleasure last evening to listen to the remarks of my honourable friend the Minister for Trade and Customs, when he made a generous defence of the Chief Electoral Officer. I am always pleased to be in the position of being able to defend a public officer. I think that it is the right thing to do, if one can do it, because the whole stock-in-trade of a public servant is his good name and character. Parliament who can say what they like about a public servant, can libel him up-hill, and kick him down, can say things to which he cannot reply in any way, should see that the power is carefully and wisely used. If advantage is taken of the privilege of Parliament to attack a public officer in general terms and not specifically, a very wrong thing is done. When a public officer does wrong, called upon to meet a definite charge. He should not be attacked in generalities. I have had only a short experience of the Chief Electoral Officer. He was absolutely unknown to me personally until recently. But I can say this-that I have found him zealous in the discharge of his duties, and, as far as I am able to judge, upright in his desire to do justice. I have never seen him in the slightest degree leaning to the right hand or to the left. I have formed the opinion that he is a competent man, and he seems to have had experience of such duties as he is now discharging. officer attacked in general terms. If there is anything to be alleged against him, let it be plainly statedLet it be put in black and white, and let us have the matter investigated. an inquirv. able thing to have an inquiry when no specific charges are made? The honourable member for North Sydney is, I know, a reasonable man, who is anxious to do what is right. Does he think that it would be a fair thing to have a general inquiry without any specific charge being made? A prisoner at the bar knows what is alleged against him. We do not charge a prisoner with general offences, and there is no power to bring up fresh charges against him in the course of his trial. speaking of the man, but of the work of the Department. demand that there should be a general inquiry, but I can understand an inquiry into the system. mission an inquiry into general charges? finite charges in that case, I believe. My own opinion is that we cannot be too caref u l in guarding public officers from attacks in general terms. If anything is wrong, there Members of should be specific charges made, which should be thoroughly well inquired into. We should not appoint commissions of inquiry merely to find out something against a public officer. NowI come to another matter about which I wish to say a few words. I allude to the Navigation Bill. The measure has not yet been laid upon the table, but it is mentioned in the Governor-Geneial's Speech. As that Bill will affect communication round he should be the coasts of Australia, it is necessarily a measure of very far-reaching importance. I only wish to say this-that the fact that a thing is good in itself affords no reason for immediately embracing it ; it is no reason for upsetting everything to bring it at once into existence. We sometimes remit duties by statute. But we generally give some notice before such an Act comes into force, in order that people shall not be injured by reason of their payment of heavy duties, and having insufficient opportunity to get rid of their stock. foreigner who paid the duty?

The same remarks might apply to other measures, especially to the Navigation Bill. Although the Bill is not circulated yet, I might say that it appears to me that if we were to bring some of its provisions into immediate operation we should inflict injury. Buti f reasonhonorable members that last year if there able time is allowed to meet the altered conhad been no bookkeeping sections in the ditions, the inconvenience or hardship to individual communities may be minimized. In connection with all such measures, especially those which interfere with vested interests, some, time should be allowed to enable those who might be injuriously affected to prepare for the change. Some reference has been made to the question of old-age pensions. those who supported the proposal at the Convention that old-age pensions should be included among the subjects for Federal legislation. The reason I then gaveI have not looked up the matter since-was , that I believed that the Federal Parliament would be able to deal with the matter better than would any local Legislature. I thought that it would be able to take a wider view of the operation of such a law, and,' although there was a good deal of difference of opinion, I voted in favour of Federal control being exercised in that matter. Whilst the Braddon section continues it will be very difficult, without imposing special taxation, apart from the Customs, to bring an old-age pension law into operation. glibly about imposing extra taxation; but I think that those who look into the matter and attach proper weight to the great distaste of the people to any new taxation will see that the subject is not such an easy regard to this matter, I stated at the last one to deal with as might at first appear. No doubt the bookkeeping sections and the Braddon sections of the Constitution suit the State which I represent. We are very pleased that those sections are embodied in the Constitution, and I am very glad that I voted for them. I venture to say that even the Labour Party in Western Australia could not successfully urge the abolition of the bookkeeping sections, or even advocate that their operation should be brought to an end. The reason is this. 'When the five years' term expires there is little doubt that a demand will be made for an extension of the period over which the bookkeeping clauses shall operate. Parliament has the right to extend the time if it thinks fit, because the Constitution provides that the sections shall operate for five years, or until such tions do not affect the old-age pensions; the Braddon section is the obstacle. aware of that; but at present I am dealing with the bookkeeping sections. I may tell Constitution, and the revenues and expenditure of the States had been distributed -per capita, Western Australia would have lost ^600,000. no need to distribute the revenues per capita, even though there were no bookkeeping sections. might be an inclination in that direction. sion could be made for special cases. very well understood by my friends from Western Australia and elsewhere that but for the bookkeeping sections it would have been possible to take £600,000 out of the pockets of the people of Western Australia last year, and to have distributed it among the other States. I do not think that any one would care to go upon the hustings and advocate a change that would involve any such distribution. I should not like to take the responsibility of doing so. Some persons talk very Western Australia is gathering in the money from the other States. that Western Australia may receive is paid for by the people of that State. With' general electionThe distribution of the surplus Customs revenue among the States, after the expiration of the five years bookkeeping period, is a very important question, and especially so for Western Australia, and our endeavours should be to have the bookkeeping period further extended. I certainly think the bookkeeping sections ought to be extended, at any rate, for the term fixed for the Braddon section, viz., for ten years.

It is provided that the revenue collected in each State, less right honourable and learned member that, one-fourth, which is made available for the purposes of the Federal Government, shall be returned to the State from which it is derived, and that all expenditure shall be charged against the State in which it is incurred.

The Braddon section will stand in the way of adopting an old-age pension scheme for a period of ten years.

I now have to discharge a disagreeable duty. I feel compelled, very much against my wishes, to refer to some remarks made by my friend, the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide, on Friday last His observations were, I think, ungenerous and unfair. His very long speech, to which we all listened attentively, and to a great deal of which we were glad to listen, was spoiled by the attack he made upon the Governments of Western Australia-bot h past Governments and the present Government. I am particularly interested in his remarks with regard to the Government with which I was for ten years connected, but I am willing to also take up the cudgels in defence of those who succeeded me. The right honourable gentleman seemed to me so unreasonably hostile, that it might have been even assumed that some personal injury had been done to him by myself, or by the representatives of Western Australia, or by the people of that State. I may say that I have no knowledge of anything of the kind. when he hears me repeat what he said, he will be really astonished that he should have made any such statements. It cannot be said that his speech was not full of goodwill towards the people of Australia, because he seemed to be very much concerned for their welfare. He spoke of his admiration and love for his fellow-Australians almost with emotion. Indeed, he presented quite a lugubrious spectacle. I could not help thinking he must have been reading the Lamentations of Jeremiah-so much emotion did he display towards the people of "" his own dear State."" But I regret to say that the same generous spirit did not animate him when he spoke of the people of Western Australia. He first attacked that State because the Constitution confers, upon its Parliament the power to tax Inter-State goods for a period of five years,, and then he went So far as to declare that I and those who represented Western Australia at the Federal Convention had intentionally misled the delegates at that gathering. from the report of my speech? what the report of the right honourable member's speech says, but I heard him affirm that the Convention had been absolutely misled. sentation. received consideration which properly belonged to Queensland and Tasmania. time at my disposal I could quote the opinions of a dozen, or, perhaps, twenty, of the most prominent men in the Commonwealth, who, at the Convention, urged that the special circumstances of Western Australia required special treatment. the actual facts. possession, and can produce, if necessary, a letter from the Government Statist in New South Wales assuring me that whilst",24,Honourable Members O H

Sir JOHN FORREST I again desire to emphasize the fact that the sliding scale under which Western Australia joined the Federation merely means that its people have to pay the extra duty themselves. Of course some of my honourable friends opposite may urge that it is the people of the eastern States who pay it, but I cannot agree with that view. Western Australia receives that which its. people have previously contributed through the Customshouse. Can it beI hope it is not-that the right honourable member's statement was prompted by the fact that Western Australia has progressed more rapidly than ""his own dear State."" Is he jealous bish?

I hope that both right honourable members will respect the Standing Orders. honourable member for Adelaide has based his attack upon the Government and people of Western Australia on statements which he declares were made in this House, and which he makes his own. I was away in England at the time when it is said these statements were made, and I have never read them. I know of them only because of the reference which the right honourable member has made to them on two occasions, and as they contain serious imputations against the Government and people of Western Australia. I would ask him whether he has made any attempt to verify them. No one is justified in accepting a libellous statement as a fact, and to refer to it and confirm it, unless he takes some trouble to determine whether it is true. the right honourable and learned member made any effort to ascertain the accuracy -or otherwise of the statements to which I refer? If it were a trifling matter, it would be unworthy of the notice of the House; slander."" spoken by the members for the but it is because of its seriousness that T district in question in this House.

What are right honourable gentleman heard those statethese charges which have twice been hurled ments made, but never dared to contradict against my past Administration, as well as them. Minister .say the present Government of Western Australia? They are, in effect, that because the Government and Parliament of Western Australia have not built a railway from Coolgardie or Kalgoorlie to Esperance Bay -an undertaking which, inclusive of harbour accommodation, would involve an outlay of about 000,000-a n iniquitous state of affairs exists. It is asserted that the policy of the past and present Government of the State is worthy of the Emperor Caligula; that in consequence of it old men and young children are dying on the gold-fields, and that the failure to construct the line in question has been due solely to a desire to benefit the land-holders of Perth. The further statement is made that children are I have heard to be sacrificed, and that hard-working men have not only been inconvenienced, but exI rise to a point of order. posed to risks, difficulties, and even danger to life, in order that the land-holders of Perth may make a profit on their investments. These are the statements, said to have been made in this House., which the right honourable member for Adelaide has taken upon himself to reiterate and confirm, and which he repeated for the second time on Friday last. Could a more monstrous charge be levelled against the Government, Parliament, and people of any State? If it were made by some one having no place in the public life of Australia, it might well be left alone; but inasmuch as these statements have been accepted and reiterated by the right honourable member for Adelaide, I call upon him either to substantiate or to withdraw them. I wholly deny and repudiate them. I challenge .and defy the right honourable member, or any one else, to prove one tittle in support of them. When I indignantly contradicted them the other day, the right honourable member for Adelaide rejoined-""What avails the contradiction? The fact remains, and there is no getting away from it .

The reason for that failure was, in the case of my own Government-and no doubt the same remark will apply to the present Government of Western Australia -that there was already a splendid railway running from Fremantle to Kalgoorlie, and indeed 200 miles further inland. That service has existed for several years; while the State Government have also expended £1,250,000 in making the Fremantle Harbor fit to accommodate the largest steamers. in Australia possesses better railway facilities than those enjoyed by Kalgoorlie. It has not only railway communication with the coast, but also a suburban railway its streets, and altogether the town is a most flourishing one. It is the great railway centre of the eastern gold-fields. The main line extends for about 200 miles beyond Kalgoorlie to the northward, as I have already mentioned. Then, again, the State has expended ,£2,750,000 in giving it a permanent water supply, which is at present even more than sufficient to meet its wants. That was a very great undertaking, and I think it will be admitted that it is a most beneI again ask ficent one. We have in Kalgoorlie a satisfied and a prosperous people.

I shall place them before honorKalgoorlie are satisfied, so far as any people It is all very well for the in a remote part of the country could be expected to be satisfied. The right honorWe lisable member for Adelaide appears to be under the impression that if any district is not connected with the coast by a railway line running in a straight course, a more direct railway should be constructed. From Deniliquin to Sydney the direct distance is 390 miles, whereas by rail the distance is 632 miles, or 242 miles more. If a railway were constructed from Deniliquin to Finley, a distance of only 40 miles, Deniliquin would be only 488 miles from Sydney. From Kalgoorlie to Fremantle the distance by rail is 387 miles, while the distance to Esperance Bay is about 247 miles, or about 140 miles less. From Sydney to Brisbane the direct distance is 450 miles, but the distance by rail is 723 miles, or 273 miles more. From Melbourne to Sydney the direct distance is 450 miles, and the distance by rail 576 miles. From Adelaide to BrokenH ill the direct distance is 270 miles-, and the distance by rail 334 miles. From Albury to Sydney the direct distance is 286 miles, and the distance by rail 386 miles. From Sydney to Cobar the direct distance is 354 miles, and the disNo other inland town tance by rail 459 miles.

170,And What Are The Sir John Forrest,"The people ofhas connection with the coast. good port. I think that the argument of the right honourable member for Adelaide ,is an absurd one. He contends that because Esperance Bay is only 247 miles from Kalgoorlie, the Government of Western Australia should make a railway to that port, although the gold-fields have already a good railway connecting them with a magnificent harbour at Fremantle. Surely, however, the matter is one for the State Government, to deal with, and they can be trusted to manage their own business. Why should the people of Perth and Fremantle be represented by any one without the remotest foundation of truth or justice, as inhuman persons who have tried to make money for themselves at the expense of, and by neglecting the interests of, their fellowAustralians living on the gold-fields. Australia have followed a policy common to all the States. honourable and learned member for Adelaide has spoken of the people of Fremantle as though they were bloodsuckers, who have tried to squeeze money out of the people on the gold-fields without providing them with conveniences in return. I would remind the right honourable member, however, that the early inhabitants of Western Australia mortgaged all that they had to borrow money to construct the railway to the gold-fields and to provide^ the people there with a water supply. Furthermore, persons from his ""own dear State"" of South Australia are as plent if u l as blackberries in Fremantle and in Perth. Western Australia there are at least three newcomers. member refer to them as inhuman and cruel? Kalgoorlie desire a change for the sake of health and recreation, do they prefer to go to Esperance Bay when they, have Perth, Fremantle, Bunbury, Busselton, Albany, and the older towns of the State to visit? What would be said of the contention that the people of BrokenH ill would rather go to Port Pirie for recreation than to the fair city of Adelaide, or to the other beautiful towns of South Australia? Both contentions are absurd. But we have had enough of these local matters in this House. two long speeches from the right honourable and learned member for Adelaide, both of them in the same style, and both dealing with a matter of purely local concern. Surely these matters should be left to those who are responsible for them, the people of Western Australia! I cannot expect that honourable members should enter into my feelings in regard to the ungenerous statements that have been reiterated, because they have not realized their gravity; but I can assure them that the charges which have been levelled against me, and the Administration of which I was the head, have cut me to the very quick. I know what the people of Western Australia have doneI do not distinguish one class from another-to try to make that State prosperous. We were originally a very small community, and we mortgaged practically everything we had to float large loans for the construction of railways to the goldfields, to give the people there a water supply, to make roads, to erect telegraphs, to establish hospitals, and to provide for public batteries for the convenience of poor miners. When I think of all that was done, and know that it never for a moment entered the mind of any person in Fremantle or Perth to be unjust or cruel to, or to do other than to try to help, the population of the gold-fields, I cannot but regret-that the right honourable member for Adelaide has lent himself to the reiteration of statements which, no matter by whom made, are absolutely untrue. SurelyI have just cause for complaint, that one with his great reputation should lend his aid to disseminating throughout the length and breadth of this country, such scandalous inuendoes and gross misrepresentations. For every old inhabitant in I have had an unpleasant duty; but I have been compelled to perform it in the inteDoes the right honourable rests of myself and of those with whom I have been associated in the Government and Then, again, if the people of Parliament of Western Australia. I thank honourable members for their kindness in so attentively listening to my remarks. the able discourse of the Minister for Home Affairs, I cannot but think that this is not the right place in which to wash dirty linen. able member say that after the speech of the right honourable member for Adelaide?

' in reference to the remarks of the Minister for Trade and Customs last night. stated that he had proved himself to be not an extravagant Minister, though he had been attacked by the press for extravagance; and he told us that false economy is often extravagant. I have been afraid of extravagant administration ever since I have been in Federal politics. Whenever the creation of a new Department is spoken of, I get into a blue funk. It is not the first cost of a Department that I fear so much as the expenditure which I know will follow. Every nounces office and nouncements of the kind I saw referred to several appointments to the Patent Office, to several others to the office of the Crown Solicitor, and so on. saving one penny by reason of the Commonwealth administration. keep on increasing expenditure in every direction. We were told by Sir Edmund Barton, when he was advocating the adoption of the Enabling Bill, that if Federation were accomplished there would be so much saved to the States. reduce their expenditure. member spend as much as he likes ! That is what he would wish. new appointees to the Patent Department will, I think, all be transferred from the service of the States. Hitherto the public servants of the States have been elbowed out of their positions by others, though men who have been in the Public Service ever since they were boys must know more of the work of the Departments in which they have been employed than new men can know. We have now an Inspector-General of Works, saw it stated in the press a few days ago that, as there are no offices for him. the Commonwealth will have to provide some. The Government wish the Victorian Government to add another story to the Commonwealth offices in your information, copy of an extract from a Spring-street; but the Victorian Governletter which we have received from Messrs. B. ment do not see their way to do so. I do Kershaw and Co. L t d . , 68 Aldersgate-street, not blame them, because we are in Melbourne only on sufferance, and the sooner we get away the better. The Minister for Trade and Customs told us that the Opposition were largely to blame for the delay that has taken place in connection with the settlement of the Capital site question. I He ask him to make a definite charge against the Opposition in regard to that matter. The question would have been settled long ago if the Cabinet had been agreed upon it. Of course, the honourable member is only playing the political game for all that it is worth when he makes a statement of that kind. I should be glad to vote to-morrow to have a site chosen in New South Wales in the manner provided by the Constitution. The Minister also accuses the Opposition of having delayed business by speaking for a period of eight months; but by our Commonwealth Gazette anaction in connection with the Tariff we have new appointments to this saved the producers and consumers of the to that. The last ancountry over jQi,000,000 of taxation. It is all very well for the Minister to say that the Government went to the polls to secure fiscal peace and preferential trade; but that was The States are not not the whole of the issue. I do not wish for fiscal peace. I wish to take off as many This Government burdens as possible from the shoulders of our consumers and primary producers. I will give the honourable member an instance of how he is taxing the exports as well as the imports of the Commonwealth. He mows that the Opposition secured reductions in the Tariff only at the point of the bayonet; the Government did nbt concede anything unless they knew that the numbers were against them. I desire to bring before honourable members the circumstances under which certain exports from Queensland have been taxed. The Government were not satisfied with taxing the whole of the machinery used in the industries of that State, and the eatables and drinkables required by the people, but they imposed a duty upon the meat wrappers used in packing meat for export. These wrappers are not required for home consumption, but are used entirely for ex port purposes, and yet the beneficent Government, which is always talking about protecting national and natural industries, imposed a burden upon one of the most and I important enterprises in Queensland. On the 3rd FebruaryI received the following letter: We, the Queensland Meat Export and Agency Co. Limited, take the liberty of enclosing",29,Honourable Members O H

Extract from letter from Messrs. B. Kershaw and Co. L t d . , dated London, 18th December, 1903 :The Argentine Government charge no import duty on Irozen meat wrappers. Consequently we send our clients in that country stockinette made into mutton, hinds of mutton, legs of mutton, lamb, beef (for liners under hessian) bags, and hessian made into beef; and mutton (for Cape trade) bags. All these bags are branded here, and complete in every way for placing on the meat. Considering the keen competition in the frozen meat trade, we are strongly of the opinion that it is high time the import duty charged in your Colony on meat wrappers should be abolished, *SD as to place you on an equal footing in this respect with your Argentine rivals. There is no calico used in the Argentine trade; but for the colonial trade we supply large quantities, chiefly in the piece owing to import duty. That describes the position of the meat export trade, which is one of the primary industries, I might even say the backbone, of the Commonwealth. Instead of encouraging -such industries, the Government are doing all they possibly can to stifle them. Upon the subject of Customs administration, I have a letter written by a friend at Rockhampton, who saysI most sincerely hope that before long the powerful voices of your party will be heard with reference to the still lamentable state of affairs with regard to Customs work. Not only is no assistance whatever given by the officers of this Department, but every effort seems to be madeto induce the unfortunate importer to make mistakes, and then down him. The great tariff bodk is now of very little use ; so many alterations having been and still are being made in it that unless some assistance is given to the public by the Customs clerks, it is as much as a man's life is worth to attempt to pass an entry. As one of the oldest Custom House agents here a good portion of my income was derived from passing entries: but it has become so irritating and vexatious and so much lime is lost that I have practically had to refuse to do any Customs work, unless where our business compels. I could fill pages of foolscap showing how the unfortunate importer suffers from the hateful system. The Department has almost despotic power, and where it is found that any fraud is intended, the delinquent should be punished with the utmost rigour of the law; b»r at present all the punishment is directed at the innocent. The idea seems to be, when an entrv is presented, not of receiving the duty, but ""Can we have him in any way?"" To put it plainlv. it is just as bad as if you went to the railwav station at Longreach, and asked the fare to Emerald, and the clerk were to say, ""Find out from the time-table,"" and if you dare to presem one halfpenny less than the exact fare, you are likely to get seven years' hard labour. Why tV>Customs more than any other Department should have the power to act as they do is a puzzle. They won't even give .change-the exact amount musl be tendered; and it often happens that for want of a few pence change a day is lost, and the The remarks are self-explanatory, unlucky individual put to serious trouble and expense. Kindly note that I am not referring to the Rockhampton Customs; the game goes on at every port the same, and it is about time that something was done to put an end to it. Surely every man should have the right to present his papers at the Customs, inquire what duty he has to pay, and pass his own entry without being put to the expense of employing any agent. Even in the case of the Inter-State .certificates the trouble is almost as great as and sometimes greater than in the old days before Federation. I shall be very pleased indeed to give you any information on the subject you may wish, and if you are the means of making an alteration you will have the blessings of thousands of miserable people, whose lives now are made wretched by this exasperating system. I know that every word contained in the letter is true, and that the writer, who is a Customs agent, has had to give up his business; he is afraid to go to the Customs-house lest an endeavour be made to involve him in law proceedings. It was very amusing to hear the Minister for Trade and Customs complaining about the treatment he had received at the hands of the Oppos'itio:. Does not the Minister play the game of party politics for all it is worth? He shed crocodile tears over the way in which the Opposition had attacked him, when he knew quite well that every one of their guns were spiked. That is why he came down upon them like a cart-load of bricks. There is a nice little bit of padding in the Governor General's Speech upon the subject of old-age pensions. Paragraph 4 reads, as follows :The re-adjustment of Federal and State finances contemplated in such an arrangement will, it is hoped, present an opportunity for the adoption of a uniform system of old-age pensions throughout the Commonwealth. No one knows better than the Minister for Trade and Customs that that is nothing, more than padding. The leader of the Opposition denounced the Government for having included that paragraph in the speech, but he did not speak half strongly enough to please me. I shall refer honourable members to what was said by the Minister, two years ago, when we were discussing the .question of old-age pensions, on the motion of the honourable member for Darwin. able member will quote the portion of my speech which I have underlined for him. me. The question of old-age pensions was referred to in the Governor General's Speech, at the opening of the first Parliament, and the Prime Minister at every place",30,Honourable Members O H

187,Mr Page,"I shall quote what suitsat which he appeared spoke of the advantages of a universal system of old-age pensions. were put to the practical test, this was the feeling expressed by the Minister for Trade and Customs. Speaking on 2nd August, 1091, he saidThe honourable member for Tasmania said that we should be generous to that State, and that if Tasmania had not enough money to pay old-age pensions we ought to provide it for her. In view of all these statements, I think it would be wise to wait and see how our finances, pan Out before making any declaration as to what we. should do in regard to any particular State. That is one of the reasons which almost preclude the Government from doing anything at the present time. The Minister told us that we could not do anything in 1901, and I should like to know in what respect the financial position of the Commonwealth has changed, to render it possible for us to do anything now. Yet the Minister told us last night that the Government intended to do something. thing that was inconsistent with my utterance on the former occasion. nest-egg ? may be very appropriately asked. The Minister went on to say, upon the occasion previously referred toAs far as I can judge, taking as a basis the expenditure which has been incurred op to the present, it would require between ^1,000,000 and pensioners throughout the various States, excluding New Zealand. That is a very large sum to be called upon to pay out of the Commonwealth funds, shackled as they are by the clause to which of mails and perishable produce from Ausreference has been made. The clause referred to is the Braddon section, which is still in existence, and yet the Government think that the padding which they have introduced into the Governor General's Speech will catch the eye of the Labour Party. So far as I am concerned, nothing will catch my eye upon this subject until a Bill is introduced. Let the -Government show their sincerity by bringing down a Bill. The Minister knows full well that if the Government took over the tobacco industry and made it a national monopoly, they would be able ""to find all the money necessary to provide for a scheme of old-age pensions. In fact, there are a hundred and one ways of accomplishing the purpose. Paragraph 6 of the Governor General's Speech reads as follows: With a"" view to giving assistance wherever possible to those engaged in the cultivation of the soil, and as a preliminary to the establishment of an Agricultural Bureau, you will be invited to consider the best means of ' assisting the When, however, the Government farmer, by bounties and otherwise, to grow new crops and find new markets. Speedier and cheaper transportation to the large centres of population of meat, butter, and fruit, under improved conditions, is much to be desired. Now, what did the Government do when the pastoralists of western New South Wales and of Queensland were in difficulties through the drought? They did not offer them the slightest assistance, and now the Minister of Trade and Customs has the barefaced cheek to shield himself behind the action of the States Governments in regard to the reduction of railway freights. What has that to do with the Commonwealth? If the States Governments like to carry passengers or produce for nothing, that is not our concern ? The drought was a national calamity, through which we all suffered, and the least the Government could have done when the people were on I did not say anythe verge of starvation was to come to their rescue. The Ministers were protectionists, but they were intent upon protecting themselves, rather than the national industries of the Commonwealth. I suppose that the paragraph, to which I have just referred, is intended to afford comfort to the pastoralists, but they do not want any aid from the Government. God has been good to them in giving them plenty of grass and water for their stock, and they want no assistance from the Government. All they 100,000 per year to pay the whole "" f ihe desire is that they may be left alone, but the Government will not do that. Reference is made in the speech to the carriaee tralia. I cannot believe that the Government were serious when they called for tenders for the mail service. If they were, why should they differentiate between Queensland and other States? They have yet to explain away their action in inviting the mail companies to say how much more they would want if they were required to make Brisbane a port of call. That was tantamount to encouraging them to name such a figure that the Government would have good reason for declining to accede to the wishes of the people of Queensland. If there is to be a Commonwealth mail service, every State should have a share in the benefits, and Queensland should receive the same treatment as other States. The Government further state that they intend to profit by the experience which was gained in the recent elections by amending our Electoral Act. But",31,Honourable Members O H

The result may be to disturb the whole of the arrangements, and possibly to cause the return of the wrong candidate. the Government during the late elections. In this connection I desire to give one in stance which goes to show how much brain is centred upon the Treasury benches. They despatched a Drake to Queensland and he obtained a "" duck. ' In Capricornia a labour candidate who is a strong protectionist, and a straight-out free trader, were rival candidates for the seat. Instead of leaving the contest to them, the Government put forward a protectionist candidate, who received 2,000 votes. The labour candidate was returned, and the free-trader was second upon the poll. Yet the Government after having done all In their power to prevent his election have the temerity to ask that labour representative for his vote. Then the Attorney-General visited Brisbane to advance the candidaa result that gentleman's chances were promptly squelched. The same thing happened in the case of Mr Glassey. Indeed, wherever the Attorney-General spoke on behalf of candidates, he effectively settled their chances of election. undeniable facts. These instances show the character of the electioneering tactics which were adopted by the Government. the honorable member for Capricornia, I should leave them some time in the field when they ought to be in the lane. I pass now to the statement in the Governor General's Speech, that the Ministry have no desire to re-open the fiscal question. Nevertheless they propose to submit a Bill which' is designed to encourage the iron industry ' by means of bounties.

When Surely some action Ministers submit a proposal of that sort, they will find that the free-trade members of the House are just as strong in their fiscal Let us asfaith as they ever were. The Minister for Trade and Customs referred to the question of preferential trade. How do the Government suggest that a preference should be given to British goods? They propose to retain the existing duties, and to raise those which are operative against the foreigner. In other words, they I come now to the action of will take all they can get from the mother country, and give nothing in return. In speaking upon the Address in Reply, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports made a very amusing reference to this question. He assured us that the agricultural industry in the old country had declined. "" Why,"" he exclaimed, "" we cannot do more than make a man insolvent.""

If we can show them that they are mistaken their bargaining will be very much more reasonable than it has been. The honourable member for Darling Downs last night dealt very effectively with this matter, and I shall therefore not enlarge upon it. There is little to fear with regard to the carriage of Australian produce to the markets of the world. As the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs has pointed out, Queensland has arranged for a new line of steamers,. fitted with the latest appliances for the carriage of her produce to the markets of the old 'world, and within the last three or four months butter to the value of ,£76,000 or thereabouts has been shipped by this line. This is only one of many items. The butter industry in Queensland is assuming very large dimensions, and, great as are the proportions which that industry has assumed in Victoria, I believe that in Queensland its possibilities are even greater. As this industry, as well as the frozenmeat and other industries expand, we shall. . not have to fear any lack of transport facilities for our goods, for only those vessels that are most effectively fitted up will secure our trade. Reference has been made during the course of the debate to the conduct of the recent elections. I myself observed a good many faults in the course of the campaign; but on u the whole, considering that we had a new system to work, and that, with a view to minimizing the expense, we placed that system as far as possible in the hands of members of the Public Service-me n to whom the work was practically new-w e have very little of which to complain. It is a matter of comparative ease to point to faults, but' when we consider the disadvantages under which the officials had to labour, it seems to me that the mistakes of which we have to complain are remarkably few. So far as the conduct of the elections in my own division was concerned, I had not the slightest fault to find with any of the officials. I think it is. I do There is one particular passage in the Governor General's Speech with which I am very much pleased. It indicates the intention of the Government to endeavour to stimulate ' our__ native, industries, to encourage the starting of new industries, and to find more markets in the more thickly It is a question of barpopulated centres of the world. In the course of his able speech at the Conference E x a c t l y ; but the of States Treasurers, recently held in Melbourne, reference was made by the Prime Minister to the Queensland exhibit at the Royal Agricultural Society's show, held at Melbourne last year. The honourable and learned gentleman mentioned the attention paid to the exhibit as an illustration of the good effects which would follow the advertising of the Commonwealth in Great Britain. Having inspected that exhibit, and having heard many comments made by visitors to the show from all parts of Australia, I feel satisfied that the action taken by Queensland had a most beneficial effect. I am at one with the Prime Minister, and I believe with, every other honourable member, in the opinion that Australia's chief need at the present time is more population, but I do not agree that assisted immigration is desirable. If we reverted to a system of assisted immigration, we should ""elikely to attract to our shores men who wo ld ,J be a tax on the community, rather than those who would assist the people already here in bearing the burdens which we have under-: taken in order to develop the continent. We have placed ourselves under a great responsibility by expending large sums of money, on public works. They are far ahead of our present requirements, but are designed to give access to our mineral and pastoral wealth, and the few who are here are bearing the burden. If we bring persons to our shores who have not the means to at once become, producers we shall only add to, rather than decrease our burdens. Advertise Australia",35,Honourable Members O H

224,Mr Wilkinson,"by all means; advertise her products. Let the world know what Australia can produce, what her climate really is, and let us send samples of our products, not only to the British Isles, but to the Continent of Europe. Some of our best settlers have come from Germany, Denmark, and other Continental countries, and we should not confine our efforts to the British Isles. The stream of immigration which is flowing to America is not an all-British one; a very large portion of it comprises persons from continental countries, who make most desirable citizens. who are very desirable citizens, while there are others who are not. I believe that Italians who engage in agricultural and vitir cultural pursuits are a most desirable class; whereas those who grind organs and carry monkeys round the streets of our cities are undesirable. It has been said, of the land laws of Australia, that nearly every member of Parliament has a. land bill in his pocket, and it is no doubt true that nearly everv member of Parliament holds a different opinion as to the way in which to increase our population from abroad. I have said in the Pailiament of Queensland, and also. I believe, in this House, that we have only to make the conditions of life attractive in Australia-to make it known in the older parts of the world that the conditions of life here are more attractive than are those elsewhere-whe n the tide of emigration will flow to, instead of from, Australia. How this is to be done is a matter of opinion, and I should occupy too much time in placing my views on this subject before the House. ter comes to be discussed upon a separate motion, I shall have something to say in regard to it. As to advertising Austialian products by the sending of exhibits to the old country, the Prime Minister said' very truly that the exhibits sent by Queensland to Melbourne were regarded with rather unfriendly eyes by some Victorians, who thought that it was not right for one State to take action which might tend to attract the population of another State. I do not think that there were half-a-dozen items in the exhibit ieferred to which could not have been produced within the Moreton electoral division, so that honourable members can imagine what an exhibition could be made of the products of the whole of Australia, from the Gulf of Carpentaria to Wilson's Promontory, and from Point Danger ,to the Leuwin. Haidly anything can be pioduced anywhere which could not be produced in Australia. I should like now to say a word or two in reply to what was said by the honourable member for Maranoa about the duty on meat wraps. I have received from the Meat' Export Company a letter similar to that which he has read, and I agiee with him that until we begin to manufacture these things for ourselves, they should be exempt from duty. required by Queensland' producers should be admitted, free, while things required' by the producers of other States are subjected to duty. member has never known me to take that position. I have consistently voted for the imposition of duties upon articles which we manufacture, or are likely to manufacture, and for the free admission of articles which we cannot, or are not likely to, manufacture or produce. I am just as proud to declare myself a piotectionist as the honourable member for. Maranoa is to declare himself a free-trader. Maranoa: is not a free-trader in respect to ID £1X1 £LX1 cLS member for Maranoa should know, that if large manufacturing populations spring up in our larger centres, meat wraps will hardly be requiied, because most of our meat will be consumed, within the Commonwealth. He seemed to imply that the honourable member' for Wide Bay is a protectionist because Maryborough, Bundae berg, and Gympie are protectionist, in their fiscal opinions. That remark was ungenerous. The honourable member, for Wide Bay would not sink his principles to please the electors in that way. He is a protectionist as the honourable member for Maranoa, is' a free-trader,, by conviction ; though it might be retorted upon the honorable member for Maranoa that he is a free-trader because cattle and. sheep are the chief products of his electorate. I hope that the day is not distant, when we shall not only manufacture meat wraps and other, cotton goods, but shall grow the cotton from which they are made. There is now a movement for the re-starting of the cotton industry in Queensland and in other, parts of the Commonwealth. In my opinion, cotton growing could be made remunerative",36,Honourable Members O H

I was connected with the industry years ago, when only the cotton fibre was used, and the by-products were allowed to go to waste, and from the knowledge I possess I am firmly convinced that profitable crops could now be obtained by the employment of white labour. If we can. grow our own cotton and weave it into cloth for the use of producers in .other industries, why should we not do so? The work of growing and manufacturing the cotton -would provide means of subsistence for a large population, who, in turn, would consume the products of others, and would help the community to bear the burden which we have undertaken to carry in order to open -up our waste lands and make them available for settlement -The honourable member for Maranoa deprecates the giving of bonuses for the production of cotton, as he deprecates the giving of any : -bonus; but I do not agree with him that to open the subject is to disturb the fiscal question. Even some free-traders advocate the giving of bonuses. traders do so. learned member for Corio reminds me that the late Sir Edward Braddon, as a member of the Iron Bonus Commission, recommended the giving of a bonus for the production of iron. He was one of the most ardent free-traders in this Chamber, and I have heard other free-traders say that, while they object to protection .because the duties are imposed for all time, they do not object to bonuses, because the payment of them can be made terminable at the end of a certain period. are not quite so bad as duties. give us his experience of bonuses? ence of bonuses only in connection with the growing of cotton in Queensland, years ago, at the time of, and shortly after, the Ameriportunity to discuss the whole matter in can war, when the price was high because of the shortage in Lancashire. The Queensland Government then offered a bonus of £ i o for every 300 lbs. of clean cotton, that is, cotton without the seed. A few engaged in the industry, and many middlemen, made their fortunes out of it because the farmers were not able to provide machinery for ginning and had therefore to sell for any price they could get to a few large u 2 storekeepers and others who brought machinery into the State and obtained the bonus given by the Government. The farmers who paid to have their cotton ginned had to wait for their money until the return came from the old country, which took nearly twelve months. In those days there was no cable service, and no ocean greyhounds, and the sailing vessels used to take from seventy to 112 and 120 days on the voyage from here to England. Then the insurance charges were high, because of the length of the voyage and the liability of the cotton to sweat, and heat, and catch fire, and the freight charges were high for similar reasons. Lastly, there were no branch railways running into the country to convey the cotton from the fields to the ports of shipment, so that local carriage was much higher than it would be to-day. of the other bonus. honourable member refers to the bonus on manufactured cotton, which, I admit, was an absolute failure, because the control of it was given into wrong hands. Similarly, if the sugar bonus were wrongly administered, it would be a failure, though I am sure that the honourable member believes too strongly in a 'White Australia to advocate its removal because of that possibility. It is not because there was"" mal-administration in the past that we need submit to it in the future. It must be remembered, too, that in those days only the staple of the rotton was used, 'the more valuable products going to waste. Now, instead of thousands of tons of seed being thrown away, the hull would be made into 'potash and the pulp pressed into oil cake. Cotton oil is now an article of commerce as valuable as the staple itself. preserving cotton seed at Ipswich. to the farmers as food for cattle, in its raw state, without having the oil pressed out of it. No doubt, however, there will be an opdetail when the Minister gives effect to his -intention to propose a bonus for cotton grown by white labour. There must, of course, be the stipulation that white labour only shall be employed, because otherwise Chinese will rush into the industry.

Their competition with the white growers is so severe that it seems to me that measures must soon be taken for the .protection of the latter. Not only does the .production of bananas and pine apples at cheaper rates than those for which they can be produced by white labour make the'competition of white men in that branch of .industry impossible, but by decreasing the value of other fruit it interferes with the profits of other white fruit-growers. I desire to direct the attention of Ministers to one or two .little.matters regarding which I have asked for information. One of these has relation to the administration of the Patents Act. Last week I asked the. Prime Minister, on noticeWhether a working man, say in Queensland, .who desires to obtain a patent under the Commonwealth law, will be in as good a position as one who resides in Melbourne, or wherever the seat of government'may be? To that question I received this replyYes. All persons in the Commonwealth desir,ous of obtaining letters patent are on the same fooling. All can make application through the post, personally, or by a patent attorney, or agent. The majority of mechanical inventors are The second question was-rpoor working men, and they prefer to attend to their business personally, .without the ^25,000 which the Right 'Honourable the Treasurer intervention of too many attorneys or patent anticipates will be saved this year on ordinary agents.

When the Bill was under inclined to think that the Minister has been .consideration, it was suggested that patents misinformed, for I have here an extract offices should be established at all the prinfrom the Brisbane Courier of 29th Februcipal cities of the States, so that applicants ary, in which an officer of the Department, for patent rights might lodge their appliwhose name I do not wish to give, is reprecations, meet any objections that might be sented as having, upon arriving at a town raised, and have an opportunity to inspect in my electorate, congratulated the comall plans and specifications of past patents. manding officer upon the manner in which The second question addressed to the Prime his men had turned out. The officer Minister wasI f a dispute arose regarding his patent rights .would it be necessary for a Queenslander to journey to the seat of government to fight his cause ? .To that I received this answerNot necessarily. Matters of small importance could be settled by post, but in the event of any serious dispute arising, say, for instance, opposition, it would be necessary for the parties to be represented by a patent attorney or agent, or to attend personally. Mr Wilkinson. If a man is to be represented by a patent agent or an attorney, he must, consult him, and although it might not be necessary for an inventor to .travel from the State in which he was residing to the seat of government, the attorney would have to come to him, because it would be impossible to make satisfactory communications by post. The other question I addressed to the Prime Minister wasIs it intended, in the working of the Patents Act, to provide for the distribution of all necessary information relating to patents granted in all the more important centres within the Commonwealth, so that persons desiring to inspect the same may be able to do so without journeying to the seat of government? The answer to that I regard as eminently satisfactory, because the Minister was good enough to reply in the affirmative. I do not propose to enter upon a lengthy discussion of our defences at this stage, because I recognise that the proper time to do that is when the defence estimates are before us. Last week I asked the Minister for DefenceWhetheri t is true, as reported in the Queensland press, that recruits for the Defence Force in that State would not receive uniforms in time to enable them to go into their annual encampment? The reply wasEvery effort is being made to supply uniforms prior to the annual camps of training. Will the Minister sav whether or not the is being saved by keeping strength of the regiments, and by delaying the supply of uniforms to such recruits is stated to have addedThe recruits would not have their uniforms in time for camp, but he asked them to show the Commonwealth their zeal by joining the movement to supply uniform at their own expense. There have been complaints of the great difficulty experienced in bringing some of the regiments up to their full strength. Can this be wondered at, when not only is pay deferred, but recruits are asked to go into camp either without uniforms, or with uniform's provided at their own expense. The officer in question was good enough to add' He was determined to take the whole regiment into camp, and in uniform of some sort, and he asked the officers and men to throw their hearts into the movement. An extract from the Brisbane Courier of an earlier date reads as follows: . Sir George Turner anticipates that f u l l y ^25,000 will be saved this year on ordinary military expenditure, and adds that this will enable the military authorities to exceed the vote of ,£75,000 for munitions of war. How this money is being saved the Treasurer could not explain, but the conclusion come to is that the forces have not been recruited up to the strength provided for in the Appropriation Act. In next year's Estimates provision will be found .for a greatly increased supply of military stores. It would not be at all difficult to provide for an increased supply of military stores if the rank and file of the forces were starved. I am entirely at one with the honourable member for Maranoa in the remarks he has made, and I do not think that the most democratic honourable member is averse to a reasonable expenditure upon proper defences. It has been pointed out time after time, and Ministers themselves have agreed, that there should be no expenditure on frippery-upo n scarlet and gingerbread-bu t that the defence vote should be spent exclusively upon what would be of service in time of war. The money referred to has been saved at the expense of the real fighting forces. Some of it has, perhaps, been spent in the purchase of rifles and other munitions of war, 'ought to have been so expended has been devoted to keeping up the parade of pomp amongst the staff officers. I do not propose to touch upon the Conciliation and -Arbitration Bill, beyond stating that my attitude is well known, because I made my position very clearduring last session. When the Bill comes before us I shall not deviate from the course I then laid down. I desire to direct the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs to a small matter that has arisen out of our Excise legislation. I had occasion to approach the Department a short time ago on behalf of a cigar-maker in my constituency, whose small factory turned out only about 90,000 or 100,000 cigars in the course of the year. This factory was the man's means of living, and was, in fact, his all. When the Custom-house at Ipswich was closed, no inspection of this factory could be made unless an officer travelled from Brisbane. I asked the authorities at the,latter place whether it would be possible for them to send a man to make regular inspections, but they represented that they could not do so, and led me to understand that a licence would not be granted, because the cost of inspection would be too great. There was no desire on the part of honourable members to crush out small men, and thus strengthen the big monopolies. I had intended to refer to certain matters relating to the administration of the Post and Telegraph Department, but I shall leave these to be dealt with on a future occasion, and endeavour in the meantime to arrive at some understanding with the Minister regarding them. I need not further detain the House. I came here as a supporter of the Government, and intend to accord them warm general support, subject to the con* ditions I laid down when I was before the electors in regard to the Navigation and Conciliation and Arbitration Bills. From those conditions I cannot depart, even though the fate of the Government may be involved. In all other matters I shall give them mv cordial support. the statement of the Prime Minister during the early days of the first Parliament, that the Commonwealth was a living organization, and that as such it would grow and extend its powers is well demonstrated in the speech now before us. Certainly, if we were to attempt to deal with half the measures therein mentioned, this session would extend so far that we should have but a good deal more than to make arrangements for a Christmas' ad^ journmertt. It would have been far better if the Government had confined themselves to two or three main measures, important for their national character or urgency, without bothering about other proposals which are mentioned in the speech, I take it, merely in order that they may play the part of ""window, dressing."" I desire to address myself specially to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. That is the only proposed legislation to which I shall refer; my other remarks will' be confined to matters of administration. I am almost compelled to declare my position in regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, because my name was included in a list published in one of the daily newspapers which purported to indicate those honourable members who were prepared to vote against railway servants being brought' within the scope of the",38,Honourable Members O H
242,Mr Crouch (Corio),"The truth ofmeasure. I propose to take up the same position that I adopted when the measure was before us last year. that I was in favour of bringing railway servants within the scope of the Bill, because I held that if a Government entered into trading enterprises, it should be subject to the same limitations as other employers, and that it would be most unfair for a Government to expect to trade if it were unwilling to submit to the same legislation that applied to rival employers. During the last electoral campaign I stated that if my opposition to the Government upon this matter would have the effect of bringing the free-trade party into power, I should have to choose the lesser of two evils, and that, in order to save doned for reading from it a very short the Government, I should not, so far as I was concerned, insist upon bringing railway servants within the scope of the BilL In view, however, of the declarations made by the leader of the Opposition and a number of his followers that they intend to support the Government, the question loses its party complexion, and I 'feel that I shall be free to vote according to the dictates of my conscience. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -Why should not the members of the Opposition choose the lesser-of two evils? they will choose what they regard as the lesser of two evils. This question is entirely robbed of its party aspect when we find the leader of the Opposition and members of what may be called the Conservative corner on the 'Opposition side coming to the support of the 'Government. During this debate another announcement has been made, -which is of very .great importance, because, in my opinion, it means a definite re-arrangement of parties in this House. difference between members of the Opposition and Ministerial supporters has been the fiscal. question. Now, however, that issue is to be sunk. Honourable members will recollect that, before the CobdenBright crusade in England, a similar condition of affairs obtained. There protectionists had a majority for many years, though there was a decreasing minority of free-traders. In the Victorian Parliament the fiscal question was never raised, because nearly all its members were protectionists. Further, that has been the position of parties in England from 1856 onwards, as most of the members of the Imperial Parliament were free-traders. Neither in the Victorian nor the English Parliaments, therefore, I then said has the fiscal question been one which determined upon which side of the House a member 'should sit. The declaration of the leader of the Opposition, that he is prepared to accept the verdict of the people of the Commonwealth upon this question, necessarily involves the formation of new parties. These will be based, not upon the fiscal issue, but upon other considerations and new principles. The other day I was looking up a biography of Lord Beaconsfield, which shows very clearly how, in 1847, a similar state of flux existed in England as. now obtains in Australia, and I may be parextract. The position was that Disraeli had severed himself from his party, and with Lord George Bentinck had formed a protectionist party. He had refused to follow Sir Robert Peel, who was a free trader, with the result that the latter was defeated. The extract to which I have referred, which fairly accurately describes the present position of freer-traders in Australia, is as follows:But the really important point in this election is the attitude of Mr Disraeli to protection. Whether he ever really believed in that doctrine or not, he may be credited with sufficient sense to see that, if once abolished, it could never be restored. He knew, of course, that the people having once got the taste :of cheap bread, would rise in rebellion .rather than again allow its price to be artifically raised by protective laws. The difficult problem which Mr Disraeli had, therefore, to solve was, to keep up his appearance of a belief 'in the possibility of a -return to protection, and at the same time gradually pave the way for abandoning protection. This is the game which he plays for the next few years, and I think the reader will not be wholly unamused in watching the skill, the audacity, and the unscrupulousness with which he played it. . . . Hitherto' the chief subject of This thesis, that an immediate return to protection was impossible, he enlarged on during his many election addresses,taking care, however, be it remarked, to hold out at the same time the hope that what .was impossible .for the moment would be possible by-and-by. It is this that constitutes the dishonesty of Mr Disraeli's action. The harm he did by keeping alive these hopes, which he knew to be false, is incalculable. It induced lethargy in both the landlord and the tenant, and throughout the entire community it kept up a dangerous feeling of uncertainty. I venture to say that, if the free-trade members of this House-wh o appear to be in a state of revolt against their leader upon the"" fiscal question-attemp t to raise that issue, after the pronounced way in which the people have declared in favour of protection, their action will be prompted by a desire to",40,Honourable Members O H

I must confess that I do not like the Federal Treasurer's proposal to accept part of the gross revenue of the States railways without taking over the administration of those railways. The Federal Convention was very careful to guard against the Commonwealth being made dependent upon the States for any portion of its revenue. That gathering distinctly declared that there should not be a direct contribution by the States towards the expenses of the Commonwealth, as it would makethe. Federation depend on the States. Therefore, I do not like the proposal of the' Federal Treasurer. dependent upon the States; because we should receive the money direct. would receive, the money, if it were available. But we should be dependent upon the disposition of the States to act generously to the Commonwealth by providing certain revenue. The Minister would also be employing States' officers for his own services, because all the railway men would be States officers in the employ of the Commonwealth. That is really the meaning of the Treasurer's interjection. have States officers whom he would not pay Sir Commonwealth officers. of their functions: In all other respects they would be States officers. Treasurer contends that they would be Commonwealth officers, I desire to know whether the Government would extend to them the provision in the Commonwealth Public Service Act that officers who have been three years in the service shall receive not less than ,£110 per annum? thing to do with them except through, the Commissioner. wpuld simply take over one State officer, whilst many States officers would receive Federal loans should not be taken over for some time to come. In view of the fact that at present the average price of States' bonds is £ 8 5 for every ,£100 that has been borrowed, I consider that the Treasurer is very wise in holding aloof from the London. money market in anticipation of a good time to come. He has to remember that in spite of the difficulties at present associated with the London money market, with its glut of undigested securities, the Russo-Japanese. war will mean, perhaps, that another ,£300,000,000 will have to be raised by lihose countries. If the Commonwealth goes into the English money market within the next five or six years, it will not be able to obtain anything but poor prices, I am glad to know that the Treasurer does not propose that the Commonwealth shall go into the London money market at the present time, and that he objects to take over any States bonds until he can obtain £ 1 0 0 for every £ 1 0 0 which we have to pay. It is impossible for him to know what will be the conditions that will obtain when the whole of these conversion loans are required. In the proposal submitted by him to the Conference of Treasurers, he shows that if he simply took over the three-fourths of the total Customs revenue now payable to the States, and did not touch the gross railway revenue of the States, the Customs revenue now going to New South Wales and Western Australia would meet the whole of their interest charges, while Tasmania, Victoriaj Queensland, and South Australia would be at most only about ,£100,000 behind. The proper course for the Government to pursue would be to take indeed, is the only course which is open to the Treasurer. Eveni f it were necessary for him to take over more bonds of one As the State than of another, he should take them over as they f a l l due, and he would find by the time that the last loans became payable that our population, and consequently our prosperity, had increased to such an extent that the three-fourths of the Customs revenue, now payable to the States, would be sufficient to meet interest on the I should have noloans, and that it would be unnecessary for him to touch the gross railway revenue of the States. In my opinion, it would be disastrous for the Commonwealth to trench upon the railway revenue of the States until we can take over the railways completely. moneys.

253,Mr Crouch,"Then the Governmenttake over these loans-and it is my desire that he should not approach the London money market until he can obtain ,£ioo for .£100I think he might very well set to work, immediately to establish a sinking fund. When the Tariff was before this House the leader of the Labour Party submitted a motion for the abolition of the tea duty, but stated that he would not object to such a duty if the money so raised were applied to a sinking fund for the extinction of our enormous indebtedness. By means of tea duties we should be able to raise ,£300,000 or ,£400,000 per annum. I do not think it would be wise for the Government to take over all the functions of a State bank; matters relating to private borrowing are much better left in the hands of private institutions. But one of the functions of banking that we might properly take over would be the issue of notes equal to the bank notes now in circulation in the Commonwealth, and which represent about ,£10,000,000. The money so derived, together with the amount raised by means of a duty on tea, could be devoted to a sinking fund for the purchase of State securitiesregardless of the State which had issued them-a t the lowest price at which they were available. In that way we should improve the credit of the State, and be able to buy at times when it would be most profitable for the Commonwealth to do so. system improve the credit of the States? were able to constantly buy up States bonds at £ 8 3 or £ 8 5 , it would thus force up the value of the stocks in the London market. It was a system of this kind that was really responsible for the fact that, until the South African war, English Consols were always above ,£100. The National Debt Commissioners were always in the market buying up English Consols, as opportunity offered. In the same way, if the Commonwealth purchased, from time to time, States bonds which were the lowest in the market, we should increase the price of the debentures, while at the same time our credit would be improved when we as a Commonwealth come into the market. We should, likewise, pave the way for a more profitable flotation of Commonwealth loans. This is a matter which should be carefully considered, because it would be most unwise for the Commonwealth to go into the market, even for conversion purposes purely, unless it could obtain for its bonds. Proposals were put before the Conference that .the Commonwealth should pay .£96 or ,£98 to convert State loans, but I do not believe in such conversions; they would mean a loss either to ourselves, or to the State. I think that, in each case, we should wait until the next State loan becomes due, leaving the State to float its own loan if the time is still inopportune for Australia to borrow, and then take over learned member think that the Commonwealth should borrow money to enable it to take over States bonds? mits it, and I have already proposed that a sinking fund should be established for the purposes of States bonds, and if myj suggestion were adopted, it would only be necessary for the Commonwealth to obtain the consent of the States to the diversion of their three-fourths of the tea duty to the object I have named. There is one other matter which I think should be brought under the notice of this House. I refer to the great falling off in our Customs revenue. I largely account for this decrease by the fact that the change of Ministers has led to the removal of that strict and honest administration which was carried on by the right honourable member for Adelaide when he was in office, and to the substitution of a system of interviews such as those which are now occurring in the Customs Department. The Customs revenue for the year 1901-2 was .£8,692,750, while that for 1902-3 was £9,451,686. I find that the figures relating to the Customs returns from June to December, 1902-3, and June to December, 1903-4, show that an absolute loss has occurred-that the collections for the last named period decreased by £200,096. the Minister for Trade and Customs. forward shortly after the present Minister for Trade and Customs took office. At that time he made a statement in the press that he was going to change what he regarded as the offensive methods adopted by his predecessor in bringing persons before the courts, and requiring them to be dealt with openly and fearlessly by . properly-constituted tribunals consisting of persons trained to undertake such duties.

They were followed by a speech of the leader of the Labour Party, which contained a peean of satisfaction with the results of the elections, with which that party, I think, are entitled to be gratified. That seems a recollection of a very long time ago; and now that we are in the third week of the session we find new debatable matter being brought forward, which seems likely to prolong the discussion still further. This afternoon we have had practically a grievance! day debate, 1 various details of administration rather than general questions of policy having been discussed I do not propose to f o l low the last speaker in the suggestionswhich he has made for dealing with that great question of the conversion of the debts of the States.

I hope that the whole question will be dealt with by the House in the: manner which, its magnitude, andits seriousness demand. As the result of the elections, we find ourselves, as nearly every member has admitted, in an almost, unworkable position. The only party which benefits by the situation, and will benefit by its continuance, is that which is so ably led by the honourable member for Bland. Last session, it will be admitted, many of the members of the Opposition afforded assistance to the Government when help was required. But that state of things cannot continue. The Government cannot expect to have the help of the Labour Party in regard to labour legislation, and then to depend upon the assistance of the moderate members of the Opposition in passing legislation which the Labour Party consider undesirable. It seems to me, and I am sure to many other honourable members, that the time has arrived when there should be some clear definition of parties in this House, and that the Government should be prepared with a policy uoon which it is ready to stand or f a l l.

It is true that Federation will 'never be completely and satisfactorily consummated until railway communication is established between Western Australia' and the eastern part of the continent; but I hold that there are many I do not think that that was the desirable enterprises upon which the Commonwealth should embark before that work is taken, in hand.

330,Mr Bamford (Herbert),"S o muchGovernor-General's Speech, I desire to refer to the Kanaka question. To a North Queenslander the Kanaka question is very much in the position of King Charles' head to the late lamented Mr Dick. A few days ago, I asked the Prime Minister a series of questions with regard to the arrangements for the conveyance of time-expired islanders to their homes. He said that the matter was one for the Queensland. Government to attend to, and that, so far, he had heard no complaints as to any of the islanders having been unable to leave. I may tell the Prime Minister that he is notlikely to hear any complaints. I admit that upon this question the present Government in Queensland is much more sympathetic than its immediate 'predecessor, and that it may adopt an attitude different from that previously assumed by the authorities. At the same time, I am afraid'that the matter does not altogether rest with the Government, because there are officers who are specially appointed to attend to the requirements of those islanders who desire to return to their homes. I am very sorry to say that many people, who Ought to be ashamed of themselves for doing so, have been in the habit of trying to beguile the simple islanders by misrepresentations. When an islander's first term of service has expired, at the end of three years, every effort is made to persuade him to sign an agreement for another six months, or for a longer period, if possible, and, among other things, he is told that there is no ship ready have the means of doing so placed at their to take him back to his home. Of course, in these cases, the islanders are not able to speak very good English, and' are practically at the mercy of those who desire to keep them in the State. I am -credibly informed 'that in many cases the Government agent, who, above all others,"" should protect the interests of the islanders, helps to delude them, by representing that there is no boat ready to return them to .their homes. When I was last in Northern Queensland I met an islander who had been .fifteen years in the State. He had with him his daughter, twelve years of age, who had been born in Queensland, and he told me that he was most anxious to go back to his own people and take with him his daughter, so that she might he made acquainted with her relatives. He had then been trying for three months to obtain a permit to enable him to go to some other port, and there wait for a ship ""to take him' away.' Several other boys were with him, arid I Mr Bam fori. was informed that they had completed their agreements, and were at that very time being induced to sign another agreement to work on the plantations for a further six months, or a longer term. Whilst indentured boys are waiting for a ship to take them back, they have to be kept by their late employers, who have to find them in rations and house room. Those who accept re-engagements, however, have, upon the expiration of their service, to keep themselves. In either case the money -which is paid over to the islander at the expiration, of his term dwindles away during the period of waiting. It is the ambition of every islander to take back' with him a certain amount of trade, and if, through the depletion of his resources, he finds himself unable to do this, he generally signs a further agreement. If what I have -described occurred when ships were leaving, with tolerable frequency, during at least nine months of the year, how much more is it likely -to happen now that no ships are leaving for the Islands to bring back recruits? The Prime Minister said that the matter was one for the consideration of the State Government, but I contend that a great responsibility rests upon' this Parliament. We have stopped recruiting, and have thereby reduced the number of ships available to take these islanders back to their homes. Therefore, it is our duty -to see that those who desire to go back--and the Kanakas do in the great .majority of cases so desire-shal l disposal. I hope that the Prime Minister will take this matter into his earnest consideration. If the islanders have been deluded in the past there is .no reason why they should .not have fair play in the future. I make these representations in their interests. For many years the employers have had the big end of the stick, and have dominated the position and I think it is our duty to see that the islanders have fair play, so far as we can assure it. This is a question which, as a member of the Labour Party, and as a representative of Queensland, I should not desire to bring forward, if it could be avoided. We regard the* whole of the legislation passed by the State Legislature in regard to the introduction of islanders to work on sugar plantations with regret, -and we should be only too pleased to wash our hands of the whole business. The matter to which I have referred is, however, a very important one, and deserves our earnest attention. In isolated instances the Government agents may have done their duty, but in a great many cases they have played into the hands of the planters. had intended to refer to the interjection made by the honourable member for Parramatta, with regard to the assistance given to the members of the Labour Party by the Government at the last election, but I think that the matter has already been sufficiently dealt with. me, or to any other member of our party, so far as I am aware. The Prime Minister himself appeared upon the public platform in. Victoria tohelp one candidate who was opposing a member, of the Labour Party. I do not find any fault with, hisaction upon that occasion,.because Ministers were at per-feet liberty to help their own supporters. I object, however, to thestatements that, they have, given any assistance to members of the Labour Party. I am one of those who have serious complaints to make, regarding the administration of. the Electoral Act. Speaking from, my experience in my own electorate, I can confidently assert that the Act was maladministered in thegrossest possible, way: I reported, several glaring breaches of the Act to the returning officer, butupon. my. arrival in Melbourne I found that the Chief Electoral Officer knew nothing about any such reports; It.has been, stated that in Victoria and New South Wales numbers corresponding with those on the roll were written upon the face of the ballot-papers, and that, the corners of the papers were then turned down. In one place in my electorate I lost a. large number of votes owing to this, practice. In that particular instance, the presiding officer did not even have the decency to turn down the corner of the paper. He wrote the number ""on the face of the ballot-paper, and thereby robbed the ballot of its secrecy. In the State electorate of Herbert, the presiding officer, in. violation of the Act, declared at each polling place the number of votes recorded there. At one place, owing to influences which I deplore, only nine votes were recorded, and they were all given against me. That, of course, showed that the electors who voted had no judgment. I took the precaution to go to that place beforehand and tell every one who had a vote that the ballot was absolutely secret. During the passage of the Electoral B ill through the House, references were made to the practices indulged in in various States, with a view to ascertain how tLs votes of the electors were cast, and. my electorate was no exception to the rule in that regard. I told the electors at the place referred to that they need not fear I that their votes would be disclosed, because the voting papers would be taken to the principal polling place and there mixed with others before the count in such a way that they would become unidentifiable. What will those people now think of me? The previous practice was so contrary to There was no help given to that which I . described that possibly they thought I was lying to them, and results would appear to justify their belief. I ask the Minister for Home Affairs what is to be done in' reference to these matters. Are the electoral officials to be permitted to flout the Act as they please? When the B ill was under discussion every precaution possible was taken by honourable members to make the ballot absolutely secret. Now we find that, owing to the stupidity, or something worse,of the presiding officers, cr of some one else; the secrecy of the ballot has been violated. I think that some action ought to be taken in reference to this matter. I do not blame the Chief. Electoral Officer. Nevertheless, this action is all. of a piece with the maladministration of which so much complaint has. been made during the course of this debate. I should like to say a few words'upon the subject of the Federal Capital. Members of the Opposition have discussed this question at great length, but I have no hesitationin affirming that if the Sydney newspapers wouldabstain from saying anything about it for one month, it would be absolutely dead. and I am aware that the question is destitute of all life beyond that which is put into it by the Sydney press. The great majority of the people do not care anything about it. Some, of course, would like it to be speedily settled, because they imagine that it would provide plenty of work. I would remind honourable members that, upon the 30th September, 1902, a. vote was recorded in this House upon a proposal by the Treasurer to borrow '£500,000. The leading members of the Opposition voted against that proposal upon principle, and I commend them for it. another principle to which regard should be paid, namely, that undertakings should be fulfilled.",52,Edwards Socialis M Is Tion Of The Community

With the exception of Western Australia, all the States are in necessitous to divide the number in question by two. circumstances. I am satisfied that great friction would be caused if the Treasurer attempted to retain the whole of the 75 20,000,000 odd. per cent, of the Customs revenue to which balance to the building of a Federal ber's Capital. tangible asset in the shape of the territory required 10 lbs. of fodder per week, that which we acquired? we should j but it would be a long time 50,000 tons.

Personally I agree with the honourable and learned member for Corio that the questions of the carriage of mails and of possible, even had the fodder duties been the conveyance of frozen rabbits to England suspended, to alleviate the existent should ' have been kept entirely separate. The honourable member for Kooyong has accused members of the-Labour Party of being socialists. We consider it an honour to be regarded as such. But I would ask that honourable member, who finds fault with us on the ground that we are socialists,' why he recommends what is purely a socialistic doctrine? He asks that our mail boats should carry butter, the honourable fruit, and rabbits in refrigerating chambers, and that they should be subsidized by the Government. I hold that the two questions should be kept quite separate. If ever surely it is in connection with the carriage of perishable produce. The trouble which has fallen upon the Postmaster-General in failing to secure satisfactory tenders for the conveyance of our mails is not due to section 16 of the Post and Telegraph Act, but is entirely the result of the other conditions which have been inserted in the contracts. I was very sorry to find another matter that I regarded as dead galvanized into life to the matter of the fodder duties.

How could the people of New South Wales have provided that money ? Honourable members should also bear in mind that in my calculation I have simply allowed for the fodder being landed upon the wharfs at Sydney. I wish now to address myself for a few moments to the remarks of the honourable and learned member for Parkes, who never appears to such advantage as when he is delivering a homily to members of the Labour Party. We all acknowledge his lucidity, his ability, his courtesy, and the manner in which he treats his subject; but we differ from"" him in his deductions from facts. Party, he declared that its members are socialists, and that they are ruining the Commonwealth-that the policy which we are striving to thrust upon the community is destroying the public credit. He also remarked that we had not read history, otherwise we should not take up the position that we do. I say that we are students of history, and that it is the events of the past which have forced us, willy-nilly, to adopt the 'policy we have. Individualism has been the curse of the world, and it is time that the system was altered; The honourable member for Kooyong says that we desire to bring, down every one to a dead level. But, in this connection, I would invite honourable members for a few moments to look at the position of Tasmania. That is a country where individualism has always been rampant, and I am perfectly certain that if the honourable member had his way, that state of things would continue. Until within aj few months ago, no labour member had ever entered a Parliament as a representative of Tasmania. What is the position of that State to-day? It possesses a good deal of cultivable land, and enjoys a magnificent climate and fertile soil, but we find that, to use a colloquialism, it is as much "" up to its neck in debt"" as is any of the other States. I am informed that the State Government of Tasmania closed the last financial year with a deficit of. ,£30)000, while the financial operations of the previous year showed a deficiency of £176,000 . land ? vidualistic policy there. legislation. land, as elsewhere, we suffered from the banking crisis of I8Q3» I wish honourable members to now turn their attention to another country in the same latitude, but possessing certainly a much larger area than that of Tasmania. In the matter of soil and climate, however, it enjoys no advantage over that State. I refer to New Zealand. In the one case the rule of the individualists is supreme, while in the other there is more socialism to the square yard than is to be found in any other country. MrO ' MALLEY In the days of individualism New Zealand was nearly bankrupt. its position was as bad as is the position of Tasmania to-day. If the honourable and learned member for Parkes were to read the history of the lands of the Southern Hemisphere as he does that of other lands, I am satisfied that he would arrive at the conclusion that the socialistic regime in New Zealand is vastly superior to the system which exists in Tasmania, and of which he approves. didly just now. ' three labour representatives in the Farliament of that State. I have a few figures here from the "" Politician's Bible"" Mr O'MALLEY -The honourable member refers to the Bulletin. ""Democrats' Bible."" I refer to Coghlan. I desire to bring under the notice of honourable members some figures relative to the rate of interest earned by the railway systems of Tasmania and New Zealand. On page 344 of Coghlan, a table is given showing the interest returned on capital expenditure for a period of five years, and. an examination of that table will show that the highest rate of interest paid by the Tasmanian railways during the period in question was 1.56 per cent.; whilst the lowest paid by the New Zealand railway .system during the same period was 3*29 per cent. A similar state of affairs exists in relation to other matters. The people of Tasmania have no old-age pension system, such as exists in New Zea land, but they pay 5s. 9d. per head towards the alleviation of distress; whereas in New Zealand, in addition to a system of",55,Edwards Socialis M Is Tion Of The Community

Mr O'MALLEY -^There of persons destitute there. honourable member for New England, I would say that if Tasmania is so prosperous as he would have us believe, why is it that her population is continually decreasing ? in population. the population statistics for a period of seventeen years, and shows that, while there was a small excess of arrivals over departures during a period of eight years, there was . an excess of departures over arrivals during the remaining period of nine years. In 1902 there was an excess of. departures over arricialism that I should like to see there; but vals in Tasmania, whereas in New Zealand the excess of arrivals over departures was nearly 8,000. compared physically? tions of both countries are almost identical. difference in the area of the respective States. Tasmania has about 16,000 square miles, while the areaof New Zealand is 64,000 square miles, and in thefigureswith which I had intended to delight the HouseI had worked out the difference. But where ever the statistics given are'per head of the population the question of area is not affected, and these figures show that New Zealand is far ahead of Tasmania. Let me take, for example, the dairying industry. Coghlan gives us some interesting figures relating to the output of butter, milk, and -cheese.' He shows that the Tasmanian output of these commodities for 1902 was of the estimated value of ,£446,000, whereas that of New -Zealand was of the value of ,£2,608,000. Allowing for the difference in area, and therefore dividing the £2,608,000 by four, we find how far Tasmania lags behind New Zealand. knows perfectly .well that Tasmania has but a very limited extent of good land. . . plies to New Zealand, a great deal of whose territory is periodically disturbed by an earthquake. Nothing could be more indicative of the relative position of the two countries than are the figures relating to education, and I find that whilst Tasmania are thousands expends ,£58,318 on the administration and maintenance of its education system, New Zealand expends £494,6211 tive revenues? I am endeavouring to show that if Tasmania were governed under laws similar to those, which prevail in New Zealand, it would be more prosperous. If the honourable member looks at the figures he will arrive at the conclusion to which I have come, that under the two differing systems of legislation should compare Tasmania with Queensland, where there are socialistic principles in force. it is comingfast, and' I am glad' to know that this-remark applies also to Tasmania, which has returned a rabid socialist to this -Parliament. honourable member was very pleased to obtainthat majority. Nothing can be said in favour of individualism as against socialism. The honourable and learned member for Parkes is certainly a student of history. He speaks of the astigmatic vision of the Labour Party, a remark that I think should be applied to his own, and I would commend these matters to his consideration. Another question to which the honourable and learned member referred was that of conciliation and arbitration. He spoke of the Moseley Commission, consisting of twenty-six working men, which left Great Britain for the United States in order to compare the industrial life of the two countries. The honourable and learned member said that the members of that Commission returned from the United States of America firm in the resolve to have nothing to do with the principle of conciliation. As a matter of fact, there is no system of conciliation and arbitration in operation in the United States of America. Why, therefore, should the honourable and learned member, in his effort to make the best of a bad case, introduce such a suggestion? There was no principle' of conciliation and arbitration in the United States of America; consequently the Moseley' Commission could not have been impressed by",56,Edwards Socialis M Is Tion Of The Community

368,Mr Bamford,"I am sure that theanything that they saw there which had a bearing upon the subject. Reference was also made by the honourable and learned member to the withdrawal of money from Australia. Some persons are always complaining that capital is being withdrawn from the States, but they rarely, if ever, get down to actual facts. The honourable and learned member for Parkes, however, gave us one concrete case, and asserted that one institution-the Scottish Widows had instructed its manager to withdraw, within a period of twelve months, some ^£2,000,000 which it had invested in Australia, and to send it to some other place in which 4 per cent, could be obtained. Coghlan shows, however, that all the money invested in Australia has paid an average of 4 per cent. were not* so sure of their securitv here. question was not directly invested by this institution in any industry. The manager was simply making a profit by lending the money to some one else to invest. Statements such as .these with regard to the withdrawal of capital from Australia require something in the way of detail to establish their credibility^ I suppose I may be permitted to say a few' words upon the subject of preferential trade. ing the electoral campaign I was asked now and again, usually by some person the worse for liquor, what I thought of preferential trade, and I replied that later on I would give an opinion about it. I am sorry that the subject has been referred to in the Governor General's Speech. At the present stage it is an academic question rather than one of practical interest. It is in the clouds. English Tariff were adopted. Then, as There is no need to discuss it during the lifetime of this Parliament, at any rate. When the English people have made up their .minds as to what they require, and ask us .to come to terms, it will be time enough to consider the matter. Until then it will be only a waste of time to discuss it. question of free-trade or protection. During the very able address delivered by the honourable member for Richmond a few nights ago, some one interjected that we have no such .thing -as free-trade. I auite admit the truth of that remark. It was also stated that we have no such thing as protection. That is also true. The Commonwealth Tariff is the result of the conflict between two parties holding opposite fiscal views. But while the protectionist is not afraid of his policy, the free-trader is afraid of free-trade. I am not speaking now as a protectionist. member still a fiscal atheist? will ask for all the protection they can get, and still hold out their hands for more; but free-traders will not accept free-trade at any price; they would not touch it with a long stick. I could count upon the fingers of one hand the members of the Opposition who are willing to adopt the policy of free trade. I am not rabid upon the fiscal question. If honourable members opposite will give us a free-trade policy-if they will: say, ""We will abolish customs houses altogether,"" I will go with them. If they, sav, "" We will give you the English Tariff,"" I will go with them. But I will have nothing to do with the fiscal faking which takes 5 per cent, off one article, puts 6 per cent, upon another, and calls itself free-trade. We all admit that the Commonwealth must raise a large amount of revenue, and if honourable members opposite will show that they have the courage of their convictions, by proposing a policy of taxation similar to that of Great Britain, I will join their ranks. But if their leaders proposed such a policy, how soon their ranks would -be decimated ! Where should we find the honourable members for Kooyong, Grampians, and Wentworth? orable member's arms. would have nothing to do with the direct taxation which would be necessary if the they are afraid to adopt a free-trade policy, what is the use of coming here and talking about it ad nauseam. ation will the Government give us ? not the courage of their convictions any Connected with it is, .of course, the"" more than the free-traders have. I am a candid friend upon this occasion. A great deal has been said during the debate about the third party.

But what the third party lacks in numbers it gains in coherence. Mr O'MALLEY -And in intelligence. members of the Ministerial and Opposition parties think that the present position should not continue, why do they allow it to do so? If the members of the Labour Party were using influence to prevent a coalition between the two other parties, they might have reason for complaint, but we are standing severely aloof. shoving the other side with all its force. any force at all yet. the Labour Party are like the Innocents Abroad. : innocents, we are not very much abroad. If the two other parties wish to have two parallel lines instead of a triangle,. the members of the Labour Party are quite willing to make one line, and to take their seats upon the Opposition benches. I am afraid that the time has not yet arrived when we can keep the Ministerial benches warm. Reference has been made in the debate to the administration of the Defence Department. The honourable , member for Maranoa, in his usual terse and bellicose style, and the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, have addressed themselves to the regulations which have been published. One can only wonder that a gentleman in the position of the General Officer Commanding, and so able a statesman as the Minister for Defence, should waste their time in framing such regulations. Some of those who have spoken during the debate have severely criticised the action of the Labour Party in voting for the reduction of the Defence expenditure In my opinion, it is a good thing that the Estimates were cut down. I agree with those who think that a change should be made in the administration of that Department to meet the undoubted wish of this House. No honourable member likes to see money, wasted upon frill and tomfoolery, upon which a great deal has been expended in the past. I believe that the Minister for Defence has the welfare of our citizen forces, and of our rifle clubs, at heart, and that he is as good a Minister as we have so far had; at any rate, he devotes himself to his duties most attentively. I deprecate, however, the manner in which the citizen forces and the rifle clubs have been treated. In my electorate the members of rifle clubs are expected, not only to buy their own rifles, but even to furnish their own ranges. Such a thing is monstrous, and must lead to the disbandment of many clubs which have been a long time in existence, and have done good service. With regard to the treatment given to officers, I should like to read the following paragraph which appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph some time ago:ONE MA N ONE COOK. The importance of the commissariat branch in the military service is well recognised, but the Arbitration Court yesterday was struck with surprise when a cook related how on the occasion of a recent encampment a mess of five officers had of a culinary staff of five to attend to their inner wants. Asked by way of preliminary what remuneration he had received while in camp, the witness blandly replied, ""Seven bob a day."" ""But you had assistance,"" continued counsel. ""Oh, yes,"" was the answer, ""four artillerymen helped me."" ""What?"" gasped the astonished barrister, ""five persons to cook for five other persons ! DoI understand you to say that?"" ""That's right,"" was the reply, ""but they were officers, and they often entertain their lady friends with afternoon tea."" That sort of thing brings ridicule upon the Defence Forces. right honourable gentleman occupied the high and honourable position of Minister for Defence he indulged in these little luxuries, and therefore sympathizes with others.

Gentlemen who have the handling of a great deal of money are not always the very highest authorities upon finance; and it appears to me that the scheme propounded by the honourable and learned member for Corio is a very sensible one, and worthy of careful consideration. The Labour Party will discuss the subject in extenso before the sesbooths had been provided-for at one or two sion is brought' to an end, and we shall take the earliest opportunity of presenting our views to the House. only hope for the representatives of New South Wales who desire to see the Federal Capital established is to place the Labour Party upon the Ministerial benches. We shall then be able to demonstrate how the -Federal Capital can be established without involving the necessity of burdening the people of the Commonwealth with one shilling of extra taxation. We have a practicable scheme which will commend itself to even the honourable member for Parramatta, who is so hypercritical in these matters. I agree with the honourable member' for Capricornia that short speeches should be the rule upon an occasion, of this kind, and I hope that 1 have not transgressed the limits of endurance. When fully 75 per cent, of the representatives in the House have spoken, one natural!v feels a desire to unburden himself, and hence I was prompted to address the House. In conclusion, I would again express the hope that the Prime Minister will give his serious consideration to the Kanaka question, to which I directed his attention in the early part of mv speech. of the large number of honourable members who have spoken and the time that has already been occupied by the debate, I shall endeavour to curtail my remarks. I presume that the last general election is a subject of interest to all honourable members, and I am quite with the leader of the Opposition and the leader of the Labour Party in asking that there shall be a full inquiry into the administration of the Electoral Act. I do not support this request in any spirit, of antagonism to the Government, or in any spirit of personal animosity to the Chief Electoral Officer. I do not ask for an execution, but simply for an inquiry. great deal of blundering in connection with the elections. The Minister for Home Affairs holds the idea that those who succeeded at the elections should be content to allow matters to rest, but I do not exactly share that view. For example, in my electorate the returning officer, who was a thoroughly capable and experienced man, had always been consulted previously, as to where polling booths should be provided, but on the last occasion a' list was forwarded to him from Sydney, and he was instructed to arrange for booths at the places therein named. I saw that no places where a large number of electors resided. I pointed this out to the re-: The turning officer, who quite agreed with me, and wired to Sydney pointing out the desirability of having polling booths at the places referred to, and also representing that a booth would not be required at one of the localities mentioned in the list, because, since the previous election, all the former residents had left, and only one man, a caretaker, remained.

There was not a house of any kind, or even a tent, that could be used as a polling booth, and it was suggesed that a carpenter, should be sent out to erect a booth. The returning officer, however, felt that that would involve unnecessary expense, and it was eventually arranged that the presiding officer and the poll clerk should take out with them a hooded buggy, and that that should be used as a polling booth. These two men were sent forty or fifty miles from the centre of population to a place at which there were no voters, and they had to spend the day in idleness. The only vote recorded was that of either the poll clerk or the presiding officer. Two or three places at which' there had previously been polling booths were omitted from the list I think that there was a furnished by the electoral authorities, and the consequence was that zoo or 300 persons in the back-blocks were unable to record their votes.

I understand that, under the old agreement, which was in operation for six or seven years, we joined the Imperial Government in paying the companies mentioned .,£170,000 per annum. amount we contributed .£75,000; whilst the Imperial Government made up the balance. These subsidies were given with Mr Thomas. four distinct objects. The policy of the Imperial Government, which, I presume; we followed so far .as the mail subsidy was concerned, was to subsidize mail steamers first, for the carrying of the mails; secondly, in order to assist the shipbuilding industry; thirdly, to provide swift armed cruisers; and fourthly, to maintain the supremacy of British comGovernment. merce. I take it that we are all in accord with these objects, but I hold that it is unfair to charge the Post Office with the There were a numwhole of the. expense entailed in achieving them. I understand that formerly the Imperial Post Office Department was not charged with the whole of the subsidy, but that the Admiralty had to contribute a large proportion of it. That, I think, was only fair. The Post Office should be charged only with the proportion, given to the comof having them panies for the carriage of the mails. Money contributed with other objects, in-view should be debited, to other departments. Our policy Whilst these matters may has been to provide not only for the carriage of our mails, but also for refrigerating space for. the transport of perishable produce.

396,Mr Thomas,"But we want aThe fact that the mail steamers do .not deliver their letters as quickly as they might can very easily be demonstrated. .Honourable members will .recollect, that, except upon one or two occasions, the Cuzco, which has practically become obsolete, was always .able to land her mails within the contract time. It is, .therefore, apparent that vessels of the trade, are .accustomed to travel upon the class of the Orotttes and Mongolia could deliver their mails much more quickly; but of course it does not pay them to do so. They are subsidized, I believe, to the extent of about .£3,000 per round trip. To accomplish the voyage sooner they would necessarily require to consume a greater quantity of coal. Consequently, there is no inducement to the companies to deliver our mails earlier. If the Commonwealth arranges to pay poundage rates for the carriage of its letters, a great saving will be effected. I understand that a charge .of Jd. for each letter weighing half-an-ounce would be equivalent to £ 7 5 per ton. But I would point out that these vessels are willing to carry ordinary freight for £ 3 . per ton, and surely our mails are a cargo which is worth considering. If Australian letters were forwarded to England by the first boat leaving our shores, with the proviso that any person could indicate .upon them the particular boat by which he desired them to be sent, we should, at least, be insured a fast service. I should .not allow our mails to be carried, by either .the French or German companies at first. If the other companies formed a shipping ring, and refused to deliver mails within a certain time, I should then be quite willing to throw the carriage of our letters open to the competition of the French and German boats. destructive socialist, because I believe in the destruction of poverty and hunger. If we could not obtain competition, I should be prepared to vote for a proposal to run our own boats, though I presume that as long as Lord Selbome is a director of the P. and O. Co., as well as a Cabinet Minister, some difficulty would be experienced in doing this. I am satisfied that if we could capitalize the!, amount which the Imperial and Commonwealth Governments disburse by way of subsidy, we should' be able to secure vessels equally well fitted with the best of those engaged in the present service. I am aware that there are some people who urge that the traveller to-day can secure better accommodation and treatment upon the French and German mail .steamers than he can upon the. P. and O. .or Orient boats. AlthoughI am a free-trader, I frankly confess that when I travelwhich I do very occasionallyI like to ,do so upon a vessel flying the British -flag. Some honourable members, however, who advocate preferential German and .French mail stamers. I assume, therefore, with some justification, that the accommodation upon these boats is superior lo that which is to be found upon the P. and O. and Orient vessels. When the officers of the latter are asked what is the explanation of this, they usually exclaim, "" Oh, but look at the tremendous' subsidies which they ;receive."" But I would point out that the same argument is applicable to other lines. Let us take the White Star Company as an example. I Believe that that company has afforded an opportunity to thousands of persons to visit the old country who otherwise could not have done so. It has also enabled a large number of people to come to. Australia who never would have faced the discomforts of a sea trip as steerage passengers in the P. and O. or Orient boats. That being so, I do not see why the White Star Company and other lines should not participate in .this subsidy. .Personally, I object to the payment of any subsidy. suggest that the Cape route is sufficiently expeditious for the carriage of mails ? equal opportunities to every compan)'. suggested by the honourable member, a mail despatched from the Commonwealth this I am a week would probably not arrive in England until after letters which are forwarded two weeks hence. guarantee that the boats would go direct. go direct, the people would soon discover the fact.

I belong to see that it does not do so. period of three years, as I hope it will, it will be the duty of the Labour Party to see that a Commonwealth system of old age pensions is secured. that such a system cannot be established as long as the ""Braddon Blot"" remains; but I should like to learn from the Prime Minister whether there is anything so sacred about a land-values tax that it is impossible to raise the necessary funds by means of such taxation. Why should a landvalues tax be held to be sacred? Is it something, like the Ark of the Covenantonce we touch it are we to die? States it has already been touched. ment have not been backward in taxing the food supplies of the people. They have succeeded in imposing duties on condensed ' milk, rice, porridge, tinned meats, and fish, and many other articles of everyday consumption. I am told that there is a duty on even ginger ale. What, therefore, can there be about a land-values tax that should deter the Government from taking action in the direction I have suggested? While the ""Braddon Blot"" exists it must be impossible to provide for a Commonwealth system of old-age pensions merely from the Customs revenue; but there is no reason why we should not raise the necessary amount by means of a land tax. All that is required is courage on the part of the Prime Minister. If the honourable and learned gentleman proposed to provide for old-age pensions by means of land taxation he would, of course; arouse the hostility of every daily newspaper in Australia. He certainly would not bask in the smiles of the rich. The wealthy people of the Commonwealth, whether free-traders or protectionists, would oppose such -a proposal. tax every time that a proposal of the kind was submitted to . the Victorian Parliament, and on two occasions I myself submitted such a proposition. statement from the Prime Minister; it gives us reason to hope that he will have the courage to introduce a system of old age pensions to be financed by means of a land-values tax.

Let Mr Cham,"Chamberlain had said that, if the Colonies did not want preferential trade he would be prepared to abandon the fight, but that it was on behalf of the Colonies-thos e who had done so much for Great Britain-that he was prepared to make a sacrifice. There is a political party in the mother country which is being handicapped by the action of the Commonwealth Government. Personally, I do not think that the Conservative or Protectionist Party has a hope at the next general election in England. But, at the same time, it is an unfair thing 'to call upon thousands and tens of thousands of the people of England to vote out of sentiment for the Colonies, when, if that appeal had not been made to them, they would go into another camp. I feel very strongly upon that point. I feel that if an amendment were brought forward against our own Government at this juncture it would not be a fair and square fight, from the point of view of a number of honourable members, because it would concern issues which are quite apart from that of preferential trade. Some would vote against the Government because they were anxious to remove certain sections from our legislation. would vote against them for other reasons. Right Honourable Joseph Chamberlain out here would not in itself be a sufficient reason for endeavouring to displace them. So that I say that it is only fair to Australia, to Mr Chamberlain, and to the people of England that we should have laid upon the table of the House the exact proposals of the Government as soon as they are prepared to submit them. be discussed absolutely on their merits, and the people of England of all political parties know exactly where we are.

No one can complain that it is "" flat, stale, and unprofitable,"" and that there is nothing in it to interest anybody. We have seen manifestoes and Governor's Speeches which were marked by that characteristic. But this is decidedly an interesting programme, and whether we agree with it in detail or not there can be no doubt that there is. something in it for' everybody I shall pass over, the references to international matters, which usually mean nothing, and come down to the first part of the programme, concerning which every honourable member who has spoken has prefaced his remarks by explaining his attitude. In connection with that subject there has been a very decided, unwarranted, malicious, and. malignant attack madeupon a certain party in this House, which is called the third party. We have been challenged to explain our presence here. We have been challenged to deifine our position, our theory; and the political school to which Others we belong. One honourable member was The fact that they invited the concerned as to what socialism meant, and many people have been cudgelling their brains to find out what is meant by that word.

We can make no such distinction. I could not go before those who sent me here, and say that I am prepared to place a large, important, respectable, and intelligent section of the community outside the scope of the Bill. I think that I was elected largely because I refused to make such an invidious distinction between one class and another.

There is always a right of appeal from court to We have all court, until the Privy Council is reached. But the disputes which will be brought before the Commonwealth Arbitration Court will rarely have to' do with the question of wages.

Any decision of a Commonwealth Court in that case would not have interfered with the State Budget. The only question upon which I can understand the action of the Prime Minister in this case. He went to Ballarat and there issued a Ministeral manifesto, in which he said that he was not prepared to apply the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to public servants and seamen. The country endorsed nine-tenths counting noses it will be found that a majority of those whom the electors have returned here are in favour of applying the provisions of the measure to those classes.

Government to bow to the will of the people, and, as democrats, the Government ought to do so. The Prime Minister put his manifesto before the country at Ballarat, and that manifesto was endorsed by the people, with the qualification that they differed from the head of the Government on a matter of detail, but not on a matter of principle. The Government have no right to stake their existence on any but a matter of principle.

We cannot have any invidious distinctions, and we are not going to stultify our Conciliation and. Arbitration Bill by excluding a highly respectx able and numerous section of the community. I have a word or two to say about preferential tirade. I need hardly tell honourable members that I rejoice exceedingly that a proposal of the kind has come before us. I am heart and soul in favour of the principles laid down or suggested by Mr Chamberlain, not only recently, but as far back as 1896. It is always painful to. find one's self in a minority, but when the great war fever or furore was on, I was one who look what was regarded as an unpatriotic view, and expressed opinions which could be, and were, misconstrued into disloyalty. I took that view because I do not; I want, the I had no' fai'th in Mr Chamberlain, who forsook the party for whom I fought loyally as a member of the rank and file in the old country for twenty years. I felt that I ought ""to speak out, and I did speak out, and taking an unpopular view, I had to bear opprobrium as a . pro-Boer. I am heartily glad, however, to be able to endorse Mr Chamberlain's proposal in the direction of free-trade, because I feel sure that, if we are to bind the distant membra disjecta of this ""Empire into solidarity, there must be a union of interest.as well as a. union of sentiment.
