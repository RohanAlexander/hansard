Chanter) -During the discussion on the Industrial Peace Bill yesterday, the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) raised a point of order. The honourable member said that on a previous occasion I had given a ruling that the matter then under discussion was sub judice, and was therefore not in order, and he contended that the Industrial Peace Bill is not properly before the House, because there are 42 cases before, or about to come before, the A r b i tration Court, and that these were therefore sub judice. The former case was entirely a personal one, dealing with an individual, and the case of the Industrial Peace Bill being altogether different, I ruled that it was properly before the House. It is now for the House to decide the question. [11.24] I move That Mr Deputy Speaker's ruling-That tbe Industrial Peace Bill is properly before the House for discussion-be dissented from.

TheI n dustrial PeaceB ill is one that very much concerns Australia, and I am sorry to have to take an objection of this kind on such a measure. I might, however, have to wait a long time, or create an opportunity, to show bow dangerous it isthough I might use stronger language-to accept by a party vote the ruling of the Speaker or Deputy Speaker, merely on some precedent that may have been established at some time or other, without considering the effects it may have on future developments here.

To this I object; and submit that it is bad at law, or, at any rate, contrary to common sense, to , rule that no matter what case is before a Court, or what is done in regard to it , that case shall not be discussed here. What is there particularly surrounding the name of Jerger that should make his case different from any other? The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan), on the previous occasion, was not dealing, with a case that was sub judice, but with a question that was being dealt with by Sir Robert GarI have been a ran, as to the guilt of Jerger, while the case'before the Court was in reference to the powers of the Commonwealth to My experience deport. Such a ruling, if allowed to stand, will block business and land us up against a brick wall; and I was surprised that it should have been supported by honourable members opposite. As I say, it was foolish to block our business in this way, when the desired end coul l have been oltained in another way, without establishing any dangerous precedent. I believe in majority rule, and if I had charge of the House, with a majority, I would insist on ruling tbe House, but I would do it in a proper way. I would not get a decision from the Speaker to block procedure, but would move that the honourable member addressing the House be no longer heard, or that "" The question be now put."" That course would not establish an undesirable precedent, involving trouble on futur e As to the occasions. My desire now is-merely to show how bad that previous decision was, and I submit that the present case is one on all-fours. The Industrial PeaceB ill concerns hundreds of thousands of On that occasion, when I was workers, whose cases are before the Arbi tration Court, and, therefore, sub judice.

57,Mr Tudor,"I think I am entitled topropose to support the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) in his dissent from Mr Deputy Speaker's ruling; but he should certainly be able to claim the vote of every honourable member who supported the ruling and defeated the motion of dissent to which I have just alluded. However, if honourable members were now to carry this motion of dissent, the position would be that Parliament would not be able to discuss any Bill for the amendment of any Act which was involved in any Court case. I am convinced that honourable members behind the Government were in the wrong when they voted as they did the other day, but I do not propose to perpetuate that wrong by now placing myself in a false position. Melbourne Ports was rightly incensed at being prevented from discussing a case which, although it was held to be sub judice, was not sub judice in the ordinary acceptation of the term. However, no good can be gained at this stage by objecting to the House proceeding with the In dustrial Peace Bill on the ground that its subject-matter is sub judice. I take the view that the Bill is rightly before this Chamber, and that Mr Deputy Speaker is in the right in permitting debate upon itif Parliament found that it was unable to amend the Arbitration Act so long as there was a single case pending before the Arbitration Court. [11.33] -The contention of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Government could not be blamed for Mathews) that, because there are cases before the Federal Arbitration Court, this House has no right to discuss or legisnicality ""was not availed of in another late upon matters dealing with the subject of industrial unTest, has only to be stated in order to be ruled out of order.

However, the In -so , possibly, influencing the presiding Judge or the jury. There is nothing in the Industrial Peace Bill which could influence or interfere with the jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court in the matter of cases before it at this moment. [139] matter of the Jerger case. thoroughly well established that Parliament may not deal with matters which are sub judice; otherwise, there would be no such thing as 'trial by jury. Judgments would, in effect, be passed by politicians from the floor of Parliament, in that they would be inflaming tbe people either for or against a case in Oourt. Juries might easily be influenced; Judges themselves might be swayed; and there would be an end of British justice. The issue involved in the previous motion of dissent, to which allusion has been made, had to do with the point whether or not a certain case was sub judice. Whether The honourable member, for it was or not I do not know; but the fact is that it was so reported to Mr Speaker. And, if the case was sub judice, Parliament had no right to discuss it. However, I emphasize that there is no con-' nexion between that matter and the issue raised by the present motion of dissent. I hope honourable members will vote unanimously against it. I take the opportunty to protest against a decision of this House with lespect to a recent ruling from the Chair. If honI t would be a very serious position orable members who then voted in support of that ruling were right, they are bound now to stand behind the honorable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews).

Having been all my life connected with labour organizations, I assure the House that no legislation can be a success that does not acknowledge that principle. With tLe recognition of the organizations must go tbe principle of preference to unionists. Withouti t we cannot hope for industrial peace, because we cannot have effective collective bargaining with a disorganized body. Those two fundamental principles must be recognised if this legisare conditions for which we must provide lation is to have any possible chance of removing industrial unreslt. The Prime Minister said that this measure was based to a large extent on the experience gained of the ship-building tribunal, but he omitted to tell the House that an essential condition of the success of that tribunal is that preference to unionists has been granted to every union that is a party to the ship-building agreement. The Prime Minister said 'to the unions that if they were prepared to enter into the agreement offered by the Government a ' tribunal would be created, the unions would be recognised, and preference would be given to their members. lit is not only ordinary preference, but an absolute monopoly of employment that has been given to the members of the trade organizations which are parties to the shipbuilding agreement. That is one of the principal reasons why ithe ship-building tribunal has been such a success, and has been able to avoid the stoppage of work on many occasions. Another factor making for its success is its accessibility, and manner."" The trade unions are not prethe quickness with which it operates. It comprises a chairman, who is very acceptable to the workers, a representative of the Government as the employer, aud a direct representative of the trade unions. After all, the success or failure of boards, councils, and courts depends to a large extent on the personnel, and especially on The chairman. Men of the type of the chairman of the ship-building 'tribunal, Mr Coningtou, would do much to make a success of industrial arbitration and Wages Boards. That tribunal is right at hand, and the moment a dispute arises it before. is dealt with, without formalities or technicalities. [139]2 tribunals under this Bill work in the same way?visions of the Bil l are amended. I repeat that the success of the ship-building tribunal is due primarily to the recognition of trade organizations, and the giving of preference to unionists; and, secondly, to the accessibility of the Board, and the speed with which it works. Those in this measure if it is to have any possible chance of success. The Bill provides for the creation of a Oommonwealth Council. What is this Council to be, and what will be its functions and powers J The Bill says that it shall be constituted in a certain way, and that it shall make inquiries into various matters, but its powers stop short at inquiry. It is to have no power of making or enforcing awards. It seems to me ridiculous that a measure designed to remove industrial unrest should constitute a body with merely investigatory powers. The proposed Council is to have no really effective power for good; wh t is required is a body that bas power, not only to inquire, but to make awards, and enforce its decisions. We have not been told whether the members of the Council are to be paid, or whether the body itself is to be permanent, or merely called into existence now and then at the whim of the Minister. The Prime Minister ought to enlighten the House upon those points. He should tell us also how the representatives of the employees are to be elected. The Bill provides that they "" shall bo appointed or elected in the prescribed pared to buy a pig in a poke. We want an assurance that the trade organizations will have the right to elect their own representatives upon the Council and the Boards. We are not prepared to give to the Minister the right to prescribe by regulation whether such a representative shall be appointed or elected. This Bill gives the Minister power to appoint as representative of the employees somebody who may be bitterly hostile to trade unionism.

If tbe B ill is not amended in that respect, the Government may as well withdraw it , because the unionists will have nothing to do with it . Another defect in the B ill is the absence of any definition of em-' ployee. It speaks of "" representatives of employees,"" but an employee may mean anybody. strife, there have been occasions when small bodies of men have broken away from the unions, and attempted to work in spite of them.

If the B ill is to be acceptable to trade unionists, it must define an employee as a member of an organization in the industry. member shut out the soldier wharf labourers' organization, in New South Wales, which did good work during the war? wishes to bring about industrial peace, he must recognise the trade union organizations. I am stating exactly the attitude which the unions adopt. If the Governmen choose to ignore these requests,, they must take, the consequences. It is well for the Government to understand clearly that certain fundamental principles must, be embodied in the B ill before tbey can hope it w ill succeed. If the Government decide to recognise some small body of men formed for the specific purpose of defeating the aims and objects of the trade unions' the organization to which I referred. this measure has been framed w i th the idea of giving those men preference in employment, and the right to elect representatives on the Council and Boards? tation can I place on the Minister's remarks? In the trade unions in New South Wales, there are 50 per cent, more returned soldiers than there are in any other organizations. Therefore, the mere formation of a bogus organization in the name of returned soldiers w ill not get the Government out of their difficulty. Returned soldiers are the backbone of trade unionism. They represent 70 or 80 per cent, of the unionists. These covert in sults and sneers at the trade union movement w ill not help the Government to obtain industrial peace. Then, again, we find that each Dis.trict Council is to consist of a chairman and representatives of employees and employers, who are also "" to be appointed or elected in the manner prescribed."" That, likewise, is too indefinite from our In the history of industrial point of view. We wish to have it declared in the B ill itself that the trade union organizations shall be entitled to elect to the District Councils the repreUnder this B ill the sentatives of the employees. A peculiar feature of the B ill is that neither the Commonwealth Council nor the District Council will be able to do more than make inquiries. They will have no real power. Each will have a sort of roving commission-runnin g about making inquiries and incurring useless expense without any possibility of being able to do good work. We cannot achieve industrial peace in this way. Neither the Comar.onwealth Council nor the District the Minister Councils, as provided for in the B ill , w ill be of any use in securing industrial peace. I come now to a very important part of the Bill-that relating to the appointment of special tribunals. These, it seems to me, will alone have any real power. The provisions as to the Commonwealth Council' and the creation of District Councils are ur.ere padding, and the Government would have avoided waste of paper-and time by omitting them. The only real bodies with any actual power for which this B ill provides are the special tribunals that may be created for the settlement of industrial disputes. with those Boards. Clause 14 is most significant. It provides thatA special tribunal shall consist of an equal number of representatives of employers and W h a t other interpreemployees respectively, together with a chairman. . TheB ill does not set out how or by whom these representatives are to be appointed or elected. I wish to make it quite clear that, so far as the Labour party is concerned, the absence of any provision in that regard gives rise to suspicion. .The Labour party wants to know who are to elect the members of these special t r i bunals, and whom, they are to represent.",26,Industrial Peace Bill Second Reading

We will not consent to members of the organization to which the Minister for Home and Territories alluded a few minutes ago being selected as representatives of tbe employees on these bodies. A Judge of the standing of the President of the Conoiliation and Arbitration Court would not remain in that position for one moment if his decisions could be reviewed by a body such as is proposed in this clause. with the honourable member. honourable member would. I should be very surprised to learn that High Court Justices of such standing would retain their position as President or Deputy President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court in such humiliating circumstances. the same if the Conciliation and Arbitration Act were amended as the honourable member has suggested. He has urged that the Court should be given power to vary its awards. different matter if the Court itself were given power to vary its own awards. The Court, with such a power, would prove very helpful. My own view is that if the I ask the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, with some improvements, were allowed to remain as it is to-day, and given power to vary its awards where necessary, it would prove a better means of dealing with industrial troubles than is provided for in the Bill. I am desirous that industrial ; machinery shall be provided which will be acceptable to the trade union movement, and will make industrial peace possible. The way to provide such machinery is to strengthen the Arbitration Court by giving it power to do those things which vary its awards, and to make inquiries affecting not only wages and hours of employment, but such other things as were indicated in the speech of the honourable I do not say that. member for Hunter( Mr Charlton). I would give the Court power to appoint power to the proposed Commonwealth Council, but it is rightly the function.of the Arbitration Court. That Court might perhaps be reinforced by the appointment of a representative of the employers . and a representative of the employees to assist the President in the conduct of particular cases. The Court should be the body to delegate powers, when delegation was necessary. All the things proposed to be done under the measure could be done by the Arbitration Court were it clothed with the necessary powers. What is needed is a short Treasure, conferring these powers upon it. Then the learned President would exercise them at his discretion. He would be able to say: "" Here is a dispute which, if not I thought that the settled speedily, may plunge the country into industrial confusion. I shall therefore ask the trade unionists concerned to Dame representatives, and the employers concerned to name other representatives, to constitute a tribunal to go into the matter immediately."" That would be a sensible way of dealing with disputes.

104,Mr Mahony,"It would be quite aand knowing the feeling of its memhers, I say that that has created suspicion of the Bill. Last week, in conversation with prominent members of the trade union movement, I ascertained that they were prepared to give the measure a fair go; but when our offer of a conference of the movement to consider the measure was made to the Government, it was refused. The consideration that'we suggested might have taken a. week or a fortnight; but had it taken a month what would that have mattered if industrial peace and harmony had resulted therefrom ? Now the trade union movement feels that the Government is not considering it , and that is why I am going through the measure closely and carefully, pointing out the defects of its various clauses. There is no machinery for the election of representatives to the special tribunals, a most suspicious circumstance in view of the action of the Government in refusing the conference for which we asked."" Even at this late hour, the Government would be well advised to accept our offer, and call a conference of the trade union movement to consider the measure. Local Boards, are to be appointed under the Bill, each of which is to consist of a chairman and an employers' representative and an employees' representative, and the members are to be appointed or elected "" in the prescribed manner."" We object to that, as we object to a similar provision in regard to the other bodies. We say that the Bill should clearly provide for the election of employees' representatives by the trade union organizations concerned. As to the powers of a local Board, clause 25 saysSubject to this section the provisions of sections 16 to 18 (both inclusive) of this Act shall apply in relation to a local Board in like manner as they apply in relation to a special tribunal. Under the sections referred to, a special tribunal has the power to review an award of the Arbitration Court, and therefore local Boards will have the same power. This heaps indignity after indignity on the head of the President of the Arbitration Court. cording to clause 27, any determination of the local Board shall be subject to review in the manner prescribed by the special tribunal in relation to which it is appointed. What will be the manner prescribed ? The Prime Minister did not explain how these appeals were to 'be made. We wish to know exactly how the machinery is to be worked. The trade union movement is not prepared to allow any decision of a local Board that may be favorable to its proposal to be carried before some other body by way of appeal, and perhaps upset. We want x to know exactly what the provision means. explanation is apparent from tbe context. The scope of the decision of a local tribunal would be very narrow, while that of a special tribunal might cover a whole industry. A local Board might, for example, be appointed in connection with a dispute at the Hepburn or Bulli Colliery, and its decisions could hardly affect the whole of the coal mining industry. They would be confined to matters arising at the particular colliery, or, perhaps, at a group of collieries. It is not intended that the local tribunals shall upset the decision of the special tribunals, nor that the special tribunals shall review and upset the decisions of the local tribunals, unless the latter are, on the face of them, impossible for the industry. A decision of a local tribunal might be opposed tc the interests of the men, and in.that case they could anpeal to the special tribunal. Minister's explanation; but I should like the position to be made clear in the Bill. That he has said a certain thing will not subsequently affect the interpretation of the measure. If the only function of a local Board is to be to deal with some trivial tiddlewinking matter their beginning in a dispute at some particular place. A demarcation dispute is a tiddlewinking thins:, but occasionally it leads to great trouble. justifiably boasted of the success of the shipbuilding tribunal. One of the reasons for that success is that the tribunal's decision *is final. tribunal's decisions are almost invariably Then, acin favour of the employees. always fair and just. * cisions are, on the whole, fair and just, and dictated by the evidence; though there may be a difference of opinion.",29,Ghanville Ryrie B U T The Hon The Powers Of These Special Tribunals 1

I know the circumstances intimately. to answer. If the Sydney branch of the Transport Workers Federation considered their conditions unfair, they would create a dispute with the employers, exactly as they would in the case of the Court, by asking for redress, and if it were not granted would ask for a special tribunal. Clearly, such a dispute would be between the Sydney branch of the federation and the employers, and each side would have three or four representatives, and the Soldiers Wharf Labourers Association would be represented by counsel, and heard before the tribunal. the other way round, and the Soldiers Wharf Labourers Association made the dispute, then its representatives would be on the tribunal, and the transport workers would have representation.

The Prime Minister, no doubt, has a pleasing recollection of fighting the issue of preference to unionists before the country a little time ago, and It is a difficult question of how successful he was in his appeal. I ask h i m now to give trade unionism recognition and preference. in return, to remember that they owe a duty to the country. If they say, "" We will neither work ourselves nor allow anybody to do so,"" they will lose their preference-that is all. ists would say that they would neither work nor let any one else do so, is ridiculous.

What bas been the history of this question in Australia? Apart from the legisstructed lation of the various States to cope with the problem, the Commonwealth, in 1904, been entered the ring with its Compulsory Arquestion bitration Bill. amended in 1909, 1910, and 1911, twice, Justice inO'Connor. in 1914, and in 1915 and 1918.

There have But, been three main complaints against the fail. compulsory system of compulsory arbitration. first has been that too much power was Mr Marks. man could hope to cover the whole field That is a factor which is The third W'liat have these three main conference. I have had some experience of the Federal Arbitration Court. I in the Prime Minister when he was plain Mr Billy"" Hughes, and had just admitted to the Bar. The case in was the first, I believe, which That measure was Court came before the Federal Arbitration Sydney, and was taken by Mr Masters and officers vessels were pror higher We did even at that early stage, I recognised that arbitration was going to The fact is that it was based on a The wrong plan; it was wrongly housed. The Court was not the right place. I would like to see something in this Bill to the effect that wherever a council, or special tribunal, or local' Board may meet, it shall not be in any building which has tbe appearance of a Court. Tbe effect both on employee and employer is that, directly they step inside the door of a Court-as Mr Braddon put it-thei r hair stands up on end, and a spirit of fight is engendered. That is not the atmosphere which leads to amicable decisions. These bodies should meet in a friendly sort of way in a room where there is a round table, and where employee and employer can face each other man to man, and so wrestle with their differences. Mr Braddon said, "" The compulsory arbitration Court sets up an atmosphere of mock legal quarrel, which is an impossible condition."" quite agree with him. What is required is direct contact between the parties. Honourable members have read statements emanating from Mr Samuel Gompers, leader of the Labour movement in the United States of America. He has no time for compulsory arbitration. America is not free from strikes; but, in their enormous works, the American people have solved their troubles for the time being by inaugurating a system of giving better conditions to the workers, paying higher wages, and distributing a share of profits, which raises earnings to something more than a basic wage. I quite agree with that procedure. I have always said that the man who produces the wealth should have a fair share of that wealth. If we treat the workers properly and bring them under a profit-sharing system there will not be strikes. Great Britain has partly solved her troubles by means of the Whitley Councils, which are working well. By degrees all the organizations are coming into the Whitley scheme. The Bill before the House is framed very much upon the lines of the Whitley methods; but I agree with the honorahle member for Dalley( Mr But we have to try everything possible to Mahony) that, in many cases, matters need clearing up. the honourable member for Flinders( Mr is conceded in camera. The honourable Bruce), who believes in the establishment of unions, and regards them as a factor for good; and I agree with him, further, that no man should be compelled to enter a union. However, in order to bring about industrial peace, and seeing that the unions represent the great majority of the working people, I hold that the representatives of the workers on the tribunals should be selected from those unions. Where a strike occurs among a small body of men who are not members of a union, I understand that the Prime Minister has stated 'that the delegates should come direct from those people. It should be made perfectly clear that the principle is safeguarded. Otherwise, no good will come of our efforts; the working man of Australia will have nothing to do with this measure. I know the Governmenlt are sincere in trying to bring about industrial peace, so I trust that they will leave no loop-hole for suspicion. Regarding the appointment of chairI men, I agree with the opinions expressed by several honourable members that it is a matter which must be most carefully What is America's experience? considered. Sub-clause 3 of clause 5 statesThe chairman shall be appointed by the Governor General. That is to say, the Government. Person> ally, I have not too much faith in certain political appointments. WhatI would like to see here, and in the case of the appointment of all chairmen under 'this measure, is provision for their selection as follows:The chairman shall be chosen by agreement between the representatives of employers and employees, or,, in default of agreement, shall be appointed by the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia from names submitted to him by both sides. That would do away with suspicion, for if there is one man in this country who is above suspicion it is the Chief Justice of the High Court,-whoeve r he may be. Much has been said concerning whether the Bill does or does not empower the Boards or tribunals to go in'to the question of profits. Here, the point strikes me whether that right should be granted. secure industrial peace, and I say that I am at one with 'the right should be granted, so long as it member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) did not object to that. Mr Braddon represents the great body of employers in New South Wales. He dealt with the same question in his address. In asking that a Conference should be appointed he set out certain points which, he thought should personally is not opposed to any inquiry be discussed; and, having cited those into profits, so long as the investigation is points, he statedThe idea would not be for tbe employer to statement of MrH .

Perhaps the local Great Britain during the war-whe n Boards might not reach likely disputes, they responded to the appeal of Mr but until a local Board is appointed as the Lloyd George to set their backs to the offspring of a special tribunal, there is nowall and give our fighting men their allthing to prevent employer and employees necessary munitions and supplies-w e in each industry meeting at a round-table would not be disappointed in the workers conference, with, as one honourable member over this matter.

I repeat what I have always .said, that we can only achieve industrial peace by the "" get-together"" policy. intention to vote against the second reading of the B ill , and as I proceed I shall state my reasons for so doing. A Labour member, confronted with such a measure introduced by a non-Labour Government, must naturally be suspicious. The honourable member for Wilmot ( MrA t k in portunity of considering the B ill . The son) said that there seemed to be a good deal of suspicion and many imaginings on the part of some honourable members. I remind the House that we have cause for suspicion. As a Labour mau, I do not forget that the Government which introduced this B ill is the same Government which, under the War Precautions Act, interfered with the marine engineers when on strike to the extent of preventing them from operating upon their own banking account. That action, added to many others of the kind, is enough to make us suspicious. I took i week, and the first thing I asked myself was whether it represented a genuine effort on the part of the Government to bring about industrial peace. I asked myself whether it was likely that the Prime Minister was bringing to bear his past expi&rience and knowledge of indust r i a l affairs with the sincere object of doing justice to both sides. ThenI remembered a statement he made at Bendigo during the recent by-election campaigna very unwise utterance on the part of the head of the Government. He was reported by the Adelaide press as having said at Bpndigo that a B ill was to be brought downI am convinced that it was this Bill-whic h would be through the House by last Saturday, "" despite all that their friends, the Opposition, oould do to stop it . "" That was the spirit in which the Leader of the Government heralded this measure. Last Saturday has gone by, and the Bill is not through the House yet, nor will it be through all that the Prime Minister threatened to do. I have been wondering whether we have to thank our friends of the Country party for the fact that the B ill was Saturday. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), when he was chided for having voted for the urgency motion, said that he knew that the Bil l was to be .passed within a certain time. From that I inferred that the Country party had a knowledge of the Government's intentions, and I wondered whether feelers had besn put cut to ascertain if the Country party would support the Government in disposing of the B ill last week. Prom the evidence before me, I conclude that we are indebted to the Country party for even this limited opstatement made by the Prime Minister at Bendigo was unwise and uncalled-for, especially in connection with a B ill which is designed to bring about industrial peace. It made one wonder whether there is a sincere intention behind, the introduction of the B ill . How can a man who represents the lower-paid sections of the community help being suspicious of the capitalistic interests and the Government which is behind them ? We know too well that the peoiple we are here to represent particularly have had the worse end of the stick in the past. the Bill home with me to Adelaide last The honourable member for Flinders( Mr. Bruce) said last night that America today is upon the edge of a Vesuvius, and that prior to the war the workers of England were not given a dog's chance. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr. Marks) stated that the Prince of Wales, after looking into the residential conditions of some of the workers in England, exclaimed, "" It is a damn shame."" I believe that if the Prince discovered undesirable conditions he would have pluck enough to express himself in that way. I could relate my own experiences when I had to battle for a living. There are other causes connected with the B ill itself which make us suspicious. I remind honourable members that the advantages which the wage-earners are enjoying to-day-if they",35,Ghanville Ryrie B U T The Hon The Powers Of These Special Tribunals 1
143,Mr Gabb (Angas) [2.23],"It is mycan be called advantages-bav e been dearly won, and they cannot blame Labour members if we are anxious that any benefits now enjoyed by the Statements have been made which lead us to believe that, in respect of certain provisions in this B ill , trade unions are to receive as much consideration as they have had in the past. blamed, however, for desiring to have that clearly set out in the B ill . We have no guarantee that, in respect of tlie Commonwealth Council and the District Councils, trade union organizations will secure recognition similar to that given them under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The statement made to-day by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) should have been made much earlier. It has certainly removed some of our fears by giving us to understand that trade union organizations will have, under the B ill , all the privileges they enjoy under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. supporters have condemned us for desiring that the trade unions should be consulted. Instead of being condemned, we should be commended for this desire, since we are anxious to make doubly sure that industrial peace will be brought about. Labour party can speak, no doubt, for the rank and file in the trade union movement, but in a multitude of counsellors there is wisdom, and there should be no complaint in regard to the suggested con' ference. I object to this Bill because its administration will be extremely costly. cognise that if , as the result of it, industrial peace were secured, the which it involved would be money well spent. trial unrest ? We are to have a Commonwealth Council, and also a District Council for each State, and one member has suggested that members of these Councils should receive a salary of not less than Â£1,000 a year. be a Chairman and six' members of each of these seven tribunals, so that if they received Â£1,000 per annum, their salaries alone would amount to Â£49,000 a year.

If that were done, and the Act improved, it would go a long way towards removing industrial unrest. The President of the Conciliation and Arbitration workers shall not , be lost. Court receives Â£3,000 per annum, so that the projected -outlay on the Commonwealth and District Councils would provide for six or seven additional Deputy Presidents of the Court, and leave someWe cannot be thing to spare. I stand bere to-day as one who is still in favour of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) compared industrial conditions prevailing here with those ruling in America, and showed that the advantage was with us. There are no compulsory arbitration laws in the United States of America, so that his comparison is but another argument in favour of our Arbitration Court. The same may be said of his comparison of the industrial position in Great Britain with that in Australia. And this despite the fact Ministerial that the Government have not done all that the Commonwealth Court has asked. I understand that, under the amending B ill , the Court will at last have power to vary its awards. It is remarkable that, although it has The for years been asking for this wider power, it is to be granted only concurrently with the passing of this B ill. I mav be somewhat suspicious, but I am wondering whether the giving of additional powers to the Conciliation and Arbitration Court at this juncture is not mere camouflage designed to disguise the I rereal objective of this B ill , wheh is to undermine the Court, and to remove expenditure from the Bench one of its members. Has Mr Justice Higgins, Mr Justice But will it do away with indusPowers, Mr Justice Starke, or any of the registrars of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court been consulted in regard to honourable this measure?

As a representative of trade union interests, I feel that it would not be wise to vote for this Bill, since it provides for the creation of special enjoy to-day. I am not ready to take one tribunals, which will be the mere handiwork of the Government of the day. These special tribunals are to be appointed by the Governor General, and it is obvious to me that their members-bot h the representatives of the employers and the representatives"" of the employees-wil l be the chosen of the Government. I am aware that my view is not endorsed by some honourable members; but I wish to have it clearly stated in the Bill that the representatives of tbe employees on the councils and special tribunals will be elected by the trade union organizations. I am not prepared to act on mere supposition. will vote for the second reading of the Bill, believing, as I do, that the members of the councils and tribunals for which it provides, will be selected by the Government of the day; but I am not prepared to do so. The honourable member for Darling( Mr Blakeley) said yesterday that there could be no objection to such a system if the Labour party were in power. While it might be very convenient for a Labour Government to have that power, it would not be fair, and, therefore, would not tend to industrial rest. The Bill gives plenty of scope for political appointments, and if a Labour Government made such appointments to these tribunals, the other side would naturally complain. Again, I am not prepared to vote for a Bill which will vest such very wide powers in any one man. It has been said that the powers for which the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides are in the hands of one man-the President of the Court. With whom will rest the balance of power in connection with these tribunals? We are to have on each council and special tribunal an equal number of representatives of employers and employees, and where they are unable to agree, the Chairman-wh o will have been selected, no doubt, by the Governmentwill be the deciding factor. We shall, therefore, get back to the position ruling in connection with our arbitration laws today. I cannot vote for the second readcertain directions, I may feel justified in voting for the third reading. I am not prepared to give up any right or privilege which the trade union organizations backward step. The movement of the world to-day is in the direction of giving those who produce the wealth a fair share of that wealth. It is in the direction of giving the workers a greater measure of justice than they have hitherto received, and any step taken by us that may he contrary to that tendency will not lead to industrial peace. , In statements made across the table today, the Prime Minister conveyed the impression that organized labour would be protected under this Bill. But neither his word nor that of any other man is sufficient for me in regard to this matter. Some members of my party I want to see that undertaking put in black and white. I want it to be in the Bill itself. Deep down in the heart of the Prime Minister there may be some feeling of sympathy for the ranks from which he sprang; but he is not always going to be at the head of the Government. There are in this House some outand-out Conservatives, any one of whom may be at some time at the head of the Government of the Commonwealth, and their sympathies have never been with unionists and unionism. If the unions will be as fully recognised under the provisions of tbe Bill as they are now under the Arbitration Act, this should be made clear and put beyond doubt. According to the Prime Minister, if there were in an industry a genuine union and a bogus unionI am not using his language in employing these terms-and trouble were to arise in the genuine union, that union wiould elect three representatives to a tribunal to investigate the dispute, and the bogus union would bave the right to be represented by counsel. I hope that representation by lawyers is not intended, though I do not see in the Bill anything to prevent the appearance of lawyers before the tribunals for which it provides, should the employers wish for them, and obtain from the chairmen the' right to make use of their services. On the other hand, should the trouble arise with the bogus union, it would appoint representatives to the tribunal, and the genuine union would be represented by counsel. Such an arrangement, it seems to me, would cause a great number of bogus unions to spring into existence, and if their representatives were brought into a case the genuine unionists would t u r n their backs on the tribunal adjudicating upon it . Some one h s saidI think, a the honourable .member for Darling( Mr Blakeley)-that the genesis of the B ill was to be found in a proposal by some New South Wales organization. an organization of Victorian returned of h i m, when he has made up his mind soldiers. Genesis of it is to be found, but I know idea that at last something is to be done, that the Revelations of it will be with the and that he is the man who will do it . trade unionists of this country. the Government. those who vote for the B ill are the alpha ceded of this matter, the omega of it w ill be somewhat the rank and file of the industrial unions, the fact that Parliament exists for the whom it is useless to flout.

Against my judgment and inclination, I did not, either with voice or vote, oppose the motion which ordered that the second-reading debate shall close this afternoon. I represent a somewhat remote part of the Commonwealth, and have not yet any concerning the measure. circumstances I should have vigorously protested with other honourable members against the limitation of the debate, and I can assure the House that there will be no other occasion, while I am here, when my vote will be given to curtail the privileges of members in the discussion of an important measure of this kind, so long as no intention has been shown to stonewall it or to delay our proceedings. It is all very well for men like the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Bruce) to suggest, as he did last night, that opportunity for consideration has been given to all. While Victorian members may have had such opportunity they fai l to realize that Victoria is not Australia, and that the outlying parts of the Commonwealth are entitled to more consideration in respect of a measure of this kind than the Prime Minister and many of those behind him have shown to them. Seeing that the country has waited impatiently for some years for something to be done in this matter it was somewhat amusing to hear the righ t honourable gentleman declare this No ; in a proposal of an urgent measure.

We are apt to forget that tens of thousands of workers never strike, and that a majority of the workers are opposed to strikes, though often dragged into them. If there were proper machinery by which their wrongs could receive reasonable and prompt attention, the voice of the workers would be heard objecting strongly to strikes. Unfortunately, during the last few years circumstances have played into the hands of the extreme and disorderly element in the Labour unions, giving it an opportunity of which it has availed itself to the utmost. It has been for strikes on every possible and impossible occasion, with sufficient apparent justification to drag behind it large numbers of workers who, in tbeir hearts, abhor strikes, and would be only too glad for some other method of securing redress. We owe it to the workers to give them relief, if possible, from the awful arbitrament of civil war, for which a strike is only another name. I think, with some other honourable members, that the amendment of the Arbitration Act should have preceded the present proposal. I still believe that the Arbitration Court is capable of doing good work in the qause :of industrial peace. No doubt, it has many defects, some of which have been pointed out here, and it is a pity that its shortcomings were not discussed before the Bill was introduced. Had there been such discussion, it would have done much to make the present proposal unnecessary. I believe that the Arbitration Court provides a better method of settling industrial disputes than that now under consideration. The troubles which now arise are due to the expense and delay attending appeals to the Court. I am sorry, in view of the [140] able legal representation in this House, to have to say that the elimination, to as great an extent as pcssible, of legal system and procedure would, in my opinion, reduce the cost of and the time occupied in the hearing of disputes by the Court. If its proceedings could be simplified and expedited, one of the gravest objections to the Court would be removed. Unfortunately, Federal action in regard to Labour members realize as industrial disputes can begin only at a comparatively late stage of tbeir development. I complain that the State Governments and Parliaments have not dealt with tbese matters as they should have done. They should have a uniform system ampngst themselves to prevent so many of these disputes growing, until, by their size and gravity, they become subjects for Federal investigation. It is most unfortunate, also, that, rightly or wrongly, at the inception of our Federal Court of Arbitration, the workers got an impression that the Judge was inclined to favdur them. This undoubtedly had a very regrettable influ, ence throughout Australia, and has brought about most unfortunate results. For one thing, many of the disputes might have been settled long before they reached the dimensions of a Federal case; but they were allowed to grow, and, in fact, many of the smaller disputes were deliberately developed, until they reached a stage when tbey could be dealt with by the Federal Court. This meant, of course, that the Court became simply overwhelmed by a multiplicity of cases, with which it could not deal, and many waited for months and months without any prospect of being heard. The final result was that direct action was employed; the Court was flouted by the workers, who, having lost faith in it, proceeded to extremes, which, as I say, have inflicted untold misery and hardship on the community. It is a duty we owe to the community to endeavour now, whether in this measure or any others before us, to bring about the cessation of these disputes. The general community has a right to expect this from us, because, as a matter of fact, it is entirely ignored in industrial disputes. There are. the"" interests of the employer on the one hand, and the interests of the employee on the other; but the unfortunate general public, like Issachar, the strong as, stoops between the two burdens.

152,Mr Fowler,"A good many of themway which, while satisfactory to the two parties immediately concerned, is unfair to the public; but this Bill takes no note of that phase of the position. While arranging for consideration for the interests of the employer and the employee, no regard is shown for the interests of the general public. posed to look after the general public. Parliament is supposed to look after the general public. I am afraid, however, that, in thinking about votes, we are more apt to have regard tfor those who are keenly interested in the industrial matters rather than for the somewhat remote public, which suffers so frequently in silence. Members are returned time and again, not for what they have done for the general community, but for what they have done for one party or another. That is a very regrettable state of affairs which I hope will come to an end before very long, and towards the abolition of which I hope to be able to do something. The measure seems to me like a huge, cumbrous piece of machinery with a ridiculously small boiler; it is going to be expensive, and consists of a great many different parts, but tbe driving power will be small and insignificant. That is the trouble with a great deal of our legislation in this regard. We have stopped short of one responsibility that this and other Parliaments will have to take on their shoulders sooner or later. That is, after having given the workers and employers effective Courts .for the settlement on a fair basis of all industrial disputes, tbe community must be protected against those reckless individuals who are prepared to flout the law in the furtherance of their aims and objects, and inflict general suffering. People, here and elsewhere, are beginning to realize that something in the nature of criminal action is required against those who break the industrial peace. In some coun-. tries, notably in the TJnited States, laws are, I believe, in preparation to make striking a criminal offence,more especially in connection with those industries and activities that are vitally necessary to The Wages Boards of Victoria carried the life of the community. peace. ' understood that, before any step of the kind is taken, there shall be an effective and fair Court for the settlement of all industrial disputes; then must come the power of the law to make it criminal for any one to break the peace in such a way as to inflict suffering and hardship on ithe community. That reform will come sooner or later, and it is just as well that this Parliament and Australia generally should be prepared to look the fact in the face. member have representatives of the general public on ithe councils and tribunals? and what I shall endeavour to introduce into the measure. I again point out that if we are to secure absolute industrial peace we must first of all provide a, fair and efficient Court for the settlement of industrial disputes, and then step in and secure the public against the actions of a criminal few, who, by reason of the power wielded either in unions of employers or unions of employees, create what practically amounts to locks-out on ithe one side and strikes on the other. I could give instance after instance of suffering that has come under my notice as tihe result of strikes in Australia, and these would give point to my contention; but with the limited time at my disposal, I do not propose to do so at the present time. I now desire to refer to some of the provisions of the Bill. There is a great deal anticipated from the creation of the various tribunals. What tlie councils will do I do not know; they will be able to talk a great deal, but as to their activity in other respects I have some doubt whether they will be worth ithe money expended on them. Only a few days ago I heard an employee, and a member of a union, describe the tribunal in the shipping industry as an organization for giving the employees whatever they desire. tion ! tion from the point of view of the employee; but what about tbe general public ? out the same plan for a long while; and Mr Murphy, who was in control of them some time ago, has produced a very in.j; formative report in the form of a book",40,Ghanville Ryrie B U T The Hon The Powers Of These Special Tribunals 1

The position regarding the special tribunals and local Boards is different. I desire to call attention to some peculiarities about these bodies. First, I will take the lesser of the two in order to reduce the position ultimately to a consideration of the special tribunals. The local Boards, like the special tribunals, will have the powers of an Arbitration Court. Presumably they are intended, as their name implies, to operate within narrow geographical Afr. Brennan. within much narrower limits than any one State. It is to be assumed that they will be used to arrest industrial trouble -at its inception, at any place or in any one State-whereve r it may arise. The curious thing is that it seems to have been forgotten that the whole of this legislation stricted by the constitutional limitation that disputes cannot be dealt with other The Commonwealth council than industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of one State. Therefore, it appears to me that we are attempting the impossible when we set up a, local body They for the .purpose of dealing with a local dispute, seeing that it is not competent for the Commonwealth Parliament to legislate in respect of local disputes at on the other hand. all. Yet these local Boards are to be possessed of very great powers-power s almost as complete as those of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court itself. A dispute may be referred to them by the parties actually concerned. And, although they are, in a sense, It does not the offspring of the special tribunals, it does not follow that they can only deal with a dispute referred to them by special tribunals, for the reason that they may be invoked direct by the parties to a dispute, without regard to the They can special tribunals at all. Although the local Boards will be subject to review by the special tribunals "" in relation to which they have been appointed,"" it does not follow that they will have been appointed in relation to any special tribunal, because they nuay be called in aid -as I have just pointed out-by the In that respect, by parties themselves. their appointment must be in relation to some special tribunal. means by which a dispute may be brought before a local Board. The trouble may be referred to it by the special tribunal, or by the parties themselves; and, apparently, therefore, they will be given jurisdiction, just as in the case of tbe special tribunal, to deal with the dispute in the way and to the extent that the Commonwealth Arbitration Court could deal with it. limit-certainly Since it will be quite impossible to attempt to address myself to the subject",42,Ghanville Ryrie B U T The Hon The Powers Of These Special Tribunals 1

Therefore, it may be that after the Commonwealth Council has considered a matter, and after the district Council has considered it, and after it has been deliberated upon by both special tribunal and local Board, it may be found that the ""dispute is not a dispute within the meaning of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act at all. In regard to clause 17, which confers powers to vary awards, I have very little hope that the Judges of the present Arbitration Court will accept service under such terms. I do not believe they will undertake their duties under tbe conditions created by that clause. It sets up an impossible situation. A Judge will no sooner have made an award than it may be torpedoed by means of this provision. I lodge my protest against the fact that this Billa most important, difficult, and intricate one-shoul d be forced through as it is to be. I have the doubtful honour, in the absence of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Ryan), to be the only member on this side of the House who can pretend to bring any special legal knowledge to bear upon the problem. I have tried to make some hurried observations where I would have preferred to speak at length. However, I am not permitted to do so. I would like to have supported the Billi f I could see that it would be of any use to the country. I think the Arbitration Act could be amended in a direction which should make of it a very useful instrument. Without amendment it does all that this Bill can do. The Bill provides for compulsory conferences. So does the Act. The Bill provides for local Councils and district Boards. The Act provides for Boards of Reference. The Governanent should give the Act facilities to function, and not destroy it. I cannot resist A special tribunal, although the conclusion that the Prime Minister and the Government, and particularly that wing of the National party which is not Labour, having no sympathy with its operations, have decided to use this indirect method of ending it.
