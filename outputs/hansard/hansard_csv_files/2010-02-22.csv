Our social and environmental problems have not been caused by excessive immigration. They have been caused by wasteful use of our water and other resources, lack of urban planning, short-sighted decision making, excessive reliance on the motor car and neglect of investment, particularly in urban infrastructure. I conclude by saying that one of the things that I find most astonishing about the antiimmigration lobby is their failure to address Monday, 22 February 2010 ----La Trobe Electorate: Berwick Primary School which relocated at the end of 2003 after more than 100 years at its former site on Peel Street. I had the great honour and privilege of being present at the opening of the new school on Fairholme Boulevard by former principal Dick Bartley, along with former member for La Trobe Mr Bob Charles. In term 1 of 2004, Berwick Primary School’s enrolment was 596. In just six years it has grown to 777. This increase in enrolments of almost 200 students since the relocation demonstrates how vital Berwick Primary School is to the local community. When Berwick Primary School was allocated $2 million for a multipurpose room under the Building the Education Revolution program, they were initially delighted to have the funding injection to improve facilities for their students. The multipurpose room was not exactly what the school needed, or wanted, but Berwick Primary School was grateful nonetheless. However, since that time, they have been let down by red tape, buck passing and a lack of communication from the state and federal education departments. Berwick Primary School has been unable to find out basic information from the departments such as the cost of the project. The multipurpose room has been independently quoted at $750,000. That means a project has been overfunded by $1.25 million. Berwick Primary School would like to use the surplus funding for the companion project, a gymnasium to accommodate the school’s 770 students. The school’s current gym was designed and constructed in such a way that the gym could be extended to full size when funds permitted. The extension of the gym has always been the school’s goal. Plans have been prepared and the project could be completed well within ER timelines. An extension to the school’s gym would accommodate the needs of one of Australia’s fastest-growing electorates. It could also be used as an emergency rendezvous point for students in the event of a bushfire. I wrote to the Minister for Education on 24 June last year when the school contacted me about their concerns, and again on 1 December. The school has been badly let down by Minister Gillard. In question time on 3 February this year when I asked her a question, her response, in part, was: If there is some issue the principals would like to raise with a government that cares about education, obviously we always stand ready to work through issues. For schools such as Berwick Lodge Primary School, Berwick Primary School, Oatlands Primary School and Belgrave South Primary School, this program has been an absolute and total failure. These schools need a lot better from a minister who says she cares when in fact she is letting education down in my electorate.

140,Mr Wood (La Trobe) (4.13 Pm),"I wish to talk about the Berwick Primary School,torate last Thursday and Friday and ran Parliament Alive in Petrie. We had two full days, and eight sessions were run in which we did a role-play of parliament with local school students. Over seven schools participated and over 650 students went through those role-plays over the two days. I can say to this House that the feedback from those teachers and schools was overwhelming. These are schools and students who do not get the opportunity to send classes of students down to Canberra each year and consequently miss out on the opportunity of having a better understanding of how the parliamentary process works. Bringing these role-plays to our schools directly and allowing these students to participate certainly helps them in their studies in government but also helps them to understand what the roles of government, parliament and members of parliament are. Certainly the feedback from the teachers was that they are hoping we can do a lot more of these role-plays, and I hope to be doing those directly with the school classes and talking with them throughout the year as they study government throughout the term. Most of the students who participated in the program are in grades 6 and 7, but we also had a class of year 10 students from St John Fisher College. Also attending were Humpybong State School, Prince of Peace Lutheran College, Southern Cross Catholic College, Aspley East State School, Scarborough State School and Kippa-Ring State School. I would also like to thank Aspley East State School and Scarborough State School for hosting these events in their school halls. Of course, these events would not be able to happen if we did not have venues and if we did not have the support of these schools in holding these events. There were many students from other schools coming and going throughout the day, and these schools were very accommodating in supporting that program. Once again, I thank the PEO for running this program. I encourage members who have not had the Parliament Alive program come to their electorates to do so. It is one that truly benefits young people in understanding how decisions we make here in Parliament House can affect them, their homes and their families on a day-to-day basis. (Time expired) Solar Energy Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (4.19 pm)-This government’s towering incompetence is causing enormous damage to hard working small business people, who are also working families, in my electorate. One such company is Austech Solar, a company which installs solar panels, about which there has been much grossly undeserved self-congratulation by this government. The company is suffering because of business undertaken on the understanding that this government could be trusted. This company is now finding out just how wrong that is. In order to ascertain the precise situation in relation to moneys owing by this financially delinquent and uncaring government, the company had a statement prepared and they found that total rebates due and payable by the federal government to Key Factors/Austech Solar is $3.144 million. This is an enormous debt burden for a company of that size to carry, and not surprisingly this company is approaching the financial brink. I have been told that the CEO and company: … appreciate the very few payments that have come through the SHCP, however, there are still many installations still delayed and waiting to be processed and paid to Austech Solar. The running of our company has been very difficult as there are too many expenses to pay, supply is being held up in the wharf, there are employees resigning due to lack of payment and staff are very MAIN COMMITTEE close to being unemployed, which of that we are currently employing over 50 full time staff plus contractors. Austech Solar is finding it very difficult to function due to the lack of payments owed to our company, every week we are processing 60 or more applications valued at $8000.00 each ($480,000.00) or more and yet only receiving very petty amounts not even enough to pay my staff wages not including the mass amounts of expenses incurred by a premium solar company trying to cater for over 2000 clients who’s rebates are ending very shortly. He continues: We are facing great risk only at the cost of SHCP’s actions of not delivering and paying what is due to Austech Solar moreover the lack of support from the DEWHA. Our company has advised you and the department of the troubles faced and made aware of the expenses and risk’s involved with insufficient payments made by DEWHA. This is a disgrace. The failure of this government to make these payments just shows how its ministers have no idea how businesses are run. Blaxland Electorate: Schools to see the infrastructure that is rolling out in schools across the country. Every primary school, big and small, is now a construction site. In Blaxland it means more than $114 million for new classrooms, libraries, halls and science centres. But not much is known about the money being invested in literacy and numeracy and helping children in our most disadvantaged schools. Many of these schools are in my electorate. Two weeks ago the Deputy Prime Minister announced the Smarter Schools National Partnerships. I looked at the figures for my electorate the other day. I could not believe what I saw: $63 million for 32 public schools and $16 million for 10 Catholic and independent schools. Schools in Blaxland have never received this much funding or this sort of investment from a federal government. All up, 42 schools in my electorate will receive more than $80 million for literacy, numeracy and extra teachers. To put this in perspective, this is about 10 per cent of the Smarter Schools funding for the whole of New South Wales being invested in one electorate. I hasten to add that Blaxland is not often considered a marginal seat. This is funding not based on margin but based on need. It will fund extra classroom teachers so primary school classes can break into smaller groups and practise reading, writing and maths. It will fund extra personalised assistance in literacy and numeracy for children who fall behind and it will pay our best teachers more to come and work in places like Blaxland. This is the real education revolution. This is the engine behind the My School website and inside the classrooms that we are building, putting money and resources where they are needed most and in the places that they are needed most. It is what we have to do if we are serious about making sure that postcodes do not determine opportunity, because they do at the moment. Today unemployment in Blaxland is about 10 per cent-double the national average. Teenage full-time unemployment is a chronic 45.2 per cent. We are being hit hard by the global recession. That is why I ran a jobs expo in Bankstown 10 days ago. Six and a half thousand people turned up, 1,500 squeezed through the door in the first half-hour and 500 went home with a job. The important point here is that I asked employers that day why unemployment in Bankstown is so high, and they all said the same thing: the lack of literacy and numeracy skills. This is what entrenches social disadvantage and why this funding is so important. Will MAIN COMMITTEE",149,Statements By Members

No, of course not, but it will change the lives of many children in Bankstown and Cabramatta and the suburbs in between. This would never have happened under the Liberal Party. After two years, the most obvious achievement of the government has been stopping Australia going into recession. That has saved thousands of jobs. But perhaps in years to come the greatest legacy of these two years will be the investment we are now making in education, where it is needed most, and the difference it will make to the lives of so many. (Time expired) Greenway Electorate: Water significance of the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury region. Residents and businesses, people who choose to live and/or work in this region, choose to do so because of its environment, because of the significance of the environment, because of the lifestyle. It is important to residents and those who work in this community that the environment and lifestyle that they enjoy is protected. The Hawkesbury-Nepean River runs through my community, along with numerous other rivers and streams that feed into it from the World Heritage listed Blue Mountains National Park. The coalition government has a strong record of protecting and promoting sustainable waterways, including those in the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury regions, with up to $132.5 million worth committed in 2007 from the Australian Government Water Fund for a proposal that would have significantly improved the health of the Hawkesbury and Nepean rivers. In my community there are many waterways and rivers of vital importance to the community, including the major Nepean and Hawkesbury rivers but also the Macdonald River, the Grose River, the Colo River and of course Wollemi Creek, which feed into them. Flowing down from the World Heritage listed Blue Mountains National Park, there are many other rivers of importance, such as the Coxs River, the Capertee River and Wolgan River, which should never be forgotten, to ensure they too remain sustainable and protected. Whilst Labor have been in government, there have been many offers to other states-for example, $1 billion to the Victorian government. However, we have seen little of this in the HawkesburyNepean and Blue Mountains region. The Hawkesbury-Nepean River system, which receives inflows from the Blue Mountains rivers, is Sydney’s food bowl and it needs assistance to improve the health of the river. Significant economic activity depends on the catchment. Agriculture in the region has an annual farm gate value of over $1 billion. Eggs, poultry, fresh vegetables, flowers and fruit are supplied to Sydney markets. The rivers also support oyster and prawn farming, extensive horse breeding and a turf industry. All rely on the health of the river. The Hawkesbury-Nepean is a catchment of national significance. It supplies 97 per cent of metropolitan Sydney’s potable water and supports the generation of 70 per cent of Sydney’s income. The Rudd Labor government needs to acknowledge the commitment provided by the previous, coalition government and ensure that the health of the Hawkesbury-Nepean River is not forgotten. It is imperative that the Labor government consider all significant water systems and take action not only to protect the livelihood of those living in the Hawkesbury and Blue Mountains region but also to secure a sustainable future for our environment and water systems.

142,Mrs Markus (Greenway) (4.25 Pm),"I rise to bring to the attention of the House theCorio Electorate: Building the Education Revolution Program In my electorate there is a business called Ezyshades Australia. It is a Geelong based business that builds shade structures and awnings for both commercial and domestic use. The business started 10 years ago and by early 2009 was well established in Gregory Avenue, Newtown, and providing jobs for six people. But by then the global financial crisis had sapped consumer confidence. Businesses stopped spending and for Ezyshades the situation became desperate. Managing Director Sam Melia said that by April last year the phones had stopped ringing. The business went from receiving dozens of inquiries a day to just one or two. Mr Melia said that they could see that the business was in real trouble and they were looking at laying off staff. And then, around that time, the Rudd government’s economic stimulus package started to have an effect. It started to turn things around for Ezyshades-in particular, the spending in schools announced in Building the Education Revolution. In my electorate of Corio, more than $102 million has been committed to school improvements through the BER funding. More than 60 building projects are underway, are about to be started or have almost finished. Building the Education Revolution funding gave many schools the means to create sun smart playground areas-shady, cool play spaces that keep children active but out of the midday sun. For Ezyshades it was the money spent on playground upgrades that made the difference. There was immediate demand for shade structures for schoolyards across Geelong, south-west Victoria and Melbourne. This has kept Ezyshades in work for the past nine months. It has provided a steady stream of work while confidence has returned to other sectors of the economy. It has safeguarded the jobs of six employees and created work for additional casual employees. Quite simply, Mr Melia says that the stimulus strategy saved his business-no question. He says, ‘Without the stimulus strategy, Ezyshades would not be operating today.’ In the midst of the malarky spread by the opposition, they would have us believe the stimulus spending was a wasteful exercise, but here is a clear example of how it has successfully saved and created regional jobs, not just the six or so jobs at this company. There are other spin-offs to consider, such as the suppliers, the engineering work and the specialist trades. Ezyshades has also been supplying awnings to a Bendigo business that has been installing shade structures in playgrounds in that city. This is just one example but it is not a one-off. Every electorate across Australia would have stories such as this. This is an example of how federal government investment in infrastructure has given small businesses a boost when they needed it most. Small businesses are the engine room of the Australian economy. This is a great example of government policy keeping that engine turning and, in this case, just in the nick of time.

144,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (4.31 Pm),"The member for Corio should look closely athistory of the parliament, and I join with others in the parliament who have congratulated him in the other chamber. On Sunday there was the magnificent opening of the beautiful Bunyip Auditorium. It is an absolutely fantastic and amazing facility. The local community supplied $1.25 million, the federal government supplied $400,000 and the state supplied $500,000 out of the Community Support Fund. But who opened it? The state minister. I go back to when Kel Anderson, former Mayor and councillor of the area and a great stalwart for Bunyip, dreamed of having a building like this. I remember Peter Knights and Michael Tuck playing in the old tin shed at Bunyip. The basketball court had one foot between the line on the side and the actual wall. But that is where they played; that is where they had all their activity. Importantly, the people like Kel Anderson, Kath Helvie, Bill Pearson and Max Padley, a former league footballer who lives in that area, had a dream. But I reckon they never would have dreamed that such a facility-which we would not have minded the minister being at to open-would be built at Bunyip. They have done a magnificent job. There was a prostitution though of the protocol. If the local people supply $1.25 million through their council, through their endeavours, through their local banks and through their fundraising, how is it then that the federal and state governments come in, put their hand up and say: ‘Look at us. Look at us. Look at me. Look at me. How wonderful are we?’ They put in $400,000 and $500,000, which is not their money. All the local money was people’s hardearned dollars, out of their rates and out of their community commitment to this magnificent building. I am one and I have had enough. I was annoyed with our governments on Sunday because they did not stand up and acknowledge properly the local people for their input. It is time we had a bit of integrity about it ourselves, about what we claim to be the heroes of. The Minister for Community Development, Lily D’Ambrosio-and she is a fine lady I know-came. The state or federal government should not come in and claim the applause for what the local people have done. Enough is enough.

Adelaide Electorate: Timothy Braund Ms KATE ELLIS (Adelaide-Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth and Minister for Sport) (4.34 pm)-I rise today to acknowledge and celebrate the achievements of a remarkable young man who resides in Wayville, in the electorate of Adelaide. At the young age of 17, Mr Timothy Braund has an impressive list of achievements that would rival a lifetime of achievements by many other Australians. Like Timothy, there are many young people who make a significant contribution to the community both in my electorate and right around Australia. These contributions from young people often go without the recognition they deserve. I am pleased to highlight just one of the very many examples of young people who are out there making a fantastic contribution to Australia each and every day. Timothy Braund has devoted all of his spare time to undertaking voluntary work in the local community by promoting, informing and contributing to youth programs through various local councils in the electorate of Adelaide. His involvement in the City of Burnside’s Battle of the Bands for 2009 contributed to this event being regarded as the youth event of the year in South Australia. A particular passion of Timothy’s is also the need for greater support for MAIN COMMITTEE those who are vulnerable and disenfranchised in the community. It has been this passion which has encouraged him to dedicate his time and effort to working with the Mental Illness Fellowship of South Australia. This passion has also led to him being asked to present an education program in local high schools to de-stigmatise mental health issues amongst young people, which is something that I think many young people would benefit from. Timothy has put endless hours into raising awareness of the plight of marginalised groups, with an emphasis on the disadvantaged. He has also completed the youth mental health first aid course and certification in child safe environments and reporting child abuse and neglect in the interest of further supporting the needs of young people. Not only has Timothy put others first in supporting fellow young people in his community but he is also passionate about protecting the rights and freedoms of all Australians, which is what motivated Timothy to become an Air Force cadet, stationed at the Keswick Barracks. Timothy was promoted to leading cadet in 2009. His persistence in the face of adversity is all the more moving, given his own hearing disability, which, whilst providing challenges, has not stopped him from helping others. After this litany of remarkable achievements, it is not surprising that Timothy is the Young Australian Citizen of the Year for the City of Unley in 2010 and the Young Citizen of the Year for South Australia this year. To top it all off, he has been nominated for the Channel9 Adelaide Airport Community Leadership Award and the RAA Driving Force Leadership Award. These nominations are fitting acknowledgments of the selfless work that Timothy does. I congratulate him on all of his achievements and wish him well in the future. (Time expired) Gippsland Electorate: Bushfire who have rallied to show their support for Black Saturday bushfire victims and their families on the occasion of the one-year anniversary of the tragedy. The recovery of my community has been nothing short of heroic over the past 12 months and there are many positive stories to tell. I stress that there is still a long way to go and governments will need to support the community in the years ahead, but the 12-month anniversary provides several examples of the community remaining united and determined to move forward. As Victorians gathered to reflect on the tragedy, there were three events in Gippsland which stood out for me. The most public event was the ecumenical service attended by several hundred people at the Monash University auditorium in Churchill. In gathering to pay tribute to the 11 victims, the community sent a message to their families and their friends that they will be here to support them for the long haul of recovery that lies ahead. Those who perished on Black Saturday in Gippsland were Alan and Miros Jacobs and their son, Luke; Martin Schultz; Colin and David Gibson; Trudy Martin; Annette Leatham; Fred and Scott Frendo; and Nathan Charles. The service was primarily organised by the Latrobe City Council to recognise those individuals and it struck the right chord with the community. It was reflective and respectful of the deceased but filled with hope for the future. The resilience of our community has certainly been tested, but we have risen from the ashes. It is on that theme that I pay tribute also to the Traralgon South community, particularly the local CFA members, for their efforts in establishing a permanent memorial for bushfire victims and their families.

I do admire the efforts of Benn Frederiksen, who designed the phoenix, and Wayne Simmons, who got the job of installation and presentation of the finished product. It is a magnificent reminder of the tragedy and the hardships that have been endured, but it also fills your heart with hope and promise for the future. There is one other event that I would like to mention. Six students from the Traralgon Secondary College decided that they wanted to do something themselves to honour the bushfire victims. The students attended the Snowy River Campus of the School for Student Leadership in the aftermath of the bushfires last year. During their nine-week stay at the Marlo school, the students were required to develop what is called a community leadership program. That involves taking back something that they have learnt from the school camp and making a contribution within their own community. On Saturday, I helped to unveil the memorial garden that the students have created at Traralgon South under their community leadership program. At a time when young people receive a lot of negative press, it was a pleasure to be on hand with the students to congratulate them, their families, their friends and the local businesses which contributed by sponsoring the garden’s development. I would like to publicly congratulate Abigail Livingstone, Grace McLachlan, Hayley Batchelor, Ben Wass, Ema Rasmussen and Ashley Chappel for their outstanding efforts on behalf of their community. They had the empathy, the respect and the compassion to want to do something to support our bushfire affected communities. They had the energy and the enthusiasm to pursue their project, and they had the determination and the resilience to actually finish the project. I congratulate all the students for demonstrating the type of leadership we want to instil in young people right across Australia.

I have worked with David over a number of years and really value his advice. I congratulate him very much. I want to talk about pyrethrum and, whilst I am talking about pyrethrum, I would like to talk about Botanical Resources Australia, which is a major manufacturer of pyrethrum extraction oil and pellets in my electorate, based at Ulverstone. Madam Deputy Speaker, I do not know whether you know that pyrethrum is the most widely used botanical or natural insecticide in the world. It is now the insecticide of choice for the environmentally conscious 21st century. Indeed, it was first recorded as a natural insecticide in the Zhou dynasty, some 2,000 years ago. Forty per cent of the world’s pyrethrum supply is grown in Tasmania, with a harvest area which has increased from 1,000 hectares in 2007 to 2,000 hectares in 2010. If the expansion plans for Botanical Resources Australia go ahead-and I am fairly confident that they will, after visiting them last week-they hope to have something like 4,000 hectares under cultivation by 2013. Last week I was hosted by Matt Greenhill and Brian Chung at the manufacturing centre in Ulverstone, which is in the Forth Valley, not far from my village of Forth, a beautiful area. They are looking to expand particularly the extraction side of their business as it becomes and continues to be enhanced as a world leader in the production of pyrethrum.

Pyrethrum is produced by the plant as its own protection against insect attack and is contained in millions of small oil glands in the outside of the seed coat in the flower’s head. Importantly, pyrethrum is very different from many synthetic insecticides in that, particularly, it is photosensitive-that is, it will break down in UV light into harmless substances. I congratulate Botanical Resources Australia and thank them very much for hosting me. I look forward to the expansion of their business and thank them very much for the employment opportunities they offer to so many people in my region and in Tasmania as a whole.

But I am more concerned about the recent comments he made regarding foreign aid, where he criticised the government for allocating money towards offsetting global food prices, basically using the usual pathetic line: ‘Look after people at home.’ As Damien Kingsbury noted in the Age, the biggest food and health problem in this country is overeating. Unfortunately, Senator Joyce’s comments were not too timely. They came soon after events in Haiti and in the context of recent events in the Sudan, which culminated over the last year in the forced movement of 350,000 people and massive international appeals by Oxfam, which led to the British government, as part of its aid program, in the past month allocating $70 million in an aid package. Most of that money, $58 million, is to be used by UN agencies and NGOs to provide emergency water, sanitation, health care and shelter in the Sudan. The comments also came at a time when figures came out of India and the United States regarding the major contribution from the food sector to current inflationary pressures. For whatever reason, whether it is because of the way in which crops are now being used for biofuel, whether it is because of the purchase by India, China and other countries of huge tracts of land in Africa and other parts of the world that are too impoverished for their own food production or whether it is because of the ascent in fuel prices, they are major factors in food price movements and of course combined will, in a massive way, hurt people in the underdeveloped world, through malnutrition and the general standard of living. So his comments attacking assistance to avoid massive food price increases were very untimely, very inhumane MAIN COMMITTEE",156,Statements By Members

148,Mr Laurie Ferguson (Reid,"Parliamentary Secretary for Multicultural Affairs andbut, unfortunately, typical of some loud thinking that the opposition leader had to slap down a few days later. It might actually be the thought within the opposition, but, of course, the Leader of the Opposition had to publicly move against him. Regarding the budget and appropriations, I want to turn to another subject. In an otherwise impressive contribution, the member for Bradfield used part of his maiden speech in this parliament to put up an image of huge attacks on local government in northern Sydney and, more particularly, in his electorate. He said that the state government essentially was moving to bring in draconian legislation and that the increased controls over local government planning in Sydney were the worse thing since the reign of terror after the French Revolution or Nazi Germany. The state government in New South Wales is doing something about public housing; it is overdue and extremely necessary. The reality is that the federal government has put significant requirements upon the New South Wales government with regard to social housing. I note that in NCOSS News some of the restrictions that have been placed on the state government with regard to public housing-and, I should say, very necessary public housing-include the fact that 75 per cent of the projects must be completed by December, at least 50 per cent of the new dwellings are to be provided to homeless Australians or those at risk of such and a significant proportion of new housing is to be transferred to community housing providers. That overall program of $1.76 billion is, as I said, very necessary. In Sydney we are seeing a wider problem-that is, the western, the south-western and the far western suburbs of Sydney are being asked to carry the full burden of density increases in our state. Some councils are cooperative with community responsibility, cooperative with the needs of the city in the long term, cooperative with the growing population of the city, while other councils, usually in very leafy suburbs, usually in suburbs with high-income workers, are essentially saying to the rest of the city, ‘Get stuffed.’ I, for one, strongly support the intervention by the federal government to ensure some equity in this matter. State opposition members in New South Wales are conducting a relentless campaign against public housing throughout the city. I live in an area that, in the 1960s, was essentially made up of public housing. Obviously, the nature of the tenants at that stage was very different from what it is today. We spent so much money on public housing at that stage that people who were lowincome workers actually got into commission houses. But these days it is basically people on social welfare, people with very clear problems, single parents, disabled people and people with addictions. We have seen a campaign by opposition members in New South Wales of denigration, of attack, of marginalisation in opposing public housing ventures. The reality is that, whilst it is easy to go to people in a street or a suburb and say, ‘Your house price is going to be repressed by these people living near you,’ if we are really talking about responsibility and countering social problems the worse thing that we can do is say that in large parts of Sydney there cannot be public housing, that it is not allowed, and basically push people into huge reservoirs that feed off each other’s social problems and poverty. That is the solution that the opposition are basically moving towards. They use the simplistic and materialistic pressure, which people will often find very appealing, of saying, ‘We won’t have higher densities of housing. Auburn, Granville, Parramatta, Penrith, Campbelltown and Liverpool should be basically forced to take 15or 20-storey high buildings whilst these other councils, particularly in the northern suburbs, basically don’t pull their weight.’ MAIN COMMITTEE However, the truth is that the measures are not as draconian as they speculate. In reality, whilst the chief executive of Housing New South Wales will have the ultimate say in these projects, local councils will have to be consulted as to immediate neighbours and be provided with the designs of these projects within 21 days. What we are seeing here is a very unfortunate campaign. It is against the public interest. It is a recipe, as I say, for reservations of poverty. It is a recipe for social problems. It is a recipe for increased incarceration of people from these areas. Basically, the opposition position is totally irresponsible. priation Bill (No. 3) 2009-2010 and cognate bill, and I am forced to speak on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill 2010 that the government brought before the House without notice. The manager of government business came into the House and guillotined a very important debate for both sides of the House. I have to speak in this place for those people who have no voice. I want to use this opportunity of the debate on the appropriation bills to talk about the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Bill as it was brought forward by the Labor government. The member for Gippsland and I are wondering right now where it has gone since we were here last. Where has it gone? Has it gone to the Senate? Will it disappear into the ether or is it really going to come forward again in the upper house? It was last year that my inbox, along with the inboxes of many of my coalition colleagues, was literally inundated with thousands and thousands of emails calling on me, as the member for Maranoa, and many of us in the opposition to stand up to the Labor government in relation to their plan to put a new tax on everything. That was meant to be the solution to carbon pollution and emissions as they saw it. As they saw it, that would help reduce the temperature of the planet. But it was nothing more, as the Australian public rightly knew, than a great big new tax. It would have hit families and households. It would have hit family budgets. Of course, we all know that it would have done very little, if anything, for the global environment. We told the Australian people the truth: it was a tax that would be imposed by the government, managed by an international finance and trading system and would have little significance in reducing carbon emissions. Our Prime Minister, the people’s prime minister, who was elected at the last federal election, planned before parliament rose at the end of last year to ram through this Labor legislation so that he could take it to Copenhagen. He was so desperate to have this piece of paper in his hand to wave around when he arrived in Copenhagen, Denmark. He was going to be a world leader and he was going to negotiate for the world to follow him and the model that he had got through the Australian parliament and which would now be law. But thankfully the coalition and the crossbench senators prevented the Prime Minister from doing just that. And of course we all know what the outcome of Copenhagen was: pretty much nothing. It was a great big talkfest costing millions and millions of dollars of Australian taxpayers’ money. Were we surprised on this side of the House? No, we were not, because we had a Prime Minister and a Labor government that would not listen to the voice of the people or to rational debate. The Prime Minister was also hell-bent on impressing the President of the United States. He really gave no consideration to Australian families or Australian businesses. He was far more interested in impressing the global leaders and the President of the United States and in stepping onto the world stage. He was not worried about families out there struggling with a MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Appropriation Bill No 4 2009 2010
149,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (4.51 Pm),"This afternoon I rise to speak on the Appromortgage and high grocery prices. He wanted to be on the global stage with a piece of legislation that had passed-thankfully, it did not pass-both houses and had become law. He was willing to sacrifice jobs and he was also willing to allow families to be hit with an increase of up to 25 per cent in household electricity bills. The Prime Minister was willing for mining jobs in Central Queensland to be lost, because that is the net effect of what would have happened. He was also willing for dairy farmers in the southern downs in my electorate of Maranoa to be hit with the extra costs-and these are figures by ABARE; they are not figures by the coalition or another independent think tank. As the member for Gippsland would also be aware, if the ETS had passed it would have hit dairy farmers, based on ABARE figures, with an additional $9,000 cost per dairy farmer. pass it on because they are at the end of the line. They are at the primary stage of production. Dairy farmers, like so many farmers in Australia, buy everything retail and sell everything wholesale. So this would have been just another impost on the costs of production. Of course, the ETS was just another way for this government to raise revenue to compensate for its mismanagement of our economy. WhatI find most concerning is that we have a Prime Minister who gazes across the seas for clues on how to govern our nation. He does not look inward across our nation. He does not take his cue from the people he is meant to lead-the Australian people. It is no wonder that Australians are angry and that we are seeing that anger being reflected in the polls. We have a Prime Minister who was voted into government by the people who thought that he would have had their best interests at heart, yet he is still prepared to sacrifice 126,000 jobs in regional Australia for his giant new tax, a tax which would have done very little for the environment here in Australia or around the world. That was the net result: 126,000 jobs lost in regional Australia-in seats like Gippsland, Riverina, Farrer, Indi, Murray and my own electorate of Maranoa. And these were figures from Treasury! They were the sorts of numbers of jobs that would have been lost. Of course, as the member for Gippsland knows, with every job there is a family. There is a family to feed. There are children. But that would have been the net number of jobs, based on figures from Treasury, that regional Australia alone would have lost as a result of this great big new tax. We can talk a lot about the impact on businesses but I just want to focus a little longer on households and how they would have been worse off. Households would have been worse off because there was not going to be compensation for every household for the increased costs of living, for the increased cost of electricity-which was well documented, I might say, by the government-that would have affected every household. Some would have received some compensation, but what about the aged-care facilities, as the member for Gippsland would know? Would they have been compensated for the increased cost of living that would have been an impost on the aged-care facilities which care for some of the most vulnerable in our community and which do a magnificent job? Their costs would have risen without an offset in compensation and without an increased payment for their recurrent funding. There are some 900,000 small businesses in Australia. There has never been any mention of how small businesses would be compensated. Small businesses, not multinational businesses, are the engine room of our economy. We all have small businesses in our electorates. MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Appropriation Bill No 4 2009 2010

151,Mr Bruce Scott,"And with no compensation and no capacity for the dairy farmer toThey are in the suburbs, in the cities and out in the country. There is no compensation for small businesses to pay for the increased cost of electricity for everything they produce. The Prime Minister himself has admitted that in the first two years of the ETS there would be a 19 per cent increase in the cost of electricity. Some 19,000 jobs would be lost in the mining industry alone in the next 10 years and 45,000 jobs would be lost in the energy-intensive industries. Queensland, with its coal industry, is an energy state. In my electorate of Maranoa we have the Surat Basin. To the north, the electorates of Flynn, Capricornia and Dawson would all be affected by the emissions trading scheme put forward by the Labor government. Thankfully, the scheme has been defeated in the upper house-twice. Unfortunately, in the lower house the opposition cannot muster the numbers or get those on the other side with any courage to come across and vote with the opposition. The member for Flynn, a representee from the Labor Party, has a large proportion of the Bowen Basin in his seat and jobs that are dependent on the coal industry. And what about the member for Dawson? Where has he been? Dawson has a coal export terminal with a massive number of jobs. Often the workers who live there fly in and out to jobs west of Mackay. It is the same in Gladstone, Emerald, Blackwater Bluff, Tjuringa, Capella, Tieri and Middlemount. All those towns are very much dependent on the viability of the coal industry. But where is the member for Dawson? Where is the member for Capricornia? Where is the member for Flynn? Do they have the courage to come across to our side of the House and say: ‘Prime Minister, we think we’ve got this wrong. We’d better vote for the people we represent in this place. We want to represent the working families who’d be affected by the ETS.’ No, they blindly follow the Prime Minister. I know that at the next federal election, which is coming up sometime this year, those working families will be able to make judgments on those from the other side of the House who do not have the courage to stand up for the jobs and families that will be affected if the Senate ever passes this flawed legislation, which is nothing more than the introduction of a great big new tax on everything. As I said earlier, the ETS would not only cost jobs; it would also cost families. Labor’s ETS would cost Australian families something like $120 billion over the next 10 years. I spoke a moment ago about compensation, but it would have been dependent on the government legislating to bring forward that compensation. We have seen how this government sometimes handles those issues when it comes to the delivery of a promise being converted into legislation and law. Families have no guarantee that they are going to be compensated adequately. They are relying on a Prime Minister and a government which says one thing prior to an election but delivers something else after the election. Mr Deputy Speaker Schultz, I, like you, represent a regional seat. I know that the emissions trading scheme proposed by this Labor government would have had a huge and negative impact on my electorate of Maranoa. I have almost the entire Surat coal basin in my electorate. Xstrata are proposing new coal mines for the Wandoan area, which is almost in my electorate, and within the next three to four years they plan, obviously if a coalition government-which will not bring in the great big new tax that the Labor Party is proposing-is elected to export 30 million tonnes of coal from their Wandoan coal leases. Then there is coal seam methane gas. British Gas, Arrow Energy, Queensland Gas Co., Origin Energy and Santos are all energy companies that are tapping into the coal seam to extract the coal seam methane gas and they MAIN COMMITTEE will be sending that to Gladstone to convert into liquefied natural gas for export to markets overseas. When they are competing for the same market with countries which do not have the threat of a great big new tax overhanging their production and the cost structures of their industries, we have to ask ourselves whether this will ever be a viable proposition. Something like 15,000 jobs are going to be generated by the coal seam methane industry in Maranoa during both the construction phase and the ongoing production of LNG out of Gladstone. Gladstone is of course in the seat of Flynn. More jobs have been put at risk by the member for Flynn. He did not have the courage to come to this side of the House and stick up for the potential jobs that would have delivered wealth to Gladstone and the working families who live there. There is also the Galilee Basin, which is east of Barcaldine and out near Jericho and is in fact a larger resource than the Surat coal basin. Two major companies are looking at the development of that-Gina Rinehart, from Western Australia, with one lease and Clive Palmer with his leases. Once again, there are more jobs, but jobs will be at risk if there is a great big new tax impacting on the coal industry and the viability of those leases, which are some 500 kilometres from the port at Mackay. When you have to carry coal that distance every kilometre adds another cost and you have to compete with other countries that do not have that huge transport component. These mines, and these jobs, may never be developed if this government is ever able to pass this flawed legislation and introduce a great big new tax that would impact on the viability of potential mines like those in the Galilee Basin or the Surat coal basin. But this is not just about local jobs; it is about wealth for the nation. When people have jobs they pay income tax, so the Commonwealth also benefits and the economy grows. But, as we know, this government really has no idea about managing the economy let alone an understanding of how their great big new tax would impact on the mining sector and on my electorate of Maranoa. Maranoa is not only a huge agriculturally based economy but a growing base for the production of energy from coal and for the production of alternative and renewable energy. Right out in the west of my electorate is the Cooper Basin, a huge resource in a very remote part of Australia. It feeds into the Moomba oil and gas fields, which pump gas into Adelaide, Sydney, Melbourne and Mount Isa. Not once did we hear any concern from the Labor Party about those resources, which are so essential to driving the energy needs of our major capital cities, and the costs that would be imposed on the production of the gas and oil wells in the outback of my electorate. But thankfully there is the opposition-the Liberal and National parties and the crossbench senators as well. We have given the people of Australia a very clear choice. We have a direct action plan that will put a carrot out there to encourage energy companies to put in technology that will reduce their carbon emissions. But we do not have a stick and we do not have a great big new tax. One of those energy companies in my electorate is the Tarong Power Station. Already they are looking at how they can utilise algal research-new technology that would be able to capture carbon at the point of burning it and convert it, through synthesis and other processes, into algal oil and protein meal. So companies are looking for ways to deal with carbon, but what we have is a great carrot to encourage companies or businesses to apply for money in a competitive process to allow them to reduce their carbon footprint. That would become a credit in terms of carbon accounting here in Australia. The company will invest in MAIN COMMITTEE the new technologies. They will have a carrot in the form of some grant money from the Commonwealth government. The alternative is quite clear. We heard from the Labor Party throughout last year and again when we were denied the opportunity to speak in the House. The Leader of the House used the guillotine and denied opposition members their right to speak when the bill was before the House of Representatives. Our direct action plan is something that I believe all Australians understand. It is simple. It is not a great big tax. It is a carrot. It is encouraging new technology and it will not hurt families. It will be good for Australia and I put to the Main Committee this afternoon that this is an alternative to Labor’s great big new tax. (Time expired) Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (5.11 pm)-It is always a pleasure to follow the member for Maranoa. I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2009-2010 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2009-2010 and to congratulate the government on its ongoing commitment to assuring Australia’s immediate economic well-being while at the same time building for our country’s domestic and international future. That is very important. While I respect the fact that the honourable member for Maranoa has a view about the government, the reality is that people in the electorate-and no doubt in his electorate, as in my electorate-are very concerned about the economic stability and the economic future of this country, because an economic future that is bleak or that runs the risk of going the way that a lot of other economies in the Western world appear to be going would be detrimental to the daily lives of all Australians, in particular my constituents and, I am sure, the member’s constituents as well. That is why I am very pleased to be speaking to appropriation bills Nos3 and 4. As I have said, we are all aware that the recent period of global economic meltdown has affected all major economies. Despite the instability and uncertainty, whichever way you want to cut it the reality is that Australia has come out of this period in a very strong position. That cannot be denied under any circumstances. However, while we are in a strong position, we are not in the clear yet. That is also a truth. The people in my electorate are relieved that their jobs and their homes have weathered the economic storm that has brought near disaster to countries around the world. We will all be aware of the great difficulties that my place of birth, Greece, finds itself in. I think most of us are reading on a daily basis of the trouble that the Greek economy is in, and not only the Greek economy but also other economies in Europe-the Spanish, the Portuguese, the Irish and the Italian. We almost have to hold our collective breath knowing that, if something is not done to assist those economies, further financial problems are afoot. Not only would that affect the Europeans but it could have an impact on the rest of the world. I think that my constituents see that and are relieved that the Australian economy has managed to pull through in relatively good stead, and of course that has an immediate impact on their daily lives. This round of appropriations that I am speaking to today continues that trend of sensible, confident and far-sighted financial management that this government has put in place, and that is probably the best way to describe it. Our attitude and our management of the economy have been sensible, confident and very far-sighted. These bills seek to appropriate authority from the parliament for additional expenditure of money from the Consolidated Revenue Fund in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last budget. The total additional appropriation being sought through these bills is over $2 billion. TodayI want to take the time MAIN COMMITTEE to focus on a number of elements of this round of appropriations that I feel deserve praise because they have an immediate impact not only on the country nationally but also on my electorate. I recognise and welcome the fact that this round will be directed towards our important nation-building agenda and will continue the practical measures that this government has committed to in order to ensure we can all take practical action to reduce our collective and individual impact on the environment. Importantly for my electorate of Calwell, in speaking to this round of appropriations I am afforded the opportunity to recognise how the national agenda has very real and very positive local outcomes. My electorate is located, as I have said many times before, in Melbourne’s north and has a substantial manufacturing sector. Many of the people of Calwell are from low-income households and are extremely vulnerable to the uncertainties of the market. Of course I watched with concern, as they did, as a number of factories and businesses closed in the face of the global financial crisis. As the threat of a global financial crisis reared, we all watched trade exposed companies who had to turn long-term employees out off their jobs. While the Rudd government stemmed that tide with its economic stimulus package, the impact of the slowdown on some of our trading partners is still being felt, and I referred to some of those at the beginning of my speech. That is why I want to welcome the $40 million in additional funding for the General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, or the GEERS program, as it is known. As a government we have responsibility at a national level to do the best we can to help businesses and companies grow, but sometimes the best endeavours of local industry may succumb to international commercial pressures. Government has a responsibility to support vulnerable workers when this situation arises. In appropriating this funding for GEERS, the Rudd government is displaying its capacity to balance macroeconomic management with compassion and consideration for working Australians. I also welcome the $45.2 million appropriation to fund the government’s response to the H1N1 influenza virus. Calwell, I am proud to say, is home to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, Australia’s leading biopharmaceutical company. CSL is the only commercial manufacturer of influenza vaccines in the Southern Hemisphere and has been contracted by the government, as we all know, to supply 21 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine. CSL employs over 1,600 people across its Broadmeadows and Parkville sites. CSL is one of the companies that is keeping Australia at the international forefront of research and development. This appropriation is complemented by $26 million to purchase the H1N1 influenza vaccine and support the associated clinical trials. As Chair of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Innovation, I am particularly aware of the necessity for the government to remain focused on research, development and innovation. This is important for the development of our innovation capacity, but it is also important because Australia’s medical research sector leads the way in important medical research. And, of course, that important medical research that we led the way in also leads in the end to life-saving treatments and vaccines. The H1N1 vaccine is very much a case where Australia is at the forefront of its development. As proof of how highly regarded Australia is internationally for its scientific and medical advances, I can give an example from when I was in Greece last July while that country was coming to terms with the first of its MAIN COMMITTEE swine flu cases. Like a lot of other countries it was not prepared for the onslaught of swine flu or H1N1. I was interested because, in the few days I was there, it was in fact to Australia that the Greek media and even the Greek politicians continuously referred when talking about the development of a vaccine. It makes you stop and realise just how highly regarded we are. Not only are we highly regarded internationally but we are also relied upon, and of course we want to be able to develop that capacity. We are proud of that, we want to develop it and we want to be out there at the cutting edge where we have been on many occasions. In order to do that, governments have to be serious about funding and providing money for research and development. This government does that and it does it as part of a central theme of its agenda as a government. Speaking on the H1N1 virus-because I have spoken to a lot of my constituents, as I am sure a lot of other members have also-I want to take the opportunity to raise some concerns about the general public’s attitude towards the H1N1 virus and in particular their attitude toward the vaccine. As I said, I do not have the figures for how many people have been vaccinated, but I get the feeling just from talking to people that not as many as we would have expected have actually taken up the opportunity to get themselves vaccinated. In speaking to many of my constituents, I get the sense there is a bit of complacency around. A lot of people feel that the virus is not as deadly as was initially thought. SoI want to take this opportunity to remind the House that vaccination generally, let alone the H1N1 vaccination, is a significant factor in protecting our community from viruses that have a history of killing people. Medical and scientific research has benefited our community. In Australia in particular, our medical and scientific integrity is second to none. We should be proud of our doctors and scientists and we have every reason to be confident in their work. SoI want to say to people out there who might feel a little apprehensive about it that being vaccinated in Australia is as good as they are ever going to get anywhere in terms of the confidence we can have in our medical and scientific research. That is why I want to support the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon. Nicola Roxon, and support her call for a vaccination against the pandemic flu. It is important to remember that those amongst us who are most vulnerable need to be vaccinated and the most vulnerable are children. In the case of H1N1, the vulnerable are also the elderly, pregnant women and people who are in contact with the general public on a day-to-day basis. Receiving the backing of the Australian Medical Association, the minister’s call serves to demonstrate that the government is willing to show leadership on an issue no less important than the health and well-being of all Australians. This is a government that is not willing to take the risk of Australians dying unnecessarily of infectious diseases as a result of not having made the vaccine available. This is a government which has taken all necessary steps by way of prevention to ensure that we are spared the pressures of a pandemic flu on our public health system. Australians have to be aware that the precautionary measures taken by the government reflect the reality of the pandemic flu. With 37,196 cases verified and 5,000 people hospitalised, the Australian newspaper reported last month that Westmead Hospital in New South Wales had to cancel elective surgery for several weeks in response to the H1N1 virus. It is important to note that one-third of all people in intensive care with the virus were from at-risk groups. It MAIN COMMITTEE is really incumbent upon all of us not to be complacent about this issue and to not assume there is nothing to worry about. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2009-10 proposes an additional appropriation of $12 million for the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government. This amount will go towards the establishment of a local government reform fund to help councils manage their infrastructure and to plan for their future needs. It will also provide funding under the Regional And Local Community Infrastructure Program to support investment in community infrastructure for very important things such as libraries, community centres, sportsgrounds and environmental infrastructure. I would like to report that in December last year-in fact, on 16 December-I was very, very pleased to officiate on behalf of the minister for infrastructure in the sod turning for the Craigieburn Library and Learning Centre in my electorate. I cannot overstate the value of this facility to my community. I have spoken before about the dynamic role played in my community by the existing Hume Global Learning Centre based in Broadmeadows; in fact, this is Broadmeadows’s first ever library. So we are very proud of it, but we are proud of it because it is an extraordinary state-of-the-art facility. The new facility in Craigieburn, just up the road from Broadmeadows-a high-growth corridor with lots of young families, where infrastructure is struggling to keep up with the number of people moving into the electorate and into Craigieburn-will extend the valuable cultural, educational and social networks of the Hume Global Learning Centre to that growth corridor. Facilities such as these in my electorate, including the learning centre, community sporting facilities, parks and halls, have been supported all over the nation through the government’s Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Fund. I cannot overstate the value of that fund to the broader community at a local level. It is these small and not-so-small projects that make a genuine difference to the lives of local residents. All you have to do is ask a community that has outgrown a cramped and outdated library, as is the case in Craigieburn. Quaint as the old library might be, as nostalgic as we all were over more or less waving it goodbye, you cannot understand the stress that is placed on a community by cramped and outdated facilities. We also cannot underestimate the impact of old netball courts or the lack of available netball courts for young women who love to play netball. Netball is a very popular sport amongst young women, certainly in my electorate. In Craigieburn, which is very much a sporting community, netball and other sports are very popular. Of course, in order to play them effectively, you have to have the right facilities. So the federal government is supporting local government in providing these basic but vital facilities through its nation building. I am very pleased that my electorate is a recipient of this kind of support. Community infrastructure, we all know, is very much reliant on strong and vibrant local government that works effectively in partnership with the federal government, as is the case now. This is a very important appropriation for my community. Last Wednesday-unfortunately, I was here, so I could not attend-marked the official opening of the Broadmeadows Primary School and early years centre, and the Hume Central Secondary College in my electorate, in Broadmeadows. Both schools were opened by the Premier of Victoria, John Brumby, and the Minister for Education, Bronwyn Pike. TodayI would like to note the great achievement represented by these schools. They are fantastic new buildings that are a real credit to the innovative thinking and sheer hard work of the school MAIN COMMITTEE community-the students, teachers and parents and of course, most of all, the school community leaders. I appreciate the enormous amount of work and foresight that was put into the planning and design of the new school as well as the complex processes of consultation and negotiation. This was all a result of a significant state government investment in local schools of about $30 million, which is complemented by the federal government’s $142 million investment in Building the Education Revolution in my electorate. So a significant amount of money has gone into Calwell, into building our schools, and in this case the beneficiaries have been many of our public primary and secondary schools. I know that in my electorate over the next five years a transformation of our entire school system will take place, and that can only be to the benefit of the young people who study there. The federal government has also invested over $142 million in my electorate, with over $125 million of that money spent on 116 projects in 58 schools as part of Building the Education Revolution. The federal government has been pleased to work with schools within my electorate through projects such as the Smarter Schools National Partnerships initiative and the National School Pride Program. These appropriation bills and the overall government stimulus package have provided significant money to my electorate. We can now look forward to a future in which the local education sector will be strengthened, in particular in our local public schools, which, of course, is crucial to the future hopes and aspirations of our local young people. We can also look to a future where our local jobs are secured through the government’s industry packages and where the everyday lives of my constituents continue to be strongly supported by the Rudd Labor government acting in the national interest at a very local level. and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2009-2010. I also welcome this opportunity to address the parliament through this Main Committee regarding my concerns about the Rudd government’s emissions trading scheme legislation which passed through the House two weeks ago and is now before the Senate. On that occasion I was unable to join in the debate because the debate was gagged. I do welcome this opportunity to express my concerns and share them with my constituents. That legislation was entitled the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and as the debate was gagged before I was able to speak, this opportunity is important to me and my constituents because not only will it impose a higher tax on the people and the families of Australia, particularly the families in my electorate of Hughes, but also because I am very concerned that the very basis of this legislation-the global climate model managed by the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology-has now been shown to be structurally unsound. I spoke on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme legislation late last year and I refer my constituents and other interested persons to my speech on 28 October, which is located on my website, www.dannavale.com, In that speech I said that this legislation was a fraud upon the people of Australia and that I was utterly opposed to it. Since then this legislation has also been seen for what it really is: it is a contrived piece of wedge politics by a self-serving, morally bankrupt Rudd Labor government. The people of Australia have shown that they are sick of such selfish, political manoeuvring, and on their behalf I invite the Rudd Labor government to get serious instead of tricky spin politics. Specifically, it is high time that the Rudd government began to deal with the hard evidence-based scientific facts that are already before MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Appropriation Bill No 4 2009 2010
152,Mrs Vale (Hughes) (5.31 Pm),"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2009-2010them. I specifically refer to two very important peer reviewed scientific research papers that provide clear and irrefutable evidence that the global climate model jointly managed by the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology is structurally unsound. These Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme bills are actually grounded on this global climate model. Again, I take the time to point out that the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and its associated bills-or the very title of these bills-should cause alarm amongst educated Australians because they will know that carbon dioxide is not a pollutant but it is a vital fertiliser. I was amused the other week to hear the member for Rankin expose an unusual ignorance about this important life-giving compound. He expressed his amusement at my description of carbon dioxide as a potent fertiliser and, up to now, a free fertiliser at that. The horticulturists of Australia will read his disparaging comments with their own collective bemusement as they pump life-giving carbon dioxide into their greenhouses to promote vigorous plant growth to provide food for their fellow Australians. Carbon itself is the building block of everything that lives on our planet; indeed, nothing lives without it. Yet the Rudd Labor government continues to try to deceive the people of Australia by maintaining the unscientific claim that life-giving carbon is a pollutant. Wikipedia proclaims: Carbon forms the backbone of biology for all life on earth. A doubling of the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere will take around a century and, as well as causing a free 20 to 50 percent increase in food production depending on the crop type and local conditions, it will also lead to an anthropological greening of the planet earth by promoting more vigorous growth of vegetation in natural landscapes. However, the title of the emissions trading scheme legislation is only the first thing that concerns me about this legislation. More importantly, I also hold very real concerns about the scientific premise upon which these bills are based. This House, the scientific community and the people of Australia should be made aware that the global climate model from our scientists at the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology, upon which Garnaut relied to produce his report to the government, has since been shown to be structurally unsound and its conclusions are therefore seriously flawed. As I have foreshadowed earlier, I have two peer reviewed scientific research papers that provide clear and apparently irrefutable evidence that the global climate model jointly managed by the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology is structurally unsound. The lead authors were Garth Paltridge and Frank Wentz respectively. Both these papers state explicitly in plain English that their real world observations flatly contradict two key speculative underlying theories on which the joint CSIRO-Bureau of Meteorology global climate model is based. The pre-eminence of observations over theories is a cornerstone of science. Accordingly, these now disproved theories should already have been expunged from the joint CSIRO-Bureau of Meteorology global climate model. WhatI do not have today, pursuant to my request in my letter of 14 December to Senator the Hon. Kim Carr, Minister for Innovation, Industry, Science and Research, is two written, testable hard science rebuttals to these two research papers by Paltridge and Wentz. In my letter of 14 December, I concluded by saying MAIN COMMITTEE Since the cited papers explicitly contradict key underlying theories on which the joint. CSIRO/BoM GCM is based, I expect the rebuttals will be to hand and anticipate receiving copies early in the New Year and well before the CPRS Bills are reintroduced. Unless and until the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology provide two written, testable hard science rebuttals to these two research papers, their joint global climate model is structurally unsound and its forecasts are exaggerated and misleading. In consequence, the recommendations in the Garnaut report are rubbish recommendations based on disproved science and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is an unmitigated disaster for Australia. The Rudd government has shown its utter disregard for the well-being of ordinary Australians by proceeding with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme bills without first holding the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology to account and insisting that they either provide these two rebuttals or fix their global climate model and provide updated forecasts. The CPRS will impose great hardship and extra costs on my constituents and on the people of Australia. The Rudd government has clearly put the second term ambitions of the Labor Party first and the welfare of the people of Australia a distant second. Unsubstantiated and half-baked disparagement of these two empirical discoveries appears to be sufficient for the Rudd government, but it is not acceptable for the Abbott opposition, nor for the people of Australia, nor for the wider scientific community. For members of the scientific community-and for all those who are interested-the two empirical discoveries are reported in the following peer reviewed scientific research papers. Paltridge et al were published in the Journal of Theoretical and Applied Climatology, volume 98, Nos3 to 4, pages 351 to 359, February 2009, and were published online on 26 February 2009. The title of their research paper is ‘Trends in middleand upper-level tropospheric humidity from NCEP reanalysis data’ by Garth Paltridge, Albert Arking and Michael Pook, February 2009. Wentz et al were published in the journal Science, Volume 317, pages 233 to 235, 13 July 2007, and were published online on 31 May 2007. The title of their research paper is ‘How much more rain will global warming bring?’ by FrankJ Wentz, Lucrezia Ricciardulli, Kyle Hilburn and Carl Mears, May 2007. Once the joint CSIRO-Bureau of Meteorology global climate model is made compliant with the empirical discoveries reported in these two papers, it will forecast an increase in global temperature of 0.2 degrees Celsius to 0.5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of CO2. Compliance with just one of these empirical discoveries, even without the other, will lead to a forecast of under one degree Celsius. A doubling of CO2 in isolation-that is, without any consequential changes in the atmosphere-will cause a temperature increase of around 0.8 degrees Celsius. The major global climate models, including the joint CSIRO-Bureau of Meteorology global climate model, use now-disproved speculative theories about consequential changes in the atmosphere to provide massive positive feedback, which amplifies the 0.8 degrees Celsius by factors of four to over eight, and so predict temperature increases of three degrees Celsius to over six degrees Celsius for a doubling of CO2. In particular, the major global climate models are based on two speculative theories: first, that the amount of water vapour in the upper troposphere increases as CO2 and temperature increases, whereas Paltridge discovered that, in the real world, the amount of water vapour in the upper troposphere decreases; and, second, that evaporation increases by about 1.7 per cent MAIN COMMITTEE per one degree Celsius increase in temperature, whereas Wentz discovered that, in the real world, evaporation increases by around seven per cent per one degree Celsius increase in temperature. Evaporation is extremely important in keeping the earth cool. Oceans cover around 71 per cent of the earth’s surface and provide around 86 per cent of the evaporative cooling. If there were no evaporative cooling and we had to rely almost entirely on greenhouse gas affected by radiative cooling, the average global temperature, instead of being around 15 degrees Celsius, would be around 67 degrees Celsius. So if you want to warm up the virtual world on your computer screen, this is very easily accomplished. All you have to do is follow the example set by the CSIRO and constrain virtual evaporation. I do not have-and very few members in this place have-any background in science, and for this reason we are understandably cautious. However, we must not allow ourselves to be intimidated. Those of us in government must make every effort possible to ensure that the advice presented by a group of scientists does not mislead the people of Australia. In this instance, the science speaks clearly and eloquently and makes plain to all of us the fact that the joint CSIRO-Bureau of Meteorology global climate model is structurally flawed. I will now read an extract from the research paper by Garth Paltridge and his colleagues. ‘Water vapor feedback in climate models is positive mainly because of their roughly constant relative humidity (that is, increasing specific humidity) in the mid-to-upper troposphere as the planet warms. Negative trends in specific humidity as found in the National Centers for Environmental Prediction, or NCEP, data would imply that long-term water vapor feedback is ternal forcing such as that from increasing atmospheric CO2.’ I have asked that the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology provide a written, testable, hard-science rebuttal to this empirical discovery made by Garth Paltridge and his colleagues, but so far they have failed to do so. Garth Paltridge and his colleagues published their empirical discovery in February 2009. An ethical scientific organisation would be expected to have made its computer-created virtual world-that is, its global climate model-compliant with this discovery about what happens in the real world well before the end of 2009. I will now read an extract from the research paper by Frank Wentz and his colleagues. Climate models and satellite observations both indicate the total amount of water in the atmosphere will increase substantially due to global warming at a rate of 7% K–1seven per cent per one degree kelvin. However, the climate models predict global precipitation will increase at a much slower rate of 1-3% K– 1 . A recent analysis of satellite observations does not support this prediction of a muted response of precipitation to global warming. Rather, the observations suggest that precipitation and total atmospheric water have increased at about the same rate over the last two decades. For the information of members, a degree kelvin is equal to a degree Celsius, and global evaporation must equal global precipitation over time scales longer than a month. Again, I have asked the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology to provide written, testable, hard-science rebuttals to this empirical discovery by Frank Wentz and his colleagues. But, again, they have failed, so far, to do so. Frank Wentz and his colleagues published their empirical discovery in May 2007. An ethical scientific organisation would be expected to have MAIN COMMITTEE made its computer-created virtual world-that is, its global climate model-compliant with this discovery about what happens in the real world well before the end of 2007. Since returning from his abortive trip to Copenhagen, Prime Minister Rudd seems to have become, silently, almost a closet climate sceptic. Prime Minister Rudd must put the welfare of the people of Australia ahead of Labor’s now-faltering ambitions for a second term and admit that, but for the intervention of the coalition, his disgraceful government would have enthusiastically and triumphantly led the people of Australia into an unmitigated disaster in Copenhagen. The government has grounded its emissions trading legislation on the global model managed by a team of scientists at the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology. This was made clear when, on 2 February this year, the Prime Minister felt the need to hide behind the scientists when he said: We accept what the Bureau of Meteorology in Australia has said. We accept also what the Australian Chief Scientist has said. The Prime Minister and his entire government can no longer hide behind the scientists. It was not a scientist but the Rudd government that decided to introduce the CPRS bills without first insisting on the rebuttals to the Paltridge and Wentz empirical discoveries. With that decision, the Rudd government stepped into the open and exposed its politically driven determination to proceed with the CPRS no matter what the science says or how clearly it says it. That decision was made by the Prime Minister, and he will be rightly held accountable to the people of Australia. Truth is the daughter of time. The Australian recently reported what Australia’s Chief Scientist, Professor Penny Sackett, said as follows: Professor Sackett said climate change was a scientific reality but there was a need for absolute openness and rigour in the presentation of evidence, including recognition of which aspects of climate change science were imprecise and required further research. I could not agree more. But a climate change of 0.2 degrees to 0.5 degrees Celsius is vastly different from the three degrees to over six degrees being forecast by the structurally unsound global climate models of the CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology. So where is the response from the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology to the empirical evidence now presented by the Paltridge and Wentz papers? Where is the ‘absolute openness’, I ask Professor Sackett? Where is the ‘rigour’? How long do we have to wait-or does the deafening silence mean that the usual ethical practice of two of our leading and respected scientific organisations has been compromised by their political masters? If this is so, the scientific community as a whole will be devalued by such a manifest lack of professional ethics, and the people of Australia will be defrauded, just as I have suggested. Sadly, unless and until the scientists of the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology produce testable, hard-science rebuttals to these two scientific papers, the respect and the high regard with which these two prestigious organisations have been held in the past within the world’s scientific community will be seriously constrained. I cannot and do not accept this dishonest legislation presented by the emissions trading bills. I do not support the immoral massive tax that it will impose upon the people of Australia on just about everything on the pretence of helping our environment. I do not support that legislation because it will do absolutely nothing for our environment. It has no mechanisms to do so. I do not support this legislation because it was based on science that has now been MAIN COMMITTEE shown to be unsound and seriously flawed and, as such, that legislation will present a monumental fraud upon the people of Australia, and I will have no part in it. Ms COLLINS (Franklin) (5.49 pm)-I rise tonight in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2009-2010 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2009-2010. I would like to talk about some of the economic activity that is happening in my electorate of Franklin. Of course, I am referring here primarily to the economic stimulus package and the money that is coming into my electorate. I was at a school, at a breakfast club, last week and, after the breakfast club, one of the school association members was so excited about the works going on at the school that she wanted to show me the latest update and she took me around the school and showed me the works that were underway there. It is the same for every single primary school in my electorate that I visit. The school community, the parents, the children and the teachers are all saying that this investment in our schools is long overdue and that it is needed. But, more than that, when I talk to the contractors and work men and women on site at these schools they all say that the stimulus package supported jobs during the global financial crisis and they are all saying that it is helping the Tasmanian economy. I have been going along to some of the projects. I went to a stimulus housing project just last week where there were six units on one site in one of the suburbs in my electorate. The contractor there told me that there were 20 jobs involved in building just those six units. We are getting at least 23 social housing units built in my electorate. It is a very significant investment in my electorate. We are expecting 23 social housing units in stage 1 and 88 in stage 2, with over $29 million being invested in Franklin’s social housing through the economic stimulus package. We are seeing improvements around the schools from the National School Pride Program. There are many schools that have already completed some of those maintenance works. We also have defence housing. We have quite a few black spots in my electorate and as you drive down through the south of the electorate through Kingston and Huonville, as I did last week, you come across the projects and you can see the vast improvements that are being made to our roads as you go through. We also have the community infrastructure projects. It was my great delight just last night, with the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government and the captain of the Australian cricket team, Ricky Ponting, to turn on the lights at Bellerive Oval which are being funded by our community infrastructure program through the economic stimulus package. These lights would not have happened without this federal government stimulus package. The state government is also funding half of the lights. The four towers are 56 metres high. People may have watched on TV the spectacle at Bellerive last night. It was indeed a great game. I certainly enjoyed the spectacle, and the lights added to the event. Not only that but they have also secured for Hobart and for Tasmanians future international matches which may not have happened had the lights not been installed. Not only were there 50 local jobs involved in erecting the light towers at Bellerive Oval but there are ongoing jobs with the economy from those games continuing to be played at Bellerive in cricket seasons to come. It was a great delight. I would like to congratulate the Tasmanian Cricket Association, the Australian cricket captain, Ricky Ponting, the state government and the federal minister for coming down and participating in that great event last night. It was certainly a great day MAIN COMMITTEE for the punters at Bellerive Oval. It was a sold-out match. It was sold out two days beforehand. It was great to see that. Also through our economic stimulus plan we have received $6.4 million for a trade training centre-which was an election commitment-in the Huon Valley in my electorate. It will be built at Huonville. Again, I was talking to local residents just last week and some of them were as yet unaware that the trade training centre was going to be built and they were absolutely thrilled that locals will be able to progress past year 10 in their local community. It has been a great project in my electorate. We also have some election commitments that are being delivered on this week. I was very pleased to turn the sod on two election commitments in my electorate. One of those was the Kingston bypass, which Minister Albanese, the state minister and I turned a sod on just last evening. The Kingston bypass is a $41.5 million project, $15 million of which is coming from the federal government and the remainder from the state government. We are expecting that the Kingston bypass will be finished towards the end of 2012. We had a lot of locals at that announcement yesterday. In particular, I would like to mention the Kingston Bypass Action Group, who have been active in the local community and have been talking about this project in the community for some time. But it has only come to fruition since the Rudd Labor government delivered on their election commitment. There had been 12 years of talk and inaction by the Liberal Party and it was great to be there to see the state government, the local council and the Rudd government working together to actually deliver on this election commitment. I know the residents of Kingston, Blackmans Bay and the channel area are going to be really thrilled that this work is underway. I look forward to its completion towards the end of 2012 or early 2013. I think it will be 2.2 kilometres, but they have to build bridges, underpasses and overpasses, so it is quite a short time frame for such a project. Early last week it was my privilege to also turn the sod on the GP superclinic which is being built in conjunction with the state government’s integrated care centre at Clarence in my electorate, just near my office in fact. The Parliamentary Secretary for Health, the member for Port Adelaide, came down to my electorate and I would like to thank him for doing that sod turning with me and the state minister for health. We are in the process of talking to local residents to make them aware that the GP superclinic is underway. We have certainly done a lot of consultation on the GP superclinic. The state minister and I conducted a community consultation. The state government has also been in many discussions with professionals and clinicians in relation to the services that will be at the GP superclinic and the integrated care centre. It is $5.5 million from the Rudd government for the superclinic and some $12 million from the state government for the integrated care centre, which will be co-located on site. So it is an $18 million investment in the local community, taking health services out to the local community so that the local residents in the area can come and access their health needs very close by indeed. Just before Christmas I was at the opening of a local community centre. This was delivering on an election commitment, involving some $156,000 for the redevelopment of the community centre at Dennes Point. That redevelopment was made in conjunction with local council-again, the Kingborough council-and building is now complete. We have seen a lot of new services delivered to the local community of Dennes Point on Bruny Island in my electorate, which is certainly one of the beautiful places of the world. At Dennes Point the comMAIN COMMITTEE munity centre now has an art gallery, a restaurant-and I understand that is up and running now; local residents have been emailing me little updates about what is happening at the centre-and I certainly look forward to returning there at some point to see all of that activity underway. I have also delivered on the $10,000 promised for our local Rokeby Cricket Club. I went to see some of their practices over the summer at the Rokeby High School. They were practising in their new nets and it was fantastic to see. I am also in some discussions about the Huon Valley water scheme, which was another election commitment, with our new southern regional water board. I hope to be talking to them next week in relation to the Huon Valley water scheme. Work is underway already on the $10.5 million stage 1 of the south-east Tasmania recycled water scheme, which is another election commitment that I have delivered on in the electorate of Franklin. As can be seen, the theme here is that the Rudd government has made election commitments in the electorate of Franklin. We have delivered on all of those. We have our trade training centre coming. We have our economic stimulus happening. What we have is a huge investment, unseen before in the electorate of Franklin, that is being relished by the local community and is employing local residents. Without this investment we would be in a much direr situation when it comes to employment in the electorate. I have been calling on the Liberal Party, who are saying that the economic stimulus package should be wound back, to say exactly which projects in the electorate of Franklin they intend to scrap. The Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, has been quite vocal in saying that he thinks the NBN is a waste of money. SoI hope for the sake of the residents of Tasmania the NBN is not going to be scrapped should the Liberal Party actually win the next federal election. There are a whole range of activities going on in southern Tasmania and in my electorate, and we have seen even the state Liberal opposition leader say that he supports the economic stimulus package and that he is at odds with his federal colleagues over it. In fact, he has been on the record writing to support projects that are being funded under the economic stimulus package. It is quite interesting that all the local senators in southern Tasmania are silent in relation to the economic stimulus package. They are not saying which projects will be wound back. They are not saying which projects they will pull. They are not talking about scrapping the NBN. In fact, all you get from them is silence because they are too afraid to tell the people of Franklin what they will actually do should they win the next federal election. But what I have done is delivered on our election commitments. I am delivering on the economic stimulus package in the electorate of Franklin. The Rudd government is employing local Tasmanians because of these projects and I know that the residents in my electorate are very pleased that these election commitments are being delivered on and that the economic stimulus package is reaching the residents of Franklin. Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (6.00 pm)-I rise in support of the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2009-2010 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2009-2010. I was elected to the parliament as the member for Chisholm in 1998-and it is a bit scary that this year marks 12 years in this place. During my nine years in opposition, many meritorious projects in my electorate were continually denied funding. There was not one funding announcement by the Howard government in my electorate. Indeed, the coalition did not even announce many projects they would fund under their own candidates. So it is an absolute joy to be part of a government MAIN COMMITTEE when something is finally happening in my electorate-and I am still skipping around in a state of exuberance when I get to go to things that have been announced and are happening in my electorate. I have always found this situation a bit odd, because I thought the Liberal Party would consider Chisholm to be a marginal seat and would want to take it back at some stage. But I have had nine years in the wilderness and things are now finally happening-and it is a terrific place to be. In my electorate, projects are underway and funding has been committed to a number of key infrastructure, educational and environmental initiatives. These projects are worth highlighting as they reflect the Rudd government’s unprecedented commitment to local communities across Australia. The appropriation bills before the House include funding for the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, which was set up by this government to support investment in community infrastructure such as libraries, community centres, sports grounds and environmental infrastructure. The Rudd government is taking a refreshing approach to infrastructure investment after the coalition’s failure in this area during its 11 years in power. The whole concept of community infrastructure is of significance and importance to suburban electorates such as my seat of Chisholm, which incorporates many of Melbourne’s eastern and south-eastern suburbs. I have often said in this place that the suburbs are ignored. The people who live in the suburbs often disappear off the map, because they are not a regional area or a region in crisis. But they are where the majority of Australians choose to live. They are where most of our community activity happens. I think it is a bit sad that the suburbs are denigrated and ignored, but I am very proud to represent a purely suburban electorate and the people who live there. I think the suburbs are great. As I said, they are where most Australians choose to live. And quality community infrastructure is of vital importance because of that. Most of my electorate do not want to have to travel into town or to other suburbs to do their activities on the weekend, so having vital community infrastructure where they live is important. The community infrastructure program has allowed local government to get on with the job of addressing their infrastructure backlogs and delivering quality facilities to their communities. The $800 million invested as part of the program equates to the largest one-off commitment to local infrastructure in Australian history. It reflects the Rudd government’s steadfast commitment to improving community facilities across Australia. My electorate encompasses two fantastic local government bodies: the City of Monash and the City of Whitehorse. I would like to congratulate Charlotte Baines, who has recently been elected as Mayor of the City of Monash, and Bill Pemberton, who has been elected as Mayor of the City of Whitehorse. Both Monash and Whitehorse have benefited from the government’s community infrastructure funding-sharing in the $800 million announced last year-and both councils are very forward-thinking in their own projects and in funding them. I commend them for their ongoing support of infrastructure and their local communities. Whitehorse council has received $2.5 million from the Rudd government to develop Wembley Park Sports Precinct. The project is well underway. It is not far from my house, and I drive past the new developments. We are very much looking forward to having a new soccer pavilion, along with the refurbishment of an existing grandstand and change room. Soccer, world football, is a sport that has increasing participation in this area. The soccer club had MAIN COMMITTEE outgrown its rooms and there were no facilities for women, whose involvement is growing and growing. These facilities will make a huge difference to the club. There has been a steady increase in membership at the club, which is associated with the facilities. The project has been welcomed by the Whitehorse sporting community. It will provide improved facilities for Whitehorse and the eastern suburbs more generally. Whitehorse has also received funding for several smaller scale projects. Last year, I had the pleasure of joining representatives from the Whitehorse City Council at the opening of the Victoria Rose sensory play space in Box Hill. This is an absolutely delightful project. The government provided $35,000 for this project, which is aimed at children aged between three and 10 years and caters for those with developmental delays and disabilities. I want to commend Biala, the fantastic organisation which is next to this play space and had a great deal to do with it. Like many of our organisations, it developed through the support of individuals who saw that children with developmental delays and disability need their own specific play areas and play based education where they and their families can come and feel that they are getting the one-on-one care that they need. The rose garden that has been built will be of terrific benefit to them and to the wider community. The Box Hill community also welcomed $154,000 in funding for the refurbishment of the historic Box Hill town hall, which included money for replacing the roof, redecorating and exterior painting. I hope that somewhere along the line we might be able to get some money for the redevelopment of the Box Hill aquatic centre that the Whitehorse City Council has just announced. I commend the council for taking the step of redeveloping the pool. Water spaces are very difficult and costly to replace. The aquatic centre is getting to the age where the debate was about whether to close it or maintain it. The council has made the tough and expensive decision to maintain and support the facility, and I want to commend them for that. I have long been an advocate for ensuring that the centre is open to all. I will declare that I am a member of the centre and was in the pool just yesterday afternoon. It is a great pool, on Surrey Drive, but it is getting a bit old and tired. As my child was madly getting her stroke ready for her swim meet on Friday and we were going through the painstaking exercise of making sure her dive was not too deep for the start of the race, we were appreciating the facility but hoping it will improve. I commend Whitehorse City Council for that. We will see if I can get some additional funding at a federal level. Meanwhile, Monash City Council has also been awarded funding for a number of projects that will be of immense benefit to my constituents. Four million dollars is going towards the new Batesford Reserve youth and community hub, which will co-locate community service providers in a new purpose-built facility. The project will deliver a centralised and supportive youth facility and will contain a number of community service providers to cater for highneeds residents of the community. A number of neighbourhood house programs as well as education and training programs and community health services will be co-located in the facility. This is a project that Monash council has been working towards for a number of years, and it is only now, with the financial support of the Rudd government, that this dream is being realised. I had the absolute pleasure of being at the first turning of the sod at the opening of the redevelopment last week. I am still sporting the ink on my hands from the hand prints I have dedicated to an artwork, a ‘house of hands’. I would like to commend the artist for his great vision and work but I really do want to know how to get off the ink. This is an exciting MAIN COMMITTEE project which will support the Ashwood community and surrounding suburbs. I also want to commend the numerous community groups which are a vital part of this project. Just recently I attended the opening of the new Oakleigh pool and recreation centre, to which the Rudd government contributed $200,000. This federal funding was used to upgrade facilities at the recreation centre, including off-street parking, landscaping and walking paths. I would again like to commend both Monash council and the Victorian government for their efforts in redeveloping the Oakleigh pool. It has been transformed into a fantastic facility that will serve the community for a long time to come. Projects like this highlight the importance of community infrastructure. I would also like to commend the community campaigners who made sure that the pool stayed open. It was through their actions that Oakleigh still has its historic outdoor pool and diving platform. If you want to have a good weekend get on down to Oakleigh and jump off the 10-metre diving board. It was through community action that the pool is now being maintained, and we are very grateful for that. Monash council is also involved in a project being managed by the neighbouring Boroondara Council, the Gardiner’s Creek Trail project, to which the government has committed $2.5 million. This project will link several of Melbourne’s inner eastern suburbs through a continuous shared pathway between Box Hill South and the Main Yarra Trail in Hawthorn. The funding will see the construction of about 1.5 kilometres of a new three-metre wide path, which will be used by both pedestrians and cyclists. I am proud that the government is building these important community infrastructure projects in Chisholm. This bike path will enable cyclists to go under Warrigal Road. For people who know Melbourne, Warrigal Road is incredibly busy and nowadays cyclists have to stop at one part of a bike track, get off, cross a very busy road and go on. As I have watched my child do it with her father on occasion, I am looking forward very much to her having an underpath to ride on, and people will literally be able to ride from the outer suburbs all the way into town on this great bike path. Each project has helped to support jobs during this time of economic uncertainty. More importantly, each project is a high value investment in the future of my electorate supporting the local community for many years to come. The Batesford Reserve facility will create 71 new local jobs, and that is a terrific thing for our community. This unprecedented funding for local projects was of course a key component of the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan, a package that has effectively steered Australia away from recession and kept unemployment at low levels. This is a point worth emphasising: Australia is the only major advanced economy not to enter into recession. We have the lowest debt and deficit and one of the world’s lowest unemployment rates. These statistics highlight the strength of the Australian economy and clearly indicate the government’s stimulus plan has worked. The stimulus has cushioned Australia from the worse effects of the global recession, facilitated economic growth and, in doing so, has made our economy the envy of the Western world. A key component of the economic stimulus plan has been our unprecedented investment in education infrastructure. The Building the Education Revolution program is the largest school modernisation program in Australia’s history and is benefiting every school across the country, including those schools in my electorate of Chisholm. The government is investing over $82 million upgrading facilities across Chisholm’s 46 schools. Given the age of the electorate, MAIN COMMITTEE many of these schools are getting to their groaning use-by-date and need much updating and improvement, and it has come at a great time for many of these schools. I have received an overwhelmingly positive response from school communities about this project: teachers, parents and principals are all ecstatic about the government pumping millions of dollars into the schools to ensure teachers and students are teaching and learning in modern facilities. It is gratifying to be part of a government that places education at the top of its agenda and is delivering real improvements to school communities across Australia, particularly into primary schools that often go unrecognised and unrewarded. Despite what the opposition might suggest, the BER project is money well spent, is money that is going towards improving our education facilities and is undoubtedly a good thing. RecentlyI visited one of my local schools Kingswood College to inspect the exciting new works that are taking place there. Kingswood has used its National School Pride money for landscaping and beautification works through its central courtyard area while construction of a new multipurpose hall is well underway through the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program. Kingswood is also benefiting from a trade training centre with close to a million dollars in funding allowing the school to upgrade existing hospitality facilities to industry standards. Kingswood College works in conjunction with the William Angliss catering college to deliver a very high standard of hospitality and catering training. This is a terrific benefit not just to the school but to the wider community who will be able to use these facilities after hours and on weekends. This will allow students to train in a simulated workplace and help equip them with the skills they need to effectively and competitively participate in the hospitality industry. Kingswood is just one example of how this government’s focus on education is leading to improved facilities and outcomes in our schools. Last week I also had the pleasure of visiting St Mary Magdalen’s school in Chadstone, a small Catholic community that struggles to make ends meet. Again, the ageing infrastructure of the building needed some help, so it was an absolute delight to go there the other day with Senator Mark Arbib and find on site four apprentices being trained and utilised on this facility; four kids who are going to go on and have great careers because they were given the opportunity on this building site. It is amazing that four tradies, four apprentices, were at the one site, and it was a wonderful day to be there. The education revolution goes beyond investing in infrastructure in our primary and secondary schools: importantly, for my electorate, which is home to several high-quality universities and TAFEs, it extends to reforming the higher education sector, including increased investment in infrastructure. The government has committed $5.4 billion over four years to higher education and innovative reform. This massive injection of funds will help achieve the aim of increasing by 40 per cent the numbers of 25to 34-year-olds to hold bachelor level qualifications or above by 2025. The government recently announced that Monash University, with its Clayton campus in my electorate, will receive over $111 million in research grants aimed at driving excellence, collaboration and diversity-vital elements for Australian prosperity. This is in addition to the massive $2.8 million investment being delivered in higher education infrastructure across Australia; $89.9 million is going to Monash University to construct the New Horizons centre MAIN COMMITTEE which will see the Clayton innovation precinct as the most significant technology innovative hub in the Southern Hemisphere. Last week, which was rather busy, I was at Monash University and had the absolute pleasure of meeting Professor Elizabeth Blackburn, Australia’s Nobel laureate, who was recognised last year for her work in biomedicine. We were opening the new biomedical facility at Monash. Again, we had contributed to the funding of this phenomenal new centre where 500 scientific researchers are going to be housed together in the facility. The collaboration was just amazing. I was a little daunted at being one of the speakers amongst so many medical scientists and PhDs-my little Arts with honours from Monash seemed to pale into insignificance in the room I was in. But, again, it is a phenomenal achievement. There is great work happening within my electorate. Deakin University with its Burwood campus residing in my electorate has been awarded $20.2 million in research grants which will encourage its brightest students to continue to higher education. Under the Howard government we saw funding ripped away from the higher education sector. The Rudd government, on the other hand, is committed to supporting higher education research and I am delighted this funding is being delivered to my electorate. The two TAFES that reside in Chisholm-the Chadstone campus of GippsTAFE, and Box Hill TAFE-are also undergoing dramatic improvements. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister both visited my electorate last year to announce over $16 million in funding for GippsTAFE. This is unprecedented. The GippsTAFE looked like it came out of the ark. My dad, who trained there, said he did not think it had changed since he did his electrical apprenticeship. This funding will allow GippsTAFE’s Chadstone campus to develop state-of the-art training facilities to supply training and services for the energy and telecommunications industries. The new facility will have untold benefits for students at the centre as well as for the relevant industries in Victoria. Box Hill TAFE has received funding for numerous projects, all of which will lead to improved outcomes from what is considered one of Australia’s pre-eminent TAFE institutions. Perhaps the most significant project is the $2.7 million green skills hub, which will support the provision of training courses in the sustainables sector. This project will incorporate several green focused initiatives and training facilities for the development of students’ green trade skills. This project not only reflects the government’s commitment to investing in the higher education sector; it is also an apt example of our focus on reskilling Australians for a more sustainable and greener economy. The government understands that climate change poses an immense threat to Australia’s way of life. Investing in green skills now is an important step in preparing Australia for the inevitable shift to a sustainable green economy. Projects such as this green skills hub are important to this transition. However, the government also understands that an emissions trading scheme is the only way of making the shift to a sustainable economy in a manner that will serve Australia’s long-term interests. Chisholm is one of the most highly educated electorates in the country and my constituents want real action on climate change. Without doubt the No. 1 issue that comes through in my electorate is people wanting direct action now on climate change. They know too well that the opposition’s climate change policy is a short-term political fix, a climate con job designed purely to get the coalition to the election. The government, on the other hand, has Australia’s long-term economic and environmental future in mind. So a MAIN COMMITTEE project such as the green skills hub is most welcome and will have environmental benefit. Ultimately there must be a cap on carbon pollution to combat climate change, and the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme does just that. I have spoken today about a number of projects taking place in my electorate-projects that are investing in community infrastructure, delivering for our schools and higher education institutions and having a positive impact on the environment. What these projects are also doing is helping to keep our economy strong by investing in the infrastructure we need for the future. These projects are being delivered by a forward-thinking government committed to policies that are in Australia’s long-term interests. BeforeI conclude I want to thank the member for Lyons for assisting me by swapping his spot. I do appreciate that. The joys of combining speaking and being in the chair sometimes cause a bit of difficulty so I do want to say thank you. I commend the bills to the House. the very generous member for Lyons. to be in the Main Committee when you are in the chair. In the two appropriation bills we are debating there is funding for the Local Government Reform Fund of $12.5 million-$0.5 million in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2009-2010 and $12 million in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2009-2010. The previously noted figure of $165 million in appropriation bill No. 4 included amounts that have been previously appropriated under various mechanisms including appropriation bill No. 1 and the new federal financial framework appropriation arrangements. The total of $167 million dollars includes amounts which have been previously provided and the details are as follows: $14.9 million has been reclassified from administrated expenses in Appropriation Act (No. 1) to make payments direct to local government for the East Kimberley Development Package; $18.3 million has been reclassified from payments which were to be made under the Federal Financial Relations Act 2009 to direct payments to local government for various Nation Building Program Roads to Recovery projects; and $10 million, which was unspent last financial year due to delays in the negotiations of funding arrangements, is proposed for the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, which is a great program. These additional appropriations are fully offset by savings against the original appropriations and estimates and thus will not lead to additional expenditure. Once again, the government has proved itself to be responsive to local needs. Through the stimulus package, it has enabled many local communities to achieve goals that they could only dream about during the period of the last government. Some of the programs funded in my electorate have allowed country communities to upgrade small facilities so they can be used again properly after they struggled to find funds to put on a new roof or to put up a kitchen to make morning teas for a pensioner group. The upgrade of a walking path from one council facility to another allows the bringing together and mixing of social groups, and a health benefit of course. They may only be small items in the scheme of things but to many it gives a lot of pleasure, a chance to assimilate and a chance to involve themselves more in the communities in which they live. One that I was prepared particularly pleased about was the sound shell that has been built in New Norfolk, the gateway to the Derwent Valley. I was invited to open this during Australia Day. A part of the opening ceremony was a concert provided by the Derwent Valley ConMAIN COMMITTEE",167,Appropriation Bill No 4 2009 2010

154,Mr Adams (Lyons) (6.19 Pm),"Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. It is always a pleasurecert Band. The band shows what a community can do. It was born in the New Norfolk High school and became a community band as many of the young players left school and had nowhere else to play. I would say it was because of the local dedication of Layton Hodgetts, OAM, who used to teach music at New Norfolk High, that the band existed at all. Although he has been recognised as a Tasmanian Local Hero of the Year in 2009, nothing can really acknowledge the amazing work and dedication of this man whose life’s work has been to ensure his community has an outlet for their talent. The Derwent Valley Concert Band Inc has been in existence since 1993 and is based in the beautiful town of New Norfolk, 30 kilometres from Hobart and nesting on the banks of the Derwent River. The band was established because of the perceived need for a local band to cater for musicians of all ages in the New Norfolk community and the wider Derwent Valley. Since the inauguration concert in October 1993 at New Norfolk, the Derwent Valley Concert Band has grown into a very active and versatile community band. At present it has over 50 regular players whose ages range from 15 to over 70. The Derwent Valley Concert Band now consists of the senior band, the development band, the stage band and the marching band with rehearsals held every Wednesday at the band’s room in New Norfolk in a friendly and congenial atmosphere. The DVCB has an extensive repertoire and performs regularly in the local and surrounding communities at a wide range of celebrations and ceremonies, such as Australia Day, Government House open day, Kempton Festival, Derwent Valley festival, the Taste of Ogilvie, the ANZAC Day march and service, the Hobart Christmas Pageant and the Derwent Valley Carols by Candlelight. The DVCB also performs major public concerts each year in both Hobart and New Norfolk, often joined by other bands from the Hobart area. The band presents on average more than 20 performances each year, including competing in the state band championships. The Derwent Valley Concert Band is one of Australia’s most highly acclaimed, widely travelled and successful community bands. It was the winner of the state band championships in 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2007 and 2009. It was also the winner of the open B grade concert band section at the Australian National Band Championships in 2000. The band has travelled to Japan, Canada, Austria, France, Belgium, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Sweden, Denmark and China. That included playing at the wedding of Princess Mary in Denmark. They are all remarkable achievements for this band from a small town in the middle of Tasmania. The council sought the building of this soundshell really as a thankyou to the band so they have a good public area from which to continue their amazing story. It will allow many other activities to be planned in the beautiful Tynwald Park in which it sits. It is one small addition to a community that is making the most of its talents. Another community which has benefited from the infrastructure package is that of Kentish Council, not far from your seat, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom. This was funding for a wellloved building that badly needed renovation. The council’s funding went into removing asbestos from internal walls, the kitchen and toilet; upgrading in line with fire regulations; sanding and sealing the floor; upgrading the kitchen and lining out the old storeroom, which has a roller door, to separate the youth drop-in room and the kitchen so both can be used independently of each other; replacing backboards and hoops; and building a disabled toilet. This will make the old Green Hall a useable building again-although we might have to change the MAIN COMMITTEE name to the Blue Hall, because the cladding is blue. But that could be a problem because it is well known in the community as the Green Hall-something for the council to consider in the future. I think the whole renovation came to $150,000, which was amazing considering the asbestos removal was quite difficult and had to be carefully done, then replaced and sealed. Once again, a community has breathed new life into an almost dead asset and now has great plans to make use of it. In the process, a number of jobs were created, and those people are now working on other community developed projects. Those dollars are going round in the community, as they should. There is also the funding for schools, which is allowing many old country schools to renew a hall, re-equip a classroom, upgrade a sports field or a playground-a program that not only is doing great work for these small schools but also brings local contractors into the schools to see where their children are being taught and makes them more a part of the school community. In some way the latter is proving to be a greater asset to the schools than the work they came to do. I have always been keen to develop the social capital of a community, as that is the way you can develop innovative ideas. I was particularly pleased to see that my old school at Cressy had put in for and received funds for the kindergarten upgrade as well as a complete redevelopment of the school hall and gym. This hall has been the centre of many community events, including the annual trout festival, the trout expo. They are also in receipt of funds to develop their science laboratory. When the Deputy Prime Minister visited last year she took time to visit this school and hear of the proposed developments. Both she and I were very impressed with the plans and the whole feeling of the school. Cressy District High School is a farm school in Cressy, which is a small town of around 650 people that is 35 kilometres south of Launceston. It has classes from kindergarten to grade 10 and also a birth to four-year program. Approximately 360 students attend the school, with 185 in the secondary sector and 175 in the primary area. Cressy District High School is truly a community school. They have numerous partnerships with the community and their students benefit from belonging to a well-ordered, purposeful community. Close cooperation between parents and teachers is encouraged because they recognise that home and school share a common purpose-the academic progress and the personal development of each individual child. They provide some significant programs like the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award, the No Dole Program of the Beacon Foundation, the Flexible Farm Program, the Individualised Learning Program, Esk Band, the Buddies mentoring program, sheep and cattle judging teams, the traineeship and apprenticeship pathways program, and the Active After-school Communities program. Their vision is for students to grow to become unique individuals of integrity, able to make sound and positive judgments and decisions about their future. In their school community strong values exist around personalised learning, a sense of community, appreciating individual uniqueness, positive relationships and a commitment to improvement. The school’s motto is: reach upward. This school has a proud history, having been established in 1863. It has been in continual use since then. Its fortunes have been mixed, but today it is seen as one of Tasmania’s top country schools. It fared well in the literacy and numeracy tests, which is a great credit to its principal, Annette Hollingsworth, and her team. MAIN COMMITTEE So the general infrastructure package has been of enormous benefit and has assisted in stimulating the economy in country areas because of the way the funding has been delivered. The Prime Minister announced 14 months ago the $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan to cushion the economy from the worse effects of the global recession. The plan was developed as the global financial crisis took hold and the full extent became clear to government. The plan built on the earlier Australian government Economic Security Strategy and nationbuilding packages. At that time, world policy makers were confronted with a crisis that threatened to engulf the global economy. Without intervention by government it is estimated that the economy would have contracted. The unemployment rate was predicted to rise to 8¼ per cent, meaning hundreds of thousands of Australians were at risk of losing their jobs, creating a vicious downward spiral in our economy. The plan was a bold and decisive strategy to arrest the downturn in the economy, cushion Australia from the global recession and build lasting infrastructure for Australia’s future. It brought federal, state and local governments together, along with the businesses, unions and community organisations, in a common effort to protect Australian jobs, businesses and communities. Today the implementation of the plan is well advanced and its results are visible to all. Australia is now the third fastest growing economy of the 33 International Monetary Fund advanced economies. We are one of the three economies not to fall into a technical recession and we also have the lowest level of government debt, approximately 10 per cent of GDP. This compares with an average of about 93 per cent of gross domestic product for major advanced economies. The difference between what Australia was facing and what we have achieved is stark. Without stimulus, the economy would have contracted in each of the past four quarters, shrinking by two per cent over the past year and plunging Australia into recession. Unemployment is expected to peak at around 1½ per cent lower than in the absence of the stimulus and we know that it has now fallen to 5.3 per cent. Treasury estimates that overall the government stimulus will support around 200,000 jobs. Through Australians working together, and with financial stimulus working hand in hand with monetary policy, the Australian economy has been able to weather the storm of the global recession. Only a few weeks ago I read from the latest economic figures that the economy is better off by $7 billion, so the government’s approach has been vindicated, despite all the opposition’s ranting about the government’s ‘big spend’ and voting against the stimulus package when it was before the parliament. Out in country areas, particularly in places like Tasmania where small towns have often been forgotten in the past, this strategy has delivered, through councils and through local community groups and through schools, and everybody has been able to take part in developing the economy, creating new jobs and allowing youngsters who have just left school to stay in their regions. Every time. I see a new house being built in one of my country towns I know that this government is working and doing the right thing. I have seen the stimulus working. To me, this means new thinking, helping the communities help themselves, getting them to think beyond their boundaries and applying the can-do attitude. Somebody has bothered to look outside the city limits and has said, ‘You are valuable to our economy too.’ MAIN COMMITTEE Government intervention into the economy allows this thinking to happen. The old conservative attitude of ‘let the market run its course’ gets into the ‘survival of the fittest’ mode and people are then competing for small amounts of nothing and squabbling over the outcomes. To allow everybody an amount of money to help them develop their communities means that those who want to will make it go much further. But it will not leave out those who are not as adventurous. I want to keep on going and helping those communities that are not as innovative to be more so and to do more, while encouraging the go-ahead ones to seize all their opportunities and create all the jobs, to build all those houses and to grow their schools and their communities. Under this government we have those opportunities, and I hope we still have them after this year. That is what I will be fighting for at the next election, to show communities what real government is about, not what we went through for 12 years. is interrupted in accordance with standing order 192. The debate is adjourned, and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Forgotten Australians Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (6.39 pm)-In November 2009 I made an apology speech in relation to Australian children in institutions. I outlined the terrible harm done to a constituent of mine, Sandra Pollard. She and other children were physically abused, raped, starved and used as human guinea pigs in a vaccination program. It was later shown that these vaccinations were given despite authorities knowing that there was a possible contamination with simian virus 40. This appalling treatment of vulnerable children was the subject of many inquiries, but Mr and Mrs Pollard are very concerned that, after all these inquiries, no-one in any government has ever been called to account for this disgraceful lack of supervision or protection of these poor children. If the Prime Minister were genuine and sincere about his apology, he would call for a full inquiry to find out why those charged with looking after these children’s welfare have never been identified and made to answer for their total neglect, incompetence and lack of compassion for these children. Commemoration of the Bombing of Darwin for the bombing of Darwin, organised by the Salisbury RSL. It was held at the Cross of Sacrifice memorial site in Salisbury. The bombing of Darwin by Japanese aircraft during World War II commenced at 9.58 am on 19 February 1942. At the end of the first of two separate raids, which lasted over an hour, more than 240 Australians had been killed, hundreds more had been injured and Darwin was left in ruins with property and buildings demolished. Twenty military aircraft were destroyed and eight ships were sunk. Over the next 21 months, Darwin and other areas of the Northern Territory endured more than 80 air raids, with attacks also at Townsville, Katherine, Wyndham, Derby, Broome and Port Hedland. Sixty-eight years later, the Darwin bombings fade into history, but, for the families and friends of those killed or injured, I have no doubt that the memory lives with them. I take this opportunity to commend the Salisbury RSL, which organised again this year what has now become an annual service. In particular, I acknowledge the untiring work of Mick Lennon, who, with the support of RSL president David Kernes and Padre Trevor Rogers, officiated at MAIN COMMITTEE",180,Qhjdwlyh Wkdw Lw Zrxog Uhgxfh Udwkhu Wkdq Dpsoli  Wkh Uhvsrqvh Ri Wkh Folpdwh V Vwhp Wr Hx

Petition: Marriage of Canning residents and Western Australians regarding the foundations of marriage. The petition has been considered by the Standing Committee on Petitions and certified in accordance with the standing orders. I welcome this opportunity to say a few words about the nature of the petition and share the sentiments of the signatories in response to the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill, introduced in the Senate by Senator Hanson-Young last year. The signatories have entered this debate, and today I table their petition opposing the amendment to the definition of marriage. The petitioners confirm that the definition of marriage is a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. The petitioners state their strong belief that such unions are the foundation on which society stands. The petition says: To alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex “marriage”, as proposed by the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill, would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially children. This petition contains 277 signatures. Let me take this opportunity to commend the organisers of the petition and those who widely circulated it throughout Canning. They have taken the opportunity to put their views on record and have played a vital role in that democratic process. I therefore present the petition on behalf of the signatories. The petition read as followsTo the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives We, the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled, that the definition of marriage as “a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life” is the foundation upon which our families are built and on which our society stands. To alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex “marriage”, as proposed by the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill, would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially children. We, the undersigned citizens therefore request that the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009, be opposed. from 277 citizens Petition received.

I want to congratulate college captains Rhiannon Hutchison and Adam Pirie, vice-captains Natasha Urselmann and Shannon Griffiths and also the student council president, Penny Redshaw. Interestingly enough, all members of the student council were female. I went back to the school. As I walked in, they all cheered. I thought, ‘I’ve become very popular since I left this school,’ but walking in behind me was Israel Folau, the Brisbane Broncos, Queensland and Australian back, and he got lots of cheers. I said to Kathy Blinks, the wonderful school principal of the 800-student school, that she was very popular but even she had to defer to Israel Folau-and to Vicki Wilson, the Queensland netball and Australian legend, who was also present. Congratulations to Vicki and Israel and all the school leaders at Bundamba State Secondary College. Kingsway Rockets Kingsway Junior Football Club registration day. The Kingsway Rockets provide boys and girls from the Landsdale, Darch and Madeley suburbs an opportunity to play Australian football. I understand that between 450 and 500 young people have registered, with 200 just for the Auskick program for fiveto eight-year-olds. I know that there will be teams for year 4s and year 5s, a team for 11-year-olds, a team for 12-year-olds, two teams for 13-year-olds and teams for 14-, 15and 17-year-olds. A strong club, the Kingsway Rockets are in their 11th year. I pay tribute to the strong support provided by the Kingsway Football Club, the senior club. I also met the senior club’s president, Jayson Bennett. In speaking to members of both clubs, it was clear to me what a strong relationship the senior and junior clubs have. The committee of the Kingsway Rockets is led by President Gavin Oliphant. The vice-president is David Blake. Ian Brotherton is the junior vice-president, Jon Carter is the secretary, Ray Buscall is the registrar, Sharon Southall is the treasurer and Craig Nylander is the coaches’ coordinator. Beyond those main positions, there are a great many people helping with the day-today running of the club, including coaches, managers and volunteers who have been getting the job done over several years. The oval at Kingsway Sporting Complex is undergoing some modifications and, when it is completed, I understand that it will be able to host visiting AFL clubs for training sessions. It is a big oval, the same size as Subiaco, and lights will make it an excellent and much sought after ground. I quickly gained the impression that the Kingsway Rockets are going well and have an even greater future ahead of them. The benefits in health and fitness for local young people cannot, however, be achieved without dedicated volunteers. I therefore thank Gavin Oliphant and his dedicated team of volunteers, past and present, for adding great value to the community.

160,Mr Gray (Brand,"Parliamentary Secretary for Western and Northern Australia) (6.46Alison was an extraordinary woman. She fought her battle with cancer in the same way that she lived: with strength, determination and courage. Alison was a tremendous advocate for the Labor Party and the labour movement, and some would even call her a Labor ambassador. Alison gave commitment, knowledge, time and energy to the Australian Labor Party for close to 30 years. She did not miss a campaign in the Kimberley, undeterred by harsh weather or by travelling to polling booths hundreds of kilometres away from her home. Alison truly was the heart and soul of the campaign team. Everybody in this parliament would appreciate the dedication and energy that it takes to get through a campaign. Alison could be relied upon to do mail-outs, to doorknock, to set up booths, to close booths and to scrutineer the vote. Alison was a rare gem. Alison was passionate. Her passions did not stop with the Australian Labor Party. She embraced the arts, history and social action groups in regional Western Australia. In recognition of Alison’s dedication to Broome Senior High School, the school will rename its library in her honour. Alison’s love and commitment to the preservation of history took her to the front line. Alison successfully campaigned to stop the demolition of the original Geraldton Town Hall, which today is a regional art gallery. The Kimberley was a fortunate beneficiary of Alison’s passion as she launched herself into WA’s first professional regional theatre company in Broome in the early 1990s, making a huge contribution to community art events such as the Fringe and Shinju Matsuri. At the time she died, Alison was an active member of the Australian Labor Party’s Broome branch, Broome Historical Society and her local church. Her positions in the local Broome branch of the Australian Labor Party were numerous and most recently included membership officer. Alison played a wonderful part in the community of Northern Australia. (Time expired) Immigration: Klue Family Klue family, formerly from South Africa, who live in Buderim. Jannie and Amanda and their children, Jan-Sari and Pieter-Nic, arrived here from South Africa in December 2007 and set about setting up a new life for themselves, free of the concerns of a land plagued by crime, where they had lived in a home behind razor wire and with CCTV cameras. They bought a business here and worked hard to make that business a success. Their children were enrolled in a local school. They became very active in the local community. They were working seven days a week in their business and they attained very great community support. They have proven themselves to be a stable and sensible family, a very much admired part of the Buderim community. They very much wanted to stay in Australia and they had aspirations for their children, but, unfortunately, due to a visa application mix-up, the family found themselves facing a forced return to South Africa.

A 457 visa has now been issued, which will give them the opportunity to make a new life permanently in Australia in due course. I want to applaud this exercise of people power. I want to applaud the local community for getting behind the Klue family, who will, in due course, make very good Australians. They very much wanted a future for their children.

(Time expired) Mr Jim Hennessy Jim was a dedicated trade unionist and a passionate advocate for the rights of working people. He was an active member of the Lindsay Your Rights at Work committee and campaigned to defeat the former Howard government’s Work Choices laws at the last election. Jim emigrated from the United Kingdom with his family. He was a painter and decorator by trade but, to those who knew him, Jim could do practically anything. After living his early years in a South London commission estate, Jim rose above the adversity of those beginnings and went on to become a man with passion for his community and a deep commitment to helping others. Even in retirement, Jim continued to make a contribution by volunteering at Governor Phillip Nursing Home and as a driver of Penrith council’s community bus. Jim had a love and deep understanding of his adopted country. He was a keen explorer of Australia, was a dab hand at the didgeridoo and had a knack for finding the nearest yabby hole. With his sharp mind and rich network of contacts, Jim was never afraid to give you his opinion or to put you in touch with the right person. With his generosity of spirit he was a man you could always turn to. Jim is survived by his wife, Sheila, children Peter and Tracey and his grandchildren. I know he will be remembered as a man who lived his life with great vigour and passion, and he has a place in the hearts of many in our local community.

I also understand your affection for the great game of the Australian Football League. We just heard the member for Cowan talk about his visit to the Kingsway Junior Football Club. In my role as the director of junior development at the Perth Football Club in the Western Australian Football LeagueI spent some time with junior clubs in my district on the weekend because their registration day was yesterday. I just want to quickly mention the junior clubs in my district, which are: Manning, Redcliffe, Lynwood/Ferndale, South Perth, Victoria Park, Belmont, Queens Park, Thornlie, Maddington, Gosnells, Huntingdale and Kenwick. They are a great group and fine teams in my electorate and also within the Perth district. I would also like to congratulate them all and wish them all the best for the coming season. To all the umpires, officials, volunteers, parents and families who get involved with the junior sporting days, without their involvement there would be no competition, and the work that they do in the community is undervalued sometimes. I forgot to mention the coaches as well. They set the standards for the kids to play to, the standards of the games and the standards of the parents. I think that the work they do for the community is fantastic.

That took his career tally to 20 Golden Guitars and four ARIA music industry awards, which is not a bad effort for a boy who started out playing in a band called Little Eagle in the pubs and clubs of the Clarence Valley in northern New South Wales. I know that his Mum, Irene Daley, and old band mate, Andrew Hegedus, who is now managing Aboriginal housing across the North Coast, are very proud of Troy’s achievements as a recording artist and prominent Australian. Troy shared the award for Vocal Collaboration of the Year with The McClymonts-sisters Brooke, Samantha and Mollie-who also hail from Grafton and who hosted this year’s awards. Samantha joked that there must be something in the Clarence Valley water because Grafton musicians dominated the prestigious talent competitions. Former south Graftonian Luke Austen took out the Toyota Star Maker competition, winning a recording deal, video clip and 12 months use of a car. A local, Aaron Bolton, was a finalist in the Road to Tamworth competition and budding instrumentalist Tullara Connors, of Ramornie, won the right to perform on the final day of the festival. All this has led to the suggestion that Grafton should stage an annual country concert, perhaps at Easter, with its home-grown stars returning to perform. I will be buying tickets for that show.

165,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr S Sidebottom),"Order! In accordance with standing or(3) requests the Government to consider, on a case by case basis, initiatives such as those adopted by the Lismore City Council and Richmond Council in Page, to develop wastewater treatment facilities that process sewerage and wastewater and create healthy wetlands. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (6.55 pm)-I was fortunate on World Wetlands Day in 2010-the theme of which was ‘Wetlands, biodiversity and climate change’-to attend the opening of the exhibition and awards ceremony of the WetlandCare Australia National Art and Photography Competition, held here in Canberra on Monday, 8 February at CSIRO’s Discovery Centre. WetlandCare Australia is a wonderful national organisation based in Ballina, which is in my electorate. This is a very beautiful coastal city and one that is impacted on by climate change and by extreme weather events. The competition received over 650 entries from all over Australia. As I have said in this place before, some of my local residents won an award in that competition of 650 entries. The General Manager of WetlandCare Australia, Nicci Carter, in a letter to me, said, among other things: This competition plays a crucial role, through the touring exhibition and media coverage, in raising awareness across Australia, highlighting the important role wetlands play in our lives and how we are so intrinsically connected to the environment around us. So true. I have seen the joy, as we all have, of the farmers when the rains come and the inland wetland areas come to life. I have seen that directly. Wetlands are not just coastal areas, as we often think. I would like to give a few examples of what WetlandCare Australia are doing in my seat of Page. WetlandCare are currently working to protect threatened Bush Stone curlews in the Glenugie-Pillar valley region and are also conducting a fox-baiting program to protect the birds by working closely with local landowners. They are also working to protect the barking owl habitat in the upper and lower Clarence through cat’s claw creeper removal and biocontrol. Cat’s claw is a big problem in my area. In Bungawalbin they are undertaking salvinia biocontrol, through salvinia weevil release and also cat’s claw biocontrol. Wetland Care Australia are fencing off waterways and wetlands from lantana and groundsel for biodiversity conservation. In conjunction with the local area, the Jali Land Council and Cabbage Tree Island Public School WetlandCare have coordinated bush regeneration, interpretive signage and a wetland walkway. There is really important work in my area on acid sulfate soil remediation works. The acid scald in the Tuckean Swamp has been significantly reduced due to the work of WetlandCare Australia. This helps all the fishermen in our area enormously. I also note that the primary legislative and policy responsibility for managing wetlands is with state and territory governments. Farmers and landowners manage the wetlands on their land and manage it very well. The Australian government, through the department, is the administrative authority for the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. The Australian government, on this matter, works with state and territory governments through the Natural Resource Management Ministerial Council in implementing the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. There are 65 Ramsar wetlands and there are 900 nationally important wetlands. MAIN COMMITTEE The other part of the private member’s motion that I want to give some attention to is the treatment of sewage through sewage treatment plants-people often confuse ‘sewage’ and ‘sewerage’-and by creating wetlands. In my seat there are two councils, Richmond Valley Council and Lismore City Council, which have sewage treatment plants that use wetlands. Wetlands are remarkable filters; they reduce the carbon footprint and they do not use a lot of energy because they are not using a lot of electricity. I have seen them in action, and they are a very efficient and friendly way to treat the sewage. Lismore City Council has said: The current sewage treatment plant at South Lismore is an old trickling filter plant with a 12 hectare wetland system for final polishing of the effluent. It goes on to say: The results we achieve at this plant are as good, if not better, than the modern designed plants that utilise high energy consumption. Outlet pollutant concentrations at the South Lismore Treatment Plant are meeting or exceeding the performance of the modern‘modern’ means fully mechanisedEast Lismore Sewage Treatment Plant. (Time expired) joying the member for Page’s contribution so much, and I am pleased you let it last a little bit longer. I think it is an important motion that the member for Page brings to the House tonight, in particular her references to the threat to wetlands from human activity and the role of wetlands in our community. Coming from the electorate of Gippsland, I am very interested in issues relating to World Wetlands Day and to the Ramsar listing of wetlands in particular. I know that World Wetlands Day was first celebrated in 1997 and recognises the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, which was signed on 2 February 1971 in the Iranian city of Ramsar. From a Gippsland perspective, where we have Ramsar-listed wetlands associated with the Gippsland Lakes, we are very concerned about the threats to the lake system of human activities, particularly further up in the catchment. While the Gippsland Lakes are a very large system of inland waters, they are actually impacted on by an enormous catchment area. What is of great concern to the people of Gippsland at the moment is the issue of further diversions of fresh water from Gippsland via the Thomson River to Melbourne. There is a message that Gippslanders have taken to the state Labor government which relates to a recent decision to take another 10 billion litres of environmental flows from the Thomson River to water the gardens of Melbourne. The health of the Gippsland Lakes system is critical to our $200 million tourism industry, and the state government is fully aware that this decision will have negative impacts on a variety of species throughout the catchment and also in the Gippsland Lakes themselves. It is an issue that I have taken up with the federal environment minister, hoping he may have some capacity to act under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The minister has responded to my representations, indicating that he was seeking further information from the Victorian Department of Sustainability and Environment about the proposed diversion and seeking greater detail about any measures that would be undertaken to mitigate the impacts on the Australian grayling, which is a threatened fish species, as MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Private Members Business
166,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (7.00 Pm),"Like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, I was enwell as information on the timing of any diversions and any possible impacts to the Gippsland Lakes Ramsar site. I am disappointed that it has taken several months for the minister even to seek further information from his state counterpart, and we are yet to have any response from the minister about whether he is going to take any action at all to protect the Ramsar listed wetlands of the Gippsland Lakes. I would also like to address the motion’s reference to the activities of communities and non-government organisations to protect and repair wetlands. As the previous speaker, the member for Page, indicated, it really highlights the role that communities play in protecting and enhancing our environment. The member for Page referred to farmers and landowners and their role as custodians of our wetlands, which may not necessarily be understood by people in the cities, who might not get to see the activities on the ground which occur in many of our regional communities. It is in that vein that I refer to the people who volunteer through the Landcare network. Last year we recognised 20 years of service of the Landcare network throughout Australia. There are more than 100,000 volunteers rolling up their sleeves every weekend anywhere you go in regional Australia. You can find them out there doing revegetation work, erosion control and pest animal control in particular-a whole range of programs which have marked benefits for our wetlands and the natural environment generally. I have a concern that I have raised directly with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry regarding the future funding arrangements for Landcare facilitation. It is an issue that the minister is very much aware of: he has had petitions land on his desk and he has had many representations from groups, including the Victorian Landcare network, which have raised concerns about the federal government’s Caring for our Country business plan. The Victorian Landcare network wrote to the minister in August last year and indicated that there were 142 Landcare support staff on the ground to support Landcare groups in Victoria during 2007-08 and what bothers me is that they fear the number is likely to drop to 35 by the end of 2009. The minister has responded to those concerns to some extent. He has put out media statements indicating that the government would fund 56 facilitators around Australia, but I would suggest that, when we are talking about 100,000 volunteers involved in practical environmental work, 56 facilitators is simply not enough. It is a major concern right throughout regional Australia. It affects regional communities and it also affects the future health of the environment-in particular, the health of wetlands and the catchment areas that serve them. I acknowledge the member’s good intentions in bringing this motion to the House and I support her in the work she is doing in relation to her own electorate, but I urge the government to continue to look at ways of taking direct and practical environmental action rather than indulging in lofty words on this particular topic. late the member for Page for bringing such an important motion to the House. The theme for World Wetlands Day 2010 is ‘wetlands, biodiversity and climate change’. One could speak at great length on the importance of wetlands for the sustenance of life-life that is wholly dependent on the wetlands, life that largely relies on the wetlands and life that seasonally or occasionally uses such sites for intermittent purposes. The inter-reliance of myriad species of flora and fauna on wetlands and the natural processes that exist in them, each reliant on the others, is epic. Their beauty makes iconic images that exemplify the best of our largely arid MAIN COMMITTEE",191,Private Members Business
167,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh) (7.05 Pm),"I rise in support of this motion and congratulandscape, images that we hold dear in our minds of Australia in its pristine condition. Be they current images of Kakadu, occasional images of Lake Eyre or 19th century images of the Murray River and its billabongs, such images are held dear by many, if not most, Australians with a sense of wonder and pride. Most of eastern Australia’s waterways are regulated in one way or another and many surviving wetlands are reliant on regulated allocations of water for their survival. The Chowilla Floodplain, adjacent to the Murray River on the South Australia-Victoria border, is one such wetland. The Chowilla Floodplain is especially reliant on flooding, as saline groundwater will lay waste to the entire region without sufficient quantities of freshwater flooding over the ground and keeping the saline watertable down. If we allow the salt to rise, this land will not only lose its forest but become a lifeless hellhole. This is one of the great arguments in support of the Rudd government’s water buyback scheme-a government scheme for delivering more water to keep alive the rivers and their surrounding lands and all that rely on them. The other great argument in support of quarantining more water for non-commercial uses is soil acidification, a truly toxic and hellish outcome that threatens much more than the local area and populations. To sustain our wetlands and flood-reliant forests and to keep the devastating chemical processes at bay, the government has purchased over 600 gigalitres of water entitlements to date. This is most welcome, and we have only spent one-third of funds budgeted for this purpose. The previous government’s target of 500 gigalitres of environmental water has already been well exceeded. The often cited target of 1,500 gigalitres, which just happens to be the highest of three arbitrary volumes inquired into by COAG around 2002, may also be exceeded by this one program. With other measures specifically concerned with metering onfarm irrigation systems and off-farm transmission infrastructure, the old 1,500-gigalitre target will most likely be well exceeded by this government, achieving in just a few years more than what the previous government ever dreamt of doing in over a decade in government. The motion before us mentions the waste water treatment facilities of Lismore City Council and Richmond Valley Council, which the member for Page has mentioned. The use of treated waste water is gaining greater and wider attention and is resulting in the unlocking of substantial volumes of water for irrigation and environmental purposes. The great majority of waste water is generated in metropolitan areas, where the land for such ponds is at a premium and would more likely be used for stormwater harvesting. Nevertheless, in the case of Adelaide, an increasing proportion of waste water is being recycled through the McLaren Vale waste water irrigation system and the Bolivar waste water treatment plant’s piping of treated waste water to the northern market gardens and orchard districts around Virginia. These are excellent examples of what is possible in the vicinity of a large metropolitan area. The member for Makin is here in the room with us. He had quite a bit to do in his former role as Mayor of the City of Salisbury in ensuring that wetlands were created in that area. The newest investment in that area, in my own electorate at Glenelg, is the Park Lands Recycled Water Pipeline Project, opened last month in Adelaide’s parklands, which I supported while a member of the opposition. I was very pleased to see that it was funded to the tune of over $30 million by the Rudd Labor government as soon as it came into office. It is absolutely vital that each of us, in our own part of this country, treats water as a precious gift. We can be in metropolitan areas where stormwater harvesting and waste water reMAIN COMMITTEE cycling are priorities or in peri-metropolitan or more regional areas where land is available for pond treatment facilities such as in Lismore and Richmond council areas. Irrespective of that, we need to appreciate the value of the water we have-its value is increasing year by year. I commend this motion to the House. lands Day 2010. I congratulate the member for Page for putting this motion forward and other members for their contributions to the debate. I spoke about World Wetlands Day during the last sitting week. I also spoke about the Canning Wetlands in my electorate of Swan. Yesterday I was down at the Canning Wetlands. I spent some of the morning clearing weeds with the Wilson Wetlands Action Group near the Wilson Lagoon which, unfortunately, looks like being overrun with Hydrocotyle, which is a weed ranked at about No. 57 on the noxious weeds list in Australia. I was lucky enough to get down there a bit earlier than the action group. They have an elevated hide beside the lagoon. I was able to spend 15 minutes watching the birdlife down there, which is just fantastic. It was like watching National Geographic on pay television. It was a great experience and the peace was only broken by the state 20 kilometres seniors walking championship, which was not that noisy because there were only two competitors. I congratulate the winner; the other competitor had to drop out halfway through with an injury, so it was a fait accompli. Wilson Lagoon is a great area which gets a lot of community use. Russell Gorton, who won the Canning Citizen of the Year award, was there with his mother. Two other volunteers, Rose and Ash, also attended to help clear weeds in the area. This volunteer group meet once a fortnight to eradicate weeds around the wetlands-there is no shortage of weeds. They are one of 17 volunteer groups in this area and are to be congratulated for all the work they do for the local ecology. Back to the weed: I thank the Parliamentary Library for providing some additional information on this matter. The weed’s specific name is Hydrocotyle ranunculoides and it is native to the Americas. It has become more widespread in Europe as a result of being introduced as an aquarium and garden pond plant that became naturalised. To date it has only been found in the Perth region of Western Australia, principally in the Canning River. According to the government website Weeds in Australia: This vigorous weed has the potential to spread to other waterways in other temperate regions. It is a potential weed of all freshwater environments, being an aggressive invader of marshes, wetlands, waterways and the edges of still and slow-moving water. The Centre for Ecology and Hydrology in the United Kingdom has said that there are a number of varying methods used to control these weeds. Mechanical control is to cut with weed cutting buckets or bolts and remove the plant physically. A chemical control option is herbicides containing glyphosate, which can work well on this weed. The glyphosate products should be used through a low-volume apparatus to apply a low volume of concentrated herbicide to the leaf surface in order for any control to be achieved. There are also several methods of environmental control, but none gives a complete solution. Providing shading by planting trees assists as Hydrocotyle does not establish well in shaded areas. Providing shade in WA can be a challenge on its own because of our great lifestyle and plenty of sun. Biological control options include a weevil called Listronotus elongatus, which has been demonstrated to feed exclusively on Hydrocotyle in Argentina. Following collection of the MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Private Members Business
168,Mr Irons (Swan) (7.10 Pm),"I rise this evening to speak to the motion on World Wetweevil on this plant, further work on this agent is planned in the UK. The adult weevil feeds on the leaves by scraping away the leaf surface and forming discrete holes, some of which become infected by unidentified pathogens. The adult females lay eggs in the base of the petiole and the larvae develop and burrow down into the stolon. Preliminary observations indicate that the larval damage is restricted to the stolon around the base of each petiole, possibly allowing other larvae to occupy neighbouring petiole or stolon sections. But we must make sure that this is a real solution and not go ahead with something that is going to cause damage to the local environment. In conclusion, I thank the member for bringing the matter of World Wetlands Day before the House. However, the government must not just do the talking but also take action. The NRM group has had its funding cut by half since the Rudd government came in, which has seen a loss of employment and a loss of projects in the local wetlands area. SoI urge the government to reinstate funding to the NRM. I also again congratulate all the volunteer groups who work in the Canning regional area. motion by the member for Page on World Wetlands Day. Between 1997 and 2007 I served as a member of the Salisbury council. During that time Salisbury council became a world leader in constructing man-made wetlands and using them to collect stormwater, cleanse it and then store it underground for use as it was required later. It was the result of the collective work of many people over three decades. The work is continuing today and the city of Salisbury now has some 36 wetlands covering around 260 hectares. Noticeably, the regeneration of the local ecosystem has been enhanced because of those wetlands. Statistics on some of the changes we have seen in recent years include: 173 species of birds, including 24 species of migratory waders, have been observed; 37 native aquatic invertebrate groups have been spotted; and seven native reptile species, seven native mammal species, five native fish species and four native frog species have been seen. That is just an example of the return to nature in habitat that had previously disappeared. Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you would be familiar with the Salisbury wetlands because I recall that some years ago you visited the wetlands as a member of parliament and saw precisely some of the things I might refer to in a moment. It is interesting that in the lead-up to the 2010 South Australian state election and in the face of a long drought period a swag of political converts to wetlands development as a source of water supply have emerged. People who previously knew nothing and did nothing about stormwater harvesting have seen the political opportunity and, out of nowhere, have become advocates of and experts in the process. Such has been the case with the state election announcement by the Liberal Party in South Australia that, if elected on 20 March, the Liberals will spend millions of dollars on further filtering harvested stormwater so that it can be used for human purposes. The policy is seriously flawed, it is illogical and it highlights the Liberals’ lack of understanding of this issue. In summary, the Liberal policy of mechanically filtering wetlands water and distributing it through the mains water system is financially wasteful. It will drive up water prices for those using wetlands water for non-human purposes. It will add financial cost to industry. It will discourage investment in water harvesting schemes by councils and it will deprive councils of a very valuable income source in the future. I will go through those points in the time that I have. It is financially wasteful because it is simply unnecessary. More than 50 per cent of the household water used by homeowners is MAIN COMMITTEE",194,Private Members Business
169,Mr Zappia (Makin) (7.16 Pm),"I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of theused for non-human purposes. Around 50 per cent of all water used in the Adelaide metropolitan area is used for non-human purposes. So you do not need to filter water to the level that needs to be done when it is going to be used by humans. It will also force up the price of water for three obvious reasons: firstly, the cost of the treatment has to be factored into the price; secondly, once the water is put into the mains system there will only be one price that can apply and that is the mains water price; and, thirdly, it will reduce competition in the marketplace for sourcing your water, which is applying right now. The policy will disadvantaged schools, sports clubs and industry. They are all major users for whom even a small increase in water price will make a significant difference. I recently had to intervene on behalf of a sports club which wanted to access stormwater to irrigate its facility because if it could not get access to that water the sports club was going to become unviable. The classic industry case is Michell Wool. On Parafield Airport, Salisbury council has developed a major wetland, and it was developed specifically to ensure that Michell Wool could access stormwater at a much cheaper price than mains water in order to ensure the industry remained viable. I see only today in the Advertiser that the Australian Industry Group is raising its concerns about the future of water prices. Again, doing what the Liberals propose is certainly going to make it more difficult for industry to have access to water that is fit for purpose but has not been treated to the extent that they want. Pumping additional water through the mains is also not a smart option at all. The additional pressure that would be applied to the pipe system would require a major upgrade of the current infrastructure. Again, this is something which I am sure has not been factored in by the Liberals. In summary, the Liberals’ policy is poorly thought through, it will drive up water prices and it will discourage wetlands development in South Australia. pired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day Debate resumed, on motion by Mrs Gash: That the House: (1) notes: (a) the growing acceptance of 15 October in Australia as the Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day; (b) that this day is officially recognised in the United States and Canada; and (c) that this day is only informally celebrated in Australia; (2) calls on the Government to consider the adoption of 15 October each year as the Official Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day; and (3) recognises the efforts of Nicole Ballinger in promoting the official adoption of this day by Australia. tating family event, especially for the mother.

In terms of the impact of the event, you need to factor in fathers, grandparents, aunts, uncles and even friends and workplace colleagues. For all intents and purposes, this is posttraumatic stress disorder, whose widespread effects are well documented within the veterans community. There is a growing acceptance in Australia to adopt 15 October as the official day to acknowledge pregnancy and infant loss. It is already widely accepted unofficially in Australia. The United States and Canada recognise this day officially and in late 2008, Shelley Hancock, of the New South Wales parliament, moved in favour of calling on their government to consider adopting the date in the state’s calendar. I believe there are moves afoot in other legislatures in Australia to adopt this date within their jurisdictions. What has brought me to move this motion was one of my constituents, Nicole Ballinger, who has experienced multiple miscarriages, and Nicole and Richard are here in the chamber tonight. Nicole came to me because she wanted something done. After the first miscarriage, she and her husband tried a number of remedies. She met regularly with a grief counsellor and complied with the suggestions that were given. She and her husband named the baby, planted a tree in the baby’s honour, wrote a memorial and made other gestures of grief. They did that with each subsequent loss, but the black dog of depression stayed with her. The 18th century psychologist GH Lewes said that the only cure for grief is action. With that view, Nicole resolved that depression was not going to beat her. She continued her research in an attempt to overcome the blight. Like most Australians, she turned to the net and soon found people on a blog site with shared experiences. Although she participated only a couple of times each week, she soon found that the process was cathartic. She found that the intensity of her grief was lessening. She found that in the course of about eight months she was blogging, and she was coming out of the process at a much faster rate than the previous 3½ years since her first miscarriage. I asked Nicole to journalise her experience so that I could relay her story to the House. With time constraints I cannot do her story the justice it deserves, but I would like to quote just a single paragraph as a way of emphasising the clinical value of having an official day of acknowledgement. This is what she wrote: So what made the difference? Certainly part of it was the passing of time as well, as the fifth miscarriage had not occurred in the meantime. I’m also convinced that I began to heal through identification with others and the normalisation of my trauma. I shared my story with those on the blog board and was overwhelmed by the amount of care and empathy that I was given. Then other people joined the board, some of whom were in the throes of fresh raw grief having just lost their baby. SoI began giving these women what I could, sharing my own experience and hope, encouraging them to ‘hang in there’ because some of them even expressed suicidal tendencies. Nicole and her husband went on to launch an information based website with both professional and lay contributions, and she has approached her state and federal members of parliament. This proposal for a pregnancy and infant loss remembrance day is not just a sentimental gesture; there are clinical and therapeutic benefits to be had, and that is why I am calling on MAIN COMMITTEE the government to support the community and formally adopt this date as a gazetted day of remembrance. How many women out there are confronting a miscarriage, thinking they are alone, when they do not have to be? This day will help reinforce the assurance that theirs is a shared experience, and, like Nicole, who blogged with other women, the sharing of the experience will help rescue them from the depression that inevitably grips the victim. Eleanor Roosevelt once said, ‘Happiness is not a goal; it is a by-product.’ Nicole has found a way of moving forward. It may not be the way that some choose, but this government can assist the process by raising awareness through the declaration of such a day. I commend the motion to the House, and I thank Nicole and Richard for being here tonight. tion to the House, and in particular to Nicole and Richard-thank you for being here and thank you for doing what you are doing. This is personally difficult for me as well, but I suppose I want to demonstrate the importance of what you are doing, because there are so many people that have been affected by pregnancy loss, stillbirths and child death soon after birth. Some of the facts that have been presented by Nicole and Richard-you mentioned that men feel it deeply as well-are that in the developed world one in three pregnancies ends in loss, one in four women have lost a baby, one in 2,000 babies die not long after birth, one in every 48 babies is stillborn and 500,000 miscarriages take place every year. One in three women in Australia in their thirties who have given birth have also had a miscarriage. So it is something that a lot of people experience. In many cases they remain silent about it, but it is very useful for people to be able to share their experiences with each other and to know that you are not alone in your grief, and that it continues for much longer than you think. On4 February 1984, my wife, Bronwyn, and I lost our son Christopher, who was born premature. There was no support at all. When Bronwyn was brought in in early labour, there was no attempt to fly her to Hobart for intensive care. There was no humidicrib; it was removed. We were basically told little. Christopher was born. We spent time with Christopher. He was alive and we held him. In our ignorance, we did not know what was happening. We were told little. Christopher was taken away and we never heard what happened, how he died. Unfortunately, Christopher had an IUD lodged in him as an embryo. We were not advised that that could have been removed earlier. But anyway he was born with that. We were told he was infected. He looked beautiful, irrespective of me, and he died soon after, about an hour after. I remember it being about 2.30 in the morning; as I was leaving, in grief, they ran after me in the corridor and asked me to sign a death certificate. The next day I came to see Bron. They had taken her out of the maternity area and had her in the general ward. She did not understand what had happened. We left together. There was no counselling or referral to anyone. We buried Christopher alone. We were told we could not have children again. Gracefully and mercifully, we were told that Bron could go on an IVF program. When she did finally front up for it they said, ‘We cannot help you because you’re pregnant.’ This was in 1986, so we lived with this from 1984 to 1986. Our son Julian was born on 26 June 1986. He looked just like Christopher, so I know what Christopher would have looked like as he grew up. Our other beautiful son William was born on 6 May 1988. I will support this motion any way I can. We had no support. Others will have support and do now, which is terrific. Thank you for the terrific job you are doing and thank you for helping me remember.

172,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (7.26 Pm),"Thank you to Joanna for presenting this moDr STONE (Murray) (7.31 pm)-This sort of motion reminds us how human we as politicians, constituents and clerks are. The loss of a baby is so profound. None of us should ever forget the sorrow of others or our own personal loss. I commend Joanna Gash, the member for Gilmore, for putting this motion to us in the House and for bringing with her Nicole Ballinger, her partner and friends. Through Nicole we can perhaps do something more, and that is officially recognise Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day, like they do in the United States and Canada. The previous speaker, the member for Braddon, and the member for Gilmore have reminded us how often there is a miscarriage, stillbirth or death of a baby shortly after birth. There is an extraordinary number. In Australia perhaps 15 to 20 per cent of babies are miscarried, for example-and that is of known pregnancies. Of course, there are probably many more. Just as Sid has said, many decades ago it was a case of: ‘Forget it. You have lost the baby, yes, but go home. Get on with your life. Perhaps you have other children to think about. Certainly, do not expect much more from the health sector, for example.’ There was no encouragement of photos, flowers, a service or the naming of the child. No doubt that led to more grief and a wondering if the mother and father-and perhaps the brothers, sisters and grandparents-were the only ones who really cared. This official Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day would give the whole community the sense that we all do care about those babies, those little boys and girls, who did not start life or whose life ended too soon. I think of my own daughter, who had a series of miscarriages. We had the joy of thinking that the first ultrasound would give us the gender of the baby, but instead there was no heartbeat. It was very sad. But, as we have said, the family together can grieve, can think of that loss and can think about the potential joy of other children or about the joy of others who are already born. It is very important, for example, in relation to paid parental leave policy, which the Labor Party has identified as commencing in 2011, that there is recognition of a stillborn baby and that the parents will be eligible for paid parental leave. I think that is a very important and humane thing to do. Certainly the coalition will echo that sentiment or that need because, of course, parents who have lost a baby deserve, should have and would need that parental leave just as if the baby had survived. SoI think this is a most important policy area. I want to say too that we should be thinking about families where babies have been lost in other countries where, clearly, too often the women have not had sufficient maternal health care, and where babies are more likely to be lost because of problems with nutrition or war or violence or extraordinary catastrophe. I understand there are 65,000 pregnancies and 7,000 babies due to be born in Haiti in the coming month or so, and those mothers and those babies will have an extraordinary time surviving. We as a country should grieve the loss of our own babies and those of others. We should understand that in some sectors of the community there is more likely to be a loss than in others, and I am thinking of Indigenous women in our community. We have got to make sure that we do all we can to support families and mothers in those circumstances. There is no doubt that grieving together, identifying your loss and having the community understand your loss must help in that grieving process. I again commend Nicole and the Ballingers for promoting the official adoption of this day in Australia. I certainly commend this motion to the House. It MAIN COMMITTEE is one humane thing that we can do in Australia when too often in this parliament we do not think of humanity but, instead, contest. This is about humanity and loving one another, and I certainly add my weight to commending this motion to the House. bringing this motion before the House. I am very pleased to be able to speak in support of it. Last year I watched one of my best friends carry a small white coffin in his arms. It was the funeral for his daughter who, days before, had died in utero. He was carrying her out of the church for her final farewell. There was not a dry eye to be found in the church. It was one of the saddest, one of the most moving funerals I have ever attended. She had been the subject of much anticipation, of the excitement of expectant parents and their friends and families. In January 2009 my wife and our four children had visited our close friends whilst on holidays in Brisbane. We exchanged stories about their hopes for their child and our experiences as young parents. We inspected the nursery. There was such anticipation. But the long lifetime full of rich memories that we envisaged would be ahead of this as yet unborn child would never be realised. The small white coffin carried in a grieving father’s arms was a heart-wrenching scene. As a person brought up in the Catholic tradition, a funeral in even the most difficult circumstances is a time for celebrating the life of the deceased. But it is not until you attend the funeral of a life that has barely had time to be lived that you realise the depth of the loss that families faced with this reality confront. As my grandfather, who survived one of his own children, once confided in me, ‘There is no greater loss you can feel than attending the funeral of one of your children.’ In Australia in 2007 there were 1,676 deaths of babies at some stage during pregnancy and a further 856 deaths of babies within the first 28 days of life. Each of these deaths represents an enormous tragedy and a grief that we all wish no-one should ever experience. To lose a child, particularly a child who has died at the very beginning of his or her life, is a wound which does not heal for parents, although the hope, the prospect and perhaps even the eventuality of having other children can help parents to again look forward in their lives. The Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day is a day that seeks to recognise the pain and the suffering of those parents who have lost a baby. In the United States of America 15 October is observed as Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day. For families who have experienced the loss of a baby this day provides a chance to acknowledge the grief of millions of parents and remember and honour the babies lost. People are invited to light a candle at 7.00 pm on 15 October no matter where they are in the world and keep it burning for an hour to create a wave of light across the globe in memory of the babies lost to us. For my good friends who lost their daughter last year, Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day has represented a way to connect with others who have experienced the same grief. My friends recently wrote to me, and I will read their words into the Hansard: The day we found out our daughter had no heartbeat and had died in utero, a piece of ourselves also died. Our hearts broken. Our dreams shattered. Our lives changed forever. We became part of a select, far too often ignored and hidden community of bereaved parents. Each of us struggling to put our lives back together, to integrate the death of our children into something resembling a normal existence. Every phone call, every message, or simple gesture recognising our daughter as part of our new lives help us move forward in our grief.

Friends, family, and the greater community all coming together to remember and honour the far too many babies’ lives lost. IPIL Day enabled us to feel the love and support of our wider community again. Words can do so little to soothe the pain that a parent feels at the loss of a baby, but Pregnancy and Infant Loss Remembrance Day provides a way to share that loss and know that others are walking down the same path. I would like to express my support for this motion and for this remembrance day. There are thousands of parents out there each year who suffer the loss of a baby, and they should know that they are not alone. expired. The debate is adjourned and resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Electronic Gaming Machines Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Champion: That the House: (1) supports the Productivity Commission’s recommendation to: (a) lower the maximum bet limit per button push from $10.00 to $1.00 on electronic gaming machines; (b) lower the cash input limit on electronic gaming machines; and (c) implement by 2016, a universal pre commitment system for electronic gaming machines; (2) notes the observations of Productivity Commission Chairman Mr Gary Banks that ‘despite progress since our last report 10 years ago, there is considerably more that governments can do to make gaming machines a safer recreational pursuit.’; and (3) calls on State governments and the gaming industry to support the implementation of the Productivity Commission’s recommendations. don gave a very moving speech on the previous motion and does this House proud when he shows such passion for an issue. In addressing the issues around addiction to electronic gambling machines and what we do about it, a problem that I have talked about many times, the first place we have to start is to ask: is there a problem? There are many ways of answering that question. One place you can go is the key points of the draft report by the Productivity Commission, which talk about the numbers of gamblers, the percentages, the ratios and all the rest of it. Or you can go to some of the headlines that have been around, like the one in the Herald Sun on 26 January 2010 which reported that ‘Victorians spend $1.36 bil in six months on pokies’. Or there is the article from the Daily Mercury on 18 January 2010 titled ‘Mackay blows $60.8m on pokies’, or an article from 23 January 2010 titled ‘Wollongong’s $131m pokie habit’, or an article from the Northern Star on 22 February this year where the headline is ‘Rise in women addicted to pokies’. There are a lot of headlines, a lot of statistics and a lot of ratios which talk about the problem. I was looking on the internet and, interestingly enough, in That’s Life, which is a popular magazine which tells people’s stories, there is an article about Pat Burns, 68, of Mitcham, Victoria. She talks about how her son died and then about how a pokies addiction developed as a result of that. There are a couple of paragraphs that I think are fitting. She says: MAIN COMMITTEE",200,Private Members Business

175,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (7.41 Pm),"I will just say that I think the member for BradSitting in front of the machine, relief washed through me. AllI had to think about was hitting the buttons. Before long, I was out of money, so I went back for another $50. Then another. LaterI realised I’d put through a couple of hundred dollars. It’s just a bit of fun, I reasoned. However, over the next few months, I found myself at the club more and more. The pokies were proving irresistible. That’s my pay for the week gone, I thought at the ATM one night. But I dismissed it, shuffling back to my favourite machine. Pat Burns in this article goes through her journey with poker machines. She talks about how, in the end, she wound up spending about $60,000 over five years. Eventually she sought help and got it. She talks about her struggles in beating the addiction. She says: Over the next two years I clawed my way out of debt, scrimping and sacrificing to get back in the black. But the lure of pokies remained. Especially on the anniversaries of Darren and Mum’s deaths. But with the help of Davidher husbandand Veraher counsellorI got through it. We can see from these personal testimonies that often people have problems when they go into poker machine venues. Often they are dealing with grief, depression or some other issue. It starts out very innocently, as a bit of escapism through gambling on these machines, but what eventually happens is a very bad addiction for some individuals. The commission’s recommendation, which I talk about in this motion, will undoubtedly help people. It will help people in a couple of different ways. Firstly, it will stop them losing so much money. Reducing bet limits from $10 a spin to $1 a spin will ultimately lower the amount of money that can be gambled per hour, and I think that will lower the amount of damage people can do while they are in the thrall of these machines. Likewise, I think the provision for self-exclusion through mandatory self-exclusion systems can do a great deal of help for those recovering from gambling addictions, for those people who realise they have a problem and who want to seek help. It helps them deal with the irresistible lure of these machines. I have spoken about this many times before. These machines are just so addictive. It is very hard to get off them once you are on them and it is very, very easy to develop a problem, even though that problem might be overlaid by other personal problems. I commend this motion to the House. I hope to see a positive response from the government. nicians, social workers and a number of professions have worked on it for generations now and we are no closer to a solution. In my five minutes today I want to focus on the medical and caring side of problem gambling, to look very briefly at the terms of reference and whether the Productivity Commission addressed them, and finally to make some ACT related points, because obviously we are in a territory where there is predominantly community gambling, and that gives it a very different profile to other states. We have been working on the medical model with everything from SSRIs to opiate antagonists as medical treatments. You work your way through peer support and self-help groups and banning lists so that you do not enter areas of gambling. But still we are a long, long way MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Private Members Business
176,Mr Laming (Bowman) (7.47 Pm),"Problem gambling is such a complex issue that clifrom a solution. That is why the terms of reference were developed and the Productivity Commission addressed this very important issue. I want to make one very clear point, and that is that we have a range of different gambling challenges within the private betting sphere and the one that is of greatest concern to me is what is called the hyperlink machines-the multilevel jackpot systems that have multiple near miss outcomes. That is one small subcategory of betting machines that is of enormous concern to me. It has not been addressed in this report, as far as I am aware. These machines are extremely damaging and are positively playing on some of the most addictive elements of gambling. What are those elements? They have been listed in DSM-IV. They have also been developed in a number of studies in the United States, but in essence it is the preoccupation and the thoughts about gambling that never go away. It is the fact that through tolerance-or toleration, as the Americans say-more and more gambling is needed to obtain the same rush. It is the irritability and the withdrawals, the sense that without gambling life is not complete. It is the need for escape, where the subject gambles to get away from the troubles of the day. It is chasing, where once one loses one feels the need to bet again to win those losses back. It is lying to hide the extent of one’s gambling. It is a loss of control where you unsuccessfully attempt to reduce gambling, and then of course there are illegal acts where one will actually break the law to obtain the money to gamble. It is the loss of and risking of significant relationships with family and those to whom you are close, be it relationships, jobs or other connections. Finally, there is the bailout, where you turn to family and friends for help. Effectively, have five out of 10 of those and you are a problem gambler. Just to take a snapshot in the ACT, around $170 million is turned over every year in gambling. It is important to say that it is all community gambling here in the ACT. There are no private establishments like pubs that allow gambling. In those 5,200 machines we have about the lowest machine take of any state or territory at around $35,000 per machine. I think those who are operating in the ACT would be at pains to say that, as much of that money goes back into the community, we need to find a very, very careful balance between that money going back to the community and setting up enormously expensive transitionals such as trying to change hardware or even reprogram machines at mind-numbing cost to do something as simple as changing the maximum bet limit. Such button changes would be extraordinarily expensive to undertake. The turnover of the machines is, I think, in the order of every eight to 10 years, so the clubs certainly cannot wait for new machines to be installed. That is of concern to those who are operating community gambling establishments in the ACT. The money does some really important things around the community, and we tend to forget that. We do not want to see a system where we have completely impotent increases in signs in establishments where it turns into something like Parramatta Road, and you end up ignoring all of the signs. In the end one element has to be small, affordable changes with the technology itself-and I have named one, the hyperlink machines. I know there is one company that holds the patent for them and it would be very, very disturbed to have that subcategory of machine banned. However, were that to be done, you would be addressing potentially 70 to 80 per cent of problem gambling because it is that machine category that is most damaging to problem gamblers. Another point to make is that community gambling is far less aggressively marketed than private gambling, from which every additional dollar gambled goes to the establishment. That is a far cry from community gambling. MAIN COMMITTEE In summary, we are hitting as hard as we can on medical solutions. We are looking at community support for problem gamblers. We know in the end that, no matter what card or identification system is introduced, problem gamblers will go to extraordinary steps to bypass them. I support some of the recommendations of the Productivity Commission but acknowledge that the one I support most strongly, which is the most damaging of all, is the recommendation for hyperlink machines. They should be the focus of this reform. matter before us. Last year, I spoke about the Wests Leagues Club, of which I am the patron, which contributes in excess of $1 million annually into sport for the local community. In addition to that they have provided financial assistance to more than 100 hundred local athletes so that they could compete in various state, national and international events. That is just one club supporting junior sport across the south-west of Sydney. TodayI rise again to speak in relation to some of the positive aspects of clubs and what they contribute to the community. Clearly this contribution is support that they provide through a consequence of their revenue stream. Also, I acknowledge that gambling is one of those streams. In New South Wales, particularly in areas with a high concentration of families, we have seen the development of clubs in our communities and we know that they provide a range of services to the community. They are extremely popular with locals because they provide quality and affordable services at a community based level. From my experience the clubs in my region are not typical venues, they are community hubs. In fact, I am advised that 96 per cent of clubs in New South Wales provide and maintain sporting facilities such as golf courses, bowls and sporting fields, gyms, swimming pools, et cetera. Clubs across New South Wales pay for football jerseys, subsidise player insurance, provide volunteers for coaching, provide referees’ fees, contribute buses and drivers and also provide a safe venue for people to meet and socialise. It should be said that, without this assistance from clubs, many of these services simply would not be provided in our communities. I have seen first hand the support and assistance provided by the clubs in my region, which has allowed a lot of kids to participate in team events, and the same clubs continue to contribute millions of dollars each year to vital community services, seniors groups, community facilities, schools and charitable organisations. I would like to make it very clear at this point that, whilst I have focused on the positive impact that clubs have in our communities, I understand that gambling excessively causes havoc to a person’s life and certainly to the social, emotional and financial aspects. Ultimately this problem may lead to the loss of relationships, homes, health and careers, may cause depression and stress, and very much be the ruination of a person’s life. However, not everyone who gambles is a problem gambler. In the main, people should be free to choose for themselves whether they want to play gaming machines or not. But it must be said that problem gambling is a major health issue in Australia, and for that reason we certainly need policies that strike a balance between the sizeable benefits that accrue from recreational gambling and the significant harm that it causes some people and their families. Gambling is therefore an important issue for the community, and the government must consider both its positive and negative impacts when identifying and developing community outcomes and producing long-term community plans. MAIN COMMITTEE",202,Private Members Business
177,Mr Hayes (Werriwa) (7.52 Pm),"I thank the member for Wakefield for bringing thisI note that this motion refers to one of the 40-plus draft recommendations of the Productivity Commission, and that is to lower the maximum bet on gaming machines from $10 to $1. I understand that the Productivity Commission has suggested in its draft report of October 2009 that a number of its recommendations should be subject to further research and not be immediately implemented. I understand that this is because there is no guarantee that the commission’s proposals would actually reduce problem gambling and they accept that a disturbance of the revenue base would have a significant consequential effect on the ability of clubs to provide various community services. But we must remember that one of the functions of government is to make decisions that set the direction for promoting the social, cultural, environmental and economic well-being of our communities. Therefore, we must develop healthy policies in relation to gambling harm minimisation. It is also important that we appreciate that the clubs in New South Wales provide 10,000 jobs. In my own region, at last count, I think there were a tad over 3,000 people employed in these clubs. Those jobs go to supporting local families. Clearly, the draft recommendations of the Productivity Commission to lower bets and to commit to a system that would require people to precommit their bets will be effective measures but they will require a greater degree of investment and also research into their implications for staff. We must strike a proper balance, and we must acknowledge what clubs contribute to our community. (Time expired) motion before the chamber. It is at least the second motion that he has brought forward on gambling. I also recall that I had an opportunity to speak before on this matter. I do not understand these sorts of addictions. I saw this problem during a rare walk through Crown Casino in Melbourne when I was there several years ago. I saw it at certain licensed clubs within New South Wales when I was on rowing trips many aeons ago. I also saw it during a visit to Wrest Point Hotel Casino when I was in the Army, back in 1990. I felt dreadful when I lost $20, and I realised then that I did not have a problem with gambling. But you see people who seem to spend a lot of time locked to their favourite machine and also a lot of money going into those things. I appreciate what is going on. I appreciate the member for Wakefield’s pursuit of this issue. A lot of people clearly cannot help themselves, and I think that is a tragedy. I recall one day-and this is not specifically about poker machines-talking to a local newsagent in the electorate of Cowan. He told me about a time when the lotto bonus was $30 million and a number of people came into the newsagency, paid off their minimum loan repayment to Dun and Bradstreet through the newsagent but saved the majority of their money to buy lotto tickets. This is one of the problems to do with gambling: that some people out there who, for whatever reason, have such a sense of hopelessness in their lives that they feel that it is only through luck-the pursuit of the life-changing gambling win-that the circumstances of their adversity can be alleviated. Maybe that is something to do with what is going on in the casinos and licensed clubs around the country where people plough in many dollar coins. They are significant dollars by the time you roll them all in together. It is a terrible thing that people surrender themselves to luck. I think we here would all agree, those of us who have worked hard to get to this place, that destiny, if anything, is in the palms of our hands and is generated by hard work. It is a tragedy that there are people out there who feel that is not the way to MAIN COMMITTEE",204,Private Members Business
178,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (7.57 Pm),"I thank the member for Wakefield for bringing thisgo-that they must rely on risking their future by ploughing coins into a machine or by some other form of gambling. As a member from Western Australia, I say that it is a great thing that we have these gaming machines restricted to the casino at Burswood. It is not ingrained into our society as much as it is elsewhere, as we heard from the member for Werriwa. I struggle to understand how this is a recreational pursuit. It does not seem interesting to me to sit in front of a machine and hear it whirr and crank; to hear the bells and whistles going off. It is not that interesting to me but the reality is that there are a lot of people who do not have a gambling problem but think that is recreation. Provided they can live within their limits we should not be trying to restrict them. I endorse the member for Wakefield’s position on this motion. If you are happy to sit in front of a machine, and that is the right of every Australian citizen, then you can surely get entertainment out of pushing a button where it does not cost you $10 a time. I think it is a tragedy that people are addicted and we can at least make some small moves to limit the damage for those who do have a problem. bate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Global Food and Water Security Debate resumed, on motion by Mr Ripoll: That the House: (1) notes that: (a) global food prices have risen 83 per cent since 2005; (b) the World Bank’s 2008 Agriculture for Development report predicts global cereal production must increase by 50 per cent and meat production by 85 per cent between 2000 and 2030 to meet demand; (c) Australia has recently suffered some of the worse droughts on record, increasing water scarcity and affecting our local crops and produce; (d) many Organisation for Economic Co operation and Development countries have diverted large proportions of crops to biofuel production; and (e) foreign aid to agriculture fell from 18 per cent of total aid 30 years ago, to 3.5 per cent in 2004; and (2) supports: (a) positive initiatives by the current Government to address climate change; (b) policies, projects and programs that deliver long term solutions for water security; and (c) the Government’s commitment to tackle the impact of rising food prices and shortages by addressing the root causes of global food security. lenges that the international community faces. It is arguable that we have a responsibility to raise, debate and address these issues as a regional leader and a stable, developed nation-state. Over one-sixth of the global population, about one billion people, is now classified as undernourished according to the Food and Agriculture Organisation, the UN body responsible for monitoring the international food situation. The effects of undernourishment are well documented. Undernourishment leads to lower energy and concentration levels, susceptibility to disease resulting from weaker immune systems, and lower life expectancy for its sufferersMAIN COMMITTEE",205,Private Members Business

180,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (8.02 Pm),"Global food security represents one of the greatest chaland this happens to many people in the world. Afflicted individuals are also not able to work at their full capacity, they have drops in productivity, and their yields and capacity to work are of course much, much lower. This leads to a drop in the overall economy of the nation or region and, as productivity falls, so does their standard of living. Lower consumption rates lead also to job losses, and drops in income lead to poorer families, making it even harder for them to afford to buy good-quality food, even if it is available. There are gross inequities in the distribution of hungry people around the world. While ideally no man, woman or child should go hungry, it is deceiving to see the levels at which some states and areas are suffering. This is an emerging complication of the food security crisis that will play out in the next century. It is one we must face and address. Even with one-sixth of the global population starving there are still adequate cereal and food supplies to ensure that each person is fully nourished. The reason many of these people, often from the most disadvantaged areas on the planet, are unable to access food is simply cost. The spike in prices is largely attributable to the failure of global food production to keep pace with growing demand. The world’s population is projected to increase from the current 6½ billion people to nearly 9.2 billion people by 2050 and anyone who has read the Intergenerational report in Australia will understand the significant challenges that we face not only here but also at a global level. Global food production will need to rise by some 70 per cent to meet this challenge, incorporating the growing use of biofuels as oil prices rise, to further complicate matters. This will need to be concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and South America, where the only tracts of high-yield, sustainable and suitable farm lands are available. The effects of the global financial crisis were not limited to the people of Australia, householders or financial institutions. The poorest people in the world have frequently been priced out of the market, with few options available to them due to the decline of subsistence agriculture. Biosecurity is also a serious threat to global food security. The vast plethora of edible fauna is largely ignored in favour of a small variety of engineered and chemically fuelled high-yield crops. These are corn, wheat, soy beans and rice. As tastes narrow and markets boom, the varieties of these staple products grow less diverse. The refined crops of today are mostly hybrids and increasingly susceptible to crop blights and other diseases that can threaten yields. By diversifying crop production, we can insure ourselves against this threat. The most typical challenge for ensuring food supplies is something I believe the opposition is struggling to come to terms with-that is, some of the dangers of climate change that are with us today. Global temperature rises will contract food production, dropping yields from current levels while demand rises across a variety of geographical areas. The greatest decline is likeliest to occur where there is the greatest demand and need, such as places like Latin America, Asia and Africa. It is important that we address and consider these challenges concurrently to stave off ecological disaster. AusAID also does a crucial job in providing funds and guidance to impoverished communities across the world, giving them the means to help themselves and their people. For example, in May 2009, the federal government announced a four-year $464-million global food security initiative, which aims to do a number of things in countries from Africa to Asia, across the continent and the Pacific as well, that are affected by global food security. There is certainly much more that can be done. MAIN COMMITTEE I also want to link this motion that I have put forward to what I think is a growing problem in Australia. It is about crop diversity and it is about food security even within Australia, because I think these matters are all linked. One of the biggest problems that we have in Australia is type 2 diabetes, which is linked directly to our diet. There is clear evidence that over the past 30 years our diets have shrunk to a very small base and that people’s lifestyle choices and what they eat are getting narrower and narrower. Our diets are now mostly filled with fructose and sucrose, high in fat and high in salt. There is very, very little diversity in all of that, and people’s lifestyles, particularly exercise, have not kept pace. We need to have a close look at what we can do to improve that. It is one of the biggest challenges that this country and the world will face, with type 2 diabetes causing so many problems for our health budgets as well. (Time expired) tion on global food and water security put forward by the member for Oxley. This motion was obviously written before the climate change summit in Copenhagen last year, so I will forgive my colleague for his vain hope that there would be some significant outcome from that talkfest. However, I do acknowledge that the United Nations have on their agenda the issue of global food security. We are very much on the verge of a global food crisis, if we are not already in the midst of it. Last year, rising food prices were the basis of violent riots in Haiti, the Ivory Coast, Cameroon and Senegal. At the moment, global food production cannot meet global demands. This is the challenge that we face: trying to feed an increasing global population so as to avoid riots, which could tragically lead ultimately to war. We are trying to do this in the face of rapidly diminishing arable farming lands. By 2050, most of the world will be urbanised. By 2025, there will be around 30 megacities with populations of more than 10 million each. To feed the population in these megacities and the projected global population of around nine billion people by 2050, food production will have to increase by 70 per cent globally. By 2030, global demand for meat will increase by around 80 per cent. There will be more mouths to feed but fewer farmers to meet the challenge. In Australia it is expected that we will have a population of around 35 million by 2050. Our farmers contribute to feeding over 60 million people a day, so we are not only well placed to feed ourselves but we are also in a position to feed the world. To do this we must ensure that our farmers are given enough support from government, consumers and industry. Yet at the moment farmers across the nation are facing their biggest challenge: encroachment on their land by urbanisation and mining. More than 80 per cent of Queensland’s land is in some way affected by resources exploration, exploitation or excavation. For the past few years farmers have suffered uncertainty in the face of the mining giant, but they have certainly not laid down without a fight and I have been with them in this fight. They have strongly and rightly called for the assurance that the state’s prime agricultural lands will be protected from the threat of urbanisation and mining. I support my colleague when he calls on the House to support policies, projects and programs that deliver long-term solutions for food security as a means of reducing poverty and achieving sustainable development. However, we cannot help others if we do not help ourselves. That is why it is important that we find the right balance between protecting our productive agricultural lands and harnessing our fossil fuel resources. I was pleased to learn that MAIN COMMITTEE",206,Private Members Business
181,Mr Bruce Scott (Maranoa) (8.07 Pm),"I rise tonight to support in principle this morecently the Queensland government has finally listened to the concerns of the state’s producers and our vital food and fibre producers. It has released a policy and planning framework discussion paper on conserving and managing Queensland’s strategic cropping land. This has been a long time coming. I have been calling for progress like this since I organised and hosted a ‘meeting of the minds’ forum between farmers and mining groups almost two years ago in my electorate of Maranoa. Nevertheless, I welcome this paper, as have many of the farming community groups in Queensland, and I will certainly be putting a submission to the strategy. I agree with the paper on the strategic cropping land proposal when it says that they have to ‘protect such land from those developments that would lead to its permanent alienation or diminished productivity’. With only two per cent of Queensland classified as cropping land, I do not think it is a big task to ask the Queensland government to ensure our prime arable lands can continue to provide a vital source of food and fibre for the state, the nation and the world. We protect national parks; we protect the Barrier Reef; it is time that we protected our prime agricultural food resource: arable lands in this country, not just in the state of Queensland. We must also make sure that our governments and our parliament are open to the highly supportive and new technologies which increase our yield, and I read a disturbing newspaper article recently which talked of some of Australia’s top chefs signing to an anti-GM agreement last year. The author rightly pointed out that these chefs are in a privileged position of being able to access some of Australia’s finest organically grown foods, yet across the ocean there are more than a billion undernourished people(Time expired) expired.

(d) The committee shall be assisted by the Clerk, Serjeant at Arms and officers of the Department of the House of Representatives appropriate to any matters under consideration. minute but I just wanted to start by saying that this motion has come about from a serious concern about the growing imbalance between the powers of the executive and the powers of the parliaments, and in particular, in this case, the House of Representatives. I would like to start by thanking my good friend the member for Chisholm and Deputy Speaker for agreeing to second this motion and for showing bipartisan support. In recent years it has become painfully obvious that the parliament itself is struggling with relatively declining resources to carry out its responsibilities to safeguard our great democracy. Democracies depend on oversight by effective parliaments. Parliaments must be independent from the government and must have the resources to scrutinise the government through legislation, spending and policy making. But in our parliament, by any measure, at the same time parliament is feeling the squeeze, the resources available to government have increased, whether it be in the form of extra ministerial staff, increased use of consultants or the growth in the size of ministerial departments. In other words, the power balance between parliament and the executive is tilting heavily towards the executive. In time this risks, I think, the whole future of our democratic processes. How has this come about? This imbalance has been in many ways exacerbated by requirements set out by the Department of Finance and Deregulation to have efficiency dividends across the whole of departments. What happens in practice is that the department of finance demands that all departments have an efficiency dividend of, say, one per cent per annum and, while some megadepartments may well be able to absorb this, there is no doubt that smaller departments like the House of Representatives are finding it increasingly difficult. When you add the fact that in recent years the parliament has had to fund significant extra amounts for security, this has further eaten into the budgets available to run the parliament. It is significant that similar concerns were raised in a recent report by the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts and Audit tabled in 2008 which recommended a commission to recommend funding levels for the parliamentary departments in each budget. I notice that the government has responded recently by ‘noting’ that report, but I feel that is not good enough and it has to be taken further. I might also add that I feel I am in a fairly unique position in putting this motion forward because I will not be contesting the next election but I have had the privilege of having been the Speaker in the 41st Parliament. So, together with the President of the Senate, I am well aware of what is required to run the parliament with the three departments-the House of Representatives, the Senate and the Department of ParliaMAIN COMMITTEE",209,Private Members Business
183,Mr Hawker (Wannon) (8.13 Pm),"I will come back to the details of the motion in amentary Services-recognising that we were operating with a combined budget of around $170 million. It is also significant, I think, that having been fortunate to be a member since 1983 I have seen the changes that have impacted on the parliament in this relative balance between the executive and the parliament. There is no question-no question at all-that the executive have become considerably more powerful at the expense of the parliament. I will just give one example to illustrate this. In the eight years since 2000-01, Treasury’s budget has increased by over 100 per cent to $146 million for operating, while over the same period the budget for the House of Representatives has increased by just 11 per cent to $22 million. Recent governments have also seen ministerial staff and Public Service numbers grow while parliamentary staff have been cut. Likewise, if you look at extra inquiries such as royal commissions organised by governments the costs of those is substantial compared with the excellent work that parliamentary committees can do at significantly less cost. I might add that parliamentary committees do some excellent work, but it is becoming increasingly difficult, given that the budget has been squeezed and resources available to committees have been steadily reduced in real terms. ClearlyI believe greater financial autonomy, together with enhanced management and scrutiny, is a desirable reform for Australia’s parliamentary administration. There is no more important power for a parliament than control over its resources. Since Federation in 1901, the delivery of services to parliament and members of parliament by the immediate parliamentary service and the greater public sector has been shaped historically by administrative convenience rather than fulfilment of an overall design. Reforming funding arrangements to achieve greater financial autonomy for the parliament would give due recognition to the independent status of the Australian parliament under the Constitution. Over recent years the demands on politicians have increased. The number of issues and bills before parliament have consistently risen. The number of bills passed by the House of Representatives rose in the past decade by approximately 20 per cent to total 205 in 2009. The Australian parliament has achieved some improvements in administrative autonomy and strengthening the Parliamentary Service in the past decade. This reform reflects the principle that an independent parliament requires a strong and independent Parliamentary Service. Not only should the administration of a parliament be on a sound and independent footing, but so too should the parliament be assured of financial independence within a sound accountability framework. The experiences of other parliaments with similar constitutional frameworks and parliamentary traditions to Australia demonstrate that greater budgetary and financial freedom do not mean that the executive is ignored. The examples of Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom-and those are obviously the national parliaments with whom Australia has the most in common-indicate that financial autonomy can be achieved effectively with an appropriate body of parliamentarians being responsible for developing the parliamentary budget, while at the same time avoiding any adverse impacts on executive responsibilities. I know that members on both sides of the chamber are becoming increasingly concerned about this whole issue, and that is why I have put forward this motion which, as I said, talks about changing the standing orders so that a House appropriations and administrative committee can be set up. Such a committee could be appointed to look at the estimates for funding MAIN COMMITTEE requirements for the operation of the Department of the House of Representatives. It would then work through the Speaker so that he could present to the House the requirements for transmission to the Department of Finance and Deregulation. Obviously this committee could consider other proposals that might be required on administration and deal with the Speaker on any other matter required. It would also talk about the importance of dealing with the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing, looking at the question of funding for the Department of Parliamentary Services. Such a committee could be set up with, say, nine members: with the Speaker as the chair and eight other members. Clearly, the Clerk, the Serjeant-at-Arms and other officers of the Department of the House of Representatives would be there to assist. We have seen what has been happening over the last few years. It is clear that the time has come for some action. As will be demonstrated, this debate is not a partisan issue. It is something for both sides to take seriously. I believe, as has been stated, that this motion will continued to be debated, and I would certainly encourage members from both sides to become involved, to look at this matter very seriously and to consider what other parliaments, such as Canada or the UK, are doing and the benefits from having that autonomy. I believe that this motion is one first step. It cannot be left to lie on the table. I certainly urge all members to support it, and let us continue its progress and change the whole way the parliament is funded so that we put it on a much more sound basis and redress what I see as that growing imbalance between the executive and the parliament. Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (8.22 pm)-I welcome and second the motion before the House tonight. I think it demonstrates the essence of this motion that an opposition member and a government member are putting forward something on behalf of the parliament. The general public sees question time and thinks that is what parliament is-that it is the ferociousness of two parliamentary parties going at each other. What they fail to see is the parliament: the building that we are standing in, the institution that we all hold near and dear. So much of what we actually do in this place, most particularly through the committee work, is of a bipartisan nature. This motion before us today would continue that solid framework of distinguishing between executive government and parliament. Then there would be a great divide, and there should be, because the parliament is the institution and it will stand. Regardless of elections, regardless of parties, it will be here. But it can only be here if it is appropriately resourced. If those resources are open to greater scrutiny-and I think that the motion before us, instead of taking away scrutiny, actually gives greater scrutiny-a committee will be allowed to be there and that committee can then be reviewed by the media, by external individuals and, most appropriately, by the Auditor-General. In a paper that the member for Wannon presented at the Presiding Officers and Clerks Conference in Perth in July 2006, he concluded: The relationship between the Parliament and the Executive depends on the mutual respect which accompanies the principle of separation of powers within Australia’s constitutional framework. Improving the funding and accountability framework for Parliament, should contribute to enhanced standing of Parliament and its Members. The motion before us is to improve that relationship-to say that the parliament has some destiny over its own funding model. MAIN COMMITTEE There has been a Senate Appropriations and Staffing Committee on the books for some time, and its website states: Standing order 19 provides for the appointment of a Standing Committee on Appropriations and Staffing to inquire into: a. proposals for the annual estimates and the additional estimates for the Senate; b. proposals to vary the staff structure of the Senate, and staffing and recruitment policies; and c. such other matters as are referred to it by the Senate. So there is a committee of this nature that currently operates in the Senate. When this Senate committee was established, it was recommended that the House do the same thing, but sadly, as is the way of these things, we have never adopted such a committee. It would be there as a standing committee to establish the estimates for the House to use. Those of us who have been here long enough would remember that there used to be five parliamentary departments, which then came down to three. If you want a brief history of previous attempts to amalgamate the administration of the Commonwealth, you can go back as far as 1910. That was when the desire to rationalise departments and actually have some structure about how the departments should be funded was first expressed. Then we go to the Great Depression, when the government established an inquiry under the control of an inspector of the Public Service Board. Australia is well serviced by independent statutory authorities such as the Public Service Board and the Auditor-General. These things stand separate from executive government. This committee would stand separate from executive government, saying, ‘This is how we’re establishing the finances of the parliament as an institution in its own right,’ and could not be prorogued by any government of the day. Committees like this, as the member for Wannon indicated, are very common around the world, particularly in countries with parliaments with which we align ourselves and affiliate ourselves most closely, such as the UK. They have a very powerful House of Commons Commission. It is chaired by the Speaker and contains the Leader of the House and other senior members. It operates by consensus. It provides estimates for the House of Commons. The Treasury has no formal control over the estimates. The House of Commons has one budget for costs relating to MPs, one budget for staff and admin costs and a budget it shares with the House of Lords. The commission is established under an act of parliament, and similar independence is accorded to the House of Lords. So in the UK such a system is already in place. In Canada there is the Board of Internal Economy, consisting of the Speaker, two ministers, the Leader of the Opposition or their nominees, and other MPs, with an equal balance between government and non-government members. It is established under an act of parliament. It establishes the annual budget for the House of Commons. It has high-level, ultimate authority in administration. That is what this motion is getting at: there are actually greater levels of administration and greater levels of accountability. This House has a long tradition of formal and informal consultation with members about matters of administration. POITAG, whether or not you like it, has a long tradition of providing for MPs’ and senators’ input on ICT matters in the parliament. We are not devoid of input into administration. The Parliamentary Education Advisory Committee, which is chaired by the Deputy Speaker and has all parties represented, looks at the great work of the Parliamentary Education Office. We have input into that; we have input into their budgetary process. The House committees obviously have a long history as soundMAIN COMMITTEE ing boards and consultation mechanisms on a wide range of matters and of advising the Presiding Officers on a range of things. Indeed, various House committees have actually recommended establishing a committee such as the one in the motion before us tonight. The Joint Standing Committee on the Parliamentary Library, as established under the standing orders, has a long and proud tradition of advising Presiding Officers on the operation of the Parliamentary Library, with input and feedback direct to the library. Again, it is a bipartisan committee. The Liaison Committee of Chairs and Deputy Chairs is again a strictly bipartisan committee. It has informal mechanisms for people to provide information back to the Presiding Officers about how committees work-how the financing of those committees works, how the staffing of those committees works. We need greater accountability, not less. Every time we talk about the staffing and financing of the parliament, the press and individuals are out there saying, ‘Well, it’s pollies’ perks.’ This is actually about saying that we should have greater accountability, greater autonomy and greater recognition of openness in the parliament. We as parliamentarians should be able to say, ‘This is our financing budget,’ not have it imposed by the government of the day. It is about recognising the value of the parliament and the work that the parliament does. I commend the motion to the House. contribution. The time allotted for this debate has now expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Debate resumed from 8 February. That grievances be noted. Home Insulation Program my electorate, particularly how government policy action or inaction has adversely impacted on various groups within my electorate. Often country people do not complain. They put up and endure and try to do their best, but then it gets to the absolutely ridiculous point where they can do nothing but speak out against what has happened. We have seen this over several government programs, but I would like to begin today with the Home Insulation Program. We have heard in the parliament today how the mismanagement and utter incompetence by this government-by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts and by the Prime Minister, who refuses to hold the minister accountable for his actions-has left thousands of Australians unsure about the safety of their own homes. We saw the sudden decision last week to halt the Home Insulation Program, without any industry consultation. This is in spite of at least 20 warnings spread over several months this year and last year. There was no consultation with the industry or any reasonable or well-thought out transitional arrangements. The whole industry has been thrown into complete disarray. Just as hastily as this poorly managed program was put together, the decision was made to halt the program. Halting the program will see thousands of Australians out of work and individual employers and companies losing tens of thousands of dollars, totalling millions of dollars. It will have an impact on not just the insulation industry but the supply industries as well. We will MAIN COMMITTEE",210,Private Members Business

186,Mrs Mirabella (Indi) (8.30 Pm),"I rise this evening to speak on issues of concern toprobably, sadly, see significant levels of debt default by those servicing this program as well. All this is happening against the background of thousands of homes remaining unchecked and homeowners remaining unsafe in their own homes. I have had many constituents contact me about their concerns, about being safe in their own home and about being approached by dodgy operators. The latest casualties are these businesses. I received an email only yesterday from a hard working small business man in my electorate who geared up to service local people under this program. I will read just a select extract from the email. It states: Can Peter Garrett tell me what to do with my staff (4) that will probably have to be put off. I spent $1,500 in retraining them all last Monday/Tuesday for the latest changes to the system … This program was supposed to last until December this year. We have $12,000 of stock, two extra vehicles, two trailers, equipment … The government still owes me over $8,000 in top-up payments for work completed in October, $6,000 in manual claims for work completed in December-January plus any other claims we have made and now I am told I will have to wait 6 weeks for anything I have not claimed because they shut the claims website down with no notice and sent emails telling everyone they had until Friday to manual claim or they will not get paid. My BAS will be due next Friday and, because I will not be able to pay, the government will charge me 14% interest. DoI get 14% off them for what they owe us? And there are hundreds of operators like that, I am sure, right around the country. I wanted to read those words because they are from a real person in the real world, not on some foreign planet of unaccountability and unreality with heads stuck in the sand. This is from the real world of people who have taken risks to run a business and to employ local people in rural and regional Victoria. Until the Prime Minister actually understands the human and economic scale of this mismanaged program, the more people will suffer. Until he appreciates the responsibility he has as Prime Minister to hold his minister accountable and to provide some answers and some solutions, not a political quick-fix to fix the disaster that was months in the making, then local people will continue to suffer economically as well as in other ways. In what other ways are small businesses suffering in my electorate? They are suffering through the government’s new industrial relations laws that were supposed to simplify everything. They were supposed to make it easier for employers and employees to understand where they stood. But it has had the opposite effect in my electorate. There is an example where local people in my electorate, both the employer and the employee, have been left worse off under the new legislation, and it is the case of the Bright newsagency. Mr Brian King from the Bright Newsagency spoke with my office this afternoon to explain his particular problem and frustration at the employment restrictions that have been imposed on him and his business as a result of Labor’s misnamed Fair Work Act. Brian employs a number of school-age children who work for him, obviously after school, for a couple of hours during the week. He has had to tell these employees that he can no longer offer them work after school. In the country we try to instil the work ethic in our young people, whether it is working after school, on weekends, helping out on the farm, or helping out in the family business. All of a sudden these young people are confronted with the reality that they have lost their job. It is not because they have done it badly, not because they have done it unsafely, not because they MAIN COMMITTEE have done something illegal in the workplace, but because the government has decided that those sorts of arrangements do not suit them. They do not have the flexibility and the link into real workplaces, into small business, to understand how small-business operates and the needs of local communities, small regional communities, and their particular employment needs. So we see the government enacting legislation, removing the ability from the smallbusiness owner to make decisions about his business, imposing legislation on this particular employer, making it difficult for him not only to employ local people and local young people but making the best arrangements for his business. This is at a time when the federal government is telling young people that they have to work longer and earn more if they are to qualify for the independent rate of youth allowance. It makes it absolutely impossible for employers to maximise their flexibility particularly in the country. So the result of this is that a lot of young people will not be able to do after-school work. Obviously this has left these young people and their parents very upset and with a sour taste in their mouths and a lot of local businesses uncertain about their capacity to offer employment. But where else do we see uncertainty in the workplace? We see it in the recent decision by the industrial tribunal to order the reinstatement of a sacked worker from an employer just across the border in New South Wales, from Norske Skog, ordering the payment of $16,000 of compensation. This has left many local businesses absolutely dumbfounded. What we have here is a decision that has created a very dangerous precedent. The decision by the industrial tribunal to overturn the sacking and to pay compensation was not based on the facts or circumstances of the workplace; it was based on the personal circumstances of the employee and had nothing to do with events that took place at the employer’s worksite. From this sort of judgement businesses are now expected to know the private and intimate details their employees including what mortgage they have and what level of education they have. These were factors cited by the tribunal, and the fact that the employee breached workplace OH&S regulations on several occasions was overridden. What kind of message does the government send out with this sort of decision? If you do not go to school, if you have a large mortgage, and if you do not act responsibly, you will not be subject to workplace rules. That is not good enough. We need certainty for employees and employers in the workplace. (Time expired) Stimulus Package the record my appreciation for the efforts of the Rudd Labor government in its achievements in the last two years that have had a real and direct benefit to the people of Brisbane and in my electorate. Throughout the nation we have seen a massive program of investment in our schools, particularly our primary schools. I think it has been the largest single investment in primary school education in living memory, and it is long overdue. Primary education was always the poor cousin when it came to educational resourcing. That has been a problem for many, many decades. Within my electorate, as within other electorates around the country, virtually every primary school now has a project. Many of them are well advanced and all of them are under way. At Windsor State School work is well advanced on three new classrooms and on a new assembly hall. The new assembly hall at Petrie Terrace State School is virtually finished and nearly ready to open. I know that, for a lot of these schools, the local parents, communities MAIN COMMITTEE",214,Grievance Debate
187,Mr Bevis (Brisbane) (8.40 Pm),"I want to take the opportunity in this debate to place onand teachers involved have actually spent many, many years in the planning of these activities, hoping that one day they would be able to raise the funds, but always the targets seemed to move further away from them. I am reminded of the situation at Newmarket State School where, not just for years but for decades, the goal of the parent body had been to build a good quality assembly hall. Although they had been toiling away in their efforts for that over decades, it was not until this government was elected that they found the financial support and can now embark upon that project. Other schools, like New Farm State School, which is a very small geographical site in an inner city area, have managed to get a purpose built facility. Like a number of schools in my electorate, because this government understood that it was important for local schools, parents and teachers to be involved in the decision making, they actually have a purpose designed facility that acknowledges the unique nature of the site, which is going to provide a wonderful resource for the school and for the community for many, many years to come. As with a number of these projects involving assembly halls they will involve a lot of community groups in the use of those facilities. It is a pity although a fact that the opposition voted against the funding of all of these buildings, I think from memory, on five separate occasions. It is even more alarming when you consider that this funding was part of a stimulus package adopted by the Rudd government to combat the global financial crisis. When you look at the comments of the Leader of the Opposition of less than two weeks ago in this parliament you can understand how some on the other side got it so wrong. Less than two weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition said that, instead of adopting the policies that have seen Australia as the only advanced economy escape the recession, we should have adopted the approach that New Zealand had taken. That is an interesting example to look at because, in New Zealand, they went into recession for five successive quarters. Even now their economy is between two and a half and three per cent smaller than it was before the global financial crisis began. It may have escaped the Leader of the Opposition’s attention here in Australia but New Zealand actually went into serious decline during the global financial crisis because of a range of factors. The amazing thing about this is that the comparison with Australia has not escaped the consideration of the Prime Minister of New Zealand. The Prime Minister of New Zealand has actually acknowledged the fact that Australia has done exceedingly well and recently said that he hoped that they would be able to catch up to Australia economically by 2025. Yet here we have the Australian Leader of the Opposition, the person who would be Prime Minister of Australia, arguing that we should have followed the prescriptions that led to that outcome in New Zealand. The development of educational facilities in Brisbane as part of the Rudd government’s program has not been limited to primary schools. I have had the pleasure of visiting the Aviation High School at Hendra, which is about to officially open its new trades training centreone of a number of trades training centres that the government has funded. That is a unique facility, as the name suggests. It is a school that is tailored to the aviation industry. It works very closely with the aviation industry in the development of programs across a wide range of skill sets that are needed within that industry. They now have a state-of-the-art trades training centre courtesy of this federal government’s commitments. MAIN COMMITTEE A number of important infrastructure programs that have been part of the government’s stimulus package also deal with the social agenda and needs of Australians in less well-off positions. I refer particularly to the investment this government is making in social housing, some of which was part of that stimulus package. At the end of last year I visited the construction site at Newstead where 95 new apartments are being built by the Brisbane Housing Company. The Rudd government is providing $6.2 million towards this project and it is going to substantially boost affordable housing in an inner city area that greatly needs that assistance. I am happy to say I was there along with the Minister for Housing Tanya Plibersek and the Treasurer Wayne Swan, and local state member Grace Grace. There is a commitment from the Queensland Labor government as well to these projects. I have also had the pleasure of visiting the Defence Housing estates that have been built as part of the ongoing activity but, also, as part of the stimulus package. There are some 101 new defence dwellings as part of the new stimulus package that are being built in and around Brisbane. In fact, they were amongst the very first new projects that were up and running after the stimulus package was announced. I do not think anyone in this parliament would object to or deny the importance of providing quality housing for our defence families. Yet, amazingly, as I have said in this parliament on a number of occasions, whilst those opposite say they support these measures they actually voted against them. It will be interesting later this year in fact to have a look at some of the electorate newsletters of those who sit on the opposition benches to see how many want to claim credit for local school buildings which they voted against, or the defence housing project that they voted against but which, nonetheless, is going ahead. Just last Friday, I also had the pleasure of attending the launch of an Australia-wide rollout of a program to assist young children, teachers and parents to navigate the internet in safety. The program is called ThinkUKnow and it was launched by the Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O’Connor and also by the Australian Federal Police Commissioner Tony Negus. By pure coincidence, and I have to confess it is pure coincidence-I would like to claim credit for it but I cannot-the launch took place at Ithaca Creek State School in my electorate, which is important not simply because it is in my electorate but it happens to be my old primary school. SoI am a regular visitor to the school, as you might imagine. The parents there were really excited to know that their school was the first school to be involved in this national rollout that is intended to make sure that at home and at school children have a better understanding of things to be cautious of, aware of, on the internet, to avoid the potential dangers of threats that are out there. As police commissioner Tony Negus reminded us, in the last year alone the AFP charged more than 100 Australians for use of the internet in improper ways targeting young children. That was just the AFP jurisdiction; it does not take account of all of the states. This is a problem and the government has adopted a number of strategies to deal with it, but I am particularly pleased that this educative program is rolling out with the cooperation and strong support of the private sector, in particular, Microsoft and Microsoft MSN. The people of Brisbane have also benefited through the support that this government has provided to welfare groups. The Red Hill Paddington Community Centre-now known as Communify-received $1.2 million to assist in the provision of services for mental health. That is an important area too often neglected. Just last week, the Open Doors Youth Service in Fortitude Valley received $230,900 for their program to help combat binge drinking. Binge MAIN COMMITTEE drinking, sadly, is an issue throughout Australia and I am very pleased that the Open Doors Youth Service has received funding to enable them to address that with local clubs and communities, particularly in the Fortitude Valley and surrounding suburbs. This is but a very brief account of a number of initiatives that this government has taken in the last two years and the real benefit it has provided to the people of Brisbane. Sewage Treatment your time, in 1990 the member for Brisbane, who has just spoken, came into this House with me. During my maiden speech I mentioned that I was a product of sewage. It was suggested to me by the member at the time that I would fit into the parliament pretty well if that were the case. There are few of us left from 1990 but, importantly, waste water was something that was part of my considerations going right back to 1990. It was only 10 years ago in one of my stints out of this House that I decided that my fatherin-law, who so loved game fishing off Bermagui-which he had done in his younger days for many years with his friend, Trevor Hardy, who had passed on-that along with my two brothers-in-law, Chris and Rod, we decided to take him back to Bermagui and just have four or five days there. For those who have been to Bermagui, it is a magnificent spot and is beauty personified. The waters are rich with fish and there are great people there. We went back and did the reminiscing tour. We had a lot of fun in the pub that night. A lady named Colleen served us at the table and in conversation with her she said that her husband, Daryl, was in the bar and would love somebody to go fishing with him the next day. We thought that we would probably not feel too good the next day but would go fishing with Daryl. Those of us who could make it went fishing with Daryl the next day. As we went out of the gap out of Bermagui and then further out into the ocean and further and further out until the GPS stopped where we were going to fish, I looked around and we were surrounded by slimy, greenie, sludgy, mucky stuff. I asked Daryl: ‘What’s this? We are out here in the pristine ocean. What is this all about?’ He said: ‘That’s Sydney sewage.’ I said: ‘Are you telling me in your beautiful boat that we are fishing in Sydney sewage?’ He said: ‘Yeh, that’s Sydney sewage that comes out and then comes back in towards Bermagui with the currents.’ I have always dreamed that ocean outfalls would be ended once I entered the parliament in 1990 as it would be a matter of just making a decision with the ministers of the day, whoever they were, and that Bob Hawke or Paul Keating would come on side immediately and say, ‘Here’s the money.’ Time has moved on since then and we still have ocean outfalls and we are still doing nothing about it and this 2010. I think enough is enough. I think the time has come when this nation is old enough, wealthy enough and prepared enough to end ocean outfalls across this country. AmI asking too much? I do not think so. In the process of recycling water I have always seen the ocean outfalls as capturing a resource, not getting rid of our rubbish. It is estimated that 450 million litres a day are poured into the ocean at Gunnamatta in Victoria alone, not to mention the scale across the rest of the nation. There are recycling schemes that you as a Victorian, Madam Deputy Speaker, would know where class A recycled water is used in vegetable growing market gardens. However, more can be achieved. While I was on the Pakenham Sewerage Authority, we were one of the MAIN COMMITTEE",216,Grievance Debate
188,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (8.50 Pm),"Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, long beforefirst to supply water to a turf farm nearby that is still being supplied today. So, I was one of the early recyclers. When I was on the Mornington Peninsula Water Board it was the same. There are 21 million people in Australia so we assume that at least 15 million of these people discharge their sewage into the ocean. The average amount of waste water per day per person is approximately 200 litres. That is all waste out of the house not just sewage waste. Therefore we have 3,000 million litres of waste water per day running into the ocean and the required cost of treating and distributing three billion litres of water per day. The Carrum treatment plant, as you would know, Madam Deputy Speaker Burke, is about to be upgraded to class A standard, at a cost which will reach $500 million. That means 400 million litres of water per day will be treated to class A standard for a capital cost of $500 million. The existing class A recycled water plant at Carrum treats approximately 15 million litres per day. The cost to construct the plant was $30 million, and then there was 60 kilometres of pipeline. This is a capital cost of $2 per litre of water for treatment and distribution. Do not hold me to these figures, because they were given to me by a water engineer friend, and they are general. Therefore, the provision of three billion litres of water per day would cost $6 billion in capital works to construct treatment plants and distribution networks, plus piping, across the nation. There would also be the additional costs of operating the treatment plants and the distribution networks. A very approximate figure for that would be $300 million per year, or $60 million a week. It would change this nation from a net polluter of our oceans to a net receiver of a resource. Singapore was able to achieve this in 2½ years, because there was presidential will right down the line. Not only is there the issue of recycled water; there is also the issue of capturing storm water wherever possible in our cities, which I have not even gone into today. I have also not talked about what is really important to me, which is that we have made a mistake in refusing to develop north Australia and the water resources that are available to us there. One day I will be in this place when Gary Gray will do a complete turnaround and look to the north for that resource-but I will go into that at another time. Singapore ceased being a net importer of water in 2½ years. Up until that time, Singapore’s bilateral negotiations with Malaysia were over water. There is now no mention of water in their negotiations, because they had a direct will to change that. The plan that I put before the parliament tonight is one which says: ‘Can we stop pouring dirty rotten sewage into our oceans? We can clean up the oceans around this country. We can make a decision to reuse that water at a cost of $6 billion to begin with.’ How many times have we heard governments in this place say, ‘We’re throwing $10 billion at that and $20 billion at this, and this is what it will cost’? Why can’t we as a nation have a capital works program like the Snowy River scheme? Why can’t we have a program that captures the vision of every family and every child in every school in Australia that says: ‘We believe that we are able to do this as a nation and, as a nation, we are not going to pollute the waters off our shores. We are not going to have fishing fields with rotten sludge across the top of the water that stinks. We are going to reuse the capacity of the ocean outfalls not only for fertiliser but also for fresh water-water that can regenerate our streams. We can have that water as a resource.’ It is not too much to ask to end ocean outfalls in Australia. I actually believe that one day, before I leave this place, Sydney town will, for the first time in 222 years, not pollute the waMAIN COMMITTEE ters outside Sydney and that Melbourne will not have ocean outfalls pouring pollution into the sea. We will be a country that leads the world in water reuse. Wouldn’t it be fantastic if, like Singapore, we were able to say, ‘No, we as a nation have decided that we are not going to pollute our oceans’? We have said to tourist cruise ships: ‘Don’t throw your rubbish into the ocean, as you’ve been doing for years. Bring it back to shore and we’ll process it onshore.’ Why can’t we say to the whole nation: ‘We’re not going to have ocean outfalls. We’re going to reuse that water. This is Australia. Water is important to us. And each city can be selfsufficient with the water that pours onto it by reusing the storm water-just the storm water. Each city can be independent without ocean outfalls’? The ocean outfalls could be used every day to reinvigorate the parks and the gardens that have been destroyed by the last 12 years of drought. Is it wrong to have a vision for what the nation can be? We fight over plans and purposes that might go right or wrong for a government. Why can’t we have a vision for Australia that is greater than one, two or three parliaments? It is $600 million dollars a year for 10 years. (Time expired) Foreign Aid face our global community and reflect on the efforts of both the Rudd government and members of my electorate of Lowe, who work towards positive solutions for a sustainable and prosperous future. In stark contrast, I would like to raise my alarm at the recent comments made by the opposition finance minister, Senator Barnaby Joyce, who questioned the value of Australia’s foreign aid. The chief political correspondent with the Sydney Morning Herald, Phillip Coorey, said that the opposition finance minister ‘advanced an argument for paring back aid levels to pay off debt and fund Coalition election promises’. In a report by the Age’s chief political correspondent, Michelle Grattan, the Executive Director of Oxfam Australia, Andrew Hewett, is reported as saying: Senator Joyce’s comments were worrying and disappointing. Meanwhile, Tim Costello, the Chief Executive Officer of World Vision, was quoted as saying: It’s not just right, it’s in our self interest … I would say to Senator Joyce that it was this region that helped keep us out of recession during the global financial crisis by buying our [commodities]. Many of my constituents in Lowe have worked tirelessly to assist those less fortunate both in our local community and through international aid programs. They are supportive of the Rudd government’s foreign aid initiatives. This evening, my friend and colleague the member for Oxley also his raised concern about global food and water security through a private member’s motion. The member for Oxley moved a motion noting that global food prices have risen 83 per cent since 2005 and foreign aid to agriculture fell from 18 per cent of total aid 30 thirty years ago to 3.5 per cent in 2004. He also noted that Australia has recently suffered some of the worse droughts on record, increasing water scarcity and affecting our local crops and produce. Further, the member for Oxley moved that the House: (2) supports: (a) positive initiatives by the current Government to address climate change; (b) policies, projects and programs that deliver long term solutions for water security; and MAIN COMMITTEE",219,Grievance Debate
189,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (9.00 Pm),"This evening I speak about the social challenges that(c) the Government’s commitment to tackle the impact of rising food prices and shortages by addressing the root causes of global food security. I support the motion and commend the member for Oxley for raising this very important issue tonight. While the opposition finance minister looks to take an axe to our foreign aid budget, the Rudd government remains focused on the challenges at hand, implementing programs and initiatives that endeavour to improve and secure living standards for our less fortunate neighbours. While the opposition looks to use the topic of foreign aid as a political football, the clock is ticking for governments around the world to meet the 2015 deadline for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. Many of my constituents support those goals. With a number of ambitious yet achievable objects, world leaders have committed themselves to halving the scourge of poverty by 2015. Whilst much has been achieved since the Millennium Development Goals were announced in 2000, the global community is currently faced with three great crises that threaten not only to reverse our achievements thus far but also to increase the number of men, women and children who are trapped by poverty. We have just experienced the worse global recession since the Great Depression, we are faced with the existential threat posed by climate change and we are currently experiencing a global food crisis which has resulted in global food prices increasing by 83 per cent since 2005. The potentially destructive impacts posed by these crises may seem overwhelming; however, we cannot allow ourselves to lose sight of the commitment that leaders around the world made in 2000. If anything, the times in which we live should make us more determined, more committed and more focused to achieve these important goals. The challenges we face make it easy to believe that there is nothing we can do to address starvation and the broader issue of poverty in the developing world. This misguided sense of futility is not worthy of this government. Indeed, it is not worthy of any member of this parliament. We can and must work as members of the international community to bring an end to the global food crisis. If action is not taken, food prices will continue to rise. Families in Bangladesh are already spending half a day’s pay on a small bag of rice. Whilst Australians are fortunate not to live in poverty of the kind that is experienced by families in Bangladesh, we too have observed an increase in food prices as a result of a long and protracted drought. Given that the world’s population is expected to grow from 6.2 billion today to 9.5 billion by 2050 and global demand for food is predicted to double by 2030, it is imperative that our attention is focused on food and water shortages and that they are urgently addressed. Therefore, addressing the global food crisis requires international action on climate change, and I refer to a recent report from the Edmund Rice Centre for Justice and Community Education in my electorate of Lowe, which is a small non-government organisation: Droughts and floods are affecting harvests. Destruction of crops from natural disasters in Bangladesh and Burma, and severe drought in Australia, has reduced food supply … Worldwide, an area of fertile soil the size of Ukraine is lost every year because of drought, deforestation and climate instability. It is very clear from the Edmund Rice Centre’s report that climate change and the global food crisis are interrelated challenges that require interrelated responses. We also cannot ignore the role of the global financial crisis. The world’s poorest have been the most affected by the global financial crisis, a crisis which has merely exacerbated the MAIN COMMITTEE problems caused by the food crisis. Whilst developed economies such as Australia have acted swiftly to stimulate their economies, the same cannot be said of developing countries that simply do not have the financial capacity to do so. For this reason, developed economies such as Australia should continue to provide resources for local communities in developing economies to develop programs and infrastructure that simultaneously stimulate local economies and provide some improvement in the food crisis. I note that the work of the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, which sends agriculture experts to developing nations such as East Timor, where they help to establish programs, will enable local communities to feed their own populations. We must also continue to tear down destructive trade barriers such as farm subsidies, which disproportionately favour rich countries over those most in need. I am delighted that our trade minister, the Hon. Simon Crean, continues to play a very major role here and internationally in working relentlessly and tirelessly to help bring about a global trade agreement as part of the Doha cal Lamy, who paid a magnificent tribute to Mr Crean by telling those gathered that ‘If there were 153 Australias, the Doha Round would have been completed in 18 months. Well done, Simon.’ We have now passed the halfway mark to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. These challenges posed by the global food crisis and global warming should not distract us in our efforts to halve world poverty by 2015. These challenges provide us with the perfect opportunity to take action and achieve the change we need to meet this ambitious yet vitally important goal. Many constituents in my electorate have raised this matter with me and the issue of global aid more broadly. Last year, I met with representatives from the Micah Challenge as part of the 2009 Voices for Justice gathering held here in Canberra. The representatives presented me with over 100 letters calling for greater federal government assistance to developing countries through our foreign aid program. The facts they presented are alarming. According to the World Bank, almost 1.4 billion people live in extreme poverty. The World Health Organisation estimates that each year 9.7 million children die before reaching the age of five. It is also estimated that, as a consequence of the global financial crisis, 400,000 more infants will die each year between now and 2015. The gap between the developed and the developing world is far too great when it comes to quality-of-life indicators. Imagine if we were born in a developing nation where infant mortality rates are high, where health and education systems struggle to provide even the most basic of services and where people are forced to live on US$1 a day. It is easy to think that because poverty has always existed there is little that we can do to address this alarming situation. It is easy to think that because the problems in other countries have no bearing on Australia we should not worry about them. However, as Mr Tim Costello pointed out, it is not only the right thing to do, it would also benefit our nation to ensure our neighbours are prosperous too. The disadvantage, poverty and suffering experienced by far too many people in far too many countries cannot be ignored. Developed countries and, more specifically, the leaders of developed countries have an obligation to implement measures to address global poverty. We have an obligation to make poverty history. One practical way in which the federal government can do this is through foreign aid. The Rudd government remains committed to an aid target of 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2015.

I Recently Attended A Meeting With The Head Of The Wto, Mr Pas","tries less fortunate than Australia, I hope the opposition does not change its position on supporting aid for those countries. (Time expired) Home Insulation Program Green Loans Program Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (9.10 pm)-I wish to address my remarks to one of the most costly and incompetently handled programs it has been my misfortune to witnesses since becoming a member of parliament. I refer of course to the ill fated, maladministered, poorly thought out ‘splash of green cash’ policy of providing funding for roof insulation and the associated Green Loans Program. Talk about a reverse Midas! The Prime Minister and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts have turned an idea into a fiasco of astronomical proportions, including the appalling tragedy of four deaths and nearly 100 house fires. And the biggest tragedy of all is that it need not have happened. The Rudd Labor government was warned time and time again about the pitfalls and dangers of the scheme. Probably the most incredible aspect of the warnings was how accurate they were. The Australian newspaper outlined what was contained in the Minter Ellison report delivered to the government 10 months ago. The risk assessment report warned of house fires and property damage by dodgy installers, substandard batts and a department ill-equipped to roll out such a massive program. It also warned that lax controls could lead to fraud and criminal behaviour, inflated charges and ineligible people accessing the program. This assessment was incredibly accurate, and anyone reading it would have seen that there would be real problems if the program were not properly and professionally implemented. My office was contacted a couple of weeks ago by the owner of a medium-sized business in my electorate which was installing solar panels. Instead of the promised four-week payment time, some of his accounts have been outstanding for 10 to 12 weeks. He is owed about $3 million and he is struggling to remain in business. He says that since before Christmas his assessors have been unable to efficiently book assessments onto the Green Loans calendar. The manager tried ringing the Green Loans office, only to be cut off after sitting on hold for an hour. Due to the hold-up he was unable to assess the validity of the assessments and pay his assessors, who are now unable to work as they are not getting paid. As 90 per cent of all assessments are not in the Green Loans calendar, he is unable to invoice the government, creating serious financial problems for the company. Here is a businessman providing a valuable service and employing 15 staff who is being let down at every turn by the incompetent, arrogant and uncaring Rudd Labor government. We also spoke about a constituent, Ray Walter, and his wife who have a disabled son. They thought it would be a good idea to apply for a green loan to get solar panels on the roof. Their house was duly assessed last October but they have heard nothing since. They had to cancel the installation contract once because the assessment report had not been received, and it looked as if they were going to have to do it again. But fortunately my office, with assistance from a ministerial staff member, was able to get the ball rolling, and a report arrived in my office by email a day or two before the installation was due to take place. So who is responsible for this massive meltdown and what should be done? Belatedly, the minister has taken action, but even that has had detrimental consequences for the industry that the minister and the Prime Minister were gleefully using to promote their own green credenMAIN COMMITTEE tials. The only reason this action was taken is that the government is under pressure and being made to look bad. Never mind the devastation for working families who have lost homes or loved ones. Never mind the financial ruin companies face because of this scandal. The only trigger for something being done is that the government is looking bad. So, in all this sorry mess, who is ultimately to be held responsible? There are already reports that various department heads will come under intense scrutiny and must shoulder some of the blame. I believe that should only be the case if they made no attempt to warn the government that there were problems with the scheme. However, if these officers did convey concerns, or perhaps did not because they were worried about repercussions, then they should not be too severely dealt with. The scrutiny needs to go much higher. So is the minister ultimately responsible or was he just basically doing what he was told? The Sydney Morning Herald was talking about ‘Rudd’s insulation plan’ in February last year. Interestingly, even in a pretty supportive article, we see the caveat by a businessman in the industry that a massive expansion would lead to a flood of inexperienced operators who would rip consumers off by providing shoddy services. So the question is: who should resign, given the terrible consequences of this government’s actions or, should I say, inaction? I found the answer in the Hansard of 7 December 2006. A Labor member of parliament was criticising the then Prime Minister over refusing to accept responsibility for his government’s actions. Here are some of the things that this member had to say: Our alternative vision is for an Australia in which we have a strong economy based on market principles but also a fair go for all Australian families … He explained that this will happen because the Labor Party has: … a different vision … which will make their lives more liveable on the ground. The similarity between then and now is brought into sharp relief as this member continued: But this debate is also about a new style of leadership … it is the vehicle through which long-term change can in fact be thwarted in substitution for short-term political expediency … one increasingly characterised by short-term political survival. That, at the end of the day, is what this Prime Minister has become a past master of. This Prime Minister is a clever politician. His talents, skills and abilities are so focused on the arts and crafts of immediate political survival that he has lost sight of the nation’s long-term needs, the nation’s long-term prosperity, the nation’s long-term sustainable security and the long-term fairness which is available to all Australian families … 95 per cent of this Prime Minister’s energy and time is spent on the art and craft of; ‘How do I get through to nine o’clock tomorrow morning?’ … But I have a message for him: the Australian people are starting to see through this. They are becoming very tired indeed of the politics of the short term-the politics of short-term expediency and opportunism. That brings us to the matter of public importance before us today: the style of leadership that either accepts responsibility or instead always blames somebody else. You either accept responsibility or you take that course of action in which you play the blame game. These words make it perfectly clear what the member was saying, that he supported a Prime Minister taking responsibility: ‘The buck stops with me,’ et cetera. He expressed quite unambiguous repugnance for leaders who seek to blame others for what is essentially their own actions. To quote him again: MAIN COMMITTEE The hallmark of this Prime Minister’s occupancy of the most important political office in the country is always that it is someone else’s fault, never his. This member then asked the then Prime Minister: Prime Minister, why do you always take the credit for the good news in this country and why do you never take any responsibility for the bad news in this country? He went on to say: But when it comes to things that go radically wrong … and things that go radically wrong over which this government has absolute control … what is his answer to them? ‘Don’t look at me; I’m just the Prime Minister.’ That is his answer: ‘Don’t look at me; I’m just the guy in charge of the country. Don’t look at me. I have tens of thousands of public servants working for me. How could I ultimately be responsible for anything that goes wrong in this country?’ This member concluded: … the Australian people are starting to see through this. They… want a new style of leadership which says, ‘I’ve got the guts to say, ‘The buck stops with me.”‘ You may, or may not, be surprised to learn that the Labor member espousing these fine words and high ideals was none other than our current Prime Minister. The really big question now is: who in this Rudd Labor government does indeed have the guts to say, ‘The buck stops with me’? Farming Sector Reform in today’s Australian Financial Review by Alan Mitchell entitled ‘Farming sector thirsts for reform’. Actually, it is more of a pat on the back to Mr Mitchell for raising this issue. He starts the article by commenting on the National Farmers Federation dig at the federal government’s promised reform of drought assistance and then goes on to tell us: The reform of drought relief is important, not just for farmers but for the wider economywhich is very true. I am in the process of putting to bed a committee report on the issue of agriculture and climate change, and I can assure you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that the community, from which we have had many views, also feels that there is a need for reforms on how the farming sector should be assisted. Australia has faced some enormous changes in the last few years, and not all of them are down to climate change. But they have implications for change to productivity through technology, the influence of the marketplace on the types of crops grown and the overarching role of the WTO in regulating some of the trade excesses or unevenness in the market. Mitchell, in his article, states: It takes 80 per cent of Australian broadacre farms to produce just 36 per cent of the sector’s total output. He then suggests: The other 20 per cent of farms produce almost two-thirds of the output. He goes on to say that the bigger farms are better protected against drought because, as the bigger of all industries are able to, they can measure their risks, and they can use sophisticated tools for financial planning by diversifying their enterprise mix and/or landholdings with efficient stocking and improvements to their natural resource base. They can weather some of the extremes, whereas the smaller farmers may get through some of what nature throws at them MAIN COMMITTEE",223,Grievance Debate
191,Mr Adams (Lyons) (9.20 Pm),"I wish to take up a grievance I have regarding an articlebut are less able to deal with extremes delivered over time. They are obviously less able to remain productive as they do not have the flexibility of the big guys. They have neither the financial reserves nor the technology to shift direction, even if they are aware that they have to. I am very much aware, after moving around the country, that change in the sector is hard because we still have grandfathers and fathers sitting at their tables with sons who are trying to encourage and manage change. It is a nice thought but it severely strains the ability of the younger generation to put change in place, and we have never done generational change in rural Australia very well. So it is no surprise, as Mitchell states in his article: The Productivity Commission last year concluded that that the present drought assistance programs do not help farmers improve their self-reliance, preparedness and climate change management. In fact, some of them do the opposite. They can be ineffective and can encourage poor management practices, allowing inefficient farmers to remain on the land when perhaps, with a different sort of encouragement, there exit could be facilitated and managed socially while a review of the land potential can be undertaken. This review, by its very nature, should take into account the history of farming in this country. It has been our economic backbone and it has been a hedge in times of hardship; but, like everything else, it needs to reflect the changes that are going on in the rest of the world. If this government can help manage this change while being also very aware of the social implications, it can take those rural communities with it-and I believe we can. By listening and reacting to their problems, hearing their ideas, innovations and very real solutions, I believe the fundamental change that is needed can occur. I only have to read the Tasmanian Country each week, where they expound the virtues of new crops being trialled-such as Uplands Spanish cocksfoot, which from the article appears to be a complementary ground cover with clover-or the commencement of the use of GPS units to maintain a controlled traffic environment that minimises unnecessary traffic movements on the farm. This allows farmers to plan for their property’s unique needs using yield maps to see management techniques can be improved. This shows that people in the rural sector are interested in change and what other people are doing-otherwise, the Tasmanian Country would not sell-and there is a need for a constant feed of information into the farming community, not just from the newspaper but also from other sources such as the website efarming.com.au and of course the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association website, to name a couple. Schools can play a role too. There are a number of farm schools in my electorate, including Hagley, Cressy and Sheffield, which are already using new farming techniques and learning how to drought proof. There are other schools and community groups developing kitchen gardens, where students are encouraged to grow their own food, harvest, prepare, cook and, finally, eat it. Everybody learns nutritional values and how to grow food, in a very historical way for our country. This leads to a greater understanding of where food comes from and how it is part of our lives. I believe it would be useful if many of the city schools did something like this as well. It would mean that their students would get some idea of the stresses and strains for those in the rural sector in making sure they get their ‘daily bread’ and milk. Milk does not just get into a carton by itself, and wheat has to be grown and baked into bread somewhere before it gets to a supermarket. Chips do not just come out a packet. We could MAIN COMMITTEE apply the same idea to our clothes. Understanding how fabric is made and how clothing is designed and produced might lead our students to look for a career in design or fabric manufacturing, or even in the production of high-quality clothes. As Alan Mitchell noted, the blueprint for change can come from this government, which has more chance of doing so than the previous government, which, Mitchell said, ‘needed to prop up the Nationals by keeping people in rural electorates, and by guarding against populist independents’. Labor members in rural electorates have an opportunity to seek community endorsement and approval of the many new ideas and directions, and I hope the various reports and inquiries that are currently under way will allow them to take the findings and raise them in their communities. We cannot do it without the assistance of local communities, who put so much effort into coming up with new ideas and also into helping to ease the distress of farmers who are not coping with change, not able to make decisions and not able to easily ask for help. Together we can go forward and make sure that there is a place in the world market for our Australian farm produce, our technology and our skills to ensure that, whatever happens with the climate or the economy, we have the tools and people to deal with it. It is not as though our variable climate is particularly new. I have just been hearing about a book called Droughts, Floods and Cyclones: El ninos that shaped our colonial past. It was written by Associate Professor Don Garden and put out by Australian Scholarly Publishing in 2009. So today I wish to encourage everyone to take up change. I want to encourage all those who are busily working, researching and developing new models, and all those engaged in other rural activities to share the knowledge they have gleaned and what direction they think we should go in.

The time for the grievance debateAustralian Federal Police (Question No. 1128) Mr Wood asked the Minister for Home Affairs, in writing, on 25 November 2009: (1) How many Australian Federal Police (AFP) officers (a) are working on irregular maritime arrivals (i) directly, or (ii) indirectly; and (b) have been diverted from (i) domestic, or (ii) international, duties to focus on irregular maritime arrivals. (2) How has the AFP budget been increased to deal with asylum seekers, and from where has this funding been appropriated. Mr Brendan O’Connor-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) (a) As at 25 November 2009, there were 89 Australian Federal Police (AFP) officers working on people smuggling, including the investigation of irregular maritime arrivals. (i) 17 AFP officers were working directly on irregular maritime arrivals. (ii) 72 AFP officers were working indirectly on irregular maritime arrivals. (b) The AFP has a flexible workforce and routinely moves resources around the organisation to address emerging crime types.

This funding is comprised of the following five New Policy Initiatives (NPIs) which were approved by Cabinet for AFP People Smuggling measures within the region: (a) Development of Regional Law Enforcement Capacity-$4 million over four years. (b) Enhancing Australia’s approach to People Smuggling-$2.6 million over four years. (c) Enhancing AFP Capability to Combat People Smuggling-$10.4 million over four years.

(2) From1 July 2008 to 30 June 2009: (a) how many and what percentage of small businesses claimed interest charges from the Minister’s department on accounts not paid within 30 days; and (b) what was the total cost of interest paid to small businesses by the Minister’s department. is as follows: The Industry and Small Business Policy Division of the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research conducts the Survey of Australian Government Payments to Small Business (Survey).

The proportion of invoices paid over two weeks late for the whole-of-Government has decreased over the last two survey years, from 1.8% (2007-08) to 1.4% (2008-09). 1 (b) As data on average times between invoices and payments to small business are not provided to the Survey and agencies use different financial information management systems, responses calculated by individual agencies will not be comparable. However the response provided in 1(a) provides some indication of time lapsed between payments. The use of government resources to develop a comparable set of answers outside the Survey does not justify the effort to calculate the average times, when authoritative information on the Government’s performance is available from the Survey. 2 (a) and (b) Only one agency reported receiving an invoice for interest on a late payment, for an amount of $30.27. It should be noted that: the late payment interest penalty element of the small business procurement policy commenced on 1 December 2008, half way through the Survey period; and it was restricted to new written contracts of up to $1 million (GST inclusive), negotiated from 1 December 2008.",230,Questions In Writing
