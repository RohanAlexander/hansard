It is oue of the saddest features of our industrial life that men employed in mining and some other avocations carry their lives in their hands in their daily operations, and arc occasionally stricken down, as these men have been, by an overwhelming disaster. We know that the men who work in mines , ure capable of performing deeds of quiet heroism. The facts are not always published, but if they were they would invariably justify our highest admiration. When we think of the domestic trouble caused by this lamentable disaster, our hearts help those who are suffering. must bleed for the unfortunate members of the families of tliose who have been stricken down. I second the motion. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) -A-As the representative of the great mining community -of Bendigo, I desire to express my fullest '.sympathy with the motion submitted by the Acting Prime Minister. In times past we have had very many mining accidents of a tragic and fearful character in Bendigo and other parts of Victoria, but never such an appalling disaster as this.' Perhaps never in the history of Australia has there been such a'dreadful wreck of human life, with jill the consequent prospective human misery. I desire to express my own sympathy and :that of the minors of Bendigo, and of Australia generally, and I trust that when .the proper time arrives everything possible will be done to lessen the misery resulting from this dreadful catastrophe, and that those who have been involved in suffering will have the hearty assistance and substantial support of the people of the Commonwealth. representative of 'the district in .which this unfortunate accident has occurred, I desire to join with the Acting Prime Minister and those who have spoken to the motion, in expressing my sympathy with those who have afflicted. In my position as representative of the district, I knew many of the men It is with the who have been stricken down. Unfortunately some of the heroic men who attemptedto save the doomed miners have sacrificed their lives, among them being Major McCabe, one of the leading men in the district. This odds to the very serious"" consequences of the disaster, and, I join with other members in expressing my sincere sympathy with those who have been overwhelmed with sorrow. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne)^-As one largely interested in an adjoining property, I feel that it would not be out of place on ray part to express my deepest sympathy with those who are suffering in consequence of the disaster. The sad loss of l if e ' anddisiocating of trade will be attended with disastrous consequences to the district, and,' so far as I am concerned, and the company with which I am connected, 'everything possible will, be done to ing Prime Minister is to be complimented upon., having given the House an opportunity to express its feelings in regard to this disaster. I do not. suppose there are any of us who do not feel the deepest sympathy with all the relatives of the men who have been killed or injured. The disaster is, unfortunately, one of several that have occurred in New South Wales, and the only relief we can feel in the midst of the present trouble is afforded by the knowledge that some steps have been taken in the past to provide for such emergencies as that which has now arisen, and that relief will be afforded to thoso who are left behind. There is no necessity to say more than that we are all in sincere accord with the motion. Question resolved in the affirmative.

In support of that contention, I would point out that there is a great dissimilarity between the Australian States and other .communities, such as Canada and America. In those countries the railways, which are the largest consumers of iron, are in the hands of private enterprise. In launching upon the work of iron production, a State would be assisting its railways, which consideration furnishes an additional reason why the industry shou.ld be nationalized. Further, the iron industry is tbe mother of all others. most industries. industry which, if handed over to a private with the establishment of the iron industry, company, will place that company in a posiand he has quoted figures showing the great tion to dictate terms to every other in. development which has followed the applicadustry.

AVe have to remember, however, that in order to raise the amount we shall have of £1,000,000; and, under the circumstances, the necessity for information and for thoroughly safeguarding the interests of the taxpayer is accentuated. Canada has, I suppose, experimented more extensively with the bonus system than has any other British community. The Dominion Government have followed different lines from those which have hitherto been adopted in Australia. The States here have directly undertaken the work of developing our natural resources by means of railway extension, harbour accommodation, and postal and telegraph conveniences, whereas the Canadian policy has been, to bonuses.

The writer of the article -strongly favours the bonus system, but he urges the very significant contention that a duty or bonus should be so framed as to be efficient in hard times as well as in good times. The true import of that statement is found in a table which shows theamounts which have been expended in bonuses in Canada. In 1884 the amount paid was 44,090 dollars, and every year shows a variation, until in 1891 the figure is 20,153 dollars. In 1901 the expenditure had increased to 351,259 dollars, showing that there have been periods of prosperity and periods of depression. is said about great benefits which result to wage-earners duction of capital by means of the bonus system, and to hear the arguments usually advanced one would suppose that the wages fund was wholly drawn from capital. But the common experience of hard-headed, .. practical commercial men is that capital does not pay wages for any very lengthened period-that to produce their own wage fund and a little over, an industry very quickly comes to a standstill, and the wage-earners have to seek elsewhere for employment which will enable them to provide the fund. mittee coimted.) happens capital, as a rule, has gone also. where any very great demands are made on it, no matter what the industry or the assistments of Canada have expended £6,600,000 ance granted may be. There is a further paragraph in the article, which I commend to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who is the high-priest of protection in Victoria. The .contention-of that honourable member when the TarifF was under review was that protective duties, whilst blocking importation, result in the decreasing the prices of commodities within the charmed circle on which its benefits are conferred. The article states that the Canadian mine owners have to face unfair competition at the hands of the American mine-owners, who are selling iron in Canada at 3 dollars per ton less than American consumers have to pay for the same article. Under the circumstances, it is contended that .. further assistance should be given, and in the Argus or Age of yesterday may be found a cable message stating that a new steel corporation has been founded in Canada for the purpose of meeting and resisting the competition. This corporation has a capital of £3,600,000, and it is to receive assistance from the Canadian Government by way of bonus to the extent of £1,000,000,"" with the further extraordinary concession of exemption from the federal taxation for twenty years. It is anticipated that by these means the mine-owners of Canada will be able not only to meet the competition of the American mine-owners, but also to produce iron 30 per cent, cheaper than is possible in America. The bonus system in Canada has been in vogue for a number of years, and, as Much there has been fair opportunity to demonstrate its good as well as its bad qualities, from the introthe results should prove instructive when it is proposed that we should embark on a similar policy. It will be readily admitted, I think, that the Economist is a reliable and competent authority on politico-financial questions. In that publication of 3rd May this year there is an article from a Canadian correspondent on if wage-earners are not able the subject of Canadian finances, and it appears that the Dominion Government, by way of loans which have been converted into subsidies, and by subscriptions for shares and subsidies direct, have expended (Com200,000,000 dollars, or about £40,000,000.

But if a State should be the first to enter upon the establishment of the iron industry, it would have to work a most difficult undertaking under unknown conditions. I would not presume to say how far the industry would succeed in Australia for some years ; having regard to the conditions operating in America, and in Canada, particularly, I would not say how far it might not be undercut from outside. Until private enterprise has clone the exploration work, I should not like to see any State enter into a business which might involve a great many incidental calls upon the public purse. I think it is a dangerous thing. I .say this hoping, at the same time, that in the course of a few years the business will be carried on by one of tlie States.

I admit that the honourable and learned member did not say so. , We have to deal with existing facts and make the best of what I might call a bad job. The next best thing to the establishment of the industry by the Commonwealth is that it should be taken up by one of the States, and a State would enter upon it to tlie greatest advantage at a time when it could profit by the experience of the private profit-seeker. I have never known an industry to be taken up by the State which bad not previously been tested by private profit-seekers. The State often fails, but when it does succeed, it succeeds always in cases in which it has followed the experience of the private profit-seeker. W it h all respect to the honourable member for Bland, I think that those who are advocating the immediate thrusting of the iron industry into the control of the State are tlie enemies of the State working of monopolies. This is a monopolistic industry, but it is a mistake to desire the States to set the ball rolling. We cannot get the State to work with its cumbrous machinery until we have had tlie experience of men who commeaca operations for the mere purpose of profit when the State took them up here. thing, but we had private railways in Victoria. The first railway in Victoria was constructed by private enterprise. first line constructed in Victoria was that running from Melbourne to Williamstown, and that it was built b j the State. Bay line, and also the Geelong to Melbourne railway was built by a private company. All that I am putting is that in view of the tremendous movements to control the output of iron and rails in America and elsewhere, it is impossible.for us to foresee how the iron industry will succeed here. There are men who are willing to risk their capital in it , provided that they have a chance of making reasonable profits. with the certainty that their works would be taken from them if they established them We were told in New successfully ? tion affecting the conditions to be imposed. I think the honourable member is quite right in saying that a man who believed it possible that if he successful^ established an industry it would be taken from him, would be chary in entering upon it . But if we provide conditions which will show those who may think of entering upon the industry that they will not be robbed of the fruits of their labours, they will be far more likely to take it up. It is for this reason that I still adhere to the view which I took when the committee last divided upon this question, and I shall certainly vote for the excision of the proviso. I voted on a former occasion for a modified excision of the words, but that proposal was not accepted. I should still vote for it if it were proposed, but it is not. A compromise has been suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports that no bonus should be paid to any private company or individual for a period of two years, in order that the States might have time to take up the industry. That proposition was not accepted. I should be willing, although with regret, to adopt it . I prefer to see the proviso omitted, so as to leave the industry to private enterprise in the first",21,Bonuses Por Manufacture S

Melbourne. His proposal is that a bonus of £250,000 shall be given to private in every Act authorizing the construction of a dividuals. pose, that the Bill should be passed, as the Minister desires, in a shape providing for a bonus of £250,000 to be paid'to private individuals who enter upon the iron industry, and that at some period subsequent'to the payment of that bonus a State should take up the industry. Presumably the honourable and learned member proposes that the State shall take it up only if it is a success. If it is a failure, the State is carefully to-let it alone. If the honourable and learned member's proposal were carried out it ' would mean that private individuals would be induced to establish the industry by their own enterprise and perhaps at considerable loss, the State contributing £250,000 to make good that loss. But as soon as they had proved that the industry could be successfully carried on the State would say to them-""We will take your property, work it ourselves, and annex the profits."" payment for the works and land. An y one who enters upon such an industry does not look to the profits of the first few years to recoup him. for an indefinite period-to the accumulated profits for his return. compense them accordingly. honourable and learned member means that on taking over the works the State should pay the owners a sum representing not merely the money expended upon them and 10 per' cent, as compensation for resumption, but an amount based upon the anticipated profits for a considerable number of years, I do not think it would be a good thing for the State to entertain. On the other hand, if a State could take over the property on paying merely an additional 10 per cent, for resumption, surely it would as to enter into the industry. private railway Or tramway gives to the Government or local authority the right to purchase it after a certain time. number of years. understand that the suggestion here is that it should be done at once. trouble in establishing an iron industry than in constructing a railway or a tramway. with question of terms. ter is favorable to tliis proposal, as he is defending it 1 asks for a fair protection of the State. see that this proposal is made under the wing of the Government.

He says that a month ago that he hoped, and fervently believed, that some State might embark in this enterprise, and for that reason he accepted He looks to their continuance with delight the amendment which he now resists. of the sort. Considering that I divided against the amendment, how could I have accepted it with delight? members of the committee understood. The Minister read the refusals of the States almost with tears in his eyes; and it is very astonishing that he resisted the proposal previously, and is resisting it to-day. He also spoke very touchingly, and no doubt truly, as to the great importance of the iron industry. But what does his proposal mean ? Doesi t recognise the importance of the iron I industry ?

It is too big an industry to be affected stances permit. by the offer of that bonus. If there is a profitable outlet for the enterprise, not for the first'few years, but during the-course of many years-if investors can be convinced in that respect-the y will not wait for a bonus of £250,000. If no profitable outlook is promised, no such sum will induce them legitimately to embark in the enterprise. If they do, it will be done simply in How can I legitimately and consistently give order to get hold of' that £250,000. They will float some concern on the markets of the world where the facts are not so well known as they may be to themselves, with the object of annexing the bonus, and the premium which will attach to flotation, owing to the gift of the bonus, and leave the company thus established to its fate. Either the bonus is not sufficient to induce tlie starting of the industry unless otherwise it can be a success, or the Minister means at a subsequent period to propose an additional bonus or duty if it is not successfully established. The Minister has .given a glowing picture of the growth of the iron industry in Canada, but what are the facts? Before the bonus was given Canada manufactured 36 per cent, of her own requirements in iron. What has been the result since the bonus was-given? Further bonuses have been asked for, higher duties have been requested, and to-day not a paltry £250,000, but millions are required to support this industry, which is said to have been so thoroughly established by the bonus system. Surely the Minister was unfortunate when he went to Canada for an example to us. Everything which is feared here has occurred there, and some of us feel that the course of embarking in this giving of bonuses in connection with the iron industry will be attended with the same objectionable results as have occurred in Canada. In this case the Minister proposes to impose protective duties after the cessation of the bonus. It is not the bonus itself only that we have to deal with. Even under the Ministerial proposal there are to follow protective duties, which, we may feel certain, will not stand at the moderate level at which they are proposed, if the industry demands higher ones. Having brought into existence this bantling, it litis to be supported at all hazards. It must be brought to manhood if possible, and the State will be asked to do it . as necessity demands, and as low as circummission by the honourable member. We know what demands we had in other directions when we were framing the Tariff. But what arethe demands likely to be in connection with the iron industry ? I am against the giving of any bonuses. I am asked to vote to give a bonus to a State. such a vote, especially as I am more opposed to a bonus being offered to a State than to its being thrown open for the acceptanceof all ? A strong objection to this assistance to industries is that it creates an opportunity to levy taxation from the people. Under a bonus, without coming duties, that cannot be done, I admit, to the same extent as can be done under .protective duties. In this case protective duties are to follow, whether a State or a private person takes up the industiy, and those duties rise with the necessity. My objection, and that of other free-traders who think with me, to that is that it creates an opportunity for taxation being drawn from the people of the State, or if that opportunity does not exist, because the duty is not sufficiently high to exclude competition by the outside world, then every industry, and every other consumer of its product is made to pay for the support of the producers. That is the position, and it is not relieved because the bonus is given to a State; in fact, it is intensified. If a State establishes the industry, and it cannot compete easily with the outside world, it will get what it demands, to enable the continuance of the competition with the outside world. There will be a tax, levied on the consumers of the material. strings than a private syndicate in that connection. State would endeavour to get all the profits which a duty, if too high, would allow. creased bonus, or an increased duty, a private enterprise syndicate will pull more strings'than a State can do. honourable member is right in that respect, OnlyI think that the State would have more weight in the getting of the help.

80,Mr Thomson,"I believe that themeeting its own requirements, it will demand, and probably will get, this higher duty, which will handicap the other industries of the Commonwealth, because pf the prices which will have to be paid for the material it produces. As regards what it uses in its own departments-and that represents a very large proportion of the total consumption-eve n if . it costs 50 per cent, more than the article could be imported for, the State will use tbe product of its industry, terests of the industry itself, and of our and' will make the people at large pay the extra prices, and thus support all those engaged in its production. ThatI consider is a national loss. Holding that opinion I cannot depart from my objection to vote for a bonus to a State. A t the present stage there is really no question of a State industry versus a private industry. Any State, if it likes, can start an iron industry to-morrow. private enterprise also. prise also. a means of getting something immediately by tlie flotation of a company which the company would have no light to get, scattered over the iron industry that, if some agitation an industry like the iron industry, which should run through the ages, £250,000 is a mere nothing. If the industry would not start without the bonus, it would not start with it . If tbe industry will start without the bonus, and it will if the opportunity is there, then it should not be given. Surely no State needs a bonus of £250,000 ? What a farce to offer that sum to the States! Cannot the poorest and the weakest of the States find £250,000? raise that sum to-morrow if she wanted it, and so could any other State in the Commonwealth. From that aspect, the whole thing is ridiculous. There is nothing that may be put into this cr any Bill which will prevent any State, if it wishes, from embarking in the iron industry. For that reason also I do not see my way to support the giving of a bonus to the States. Then we . liave this other questionalthough it is a most important one, the Minister has given us no information-ho w will it affect our financial position ? If we its present shape it will assist in the estabhave to provide £100,000 a year for the payment of these bonuses, and if we are going, as the House has expressed its desire' that we should, to pay out of revenue much which hitherto has been paid out of loan account, where are we to get this sum of £100,000 a year from? Are we to raise £400,000 or £500,000 in order to provide for it ? If not, we should have some indication from Ministers regarding ways and means. The LoanB ill has not yet been passed, and may not be, and the Governmentshould be able to tell us how they propose to find the money. In the inown financial position, it would be infinitely better for the Ministry to allow this proposal to stand over for the present. The members of the labour party have expressed themselves against giving bonuses to private individuals. are all in favour of giving tbe preference to the States. myself, are against giving bonuses to private individuals. not. ber for Bland said yesterday that such a strong feeling existed in New South Wales in favour of the Government establishing were made, the Ministry would probably enter upon the industry before many months were over.

That State could raise ten times £250,000 if it desired to establish the iron industry. I intend to vote against bonuses in any form. I sball vote against this clause, and I trust that the B ill will be reports quoted by the Minister indicate defeated. I am satisfied that by granting bonuses, either to the States Governments or to private individuals, we shall enter upon a policy the end of which we cannot see. The Commonwealth will be dragged into giving more and more support to any industry that may be created upon such a false basis. to grant £250,000 as worse than a scheme involving an outlay of £1,000,000.' If it were proposed to spend the larger sum we might look upon that as ending the matter, but a grant of £250,000 will simply introduce the thin end of the wedge. If the industry were started under that bonus we should have appeals for further assitance made to us within a very short time. We should be asked not to destroy that which we had created, for which the future held out great hopes of prosperity. A bonus of £250,000 would be a mere drop in the ocean. We must not look to the expenditure of a year or two in connection with such an enterprise, but to an outlay extending over decades. If the opportunity presents itself the iron industry will be estabthe firm for any loss which it has incurred ? lished upon asound basis, and undersuch conditions that those engaged iu other industries will not be required to contribute to its support, and consumers will not have to pay more for what they require. The industry will then grow with the progress of the Commonwealth, and may even, by means of an export trade, bring wealth to our shores from other parte of the world. great interest to the reason which the Minister gave for asking honourable members to reverse the decision previously arrived at. A l though the right honourable gentleman spoke with great earnestness, and stated that he had the most convincing proof of the necessity for restoring the Bill to its original form, the facts adduced by him seemed to me to constitute the strongest arguments against his proposal. The information received from Canada proved that large sums of money had been spent by the Dominion Government, and that the ironworks had greatly increased their output, but, at the same time, we find that those engaged in the enterprise are still crying out for more assistance, and that there is no perceptible end to their demands. There are any number of men who will produce anything in the Commonwealth if the Government will, pay them to do so. The that there are such dangers connected with the bonus system as should frighten every honourable member. I do not think that the reports from Canada had much to do with the desire of the Government to restore the Bill to its original form. I should be sorry to say that the lobbying which has been I look upon the proposal going on for some time past had anything to'do with their action ; but the fact that some honourable members have changed their opinionhas, nodoubt, largely influenced tbem. They have been relying upon the count of noses rather than upon the figures from Canada. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne made a most extraordinary proposal. He evidently thinks that a heavy loss will be incurred in connection with the establishment of ironworks. He, therefore, suggests that a handsomebonus should be granted to induce some one to undertake the experiment, his idea being that the State should, in the event of success, take over the works. Isi t likely that the Government will be able to take over the industry unless they pay Wouldi t not be a great deal safer for the State itself to find the money necessary to embark upon the undertaking ? The party with which I am associated are prepared to stir up public opinion upon this matter in New South Wales if the Bill in its present form becomes law. A t the scmo time, we have just cause of complaint against the Minister'for Trade and Customs. When the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Bland was carried, we accepted his assurance that the Opposition had not succeeded in killing the'Bill, and that the Government intended to proceed with it . It is a very big strain upon our faith, therefore, to find the Minister now attempting to reverse the decision arrived at by the committee, and it is misleading to the section with which we are associated. The replies received by the Minister from the States Governments are just what might have been expected. But despite the statement of the Premier of New South Wales, I hold that if the B ill passes in its present form he will",25,Bonuses Por Manufacture S
92,Mr Thomson,Does the honourable,26,Bonuses Por Manufacture S
93,Mr Spence (Darling),"I listened withbe unable to resist the pressure of public opinion that will be brought to bear, and will be compelled to embark upon this industry. A t the present time, however, he can excuse Government inaction by the plea that he has no assurance that the Bill will pass both Houses of this Parliament. As the honourable member for Bland has pointed out, past experience teaches that the States Governments will never enter upon any large undertaking until they are forced to do 50 by public opinion. In effect, the proposal of the Minister for Trade and Customs is to borrow money from one set of British capitalists for the purpose of advancing it to another. ""We know that syndicates are always ready to secure privileges, which they dispose of to a large -company, in anything for which they choose to ask from which they receive a big share. In mining circles these individualsare known as ""first robbers."" If the industry does not pay-they close down the works, and deputations wait upon-the Government pleading for further assistance, either by way of the payment of an increased bonus or the imposition of a higher duty, so that they may put money into their own pockets. Honourable members are practically asked to allow themselves to be used as mere tools for the benefit of a few capitalists in Great Britain. Even if the proposal of tlie Minister is assented to, we have not the slightest guarantee that the iron industry will be established by private enterprise. This is a question in which the labour party has taken a very keen interest for a considerable time, and I unhesitatingly say that the action of the Minister is calculated to defeat his own wishes. It is all very well to argue that none of the States Governments will embark upon this industry. But I would point out that New South Wales has a sufficient surplus income to engage in it even without any artificial aid. I venture to say that, if the Bill be carried in its present form, within a year or two one of the States will nationalize the industry. £0 confine tbe Bil l to the"" States Governments for two years, but the party to which the honourable member belongs would not Agree to the proposal. twopence whether or not the iron industry becomes established so long, as they can attack somebody's pouketSi There is always something rotten, associated with appeals to the Government to aid private enterprise: The whole principle is a bad one. There is absolutely no justification for offering thisbonus at such an early stage in our federal history. A t the present time we have not a penny to spare. We cannot get a telephone wire put across a street, a t a cost of30s., 'because there is no money available, and yet it is proposed to offer private individuals £320,000 to engage in these industries. I do not like tbe look of this proposal, and I protest against the lobbying which has been going on within the precincts of this House.' We had. enough of that in connection with the Tariff proposals. If only, a man and a boy are engaged in au industry they can get almost this Government. Of course lobbyists do not worry me, because my views upon this question are well known. SinceI have occupied a seat in this Parliament I have been astonished to find prominent labour men interviewing honourable members on behalf of the British capitalist. To what istlie country coming when we witness that sort of thing? The time seems to be rapidly approaching, when we shall have to frame a standing order for the purpose ofpreventinglobbying. When I see honourable membersprofessing certain principlesand deliberately placing, obstacles in the way of the realization of those principles, there-is a big strain on my belief in their sincerity. The honourable member for North, Sydney, and others-who think with him, had better be careful or they will fail to accomplish the object they have in view. There are many who believe in the bonus system, and many who are opposed to it , and the voting will be somewhat mixed ; but I sincerely hope the committee will adhere to the previous decision. If the States fail to take the matter up"" there will always be the opportunity for the Government to carry out their desire to encourage private enterprise. No doubt we have all. received the circular to which reference, has already been made, and from the statements therein we can see that, the drift in Canada is in the direction of monopoly.

Frequent reference has been made by the honourable member for .Darling to the necessity which has arisen for further assistance to the Canadian iron industry : but surely that honourable member has not looked carefully at the telegrams which have appeared in the press. The Government of Canada have seen that American combinations are likely to get control of the shipping between Canada and Great Britain, and, as would be done here in similar circumstances, it has been decided to contribute a bonus of £1,000,000, and give twenty years' exemption from wharfage and other charges in order to retain communication with the old country. The object is not to bolster up the iron industry, but to retain the present growing trade.

Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN have no objection to the Government taking the works over if necessity arises; but the honourable member for Bland contends that there should be no possibility of private enterprise.

I am astonished to find the Minister for Trade and Customs fighting for the Bill, because hitherto I have recognised him as one who believed thoroughly in State control of large enterprises which come within the category of monopolies.

There is no one in this House who is more sincere in regard to the State undertaking works than is the Minister for Trade and Customs. He has taken strong action in regard to the nationalization of works in South Australia. Therefore, I cannot understand why he is so anxious that private enterprise should undertake the iron industry, which comes within the category of works that ought to be controlled by the State.

Mr A. M c LEAN with the question of monopoly. If my honourable friend were a member of a private company which proposed to invest several hundred thousand pounds in the industry, he would surely object to the adoption of that course if he believed that the Government of any State, supported by a Government bonus, was likely to enter into competition with it . A private company would be placed at such a disadvantage that it would not be likely to enter upon t/he work. I would rather see the B ill lost than passed with this proviso in it , because I believe it would have the effect of effectually shutting out private enterprise. I would ask those honourable members who are opposed to the payment of a bonus in any shape or form, but who are friendly to the establishment of the industry by private enterprise to give that aspect of the case careful consideration. It was very strongly impressed upon me by gentlemen w ho are interested in this industry that ; they would not invest one shilling of their capital in it if the measure were placed upon the statute-book in its present form. aspects of this subject for which I am unable to find any satisfactory explanation in my own mind, nor have I obtained it from any honourable member. In the first place, I cannot understand the reason for the haste shown by the Ministeri n charge of the Bill. I cannot see any great national calamity behind the possibility that this project may be set aside for a little while we stand financially. I apprehend that we have been doing fairly well in obtaining our supplies of iron from the cheapest markets of the world, and while I should certainly like to see the industry established in Australia, I am not so foolish as to imagine that it could be entered upon either by private individuals or by any State without a careful scrutiny of all the circumstances, and on the very best consideration from an expert and financial point of view was likely to prove 'successful. I can understand that certain gentlemen who have' been perambulating about a part 42 c 2 of this building which is supposed to be set apart for the use of honourable members should regard this matter as an urgent one. A sum of £250,000 is not to be sneezed at in these times, and if they could manage to impress the capitalists of the world It has nothing to do of the advantage of doing something to acquire that sum the result would be sufficient to justify any exertion which they might have put forth. The second difficulty which I have is in regard to the position taken up by many honourable members, who, while professing a great admiration for a certain principle-in this case the organization of the industry upon a State or Commonwealth basis-ar e prepared to put aside that principle because they do not think it possible forthwith to carry it into effect. It is a position worthy of an Australian aboriginal or a Hottentot, that men professing to be statesmen should be so destitute of patience and foresight that, for the sake of atemporary advantage, they are willing to allow a condition of things to be established in Australia for all time, which will mean that the heritage of the people of the country has been given away for a mess of pottage. The position taken up by such honourable members is analogous to the lack of foresight shown by the most degraded savages on the face of the earth, who if they obtain a meal to-day will gorge themselves to repletion without any thought of to-morrow. We are told by the Minister for Trade and Customs that he wishes to secure employment to tbe workers of the Commonwealth. He is so anxious about that matter, that he' is prepared to hand over one of our great national resources to the handful of energetic gentlemen with whom we have become so familiar during the last week or two. The Minister must be aware of the circumstances which until we see how have made a lack of employment so common throughout almost the whole of Australia. He must recognise that it is because the natural resources of the country, to a very large extent, have been securedin many cases by means which w ill not bear investigation-by a handful of people, and that those people entrenched behind the laws of the various States are able to utilize these resources in a way detrimental to the welfare of the community. On the'face of it , it .is absolutely preposterous that there should be' this lack of employment on an immense continent so thinly populated as this is ; but, because of it, we",31,Bonuses Por Manufacture S

124,Mr Fowler (Perth),"There are twoare asked to take another step in the same direction. I exceedingly regret that such a number of enthusiastic supporters of the principle of State socialism are prepared to put it aside upon the pitiful excuses that we have heard both to-day and last night. I am reminded that not very long ago the Government sought permission to raise a loan, to enable them to carry out public works which would give a vast amount of employment. The sum which they are prepared to throw at the heads of these syndicators represents about one-half of what they desired to .borrow for Government works. If they would reconsider the matter, and expend this amount in improving the telephonic service, and in carrying out other works, they would obviate to a very large extent the unemployed difficulty in several of our large centres.

I have no doubt that the ordinary impression is that socialists are very unreasonable people, but if any holder of that view will take the trouble to read up a little on the subject he will find not only that they are reasonable, but that some of the best master-minds of the world are on their side. Just before I rose to speak I was referring to the current number of the North American Review, which contains an article, not by one of those wild, hair-brained socialists, but by a sedate professor of political economy in Berlin University, on the national debts of the world, dealing -particularly with the public debt of Prussia. member know that he is not a socialist 1 sible that he is a socialist, still he is a man of such standing that I think very few honourable members would care to cast a stone at him. In this article he is enthusiastic in pointing out the advantages to the Kingdom of Prussia from the adoption of State socialism as regards its railways and other national industries, and he makes out a wonderful case for the adoption of the principle which might be worth the consideration of the Minister for Trade and Customs. A t the. present time, with the development of commercialism which is taking place, there is no difference between a State industry and a large private industry so far as general management goes. A t one time it was argued that a private industry had always the direct supervision of those who were specially interested in its success. But at the present time the position of the shareholders in many of the large industries of the world, in respect of the management, is of a State. As regards the management of the iron industry in Australia, the proposals of the syndicate are practically on all fours with those which would emanate from a State, or possibly, from the Commonwealth-, if the constitutional difficulty were overcome. The first step would be the provision of a certain capital, and tbe next step would be the appointment of a manager, who would act in precisely the same way, whether he was representing a State or a private individual. I feel sure that if it is sufficiently Speaking as a attractive to a private company to embark in this industry under these conditions, the State after a little more hesitation, perhaps, and a little more inquiry, w ill be perfectly prepared to do so. All I ask for is that necessary interval to enable the State to institute the inquiry which the people naturally expect. As regards the possibilities of the industry, even the Minister is in absolute ignorance. It is at present in the clouds. He is not certain",32,Bonuses Por Manufacture S

I take it that the great difficulty, lishment of the industry within the Commonwealth, it would afford to the Minister, who is anxious for the nationalization of such industries, a splendid opportunity for going to the people of the Commonwealth and asking them to alter the Constitution in the direction of enabling the Government to take up the work. Surely that is a prospect which ought to have some attraction for him. Mi"".

I hope that as the result of the division a little more time will be given to the States to consider, where they stand, and to the people of Australia to develop the ideals of national progress, as a good many of us understand them, and that is to give the population of the country the f u l l advantages of its own national resources. previous occasion, I attacked what I regarded as a socialistic addition to the clause, I was the only member of the committee who then took up the position of an individualist, and I am very glad indeed to learn, in the course of this discussion, that I.have received support from quarters whence I did not expect it to come, and whence, certainly, it did not come on that occasion. I believe that if the committee could vote free from party influences there would be a majority in favour of the institution of a bonus, I also believe that if one section of the committee could be excluded, both the main. Ministerial side and the main Opposition side would vote in favour of stopping tliis proposal to introduce socialism. When the honourable member for Perth expressed his surprise that a professor of political economy in Berlin University should be a socialist, he gave perhaps the strongest argument against socialism which has yet been given here. When I asked whether a professor was a socialist, the honourable member said that he was a professor of political economy, and he seemed to think that that was a clinching answer to my question. I am ready to accept his deduction, and to state that no man who is a sound political economist could be a in regard to the position which has been attempted to be taken up by certain honourable members, is that the State which owned the works would feel that it was its duty to give the best terms it could to its own constituents; it would not act impartially to the whole Commonwealth. The duty of a State, as a State, is to look after its constituents who pay the taxes. For instance, if Tasmania or New South Wales were to spend public money in addition to the bonus of £250,000 in establishing ironworks, are we to expect that it would treat equally with its own people the inhabitants of Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia, who wished to use its iron 1 The people who were taxed to support an iron industry would certainly expect to receive more advantages than the people of other States. If a State establishes the iron industry, it will not be able to confine its attention to the smelting of iron, but will have to carry on smithies and foundries. It cannot go backwards, but must continually extend its bounds. To institute this State industry necessarily means the extension to all industries. The most forcible argument against this socialistic proposal is to be found in the fact that every enterprise upon which the State enters involves an increase in the cost of administration and of production. control of the railways in Australia has been to largely increase the cost, not only to those who use them, but also to tbe general body of citizens.

Synie he would know that the cost of constructing engines and carriages at the Newport works is outrageously high, -and largely in excess of the prices charged at the Phoenix foundry at Ballarat, or at the Sandhurst carriage works. The honourable member might also have read reports in the newspapers to the effect that between £400,000 and £500,000 worth of material which had been taken into account by the railway department as an asset, is about to be destroyed as useless or sold as out of date. Any honourable member -who compares the results obtained under the Government control of manufactures -with those achieved under private management must admit that the cost in the former case is excessively large. The effect of establishing ironworks under Government control would be to largely increase the cost of iron, and this w.ould affect nearly every industry in the Commonwealth-in some cases, even to the point of disaster. Wheni t is remembered that every industry in Australia is dependent upon the use of iron or machinery in one form or another,-the position becomes critical if the original cost of the iron is largely increased. No industry can possibly succeed unless it is placed under proper control. If the aspirations of the members of the labour party are realized, the ironworks established here will be under the dual control of the Commonwealth and State, -because the Commonwealth will have to satisfy itself that the bonus is being properly applied. We shall, therefore, have a control of the very worse description, -namely, that of Parliament. This must prove ineffective, because both the States and Commonwealth Parliaments are already -overworked and will not be able to give to the industry the close attention and economical management essential to -success. Therefore, it must either fail,-or involve such heavy expense as. to make the operations utterly unprofitable. So far as the post-office is concerned, I hold that anything that can be done properly by individuals should be left to private enterprise, and that in all other cases the work should be carried out by municipalities if possible, or if not by municipalities, by the State. ber agrees with that view he must admit that his amendment should be struck out, because he has not proved that individuals cannot effectively carry on the manufacture of iron. it as effectively as the State. has not quoted any instance in which a Government has taken up the iron industry, and therefore his statement is in the nature of a prophesy rather than an argument. The railways and post-office stand upon a footing altogether different from that occupied by the iron industry, but I am sorry that the States Governments have taken over the railways to work them. They should rather allow private enterprise to have control; and take a fair share of the profits. I believe that they could make a profitout of the railways by leasing tbem. The political management of our railways has been so inefficient that efforts have been made in almost every State to remove them from political control, by appointing commissioners. Some reference has been made to the feeling regarding this B ill in New South Wales. I might point out that the Age of 21st July contained the following telegram from Sydney :The Carcour Municipal Council has adopted a motion to the effect that the action of the Federal Parliament in amending the Bonus Bill and making it applicable only to the States as manufacturers is one tending to the destruction of the iron industry, and in order to insure the industry being developed, the Federal Government be requested to reconsider the proposal, with the view of extending the bonus only to manufacturers of iron made from Australian ore. All tbe municipal councils of the State are to be asked to cooperate with the Carcoar council in bringing the matter before the Federal Parliament. The Council of the Chamber of Commerce of Melbourne, on 22nd July, passed the following resolution That this council, while not expressing any opinion as to the wisdom or otherwise of giving bonuses, records its strong objection to confining their operation to the States alone, believing that they should be open to all members of the community.",34,Bonuses Por Manufacture S

This Government was not in a position to undertake the responsibility of establishing these works. The Government could not see its way to do anything of the kind. At the same time he would be glad if the Federal Government offered a bonus in connection with steel and iron works, because he felt that they would be established in this State. These expressions of opinion from New South Wales should have some influence upon the honourable mernber for Bland. those who uttered them that I am not influenced. -the House of Commons, which was appointed to consider the question of the State purchase of cables, and which was composed of men holding the very highest positions in English politics, passed a resolution upon very much the same lines as the anti-socialistic arguments which I have used during this discussion. They point outThat the State does not obtain favorable, -terms for the transfer of property to itself, and that when the transfer is made there is constant pressure for an increase of the wages of the workof the States to the bonus for a couple of ing staff and for an indefinite reduction in rates. years. In taking that action, I was surely These objections would not be fatal if. it were established that submarine cables would be more -efficiently managed by the State than by private companies, but no serious attempt litis been made -to prove this point, and we ourselves are decidedly of a contrary opinion. If ironworks were established under State control, an agitation would very probably be raised with a view to securing a reduction in the prices charged to consumers, and if this proved successful, the whole of the taxpayers of the Commonwealth would be called upon to pay taxes in perpetuity in order to keep the industry going. I hope the committee will support the Government, .so that the industry may be established nnder the control of persons who are able to carry it on without imposing too heavy a burden upon the taxpayers, and who from, the experience of the past and the teachings of history best make it effective, permanent, and successful. what surprised to hear some of the observations made by honourable members, but as I desire that a division shall be taken as early as possible, I do not intend to do more than briefly refer to them. [Committee counted.] I have been taunted with professing a desire to see the iron industry 'established by the States, whilst refusing to afford the necessary facilities. If honourable members give the matter the slightest consideration, they must come to the conclusion that those taunts are entirely undeserved. From first to last, there has been an endeavour on the part of the Government to give the States every reasonable opportunity to embark upon this enterprise, if they choose to do so. In connection with tbe Tariff, we introduced Division VIA . , without any express provision in regard to the States. A suggestion was then made that it would be a proper thing to extend its operation-to them. We introduced the necessary words without any demur, and, therefore, our intention was perfectly clear from the beginning. Further, when the matter was previously under consideration, it was put that the States Governments ought to be given a preference over private individuals. Believing in that policy then-as I do now-bu t holding that there were doubts as to whether any State would nationalize this industry, I contended that we ought not to confine the payment of the bonus to the States for all time. Accordingly, I moved to limit the exclusive right doing what was reasonable and liberal under the circumstances. A t first those who pleaded the cause of the States sought for a shorter period; but just as we gave way the term was enlarged. Finally, however, they refused to be satisfied with any limitation, and desired to expressly 'provide that at no time should private individuals be permitted to share in the benefits conferred by this Bill. When we were asked to concede that we were asked to concede too much. If the iron industry is to be nationalized, surely two years is a reasonable period to allow of the States taking some action in that direction. I hold that a considerable advantage would be gained by limiting the exclusive right of the States to the bonus, in that it would operate as a stimulus to action, and thus induce an early settlement of the question, to the benefit of all concerned. Therefore, the charge of inconsistency which has been I have been somelevelled against the Government in connection with their declared preference for the States undertaking the work is not justified",35,Bonuses Por Manufacture S

147,Mr Kingston,"And I had the honourbelieve in the Bill as we originally introduced it . They affirm that the establishment of the iron industry is a matter for private enterprise, and they are supported in that contention by the two great .representative journals of the metropolis. Under such circumstances, however desirable it may be to induce the States to a contrary conclusion, there is nothing which would warrant ns in embodying within the four corners of the Bill a provision that there shall be no hope of help to any one else for all time. We are perfectly prepared,-as we were previously,-to limit the preferential right of the States by prescribing a fair time within which they must commence operations. Some little amusement was caused by our approval of the provision suggested to the committee by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. I wish to tell honourable members that we. are prepared to do anything that we reasonably can, or ought to be asked, for the protection of State interests in connection with matters of this sort. We know the inconveniences which ma}' possibly arise. We realize that large monopolies may be created. We know further how at different times Parliament attaches various conditions to the granting of privileges. It was suggested by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, .who was simply carrying out a proposal of which the honourable memberforMelbournePorts had given notice, that there should be a right of purchase attached to the grant of the concessions conferred by this Billa right on the part of the Government to acquire the works and industry upon certain terms. That suggestion was laughed at by some, who urged that it would be infinitely absurd for the State to give to certain individuals a right to start an industry, and immediately it proved to be a success, to take it away from them. Nobody suggested anything of the sort. In South Australia. I know there are very few instances in which special concessions are granted without a rigbt-of-purchase condition being attached to them ; but, of course, it is not a condition c which enables a State to wrongfully deprive a man of that which his own enterprise has created. I venture to suggest that for years past no Bill authorizing the constiuction of a tramway or electric work has received the assent of the South Australian Legislature which has not had attached to it the condition that after the lapse cf a certain period, during which the promoters could obtain a reward for their enterprise, there should be a right of purchase by those chiefly interested-eitherthelocalauthorities or the Government-a t a fair rate, and on a valuation to be determined by arbitration. There is much to be said for the contention that a condition of that sort should be attached. I hold in my hand a volume containing the latest South Australian legislation, and I find attached to the permission to the BrokenH ill Company to construct a railway to the Iron Knob the condition that the Governor and the Railway Commissioner may at any time purchase the lease, with all the buildings, rolling-stock, plant, and jetties and other works, the price not to exceed the cost of such railway, with a fair deduction, to be determined, in case of difference, under the Arbitration Act. In an Electric Light Act passed in the same State there is the condition that at any time within three months of the expiration of three years after the passing of the Act, and at any time within three months of the expiration of any succeeding two years, the local authority may purchase at a price to be fixed by arbitration. the granting power reserves the right to resume. the grantor attaches as a condition the right to resume the works and all connected therewith after a lapse of time, on such terms as shall give a fair opportunity for profit earning, and shall not deprive the grantee of one penny to which he is fairly entitled. And so, as regards this proposed bonus of £250,000 for the encouragement of the iron industry. We may reserve to the Government the right, after an interval to be specified, and on terms fair to both the Government and the individual, to acquire the industry and plant: Of course, all details will have to be considered if such a proposal is made, but the terms must be such as will leave no ground for complaint by one party or the other. terms which would have that effect. any set of conditions, the honourable member desires, but it is .too much to expect me to state exactly whatthose conditions shall be, when I am simply indicating the readiness of the Government to take steps for the further protection of the State.

Anxious as we are to have this industry established, the terms must not be unfair to Australia, but such as, while encouraging the individual, will preserve the State right even to the extent of purchase at a, fair value. In the case of purchase we should be in the same position as if the State had -originally started the enterprise, except that the industry would be proved, and we should not be called upon to embark in pioneering work. I was amused to hear honourable members talking in such a strain as to leave it doubtful whether, in their opinion, the industry will be a success or a failure. The honourable member for Bland was one of these, and I wondered why, if he is so doubtful, he should be so enthusiastic about confining the bonus to the States. stood me. WhatI said was that it was unlikely Australia could successfully manufacture for export. I am of opinion that the State could supply our own requirements. I was speaking on figures supplied by one of the experts. ber for Melbourne has told us that from Canada during the last eight months of the present fiscal year there have been exported €6,00 0 tons of locally-made pig. iron. If that could be done in Australia we should have every reason to be pleased. quantity. ported into Canada? as to the imports during those eight months ; I have dealt only with the statistics to the end of the year 1901.

Australia is very little less than that of Canada, and the trade of the Dominion is no greater than that of the Commonwealth. When we are told that Canada requires a certain quantity of pig-iron and manufactured goods, we shall not be over estimating if we say that our requirements are about the samp our requirements will be much below those of Canada. think that our requirements in regard to pigiron and manufactured iron are equal to those of Canada, and it is nonsense to speak of £220,000 as being sufficient. Have honourable members any idea.of the amount invested at the present moment in the Canadian iron industry? The amount invested is 35,000,000dollars, or £7,000,000. mines and. in plant, and in two or three years the amount will reach 5.0,000,000 dollars. From the Statistical Yeair Booh of Canada we learnThe united investment at Sydney, Hamilton,' Deseronto, Midland, New Glasgow, Radnor, Druirimondville, and '.Ferrona amounts to 24,500,000 dollars, which will be increased to five or six years the total investment will aggregate, approximately, 50,000,000 dollars.",38,Bonuses Por Manufacture S

I do not say that in the first instance an outlay of £10,000,000 is necessary; but what is the proportion of £250,000 to £220,000 ? I am inclined to say that in this case the bonus is a matter of very considerable importance. gentleman denies that £220,000 is sufficient. -highest and the lowest figures. I have put the case fairly and fully, after having given it the best consideration of which I am capable ; and it is my opinion that the proposal of the Government will act as an incentive, and result, as we desire, in the early establishment of the industry. There is much speculation as to the result of the proposed enterprise, but my own opinion is that it will be a success. Honourable members have twitted me with not giving all the information they desire, but I have ransacked all possible sources, and I do not know -what further facts can be laid before them. In committee I have not addressed myself at length to the question for the reason that I have spoken several times previously. But for the purpose of introducing the measure originally I studied the debates which took place in the Canadian Parliament when similar legislation was proposed, and. I found that the speakers referred to history, and to the encouragement which had been -given to the establishment of this industry by the imposition of certain duties in America and England. They pointed to the results, and asked whether it was not possible by fiscal aid to establish the indust r y in Canada. In asking the committee to embark on a similar enterprise, I have briefly glanced at the circumstances which -induced the Canadian Government to grant bonuses. Having shown the results of the policy in that country, I do not know of any further facts which are necessary to enable honourable members to arrive at a conclusion. Granted that there is some risk, I ask. whether is it better, at this time in our history, that we should provide a sure and safe means, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, of establishing this industry, or that we should embark upon what it is suggested will be at least a doubtful enterprise? This is not a case in which we It is 2*. per cent. risk a single sixpence without the assurance of a five-fold return. We are asked to pay 12s. on every ton of pig-iron producedthat is 12s., or 20 per cent., on £ 3 in .value. And this is value produced for Australiaby Australian flux, Australian ore, Australian coal, and Australian labour. What more do we want ? How often has it been my unhappy lot, in connection with matters of this sort, to be desirous of_ finding employment for our people, and failing to do The right honourable so? The establishment of an industry of this sort in our midst will be a means of finding fresh and profitable employment. And there is another reason for what is proposed. Eor every 12s. we pay, there is an increase of £ 3 in our National wealth. What is the value of the ore when it is lying in the ground ? What is the good of the flux unless it is used ? What is the value of the coal unless it is employed for useful purposes ? What is the use of the labourer going about the streets with his hands in his pockets seeking for work and being unable to find it? For the £250,000 which it is proposed to spend, and which is only 20 per cent, on the value of the iron that will be produced, we shall be bound to get a return equal in value to £ 3 for every 12s There is no risk. Not one penny will the Commonwealth be called upon to pay, and no claim can be sustained, unless there is submitted to fche inspectors of the Government five times the amount of material wealth for the amount expended. The return we shall get for our expenditure will be a £1,250,000 for £250,000 of outlay. Why do honourable members hesitate? It is an absolutely sure thing. Those are the conditions, and the only conditions, upon which we are called upon to pay. I say, looking at the history of other countries, and at what they have been bold enough to do, that Australia is capable and bold enough to do ths same at least. That being so, we should no longer hesitate to do it at the earliest opportunity.",39,Bonuses Por Manufacture S

It was only when he found that the committee were against him, and that he could not carry the bonus proposals without some restriction, that the haughty Minister at once becameextremely def eren rial, and said that the proposal agreed with what the Government had intended from the first. The Government proposed that the measure should come into operation on the 1st ult. If that intention had been carried out, the bonuses would have been offered, not to a body of manufacturers, but to one or two firms who happened to be ready to take whatever the House chose to give them. Not one word was said by the Minister in introducing the Bill showing that he considered that delay was desirable to enable the scheme to be advertised throughout the world, so that we might secure 20 or 30 firms instead of one or two to embark upon the enterprise. The Government desired that the Bill should come into operation at once, I understand from so that one or two firms might be in a position to take advantage of it . The Minister said that the Government had been interviewed by one or two syndicates, and that he knew that capital was waiting to be invested in the industry. He had been behind the scenes; he knew what was going on; and said, therefore, that we ought to grant this money. Could a more direct appeal be made on behalf of a special body of individuals ? If the right honourable gentleman had accepted a brief to plead their case in another court, he could have said no more in favour of starting the industry at once. Hundreds of pastoralists and agriculturists have been rendered practically destitute by the drought; but the Government have not come forward with any proposal to give.them a bonus of £ 1 for every £ 2 which they can collect. Thoy seem to think that their whole Ministerial existence depends u pon their effort to force upon Parliament a Bonus Bill which will hand over this large amount of money to a few men. The Minister pretended to be in favour of a State monopoly, but if he approved of giving the bonus to one of the States-whic h would be a return of the money to the people themselves-ho w could he be in favour of handing it over -to any syndicate or syndicates ?

No reason has been given why honourable members should reverse the votes recorded by them upon a former occasion. The right honourable gentleman has said that some 66,000 tons of iron were exported from Canada last year. been quoted by him that we are disposed to subject them to criticism, because the necessity for special pleading on his part often causes him torefrain from quoting the available information in full.

He reads a letter in which the Premier of Queensland that he is not likely to deal with this subject. We can all remember with what a great flourish of trumpets he exhibited as a guide to us tbe opinion of Mr Philp. When we were discussing a question which vitally affected Queensland-theretention islanders for a further term-did he then pay any regard to the statements of its Premier?

Mr Philp that, as an' election would soon be coming on, the)' would be able to deal with the matter then, and that all they asked the Federal Government to do was to wait until they could get an opportunity to ascerThey tain from the people whether a certain course was right or wrong. Despite the protest of the honourable members for Brisbane and Oxley, and despite the written and oral protest of the Premier of Queensland, did the Minister for Trade and Customs ask us to pay the slightest attention to their objections to that Bill1 D i d he not cast aside the protests as So many figures have something not to be considered for a moment? Why? Simply because it never fitted in considerable with his own views. But when we come to consider the question of granting a bonus for the establishment of the iron industry, what does he do? Becausei t happens to accord with his own views, he rushes with what one might almost characterize as indecent haste to acquaint the State Premiers with the result of the vote in this committee, and asks tbem to send him as speedily as possible an answer, which he afterwards quotes to us as a guide that we ought to follow. Again, if regard is to be paid to the statements made by the State Premiers, may I ask, did the Minister pay any deference to the statement of. the Premier of ""Tasmania when we were dealing with a question. which vitally affected its Because, if his argument amounts revenue ?

No, although from the very nature of tilings the State was perfectly competent to deal says with the whole matter. Such a bit of political work as to t r y .to influence the committee by getting telegrams or even letters from the State Premiers on a question of this . kind before the members of State Parliaments had had an opportunity of discussing of Pacific it.has never been done before. What does ' Sir John See know as to whether the Parliament of New South Wales will approve of the establishment of a State iron industry ? I admit that I . have never argued altogether in favour of State socialism. Mariy.honourable members have supported a ' movement like this, sometimes as the lesser of two evils. If it requires such an enormous capital Tuesday as the Minister urges it does, the manufacture of iron must, in the very nature of. things, be a monopoly. The supply of ore is limited, as he urges, and there are only one or two beds that can be opened. Under these circumstances, al-. though perhaps not under others, there are honourable members on this side who will turn round and say"" Much as we are in favour of private enterprise, if we allowed this business to be held entirely by private individuals, it would be encouraging monopoly-it would be giving a grant to special individuals which they did not deserve."" As the honourable and learned member for Corio very truly pointed put, we must not forget that iron is used by men in at least twenty trades, while only one is engaged in its production. The right honourable member has stated that 4,000 men may possibly bo engaged in the iron industry in time to come. That is the utmost estimate which even the Minister has dared to offer. We know his power of imagination. We know exactly how' much reliance to place on his figures. We on this side have examined them too often not to feel perfectly sure that he possesses on certain subjects connected with figures on imagination which might be the envy of many poets j . and even he' put down the number of employees at not more than 4,000. Is he aware that in the various trades in Australia there are at least 70,000 or 80,000 men for whom iron is the raw material? Yet he not only asks us to support bis proposal, but he has the assurance to say that afterwards we must continue a protective duty of 10 per cent. He does not say to us"" This is ah industry which; as soon as it ' is started, will bo like many others. It w ill become self-supporting."" No ; so for from that being .the cose, by giving this bonus we shall encourage another parasite to spring u p one which we must always support, because it will never be able to stand without assistance. honourable members to miss their trains, I shall ask the Chairman to report progress' now, if the motion is withdrawn.
