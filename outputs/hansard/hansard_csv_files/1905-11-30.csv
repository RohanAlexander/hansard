For a very long time, in fact, ever since the question of what we may fairly and properly call workers' trade marks has been before the country, practically one side only has been presented to the public; and I desire now, as briefly as .1 can, to put forward the views that have impressed themselves upon the Government, and have led them to believe that the proposals now made by them are justifiable, and ought to be adopted. Although the views that have been presented in some quarters in opposition to our ideas have been scarcely due to ignorance, I believe that in many instances they have been due to misconception-misconceptio n not only as to the tenor of the proposals placed before the House, but misconception also as to the history of the subject and the way in which it has been dealt with in a far larger community than ours, and one in which mercantile interests of huge proportions are involved.

I shall read the clause, because I believe that the language into which I have put these proposals correctly represents what those in favour of them have always maintained is the root principle of the proposed legislation, that is to say, the prevention of fraud.

18,Mr Isaacs,"Yes. I should like, inmembers. The proposed clause 73 reads in this way1. No person shall(a) falsely apply to any goods for the purpose of trade or sale; or (d) knowingly sell or expose for sale, or have in his possession for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture any goods to which there is falsely applied; or (c) import into Australia any goods not produced in Australia to which there is applied a mark which is a distinctive device, design, symbol, or label registered by any individual Australian worker or association of Australian workers corporate or unincorporate for the purpose of indicating that articles to which it is applied are the exclusive production of the worker or of members of the association (and which mark is hereby declared to be a workers' trade mark), or any mark substantially identical with a registered workers' trade mark, or so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive. So far, there is a prohibition against false application. what false application meansThe workers' trade mark is falsely applied unless in truth(a) the goods to which it is applied are exclusively the production of the worker or of members of the association; or (b) the goods to Which it is applied are in part but not exclusively the production of the worker or of members of the association, and the mark is applied in such manner as clearly to indicate that its application does not refer to, describe; or designate the parts of the goods not being the production of the worker or of members of the association ; and (f) the mark is applied to the goods (being goods produced in Australia) by the employer for whom they are produced, or, with the authority of the employer, by the worker or a member of the association registering the mark. Then there is an inclusive definition of "" association,"" declaring that it means any number of associations acting together, in which case the members of the combined associations will be the members, of each separate association. provides"" Production "" means production, manufacture, workmanship, preparation, or product of labour; "" Produced ""' has a tneaning .corresponding with "" production. "" Penalty : F if t y pounds, in addition to any liability to forfeiture provided by law. That, of course, relates to cases in which goods are imported, and may be liable to forfeiture for a breach of the Customs law. It is merely inserted to guard against accident, 2 and the belief that the only penalty t °3] provided is a monetary one. Assuming this Trade Marks Bill to be constitutional-and I shall deal with that aspect of the matter hereafter-m y view i's that these clauses only confer upon workers the same advantages that are extended to capitalists in the remainder of the measure. BeforeI resume my seat, I shall offer to the Committee the testimony of Judges who have expressed the opinion that it only places the efforts of the labourer in the same category as the tangible property of the employer or ordinary tradesman is put by other sections of the trade marks law. That is the foundation of the morality, if I may call it such, of giving to the worker the power to register his trade mark, irrespective of whether he is a single worker, whether he is a unionist, or whether he is combined with other workers who are not members of a union at all. 'Hie can register -a trade mark without Then follows a definition of anybody's consent; but in no case can he affix it to any goods. It is quite clear that it is improper that it should be falsely applied. Under this clause, if a worker applies that mark to any goods of his employer without his employer's authority, he i's liable to a penalty of £>$oA trade mark cannot lawfully be attached to any goods, except by the employer himself, or by some member of an association-if it be an association mark-o r by the worker himself-if it be a worker's mark-wit h the authority of the employer. In short, I take it that when we are passing a Trade Marks Bill our aim should be to make no discrimination between various classes of the community. I believe that I am right in saying-and I hope I shall be able to prove it to the satisfaction of honourable members-that this B i ll represents an effort to place workers and proprietors of goods"" capitalists,"" or whatever we may term themupon an equality before the trade marks law. At the present time the whole conThe clause further tention of honourable members upon the other side of the Chamber is that a worker has no right to register a trade mark. I intend to examine that argument, and to discuss why he should have that right. If it be lawful, and if it is a right thing to do from a moral stand-point, I do not see why we should! not allow him to register a trade mark. ' If it be a wrong thing to do morally, it is certainly not proper for us to permit him to register it. But I take it that there can scarcely be any difference of opinion upon the question that it is right to say that in respect of any mark, which a worker may adopt to distinguish the product of his labour, or which an association of workers-whethe r it be a trades union or not-ma y adopt to distinguish the product of the labour of its members, it is a moral offence, and ought, if possible, to be made a legal offence to forge that mark. -clause to which I refer provides. As honourable members will notice, it imposes a prohibition upon a person falsely applying a trade mark to any goods for the purposes of trade or sale. It also imposes a prohibition against knowingly selling or exposing for sale, or having in possession for sale, or for any purpose of trade or manufacture, any goods to which such a mark is falsely applied. Then there is a further prohibition upon the importation of goods into Australia bearing an Australian mark, when those goods have not been produced in Australia. has omitted the word "" knowingly "" in that connection. He regards it as impossible to introduce such goods into Australia unknowingly. sible to honestly import into Australia goods bearing a mark to the effect that they have been made in Australia, but which have not been produced here. That is the position. The remainder of the clauses must, I believe, be recognised-if this principle be once adopted-as purely machinery provisions. The registration of a mark is nothing more or less in this case than it is in the case of an ordinary trade mark. In ordinary business circles, a man may have a trade mark. It may be the representation of a horse, as applied to salt. If that is the trade mark of one business man, and another person invades it by selling salt with tlie representation of a horse upon it, the owner of the trade mark can appeal to the Court, independently of any Trade Marks Act, and restrain the thief. The Trade Marks Act was introduced to allow registration for the purpose of more effectively providing evidence and remedies. Therefore, registration, in every case, is simply for the purpose of allowing the public to see what trade marks are protected, and to establish-afte r the lapse of a certain time, at all events-beyon d all doubt who is the owner of a specific trade mark, to provide remedies of a comparatively simple nature, and, in some cases-if the right to the trade mark is contested and withstood to have the trade mark taken off the register. In short, it is to allow the public to know to whom the registered trade mark belongs, and to give the owner greater facilities for protecting his property. If we admit that the workers That is all that the have the right to some symbol designating the product of their labour, there can be no objection to allowing them to put it on the register, because by so doing the public will be protected in every way. If we do not allow that, the result might be that a worker, a union, or an association which is not a union, might by advertisement or in some other way, notify the public that a certain mark belonged to them, and the employer who wished to apply it might be caused great confusion, because he might have grave doubt as to whether he was correctly applying it by acting upon the consent of one person when he ought properly to get the consent of another. Without this Bill at all. any trade union, or any workerI will take the case of a trade union, for the purpose of my argument, because that is the organization which is uppermost in the minds of honourable members-ca n at the present time pass a resolution adopting a certain label. It can advertise it in all the newspapers Union at Broken Hill has a label of that sort. being done strengthens my argument that it may be done.

27,Mr Isaacs,"A t the present moment,supposing-as is often the case in connection with trade marks-the public recognise that label, and wish voluntarily to promote the welfare of that union by purchasing goods to which it is affixed; what would be the inevitable course of proceeding amongst those who do not observe union conditions? would be a few-sufficien t in number to break down the guard that the public had, and so to deceive and injure them-wh o would put that mark upon goods which were not truthfully described. would not be a read)'-if any-mean s of restraining the man who was undoubtedly a rascal. punished under the present Act? tell honourable members what happened in America, because it will serve to point what I am now saying. In 1874, the union label was first introduced in the United States. In that year the state of affairs existing in California, and particularly in San Francisco, was very bad indeed. In the cigar trade, white persons who were working at a proper wage found that there were shopkeepers ancl manufacturers employing others-som e white and some Chinese operatives-a t what would be starvation wages from a union worker's point of view. They found that these persons were employing coolies, and also women and children in what were called small rat tenements, in manufacturing cigars, which were circulated among the people, and were, in some cases, dangerous to human life. Thev were certainly made undter conditions of labour which tended to greatly depress the conditions of living. ; sidered dangerous because some of the makers were suffering from leprosy ? such a danger, but that is not the point. What happened? The unionists met together, and, just as we desire to have a White Australia, determined to stand out for a White California. adopted a white label, and decided that it should be affixed, with the consent of the employers and the unions concerned, to the products of those who gave reasonable wages and made cigars under proper conditions. The public supported the unions. They set their faces entirely against the sweating, improper, and dirty conditions that had obtained, and the white label [203]2 achieved popularity. But unscrupulous, persons, who were not adhering to reasonable conditions of labour, affixed the whitelabel to their products, with the result that: the unions sought protection in the Courts, Decisions were then given, which, -in some cases, have been cited in opposition to our Undoubtedly there proposal. The Court said to the unions, "" We cannot say much for the morality of the action of which complaint is made, but, viewing the matter from a strictly legal 1 stand-pOint, we see no ground for protectThere ing the unions. The white label is not' at common law, apart from statute law, a trade mark in the strict sense of the term. The unions are not carrying on a business of their own, and we cannot consistently, with precedent, give them the protection they seek."" What did the unions do? Finding themselves thrust aside in this way, they determined to appeal to the public to support them. They advertised, in the newspapers that A, B, and C, whoever they might be, were the only persons authorized to affix the white label to their, goods, and they asked the people to support them. That has been described as boycotting. It was. an intimation to the public as to who were justly and truly affixing the white label, to their goods. When the public found from experience that this was a proper system to support, the Legislature stepped in and passed a law dealing with the subject. A provision was passed similar to> that which was agreed to by the. Senate,, but which I thought too drastic, and not necessary in this country. I have entirely a l tered that provision, which was passed in the United Statesc f America for reasonswhich will be obvious to honourable members,, now thaT I have related a portion of thehistory of the matter, and which are certainly inapplicable here. I altered it because, as it stood, it would have given the unions here the same power as is enjoyed by unions in every State where the union label has been adopted-the power to give or! refuse permission to place the union label on ali goods. What happened in America? They therefore The question was dealt With in various Courts. The hatters and clothiers took up the matter, and issued a union label hr v the sanie way as other unions had done. But in each case, unscrupulous persons applied it to goods which did not deserve in truth to bear the label*.

The Watson Government were only a short time in office, and had not very long amendment is shown by the fact that in to consicler the matter. Whilst the Bill was before the Senate, what took place ? It was read a first time at the instance of Senator McGregor, a member of the Watson Government, on 14th July, 1904. It . was read a second time on the 27 th July, 1904, and on 10th August of that year, while the Watson Government were in office, the part relating to trade union marks was introduced as an amendment by Senator Pearce. On the following clay, the first clause in that part wise with negard to the principle he has in view, was agreed to without a division. The remaining, clauses"" of the same part were proto insert these provisions in a Bill relating to ceeded with, and the next one was also agreed to without a division. Then Senator Drake moved the insertion of a clause forbidding trade unions to refuse to authorize a manufacturer or employer who adopted the rate of wages and the hours of employment fixed in reference to the trade of such unions to apply the union trade mark to his products. That clause was rejected by a majority of ten. The remaining clauses were agreed to without division, and the Bill was reported to the Senate with amendments. On the 18th August, the Reid Government came into power, but the Bill did not leave the Senate until 30th November, some three and a half months later. During that time it was under the charge of the Attorney-General in that Administration, Senator 'Symon, but there was no intimation that his Government were opposed to these clauses. On one or two occasions, Senator Symon gave expression to his own individual opinion, . and I would call attention to what he said. On the 7th September, 1904-the proceedings are reported on pages 4335 of Vol. X XI . of Hansard-the honourable gentleman moved that the Bill be recommitted for the reconsideration of clauses 15, 72, and 93. Clause 72 was one of the trade union label provisions, and it was proposed to recommit it to enable Senator Pearce to move an amendment which would strengthen it. of a wicked bargain between the ReidMcLean Ministry and the Labour Party. facts. Senator Pearce desired, as I read the debate, to amend the clause so that "" union "" would cover, not only an individual union, but an association of unions, and Senator Sir Josiah Symon moved the recommittal of the Bill to enable that to be done. That he was not hostile to the Committee he suggested words which would better carry out Senator Pearce's purpose, and, his suggestion having been accepted, the clause was amended accordingly. It is only fair to add that he said that he thought it a mistake to insert these provisions in the B ill . He remarked, speaking of Senator PearceI am not saying one word adversely or otherbut I think that from his own stand-point it is worth consideration whether he should ask us what is an entirely distinct matter-trad e marks -and whether it would not be better to have a separate piece of legislation dealing with this particular subject. would be opposed to these provisions even if they were contained in a separate B ill . Symon expressed the opinion that he would be opposed to them, even if they were embodied in a seDarate measure. I do not think that he left himself open to misunderstanding on that point. But he saidI wish honourable members to remember these words when the constitutional question is raisedI know that in America-and that is the pattern which nn' honourable friend has followedsome enactments for this purpose have been nassed: but it is noticeable that these are not Fedeml ennctmenfls.

He saidI merely throw that out as a suggestion, but if he desires to retain the clauses, the words which I have suggested will meet his view, instead of the word "" association."" The honourable and learned"" senator, who, at the time, represented the Government, did not express any opinion on his own behalf, or on behalf of the Administration, hostile to these clauses. The clause was amended as I have stated, without division. Then, on the 23rd November, when the Reid Government had been in power for a long time-m y authority is the report contained on page 7282 of Vol. XXIII . of Hansard-Senato r Sir Josiah Symon, in compliance with a promise made to Senator Pearce, moved the recommittal of the Bill for the reconsideration, of a proposed new clause, 8A, but he did not seek the reconsideration, of the -trade union label clauses, although Senator Lt -Col. Gould wished to have those clauses reconsidered. an individual Minister are not to be taken as the opinions of the Ministry? If that test were applied to the present Ministers, what would be the result? Josiah Symon spoke as the representative of the Government. learned member for Angas refer to expressions of opinion made by an honourable member when a member of a Government, ancl representing the Government? That was the position of Senator Sir Josiah Symon at the time. Symon and the Ministry of the day were opposed to these clauses. question that the Bill be recommitted, a.nd Senator Sir Josiah Symon expressed himself as personally opposed to the clause, but addedThere can be no harm in reconsidering the matter, and if any honourable senator desires that we should reconsider other clauses, I shall be equally remember that it has been said by honready to assist him. So far as I'can discover, the Government attitude was not declared to be hostile to the clauses, but they were not recommitted', because, on a division being taken on the question, the voting was equal. that that ite the occasion to which the honourable and learned member for Corinella has already referred. vember-as witness the report on page 7594 of Vol. XXIV . of Hansard-Senato r L t Col. Gould again moved the recommittal of the Bill for the reconsideration of the trade union label clauses, on the motion that the Bill be read a third time. He expressed himself against the principle of the clauses, but the chief reason which he urged for the recommittal was lhat under the clauses as they stood, a manufacturer, although paying union rates of wages, and observing union hours ancl conditions, could not use the union trade mark unless a union saw fit to allow him to do so. That defect has now been cured. The honourable senator, however, was against the principle of the clauses altogether. Senator Sir Josiah Symon, as the representative of the Government, would not agree to tlie proposed recommittal, and asked Senator Lt -Col. Gould not to press his motion to a division. He saidI do not think I ought to sacrifice a Bill because of some provision in it which I do not like. He added that, if necessary, the measure would come before the Senate again after it had been dealt with by the House of Representatives. Buti f this House had accepted the union label provisions, they In this case Senator Sir could not have been again considered by the Senate. There is no indication, so f a r as ,1 can discover-othe r honourable members may be more fortunate-that the members of the Reid-McLean Administration, as a Government, were opposed to these provisions during the three and a half months which elapsed between the 18th August, when they came into office, and the 30th November, when the B ill was sent from the Senate to this House. did not introduce ihe Bill. opportunity to express their views as a Government in regard to its provisions, through their representative in the' Senate.

What we have done has been, not to introduce those provisions, but to make them as fair as posI think sible, and great credit is due to the Labour Party for having honorably agreed to take a much less degree of protection for the Then, on the 30th Notrade union label than, is given in any State of the American Union.

50,Mr Isaacs,"No; but they had anformed honourable members of the nature of the trade union label, and have given its history, so far as I can; let me now consider the objections to it. The chief objection which has been raised is that, in America, it has resulted in boycotting. I think that what has happened in America has been greatly exaggerated, and that, if utterly exploded-that the American Courts the American reports are consulted, it will be found that the boycott, whenever its existence has been proved, has been repressed. I use the word "" boycott"" in the sense of intimidation, or coercion, by an unlawful act of some kind. If honourable members say that it is boycotting for a union to openly and frankly appeal to the public to support it, they attach to the term a signification which accept. a union to ask the public in a peaceable way to support it than for a candidate for office to ask his electors to vote for him in preference to his rival. But circumstances. if there is intimidation, coercion, or oprest perfectly assured that all that we have pression by any unlawful act, that is wrong, heard about the Acts having impaired the and, so far as I know, such proceedings have been universally and uniformly repressed in America, in England, and in this country. When the subject was first discussed, we heard a good deal about the American decisions. It Avas said that in America it has been decided that the trade union label is not a trade mark, that its use has been discountenanced by the Court, and held up to obloquy by the Judges. Case after case has been quoted from the American newspapers, and repeated ad nauseam, to show that the trade union label has unchallenged to-day. In case after case 1jeen used in America as a,n instrument for boycotting. ever, in which a decision has been given against the validity of the union label on the ground that it was being used for boycotting. WhatI have found is that unions have been prevented from boycotting, although, in one or two cases, the use of the union label was cart -of the facts stated. The instances to which I refer are of this kind : No employer can lawfully use a trade union label without the consent of the union, and agreements have been made whereby, in consideration of being allowed to use a union label, an employer has agreed to observe union conditions. Unions have been accused of boycotting by refusing to allow the use of their label to those who would not adopt such conditions. But the decision of the 'Court would have been the same if , without of the Peoplev -Fisher, New York, 1894, the withholding of the label, coercion had been used against a manufacturer, because he did not employ union men or observe union conditions. Then we were told that there were a number of cases after the Acts had come into force, and we were also frequently informed-*-though not lately, because that idea has been had pronounced the Union Label Acts ss unconstitutional, and contrary to the United States fourteenth amendment, and also to the Constitutions of the States. I can say confidently that, in no case that I have looked at has there been one single decision impugning the constitutionality of these Acts. I challenge any honourable member to produce a decision showing that I cannot one of these Acts was unconstitutional. If It is no more boycotting for it had been opposed to the fourteenth amendment of the Constitution of the United States, no State would have had power to pass such an Act under any And, therefore, we may liberty of the citizens of the United States, and being contrary to the United States Constitution, is all moonshine. of Appeals stated that although it was indicated to them that the Act was passed with a view to permit of boycotting, they could not allow the decision to rest on that ground. what I say one bit. I maintain that every one of these Acts is in operation, and is the Acts have been enforced, and have I have found no case, however since their enactment been held to be valid, constitutional, and binding. I have a list here of some fifteen cases which have been tried-som e before the Act, and some after it-and I wish to direct attention to the fact, which' is very instructive, that every one of these cases has arisen through unscrupulous persons counterfeiting the label. Before the Act was brought into operation, these offenders were able to go away, triumphing in the fact that in spite of their dishonesty the law was not strong enough to convict them-the v were honorably acquitted on a point of law. These people have now been repressed, and in case after case convictions have been upheld. In the case of Colin v. People, Illinois, 1894, 41 American S.R., 304, the conviction was upheld. In the case 50 Hunt, 552, the conviction was upheld.",20,Trade Marks Bill
51,Mr Glynn,The New York Court,21,Trade Marks Bill
52,Mr Isaacs,"That does not affectIn the case of the State v. 'Bishop, Missouri, 1895, 49 American S.R., 569, the conviction was set aside, but the Court held that the Act was perfectly good, and the only reason the conviction was set aside was because a guilty knowledge had not been proved. In the same year, in the case of the State v. Bernsheimer, Missouri, 62, Miss. Appeals, 165, it was held, because there was no Act, that the label was not a trade mark. In the case of Hetterman v. Powers, Kentucky, 1897, 80 Am. S.R., 637, the bill was filed in 1890, before the Act was passed, but the Court gave its judgment on the morality of the case, and although the label was not a technical trade mark, they accorded it protection. In the case of Schmals v. Woolley, 1898, New York, 73 Am. S.R., 6371 the Equity Court of Appeal in New Jersey upheld the right of injunction, and decided that the Act was correct. 1899, in the New York case of Per kin v. Heert, 70 Am. S.R., 483, the right of injunction was upheld. I should like to read at this juncture what the Court of Appeal in Equity had lo say on the subject. They had to consider the constitutionality of the union trade mark, and they made some observations as to the right of a workman to have a mark Indicating his workmanship. This was the judgment of the final Court of Appeal of the State the highest Court of Appeal for such a subjectThe case was on behalf of the Union Hatmakers' Association for an injunction against the learned member has only just come into the defendants to restrain them from using a counterfeit Trade Mark and Label. On page 643, the Court asks-Why should the specific personal element of ownership of merchandise at the time it is put upon the market be deemed important? Then the Court proceeded to sayThe public object sought in the protection of trade marks is to bring upon the market a better class of commodities, and the means for attaining that object is by securing to those who are instrumental in supplying the market, whatever reputation they gain by their efforts toward that end. commodity is made is one of these instruments, just .is his employer, who furnishes the raw material, and owns and sells the finished product; and if the former is permitted by the owner to place upon the commodity a mark to indicate whose workmanship it is, and thereby commend his workmanship to other employers, this license from the owner should be deemed a right against everybody else. His aptitude in his trade is his property, and if by a mark he can have it identified as his in the market, he may enhance*its saleable value, and thus secure the same sort of advantage as his employer by similar means. No reason exists why this advantage Mr Isaacs. should not be protected by the Courts in the same manner and to the same extent as is the like advantage of the employer. The mere fact that one rather than the other of these persons has placed the product upon the market has no rational bearing upon the matter, for both alike have had the market in view in the efforts they have made, and through those efforts the market is supplied. Mr G. B. EDWARDS -That is all right, as applied to a picture, but is nothing as applied to a pair of boots. readily subscribe to any moral precept, but when it is applied find it inopportune to comply with it. I am reminded of the New York legislator who was asked his opinion in regard to a liquor prohibition law. He said that he was strongly in favour of the law being passed, but against its coming into operation. In prevent the possibility of granting the protection spoken of in the judgment quoted. honourable member. eral state that there is not a single instance of a Union Label Act having been held to be unconstitutional? gentleman know of a case in which it has been held that a union label is not a trade mark? Chamber. I have already traversed that ground. At page 644, the decision to which I have referred continues in reference to the union of the journeymen hattersWe understand from the bill that the members of the association represented by the complainant are connected together as journeymen hatters; that their skill in this trade, and their mutual assistance in profiting by its practice, form the motive and chief aim of' their association. The connection is as clearly one for business purposes as is that of members in a partnership, or of The workman by whose handicraft the stock-holders in a corporation. Although it is a comparatively novel species of relationship, it has become an established one, and therefore calls for the application of those general principles of law and equity which are applied to other species of business associations. According to these principles, we think a workman or a number of workmen engaged in the same branch of industry, and banded together for their mutual profit in the pursuit of their common vocation, may acquire a right of property in a trade mark designed to distinguish their workmanship from that of other persons, and that a trade mark so owned is entitled to the same protection as other trade marks.",21,Trade Marks Bill

Then, in the case to which I previously referred-that of Hetterman v. Powers, in Kentucky, the Court, amongst other things, saidIn order to get the benefit of the superior reing sanitary ancl humane conditions, givputation of cigars made by them, the appellees select and apply the label as a distinguishing brand or mark. And it would be strange if this thing of value, this certificate of good workmanship, and which makes the goods made by them sell, and thus increases demand for their work, be entitled to no protection, because those making the selection and application are not business men, engaged in selling cigars of their own. The man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer in that larger sense in which the word "" business"" has come to be used by statesmen and legislators. General address all this to members in the Labour corner? dressing it to the honourable member? open to conviction. V. Mooneliss, which was a case of boycott, the Court held that there was no competent evidence of boycott, but they saidOn the whole case, therefore, we are of opinion, that the law may be justly invoked by organized labour to protect from piracy and intrusion the fruits of its skill and handiwork, and that brain and muscle may be the subjects of trade law rules as well as tangible property. a Union Label Act having been repealed by a State? except with the object of substituting a better Act. So far as I have been able to trace the matter, the States have gone on, clown to 1903 and 1904, passing these union trade mark laws, and in no case can I discover that they have receded. May I point out, for the information of honourable members, that in 1898 only twenty-eight of the States territories had union trade mark laws; but during the six years that have elapsed, the number has been increased to fortv. Then it has been stated that the conditions in the United States are different from ours; that in America they have no labour laws. I have heard it stated that there are no laws which in any way resemble our factory, anti-sweating, or industrial conciliation laws, and so on. In one sense, and to a limited extent, that is true. That is to say, I do not think there is any Act which, from the beginning, compels arbitration and conciliation. I am clear, from what I have seen, that with a very few exceptions there is no law fixing wages generally. But there is a huge bodv of Labour legislation which in all other respects is quite as stringent as ours for meeting protection to wages and to the labourer, and in some few cases fixing the wages, more particularly for work done for the State or for municipalities. I intend to briefly indicate the nature of these laws. There are laws in twenty-seven States providing for the appointment of inspectors of factories and work-shops, whose duties consist in visiting and inspecting factories, work-shops, mills, and, in some cases, mercantile establishments, sweat-shops, bakeries, laundries, and building construction work, and enforcing the laws concerning the same. In regard to mining labour, a very extensive set of statutes has been passed in the mining States. I can give honourable members the details if they desire them. Then the statutes relating to hours of labour which have been enacted in various States must be considered in five groups, namely-(1 ) General laws, which merely fix what may be regarded as a day's labour in the absence of contract; (2) laws defining what shall constitute a day's work on public roads; (3) laws limiting the hours oflabour per day on public works generally; (4) laws which limit the hours of labour in certain occupations; (5) laws which specify the hours per day or per week during which women and children may be employed. The statutes considered in the first four groups relate to employees regardless of age or sex. Then laws exist as to the payment of wages-that is, the times and mode of payment-certai n piivi leges and special protection in relation to wages, such as freedom from attachment of wages, preference given to wages, prohibition of deductions from or fines upon wages. In some States notice has to be given-in some cases thirty days' noticebefore reducing wages. Four States have statutes in force fixing the minimum wage rate for labour on public works. In California and Nebraska the minimum rate is fixed at 2 dol. per day, the law in Nebraska requiring the work to be performed by",22,Trade Marks Bill

A Delaware statute provides that the daily wages paid for a legal day's work to labourers,-workmen, or mechanics in the employ of the municipal corporation of the cityt of Wilmington, or of any contractor or sub-contractor for public works for that city, shall not be less than the prevailing rate for a day's work in the same trade or occupation in the locality where the work is done. Then there are laws as to employers' liability, coercive boycotting, black-listing on the part of employers, and intimidation of employees and employers. eral trade union law, which was passed on 29th June, 1886, provides for the incorporation of international trades unions. "" National the associations ing two or more branches in the States or territories of the United Statesf or the purpose of aiding their members to become more skilled and efficient workers, for the regulation of their wages and hours, and for securing conditions of labour, or benefits such as obtain in friendly societies, or such other objects for which working people may lawfully combine. that legislation enacted? commerce sections of the Constitution, I think. That shows the extent to which Congress has gone. Whether its action is constitutional, I am not prepared to say. But the fact remains that in America the Federation has done what we are told it is improper to do-it has extended Federal recognition to trade unions. creating Boards of Conciliation and Arbitration. These bodies differ very much in many of the States, as well as under the Congressional law. pointed-in some cases temporarily, and in others permanently-and an opportunity is f iven to the unions to appear before them, f they do so appear, the decisions of the Boards are binding, and can be enforced. In my opinion it is not a valid argument to say that no labour laws have been enacted in America. As a matter of fact, very extensive labour laws have been passed there. members who urge that in Australia we have industrial and factory leeislation. and that, therefore, no necessity exists for the introduction of the union label, "" What is the constant cry that we hear in regard to that legislation from those whom they represent "" ? Are we not .frequently told that such laws are injurious, that they are not effective, and that they ought to be repealed? Do we not hear that they do not prevent sweating, and that they only make matters worse? "" Are we not constantly assured from those honourable members, and the section of the community whose views they so ably represent, that that sort of legislation ought to be repealed as quickly as possible? In the view which I am now presenting, the quesA Fedtion at issue is not union as against non-union labour. It is a question of the workers, as a great body, asking that the same recognition in trade marks law should be extended trade unions,"" within to them as is extended to those who are meaning of the Act, signify not workers. They say, "" It is true that of working people havin. many cases litigation has to be resorted to to get our rights. It is true that in too many instances it is difficult to get exact justice without friction, ancl without irritation,' by means of arbitration. It is difficult to secure exact justice in many cases by means of wages boards. We desire an opportunity -bu t only with the employers' consentto ask the people of Australia whether they are willing to support us. We wish to appeal to them peaceably, and apart from any restrictive enactments."" That is a fair and strong argument. The unions cannot possibly succeed unless public opinion is with them. If my honourable friends opposite are right, and if the public are against them, the very worse thing they can do is to put a union label upon their goods. If public opinion is in favour of supportThen laws have been passed ing union labour, is it not a fair thing to give it a chance of doing so? If the people are opposed to union labour, is it not a very good thing-fro m the standThev are appoint of those who oppose this Bill-that the unions should have an opportunity to attach a distinctive label to their goods at the earliest opportunity ? If the public want goods to which a particular mark is affixed, why should not they have them? When we are told that only a minority of unionists desire the adoption of the union label, is not that a cogent argument that they will not boycott the rest of the people ? I should like to ask honourable The unionists of Australia number only about 7 per cent, or 8 per cent, of the population.",23,Trade Marks Bill

We have been told that the passing of these provisions will lead to a boycott by labour, and the word "" boycott "" is used in a derogatory sense. I wish to direct attention to a memorandum on the union label clauses which was addressed to the Commonwealth Government by the president, executive officers, and council of the 'Central Council of Employers of Australia. to personal matters. I cannot give the exact date of the memorandum, but I find in it a reference to 24th January, though it bears the date of 23rd August, 1905. is signed by Mr Walpole, as secretary, and I think that it is amongst the papers laid on the table of the House. It is a warning against these clauses. In this memorandum the following statement is made:Another danger may crop up speedily. If the employer gives way to union pressure, and for the sake of the union label accepts union conditions in their entirety, those people in the community who object to the union label goods may refuse to buy them. In extreme cases pressure might also be brought to bear upon the unfortunate manufacturer through his trade creditors or his banker, if he accepts union conditions. ing as it does from Mr Walpole, who represents the Central Council of Employers? Is it a threatened boycott, or is it not? Is it not a statement by Mr Walpole that if we desire to do this the great banking institutions and trade creditors smaller traders, and prevent fhem from doing that which they might otherwise do? This is the first and only real threat of a boycott thai I have known to be made during the whoTe of these proceedings. I accept this statement, coming, as it does, from 1 Mr Walpole, as emanating from a source which is supposed to be aware of it. but I will say that I ""do not believe Mr Walpole on all occasions thoroughly and properly represents the Employers' Council. Banks, that the statement in question is not accurate. fully and frankly accept the assurance of my honourable friend. with the employers, and the courteous, frank, fair, and outspoken way in which they have always met me, leads me to believe that they would not lend themselves to any-thing of the k in d ; but I wish to warn the country against accepting the statements of Mr Walpole on all occasions. I do not think that on all occasions he properly represents the employers, and in many respects he may do their cause great injury. As this statement has been put before the country by Mr Walpole, who may be taken by the people to properly represent the Employers' Council, I think that the latter would do well to see that such memoranda are properly scanned before they are It sent out. I wish now to deal with the constitutional aspect of the matter. If these clauses, from a moral and political standpoint, ought to be enacted, then we should enact them-, unless, as I take it , we can clearly see that they are beyond the range of our power. Are they clearly beyond the range of our power? I should like to remind honourable members that, under subsection xviii., section 51, of the Constitution, power is given to the Parliament to make laws with respect to copyright,. patents of inventions and designs, and trade marks. It has been contended for a very long time by those who hold that the provisions now before us are unconstitutional, that the power of the Parliament in this respect is restricted to the passing of laws relating to marks which are used by the seller of goods to denote that they are sold by him. I have referred to some American cases which very considerably shake that view. One of the clauses which we passed last night distinctly departs from it. will put pressure upon the English legislation. able members look at the section of the Constitution to which I have referred, they will see that it gives us power to legislate with regard to trade marks. There are two separate words. It is possible to take a broad view; it is possible to take a restricted one. Eveni f we take the restricted view, I am not sure that the contention that it is outside our power to deal with such a matter as this is correct. I should like to call the I will say, on behalf of the attention of honourable members to a point which does not seem to have occurred to some of the critics of this power.

EDWARDS -Hear, hear; I am with the Attorney-General up to the hilt. We have not said that the unions are to be able to apply the mark to goods which do not belong to them. We have not given them power to apply a mark to goods; but we have said that a man in trade, having a right to .sell his goods, may apply to them a particular mark, if it be true. I should think it would take a lot of argument to show that such is not a trade mark. It is a trade mark used for the purposes of trade. If we take a broader view of the matteri f we remember that ours is a Constitution for all time-it seems somewhat remarkable to assume that for all time as a Commonwealth we are to be restricted to legislation in respect of just such trade marks as were used and known in commerce when the Constitution Act was passed.

Senator Sir Josiah Symon said that it-was a moot question. When we have twodistinguished lawyers, one saying that it isa question of extreme difficulty, and another, when in a position of responsibility,, declaring that it is a moot question, arewe, as a Federal Parliament, at oncegoing to admit for all time that we have no power to pass these provisions?

Protests have been, made by residents in all parts of the country against the adoption of the union label proposals, and we find that the great newspapers of the Commonwealth are almost unanimously opposed to them. Attempts have been made to associate some honourable members who are opposing the union label provisions with the statements made by Mr Walpole, the secretary of the Employers' Federation. I feel sure that honourable members in the Labour corner would not care to shoulder the responsibility for all the utterances of Tom Mann, and other persons of a similar character, and therefore it is scarcely fair to expect honourable members who are op^ posed to the union label provisions to accept the responsibility for all the statements made by Mr Walpole.

As the honourable member says, it has been on tlie notice-paper for two years, and yet we have not been asked to deal with it until the fag-end of this session, when important work still remains to be done.

Not only have the provisions been altered in the way I have indicated, but as was ably pointed out by the honourable and learned member for Angas, and the honourable and learned member for Corinella, amendments had been made in other clauses-apparentl y in the hope that they would escape notice -in order that the powers desired to be conferred in the first place should be granted. Our thanks are due to the honourable and learned members referred to, for the ability with which they have indicated the true meaning of the provisions to which I refer. which alterations were accepted by the Attorney-General last night caused me to suspe:t that he knew all about the defects sought to be remedied, and made them good, only when he was found out. Verylittle has been said by members on the Government side in support of these provisions. The honourable member for Bland has spoken, but not a word has been heard from any Minister, except the Attorney General. The public are entitled to know why certain Ministers have changed their views since last session. now submitted for our consideration, although they were drafted before the Prime Minister announced his policv two years' ago, have not been embodied in any policy submitted to the country. No Government has seen fit to take the responsibility of bringing them forward. It was left to a private member of the Senate to introduce them. this House they have been nursed by the Attorney-General, and the honourable member for Bland has acted as medical adviser, and has carefully watched over them to see that no harm befell them. We have a right to know why the whole of the business of the country is being turned upinterests they are submitted. Only the side down, in order that certain new conditions, the operation of which no one can foretell, may be introduced into our industrial life. one reason for all this hurry, namely, that support of these proposals, he declared, the members of the Labour Party are determined, before the session closes, that the principle of preference to unionists shall in some form or other be embodied in cur Statutes. Honourable, members must have a vivid recollection of the struggle that took place over the question of preference to unionists in connection with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Government of the day, rather than accept a modification of the provisions contained in the B ill , elected to leave office, and now they have succeeded in bringing to heel those who formerly opposed them. If these provisions are passed, the Labour Party will claim that they have achieved a triumph, and no doubt they will have done so. They will say that they compelled a recognition of their principles. Of course, the Attorney-General, the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Minister of Home Affairs are perfectly consistent, inasmuch as they supported the proposed provision The readiness with in the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill . But it is only fair to the country that the other members of the Ministry, who, upon that occasion, told us that to grant a preference to unionists was-wrong, should rise and explain why they have changed their minds, and why a proposal which was then so baneful has suddenly become so salutary. changed their minds; they have merely changed their seats. MrM c COLL It is due to the Committeee and to honourable members who folThe proposals lowed those gentlemen at that time that they should state their reasons for their changed convictions. If they still believe that preference to unionists is a bad thing, it is only fair that they should not make a party question of this proposal. It should be an open question with them, and they should be at liberty to vote in accordance with their convictions, Since they have reached If that were done, honourable members upon this side of the House would be quite content. It is not fair, however, that members of the Ministry should be compelled to vote under duress. The Attorney-General did not tell us that these provisions would prove of great benefit to those in whose special other night the honourable member for Bland distinctly stated that he did not think any very great benefit would be derived from I can only conceive of them by members of trade unions. His was based rather upon the benefit which the public would derive. He said that the adoption of the union label would determine the quality of goods, and would protect the worker by insuring that they were manufactured under fair conditions. How.",30,Trade Marks Bill
129,Mr Joseph Cook,"They have notI ask, can it determine the quality of goods? The worker, as we all know, has out the conditions that will probably, be to take the materials which are placed in laid down if these clauses are brought into his hands. Although he may put the best operation. of work into those materials, the goods which he produces may not be of high quality. Indeed, it is probable that these union labels will shelter very inferior articles.

We do not think that those who claim to represent the workers in this House have a monopoly of wisdom. The Attorney-General, in defending the introduction of the union label legislation in America, showed that it was intended to cope with a set of conditions entirely different from those prevailing in Australia. Powerful trusts were grinding the workers down as low as possible, and they had to band themselves together, and resort to the use of the union label to protect themselves against, not only these trusts, but the enormous influx of coloured and other cheap labour, which' was then pouring into the United States. We have no such conditions here, and why should we throw in this bone of contention ? Why should we pass provisions which will set individual against individual, and class against class, without conferring a benefit upon evenone section of the community ? The people of America are between the upper and nether mill-stones. They are ground down between the trusts on the one:hand, and the trade unions on the other. HadI known that this matter was to come up for consideration, I should have taken care, when in the United States recently, to collect f u l l information, both for and against the proposal; but 1 had other work to do, and, therefore, did not give special attention to it. I did not hear much about the union label, but was certainly informed that wherever it had been introduced the cost of living had been enormously increased. Within the last fifteen years the cost of living in districts where trade union label legislation prevails has increased from 20 to 25 per cent. member account for that? simple. The trusts, which must make their profits-anc l make perhaps more than they ought to do-hav e control on the one hand, whilst the unions have control on the other. Wages are exceptionally high, and every demand on the part of the trusts I for increased profits, and on the part of the unions for higher wages, results in an increase in the price of goods to the general consumer. That is one reason why, without any desire whatever to block this measure, I would strongly urge upon the Government to withdraw these provimarks, and thus bring a most useful measure into operation; but let us refrain from dealing with the question of the union label until next session. By that time we shall have had f u l l opportunity to consider it, and will be able to approach it with open minds, and possessing f u l l information on . the subject. We can point to only one country where these provisions have been in operation, and they were brought into force there because the situation required something of the kind. But such legislation has never been adopted in any other great industrial country. Having regard to the infancy of our industries, why should we rush these provisions on to the statute book when we do not know what their effect will be? They mav prove beneficial, whilst, on the other hand, they may prove a curse; but once they are placed on the statute-book, it may be very difficult to repeal them. In our desire to promote the welfare of our industrial life, we must have regard to two considerations. We must remember the man wTio has to find the money as well as the worker.

Whatever our conditions may be, let them be settled, at least, for a time, and then the people will know exactly what their position is. As it is, they never know what special legislation may be passed that will have the effect of making, or marring, the industries in which they are engaged. We desire to have large manufactories, but who is going to start fresh undertakings? Under present conditions, no one will feel disposed to do so.

I am only a worker. It seems to me that the trend of legislation in the Commonwealth is more and more to set individual against individual, class against class, and State against State. Five years ago, when the union was consummated, we fondly hoped that we were going to be one people. But although we have a political union, a union of heart and of feeling is further off than it was. Who are responsible for this state of affairs? The responsibility rests with those who control the affairs of the Commonwealth. It appears to suit some people to maintain this unsatisfactory position. I do not propose to say anything about the constitutional aspect of the situation. That is a matter which must be threshed out by the Attorney-General and the other lawyers in the House. But we have some three or four leading barristers in the Government who are constitutional authorities, and I should like to hear them endorse the opinion expressed by the Attorney-General.

If the union label be such a good thing, how is it that all efforts to force it upon Canada during the last ten years have been in vain? How is it that it has not been adopted in England? House of Commons passed it in an amended form, but the Senate rejected it. MrM c COLL that they could not constitutionally pass such legislation. Is the Prime Minister prepared to chance the enactment of these clauses, or will he follow the wise course that he laid down some time ago in connection with the Conciliation"" and Arbitration Bill? Those who are opposed to these provisions feel that they will bring discredit upon tlie Commonwealth, and that they will force men to join unions against their w ill. We feel that the union label will bring into vogue a system of espionage, which will be degrading to those who take part in it. When we look the whole matter fairlv in the face, we cannot refrain from asSng, ""What good will it confer upon any one?"" If its value be so problematical, why should we waste our time, and cause trouble and confusion, by endeavouring to pass such legislation? We have so far only touched upon the fringe of the work that the Commonwealth should take over from the States. powers under section 51 of the Constitution that remain untouched-power s that should be exercised for the benefit of this great Commonwealth. But we are shelving great and important questions, and wasting time in the consideration of such miserable matters as those now before us. Judging by the opinions expressed in the press, the workers' label is not popular. It will be an instrument of coercion and boycott. It will force.non-unionists to join unions, and in a little time may lead to the introduction of the walking delegate. The benefits to flow from such legislation are so unreal and shadowy that I feel compelled to opDosei t , and trust that the majority of honourable members will consider it their duty to reject these proposals. very elaborate discussion which took place on the second reading of the B ill , and which has also occurred in Committee, we should, as far as possible, place a I do not consider that the Attorney-General consumed an unreasonable amount of time in his clear exposition of the reasons which induce him to move the insertion of these provisions. He put his case with good temper and ability, and with the usual clearness as to his meaning. I agree with I think that the Canadian him that, on some points, there may be a fair difference of opinion. One should not be too confident as to what is the law on any subject, and constitutional law is so I believe it was shown broad, and, with respect to our Constitution, in such a probationary stage, if I may use the term, that only a juvenile in legal matters would be cock-sure in any expression of opinion in regard to it. But one may be permitted to express his convictions with emphasis without being dogmatic. I understand the prefatory apology of Mr Cussen, a lawyer whose mature judgment we respect. There are few lawyers, no matter how eminent, who have not learned by experience to be humble in judgment, and who, when their opinions are sought by solicitors or others, will not indicate that there may be some doubt on the point in regard to which they have been consulted. Indeed, it is not unusual for an opinion to end with the suggestion that the matter might well be referred to the determination of the Court. Therefore, I do not pay too much attention to the modesty of Mr Cussen's prefatory observations. Nor do I place much stress We have on the fact that Senator Sir Josiah Symon assisted a member of the Labour Partv to perfect some clauses which were inserted in the Bill in the Senate. Senator Sir Josiah. Symon, as well as an able, is a tactfut man; and if he'sees that the suaviler in modo will soften opposition, is caoable of employing it. But his opinion"" in regard to the proposals which the Labour Party are now supporting are clearly indicated by the remarks read by the Attorney-General, who I do not ' think would contend that the action of Senator Sir Tosiah Symon, in suggesting that the wording of certain clauses might be susceptible of improvement, was an adoption of the trade union label principle. It is the primary duty of members of an Opposition to criticise proposals with a view to the discovery of the truth underlying them; but when a principle has been approved, honourable members are justified in seeing that clear expression is given to the wilf",34,Thomson Wh Y Should Sions Let Us Pass Those Relating To Trade

He enunciated several moral'propositions and truisms which we cannot controvert any more than we can say that they have the slightest applicability to the subject under discussion. In this connection I would remind honourable members of Burke's warning against the ""delusive plausibilities of the moral politicians.""

It would be morally right for me to walk to Adelaide, but it would be absurd for Parliament to legislate to require me to do so. Then, at the conclusion, of his speech, the honourable gentleman assumed that the electors who were opposed to the adoption of the non-union label are in a minority, and asked if the principle that the minority shall rule is to be applied in the present case. action of the Opposition to which he referred when he asked that question was taken with a view to emphasize the rights of a minority, not to rule, but to express its opinions. Correlative with that right of a minority is the right of a majority to rule until the opinion of the minority, if a sound one, has been adopted by the majority. But these moral propositions and truisms, like the "" flowers that bloom in the spring,"" have "" nothing to do with the case."" So far as our powers 'to legislate on this subject are concerned, I think the matter has been fairly discussed, and I do not wish to COOK I think that we go over ground which has been well trodden.

We must be careful not to accept the statements of honourable members on this subject without the qualification attached I might refer briefly to some of the decisions mentioned by the Attorney-General, as having been given in America, as to the validity of union labels. point out that all these decisions have been given under States laws,"" they are States decisions, and as such they are incontrovertible. Under the Trade and Commerce section of the American Constitution, the Federal Parliament has assumed power with, regard to trade marks, and, I think, copyright, but that power, being connected with the trade and commerce clause, can only be exercised in relation to goodsand this is significant-that are intended for trade and commerce between the States, or ""for export to foreign countries. balance of the trade marks nower remains with the States, and is, I believe, exclusive. Therefore,^ the States, wherever they have passed laws to allow of the registration of union labels, so as to protect them against piracy, have been acting perfectly within their constitutional powers. Congress could not have assumed such power under the trade and commerce clause. Upon the question of the Federal power, I wish to quote the opinion of one of the labour leaders of America. Mr Samuel Gompers, who was examined before the Industrial Commission on the conditions of capital and labour, in 1901. At page 629, of one of the volumes of that Comthe President of the Federation of Labour, but not a lawyer-said We realize that under the conditions of the United States a trade mark or label cannot be protected unless the party owns the proprietary right in the article covered by the label, transacts business with foreign nations, or with a tribe of Indians, and that makes it exceedingly difficult to overcome, so that we have not made any real, serious attempt to secure national legislation on that subject. That statement of a representative workman, who desires to obtain Federal protection for these labels, is certainly very significant. attempt has been made to secure such protection, because it is recognised that the Constitution bars the wav. Federal power has been assumed, whether rightly or not, under the trade and commerce clause, which deals with goods which pass from one State to another or to or from foreign countries. Therefore, the trade marks power has arisen in connection with goods, and the label divorced from the goods would not be recognised by the trade marks law. under the Constitution. That strengthens my opinion that the High Court may hold the provisions now before us to be ultra vires of our power. A t the same I would time, I admit that if the Attorney-General believes in the policy of placing such legislation as that now proposed upon our statute-book, he ought not to hesitate to go forward with it because there is a reasonable doubt as to whether our powers exend to sanctioning the use of trade-union labels. We ought not to commit constitutional suicide by refraining under a doubt with, regard to our powers. The Attorney General appears to have abandoned all pretence that a union label may be used as a registered trade mark, but he intends The to penalize any man who uses a label in defiance of its ownership by some one else. He could not, however, adopt these penal clauses, and give them efficacy, unless the Bill had been so framed as to cover union labels. The point of our observations at a previous stage was, that the variations from the English Act, whether they had been made deliberately or otherwise, although making no express provision for union labels, were of such a character that union labels would be brought within the scope of the Bill. Emphasis has been given to this view by the fact that the clauses now before us assume that union labels are covered by the B ill , and merely provide that penalties shall be inflicted upon any persons who pirate such labels. It seems to me that it would have been far tetter if we had followed the Canadian and American precedents. In Canada, a Bill was introduced, for six or seven vears in succession, dealing speciallv with union labels, because it was iecoani. ed that they did not c come within the descriotion of trade marks. That measure was called "" A Bill to deal with Labour Union Labels."" They stated in clear ancl unpharisaical language what they meant to do. Clause2 of that measure providedI t indicates that no serious Every labour union which, before the passing of this Act, has adopted or used, or which hereafter adopts or uses a label to designate, make Again, the known, or distinguish any goods, wares, or merchandise, or other product of labour, as having",36,Thomson Wh Y Should Sions Let Us Pass Those Relating To Trade
168,"Mission's Report, Mr Gompers","wh o wasbeen made, manufacturedj produced, prepared, packed, handled, or put on sale by such labour union, or a member thereof, may register. That is clear, straight, and genuine; and there can be no mistake as to what it meant; whereas we are being asked to make provision in a much less direct form, by merely providing for the imposition of penalties upon those who improperly use such labels. The first series of amendments introduced by the Attorney-General were a little more definite upon this point, because they defined a union trade mark. But now all definitions have disappeared, and all we have is a workers' trade mark. But, as if there were some unfortunate association attached to the word "" union,"" it has now been dropped altogether, and the word "" association "" has been substituted for it. might not be confined to the unions. professed to regard any interference with the proposed union label as an interference with trade, and he altogether ignored the association between "" trade "" and "" mark."" I should like to turn for a few minutes to the circumstances connected with the introduction of the union label into America, and the assumption that the conditions which might have justified its introduction there at a certain stage, exist here to an extent that will warrant us in following in the footsteps of the United States. I conceive that, at certain stages of the agitation between labour and capital, justification may have existed for resorting to the label as an expedient to tone down the oppressive action of capital. I mentioned, when speaking on' this question before, that Acts had had to be passed in America to prevent capitalists from excluding non-union labour from their employment. union label, as a weapon of offence, might have had a sort of quasi-justification that could not be urged to-day under the conditions of labour and capital in Australia. We have been told that"" the union label was first introduced in 1874 in connection with the cigar-making industry. In 1868, between 11,000 and 12,000 Chinese were landed on the Pacific Coast, and many of them found their way into the cigar-making industry of California. The result was that a great, many white people were thrown out of employment, and great distress resulted. The condition of affairs at that time has been referred to by' Miss Helen Campbell, in her Prisoners of Poverty. She shows that the most appalling results followed from the competition of Chinese labour with the white workers in the cigar industry. She tells us that, upon going round among the tenements of the cigar-workers, she found a family of seven, three of them being under ten years of age, and all the children being girls, in a room measuring 12 f t . by 14 f t . The tobacco lay in heaps in the room; the place was filthy dirty, and was pervaded by a rank smeil; and it was almost inconceivable that human life could exist under such conditions. found working for Afghans and Assyrians in Australia, in making up wearing apparel. America, and I am saying that I could understand that there might have been some justification at certain stages for the introAttorney-General duction of the union label in connection with labour agitations in America. Miss Campbell tells usTwo of the children sat on the floor stripping leaves, and another on a small stool. A girl of twenty sat near them, and all alike had sores on lips and cheeks and on the hands. Children from five or six years up can be taught to strip, and thus add to the week's income. That was in connection with the cigarmakers' strikes excited by the competition of coloured labour. Also, in connection with this matter, President Roosevelt saidI have visited these pest-holes personally^ and can assure you if smokers only saw how these cigars are made, we should not need any legislative action against this system. Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that the labour conditions became so bad that at times the men became desperate, and resorted to desperate expeTherefore, the dients. For years there were continual struggles in the icigar trade. There was a very big strike in 1887, when 10,000 workers went out, and there was also a strike in 1883 in Cincinnati, which lasted for thirteen months. But, as the result of the better organization of labour, and the greater resulting power, strikes have gradually diminished. We are told by John Graham Brooks, one of the advocates of the union label, who admits some of the unfortunate results of its operation, thatThe attempt to understand the American trade union is incomparably more perplexing because of the racial effects. The constant pressure through immigration, of a great multitude of half-skilled labourers, representing far lower standards of life , and at the same time introduc-",37,Thomson Wh Y Should Sions Let Us Pass Those Relating To Trade

I am endeavouring to summarize from a dispassionate authority the impression which was left on his mind. As in one case, I have quoted extracts from the evidence of a labour representative in connection with the Federal jurisdiction, I will now quote the opinion of a friend of labour. This is the view of Mr mentions that in some cases-for instance, Maurice Low upon the conditions which obtain in the ""United StatesViewing the present condition of trades unionmanship. In this connection he saysism in the United States in the light of the history of the movement in Great Britain, the men whose opinions are here presented believe that in the United States trades unionism has not yet advanced to the high level it now occupies in Great Britain. That is the admission of a friend of labour as to the comparative ineffectiveness of the American Statutes to protect, and give the desired status to labour. not without some reason that I allege that the conditions which prevail in America are not reproduced here. We ought not, upon the theory of moral right, to experiment in a direction, the development of which appears to have been somewhat unfortunate. A t the same time, I wish to say that if the conditions in Australia were similar to those which obtained in California in-1874, I should hesitate before I opposed the adoption of the union label. Apart from the constitutionality But I ask honof the matter-that is the word that we use in connection with Federal and States powers-apar t from the fact that the label does not come within the trade marks law, there is no broad opposition from the point of view of mere naked rights that can be urged against the adoption of this proposal. If it be true-as is stated in the evidence of some of the labour leaders in America-that their intention was not so much to perfect the conditions of manufacture as to strengthen unionism, and if their efforts in that direction have led to such extraordinary developments, I hold I thank the honourable that with oertain Qualifications rendered necessary by the different conditions which obtain in the two countries, we may reasonably assume that similar results will be brought about here. It has been alleged that in America the use of the label leads to better workmanship, and improved conditions, from the point of view of the consumer. In this connection, Mr Brooks saysI was referring to the It is hardly open to doubt that such action upon However, I am not going the part of municipalities would greatlv strengthen the use of the label, at least until such time as the experiment was found to fail. Upon its theoretic side, the label stands, primarily, for "" better pay and for improved conditions of labour.""

It has been usual to claim for the label that it represented merely lhat the work was done under strictly union conditions. So far as these conditions-wages , hours, sanitaI think it is tions, &c -stan d for Higher excellence (as in many cases they do) it may be claimed that the label also represents a better quality of work.

176,Mr Glynn,"admit this, although they have an organization of extraordinary completeness and efficiency. . . . In the case of the hatters it is even more difficult to trace any relation whatever between the label and quality or improved conditions. Many shops, conspicuous for the high quality of their product, wages, and entire circumstances under which the labourer works, have never use'd the label, nor is there any likelihood of t'heir so doing. Subsequently he acknowledges the unfortunate developments which have characterized the use of the label , without at the same 1 time denying that there have been gross abuses of power by the capitalistic classes as well. I should like to refer to one case which was mentioned by the Attorney General. He sought to lead the Committee tobelieve that some of the English Judges had considered that there might be trade marks in use which were necessarily connected with the proprietorship of goods. The case to which he referred was that of Somerville v. Schembri, which is reported in XIV. Appeal Cases, page 453. In that case it was hejd that the mere fact that the label used by cigarette manufacturers had also been used by other trades did not affect its exclusive use by the cigarette manufacturers for the purpose of cigarettes. It was I'aid down that ""exclusive use"" did not meain that the label must be used only by one firm, but that it must be used only by that firm in connection with the manufacture of a particular article, which is quite a different matter. In this connection Lord Cranworth, page 457, says"" The right which a manufacturer has in his trade mark is the exclusive right to use it for the purpose of indicating where, or by whom, or at what manufactory the article to which it is affixed was manufactured."" As soon, therefore, as a trade mark has been so employed in the market as to indicate to purchasers that the goods to which it is attached are the manufacture of a particular firm, it becomes to that extent, the exclusive property of the firm; and no one else has a right to copy it, or even to appropriate any part of it, if by such appropriation unwary purchasers may be induced to believe that they are getting goods which were made by the firm to whom the trade mark belongs. Had it not been for the views expressed by the court of appeal in giving judgment, it would hardly have been necessary for their lordships to observe that the acquisition of an exclusive right to a mark or name in connection with a particular article of commerce cannot entitle the owner of that right t i prohibit the use by others of such mark or name in connection with goods of a totally different character; and that such use by others can as little interfere with his acquisition of the right. I have no desire to trespass any longer upon the patience of honourable members. I think I have clearSy shown that the inMr Glynn. traduction of this label is not warranted by the social conditions of the people. very attentively to the greater portion of the speech delivered by the Attorney General, and I think that the weakness of his case was shown by the length of his utterance. When he has a good cause he puts it very pithily, and occupies only about half the time that he occupied to-day. I regret that he scarcely touched upon the points in these proposals to which I take exception, and I may say at once that my objection to them has no reference whatever to unionism. I object to them upon general principles. The Attorney-General has said that these proposals will place workers and capitalists upon the same footing. I join issue with him upon that statement. It is impossible to put the two classes upon the same footing, because there is no analogy between their positions. The enterprise of the capitalist is based upon ascertainable facts and business principles. It is of general benefit to the community. general benefit to the community? member will allow me to develop my argument in my own way. The advantage of a trade mark is that it acts as a guide to quality. Having tested goods bearing a certain mark, the consumer knows for what he has to ask in order to secure the same quality. But a workers' label would be used for a different purpose. It would simply indicate the peculiar political tenets of a particular section of workers. member heard of that being done? done. ence of the workers' label in Australia. It would certainly give no guarantee of quality. Under the system adopted by mediaeval guilds, membership indicated skill. Men were allowed to join such guilds only when they possessed special training. But the workers' labels would not be an indication of the skill of those engaged in producing the goods to which they were affixed.

And so it was with the ancient guilds. A certain test was applied to determine the skill of intending members. They had to pass through an apprenticeship, so to speak, and that was a guarantee that those belonging to the guilds were specially skilled, and, therefore, entitled to some special consideration. But those who use these Jabels will not be required to pass any lest. The use of the label will divide tlie workers into two hostile camps. It will assist the partisans on either side to more effectually use their strength. The Attorney-General this afternoon read an extract from a document issued by the Employers' Federation, and signed by Mr sorted to as the result of this system. Walpole. In doing so, he unconsciously supported one of my arguments against tbe workers' label"", because I hold that such a label will lead to the establishment of a boycott on both sides. I believe that the result will be ""war to the knife."" When this proposal was first introduced, it consisted simply of one clause, to provide a particular weapon, the union label. But now unionists and non-unionists are to be put on an equal footing. As the Attorney General has said, there is to be no discrimination of class, f do not think that the situation will be improved in this way. The only outcome will be the supplying of both parties with more improved methods of injuring each other. I have no hesitation in saying that both parties will use it as an instrument of boycott. There would be at least a silent boycott; there would be a determination on the part of each party to avoid purchasing the goods of the other. The possibility is that in that respect the unions might be worsted; it would depend largely upon the purchasing power of the partisans on either side. Apart from any consideration as to who might be worsted, my desire is that there shall be no clashing. Without offering one word against unionism, I would say to my honourable friends of the Labour Party that I think they make a mistake in rushing towards extremes. unionism has received in this State so far as I know, has been due to that. honourable and learned member for Corinella last night anticipated something I had intended to say in regard to the Wages Boards. I heartily concur with his -suggestion that there should be a mark indicating whether or not goods have been manufactured under Wages Boards conditions. That would give us a clear-cut line on a national rather than a sectional basis, and no one could cavil at it. If the proposal were to provide for a label showing whether or not the goods to which, it was applied had been made under Wages Board's conditions, I should be distinctly in favour of it. But to go further than that is, to my mind, to set aside the elements of political economy. As the honourable member for Echuca has said to-night, the proposal is to bring in all sorts of devices to shorten the hours and to reduce the standard of labour. I have seen rules, in which it is laid down that men should walk to their work as slowly as possible in the employers' lime. That is the sort of device that would be reber any proof that such a rule is in practice? looks at Wages, a book written by Professor Walker, he will find the rules I have mentioned.

If the suggestion made by the honourable and learned member for Corinella were adopted, what justification would there be for going further? If we do go further, we shall simply pander to the idiosyncracies of certain people. The workers' label will not be an indication of superior skill. The abandonment of the original clause, which confined the mark to goods produced by unionists, is an acknowledgment of that. The label will not be a mark of quality. ways an indication of quality? an article bearing a trade mark, and on finding that it is good, asks again for the same article. that the label will not be worth anything to the worker, but will be simply a badge to provoke strife. It will be something worse than the orange and green. It will be of no value to the community, but will help the opposing factions to disturb the peace. I think it should be deprecated by every law-abiding citizen. If I had my way, I should legislate against any attempt to set class against class in connection with such matters. With the passing of these provisions', the supporters of the non-unionists would, in my opinion, exercise a I do not know greater boycott than would the others. There would be, as I have sa'id. a silent boycott. It would be a case of "" Take only the goods of the side you espouse,"" and the whole matter would be setled in that way by the two opposing sections. That would not be for thebenefitof anybody. It only aggravates the position to require the consent of the employee. As the honourable member for Echuca has pointed out, employers, if their men are squeezing out of them higher rates of wages than leave a certain amount of profit, might enter into one man collusion with their employees to increase prices. That has been done in California, under the voluntary application of the trade union label; but it is now being, proposed here that we shall pass a law which will compel employers to obtain the consent of their employees to use these labels, and the two will have to work together against the interests of the consumer, who must always suffer if rates of wages are too high. I was impressed by an article by Mr Graham Brooks, which I read the other day, upon I think that it is. the co-operative method adopted in BelI can remember when it gium.

Although a worker who is being paid abnormally high wages may gain in one direction, he will lose in ten other directions, and if through ill-health or some other cause he loses his job, he will find that he must pay very dearly for everything he needs.",41,Thomson Wh Y Should Sions Let Us Pass Those Relating To Trade

We are too prone to adopt laws because they are in force in other parts of the world. It is very easy to make a quotation from one and another authority in support of any such proposal; but I recollect that in 1874, when the Californian law was brought forward, leading writers were of opinion that it was a great advantage that the trade union label could be legalized only by the laws of the States, and not by a Federal law, because if one State chooses to go to extremes, others, later on, seeing the mistake that has been made, will avoid following her example. What is now proposed, however, is to legislate in regard to the trade union monwealth before we have had an opportunity to test the usefulness of Wages Boards and Arbitration Acts in each of the States. The unions, having failed to obtain a preference under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, put forward these proposals as another means of bringing all the workers under their control; but, fortunately, the clauses have been altered, so that that danger may be avoided, and, instead of every one being made the mental and moral slave of a certain section, we shall have two parties competing one against the other. I do not see bow the trade union label can be made to serve any useful purpose. . Its application to goods will not show that the workmanship in their manufacture is better than the workmanship in goods not similarly labelled, and, as I think that conditions will be infinitely worse for' the working classes if we adopt these proposals than they are now, I shall strongly oppose it .

I am showing what obhonorable members in favour of punishing pirates ? lowed the address of the Attorney-General pretty closely, and made notes, so as to lose none p f his points, of which there were two to which he gave especial prominence. According to him, the crux of the whole matter is: How shall we legislate against the pirate? Under the law as it stands, apparently, any organization may register a label, but cannot prevent the use of that label without its permission. There was no meed for the Attorney-General to elaborate the statement of fact that the label is not now used because it is of no value unions have labels. that in Kalgoorliea very intelligent and enterprising community, but one far removed from other centres of civilizationthe union label is in use, and the storekeepers there, who have not to fear the -competition of similar tradesmen in Perth, encourage its use to secure the trade of the label for the whole Comminers. Selfishness is at the bottom of the encouragement given to the system at Kalgoorlie, so that I do not think that what is done there should be advanced in support of the proposal to legalize the use of the union label.

The object of labour leaders aill over the world is to force men into the unions. Tom Mann has openly stated that the objects of the unions in England and upon the Continent is to obtain power to force non-unionists into their organizations, by intimidation and coercion. It is for such a purpose that it is proposed to use the union label. The unions are aiming at the achievement of the highest form of political power. minority achieve all these results? zation has to start with a small membership. their membership by coercion. endeavouring to gain strength by coercive measures, but they cannot establish themselves upon a sound basis unless they rely solely upon moral suasion.

Is it not equally obvious that if all men belonged to those organizations, no particular advantage would 'accrue to the employer who used a union label ? the individual, and it is only right that we should place a label upon his goods. Man is not a chattel. Another objection to this proposal is, that if it be adopted, a skilled workman who is not a member of a trade union will not be permitted to act as foreman upon any undertaking. Only the other day a gentleman died in Adelaide, who was quite as well able to take charge of a thousand men upon a work The unions are as most individuals are to control a dozen. I refer to the late Mr Puddv. who built most of the railways in that State. He was particularly well qualified to handle men, but he was not'a unionist, and did not belong to a trade union.

Honourable members will remember that there was a fierce conflict over the proposal to grant preference to unionists. that its object was to force men into unions, so that those organizations might be built up numerically and financially, and that as they were largely political machines, used by one section of the people, they should not be strengthened at the expense of all other sections. That was the objection winch"" was freouently voiced, and with the assistance of the present Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and the Postmaster-General, we succeeded in almost annihilating preference to unionists. I think honourable members will admit that it was pracHcally! killed. time. will recollect that preference to the members of a union having political objects was also prohibited. A proposal in that direction was scotched by us, with the assistance of the members of the Ministry to whom I have referred. Being free agents, ancl not having, as far as I am aware, covetoius eyes on the Treasury benches, they voted for amendments which had the effect of practically annihilating the principle. It was at that time that we heard so much of what is known as the caucus, and of the dangers of machine government. Reference was made to them in eloquent speeches in this House, and in still more brilliant utterances at Ballarat. told that my honourable friends of the [204] Labour Party were rushing the people over a precipice-that bit by bit they were undermining the independence of representatives, and turning them into mere pawns. But all this has been changed. If I may use a well-worn simile, ""Barbarossa has had to do penance."" Those who helped us to annihilate preference to unionists are now supporting a proposal that will have the same effect, but will be devoid of the safeguards attached to that principle in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Preference to unionists under that Act cannot be awarded except by an order of the Court. Therefore a Judge must, in the first place, hear the -pros and cons of the question before application for such preference can be granted. There is no such safeguard offered in connection with the provisions which we have before us. There is some justification for the demand for preference to unionists under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, because the orWe who opposed it said ganizations which bring disputes 'before the Court have to bear the cost of presenting their case, and their funds are liable to attachment if any of their members f a i l to observe the award of the Court. member forgot that arguinenti when the . question was before the House. ber scarcely does me justice. I did not forget it , but thought that it was outweighed by arguments on the other side. I do say, however, that that argument deserves consideration, and it was certainly advocated with all the fervour that my I do, and said so at the honourable friends in the Ministerial corner possess. Buti t does not apply in the present case. There is no question of an organization or union incurring large expenditure in bringing a claim before the Court to apply a union label, nor is there any question of its funds being attached in the effort to do nob only its own members, but other persons, good service. So far as these provisions are concerned, we have therefore a complete change of front on the part of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Postmaster-General, and_ the Vice-President of the Executive Council. They are eating the leek. Indeed, the Treasurer and the'Vice-'President of the Executive .Council are swallowing it whole, and are endeavouring to hide from the public We were the wry faces they are making in the attempt.

263,Mr Robinson,"The honourable memlabel seems to. me to be one to legalize the boycott. I have given careful and exhaustive study to the multitude of pamphlets, papers, reports, and so forth that have been written and printed upon this question, and I say, unhesitatingly, that the inference must be drawn from thorn that a boycott or an attempted boycott is necessary to the effective use ot the union label. Wherever the attempt has been made in the United States, a boycott has inevitably followed. The means adopted by the unions to establish the union label, and so to strengthen their ranks, are in essence and in fact a boycott. The first method adopted is to persuade all unionists to buy only those goods which bear the union label. The next attempt is to force them, if need be, not to buy from a retailer who sells articles that do notbear the label. every means in their power they seek to extend the feeling that those who make, sell, or handle goods made by non-unionists should not be patronized. The action of the hatters', the cigar-makers', and other unions, to which reference has been made, shows that the usual forms of address issued by the various trade uirons and federations of labour are, "" Do not purchase such and goods,"" "" D o not purchase articles made by such-and-such a firm,"" "" Do not purchase articles unless they bear the union label."" By direct and indirect means the boycott is set up in respect of all good's that do not bear the union label. This has just the same effect as has preference to unionists, except that the boycott takes a more drastic and deadly shape. Unlike preference to unionists, it has not the sanction of a Court. lic opinion. able member to consider the case, say, of the Bootmakers' Union. that it applies the union label to goods manufactured by its members. Then bootmakers generally are urged to buy only union-made boots bearing the union label, and every other union issues the same request to its members. That is the first step, and it is iri itself a kind of boycott. The next step is to urge unionists not to buv from any retailer who handles goods which do not bear the union label. Forty or fifty unions comprise a goodly section of consumers in certa'in portions of this State, and if their members determine to buy only union-made goods, and to boycott any individual who has invested in a business which handles non-union articles, the position becomes serious. and learned member does not advise the public to patronize a non-union lawyer. their own selection. But a man who employs a non-union lawyer usually comes back in the end. and in order to get on the right path, has to spend twice as much as he would have been called upon to do had he patronized the union man at the outset. learned member admits that intelligence is in the union. By orable friend, and others, know that the word ""union,"" in its ordinary sense, is totally inapplicable to a profession which is open to every one who passes the necessary examinations.. The Bulletin of the National Metal Trades Association, of October. 1903-a n American protectionist magazine, published in Cincinaiati, Ohio, contains the following report from San Francisco: such In the case of Michael Hallanan against W i lliam Storey, et al., members of the Journeymen Horseshoers' Union, Local No. 25, Judge Beatty, of the United States Circuit Court, rendered judgment for the plaintiff this morning, continuing the injunction and restraining order on the grounds that Ohe boycott which the plaintiff alleged was being placed on his goods' tended to materially injure his trade. Hallanan is the manufacturer of-a patent rubber horseshoe pad, which he alleges was in common use in this city until the commencement of the boycott. He became involved in a dispute with the Horseshoers 1 Union of New York over the placing of the union label on the output of his factory. On his refusal to comply with the demands of the It has the sanction of pubunion a boycott was declared against his goods, and all the horseshoers in this city are alleged to have refused to handle the rubber pads made in his factory. Hallanan made an application to the United States Circuit Court for an injunction Let us assume ancl restraining order, which was granted by the court, and an order was,issued directing the defendants to appear in court to show cause why a permanent injunction should not be granted. After hearing the evidence in the case, Judge Beatty ordered that the restraining order be continued, holding that the testimony had borne on the allegations of the plainiff, and that the boycott on the article which he manufacured and put on the market as a commodity was unlawful, inasmuch as it tended to injure his business. These facts show that the union label is used to prevent men from buying and dealing in goods which are not manufactured by union workmen.

If the desire were to legalize the union label merely to distinguish between sweated and non-sweated labour, no doubt the proposals would be accompanied by a clause providing that they are not to apply to industries under Wages Boards or Arbitration Acts. But there is no such clause, and honourable members opposite are not likely to vote for such a provision, beour statute book, it will be difficult to recause their intention is not, primarily, to improve the conditions of laboflr, but to strengthen the political labour organizations. For that reason they will doubtless prevent the Government from accepting any amendment in the direction I speak of. The speech of the Attorney-General is more ingenious than ingenuous. It was based on the assumption that the union label is being brought forward to distinguish between goods the product of sweated and goods the product of non-sweated labour. Whereas in truth and in fact the label will 'do nothing of the kind. He is distinguishing between men who belong to unions, and those who do not, to the prejudice of those who, for various reasons, do not care to associate themselves with the labour organizations. It is making the lot of those outside the fence harder than it is at present. into operation, it will tend to force men out of employment, or into the unions. A remark of the secretary of one of the unions is recorded, to the effect that all the men employed in the industry with which he was connected, were in the unions. No non-unionists were working, because such of them as were left were in the hospitals.r I do not suppose that any such state of affairs will be brought about in Australia, but that apparently expresses the spirit which actuates some of those who desire to impose upon us the union label provisions. Thev aim at forcing off the earth all those who, for reasons satisfactory to themselves, refrain from joining unions. All our Australian legislation is based upon the assumption that it is desired to treat all classes of the community alike. That is why we call ourselves a democratic community. But proposals of this kind make class distinctions, and are designed to place in the hands It cannot be said of unionists a means of oppressing those who do not belong to their own organization, and of making their position in lif e more difficult than it is. It is because I do not believe in these differentiations, or in creating any privileged class, that I regard these proposals as specially dangerous. Experience in the United States shows us that the concomitant of the union label is not only a boycott of workmen, but a boycott of retailers. The system creates the greatest ill-feeling, and the greatest mischief wherever it is introduced, and once provision is made for it upon 1 move it. I do not profess to deplore the fact that it may be necessary to bring this , matter before the Courts, nor am I going to predict what will be the result. I have great faith in the opinion of Mr Cussen, who has been mentioned by the Attorney General, and I think that his view ought to receive the fullest consideration. I do not base my opposition to this proposal upon that opinion. We should be inflicting a great wrong if we brought about any class distinction by making it more difficult for certain men to earn their living. I voted consistently against the union preference provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill last year. I then found myself sitting side by side with half of the members of the present Ministry.

276,Mr Spence (Darling),"I haveof that coercion of employers to which he has referred. All such talk is sheer non-sense. If the unions are so influential as the honourable member represents them to 'be, and can exercise so much coercion, why for the country? If every member of a union were coerced into joining it. the organizations would soon fall asunder, because the units would be mutually repellent. Pressure, which may, in some instances, be -called coercion, has been brought to bear upon individuals, but it is absurd to say -that that would apply generally. We are not here to deal with extreme cases that no one would attempt to justify. No attempt has been made to controvert the fact -that the public opinion of the United States, -as expressed in the laws of that country, shows that the majority of the people regard the trade union label as an excellent institution. Honourable members have been hunting round for some time past for cases that could be quoted against it. The honourable and learned member for Wannon has mentioned some vague decision with regard to a case of boycotting, but that is a poor reply to the mass of evidence that has been adduced by the Attorney-General. United States affords the fullest support to the proposals now before us. No mention is made in the clauses under consideration of the trade union label. The Attorney-General has evidently been endeavouring to please the Federated Employers' Union and the members of the Opposition, whom it is impossible to satisfy. -clause, we will be satisfied. would never be satisfied. If these proposals had been introduced by the Reid Government, the honourable member would have supported them. have done so. member would no longer have had the Ministerial majority within his control. member show us the real necessity for these provisions ? so. Unfortunately, the clause before us does not deal with union labels, but I shall assume, for the sake of argument, that it probusiness. The fair employer will gain that vides for the use of union labels similar to those adopted in America. In the event of a union adopting a label, the employer who believed that his business would be extended by the use of such label would apply for the right to affix it to his goods. are their members working What actuates the employer is his own selfwages, instead of running interest, and no force is brought to bear upon him. He looks upon the label as a means of securing additional business. As the result of friendly negotiations, in most cases the employer's application would be granted after an understanding had been arrived at with regard to wages, hours of work, and labour conditions generally. It has been stated that the union label provisions would operate detrimentally to non-unionists. That term has been improperly applied to all men who are outside of the unions. Those who are referred to in harsh terms by the members of labour organizations are the non-uriionists who work alongside unionists, and who take advantage of all the benefits secured by their organized fellow employees. There are a number of men outside unions who are not necessarily non-unionists. They may be thorough unionists in spirit, but they may not find it to their interests to form themselves into organizations, or possibly the conditions may be unfavorable to their Experience gained in the doing so. I would point out that after the passing of the Conciliation -and Arbitration Act in New South Wales, a great number of men, who had formerly been unorganized, formed themselves into unions, not as the result of coercion, but because they found it would be of advantage to them to do so. If he withdraws the would get no preference unless they joined the unions. dlustries in which there were no organizations among the employ6s. No question of coercion or preference or anything of the kind was involved. They formed themselves into unions in order that they might represent their case to the Arbitration Court and obtain redress of their grievances. I have no sympathy whatever with the individual who is opposed to unionism, but I admit that we are entitled to consider those who are not members of trade organizations.

I say that the adoption of the union label will secure an additional business to the fair employer, and will decrease the evils of sweating. What has been the experience in Australia ? For years past a preference has been given by many individuals to union employers. When a union is first established, it usually requires certain printing to be done. In that instance a preference is naturally given to the union printer. So it is in other branches of industry. When I started housekeeping in Sydney, before the Arbitration Act came into force, one of the first things that I did was to find out a union baker. I knew that there were union employers in the baking trade, who were paying their employees £ 2 12s. per week for forty-eight hours, whilst non-union employers were paying their workmen only 36s. per week for ninety hours. Adelaide are getting less than that to-day. from the secretary of the Bakers' Union before I could procure a list of bakers, so that I could patronize a fair employer. I do not object to the honourable member for Wentworth and othersdealing with unfair employers, who bake their bread! under insanitary conditions, but, personally, I wish to see the union label upon the bakers' carts, so that I may be spared the trouble of hunting up a union baker. There are thousands who follow the same rule as myself. Before they deal with any tradesman, they wish to know that he is a fair employer! That is what every honest man ought to do. were compelled by Act of Parliament to belong to a union? pose anything of .the sort. I intend to deal with absolute facts. We have had too much supposition here. Let me supply another illustration from my own experience. When the employees of Messrs. Burgon and Ball desired to form a' union, that firm, which was engaged in the manufacture of sheep shears, locked them out. I wrote to the employees, advising them to form a co-operative union, and to manufacture the shears themselves, promising that if they produced a good article they should have our trade. They acted on my suggestion, and soon captured the Australian market. sort of thing. honourable and learned member has discovered one statement of mine with which he can agree. The union in question has also secured a good deal of the trade with the Argentine, with the result that the establishment of Messrs. Burgbn and Ball has been closed. As the institution is a cooperative one, the profits, instead of being divided amongst a couple of individual's, are distributed amongst the workmen. union ? Sheep Shears Co-operative Society Limited. It is located at Sheffield, England. During the course of this debate, the statement has been made, without .any justification whatever, that if these proposals are adopted, coercion will be exercised by the trades unions. It has been urged that the trades unions will pass rules compelling their members to purchase their wares from employers who use the union label. In the case which I have cited, no such compulsion was exercised. But the loyalty of the men naturally induced them to give a preference to the particular article produced by the society in question. That sort of thing is done every day. We select the best tradesman available, and give him a ""preference."" That is the correct term to apply, and the word "" boycott "" in this connection is a misnomer. Why should a union be prevented from registering a trade mark if it desires to do so ? Why should not an employer have a right to place a union label on his goods? There will be no coercion used. after it? will be just as ready as are employers in the United States to use the union label. In this connection I would give the employers a hint.

The members of the Shearers'' Union, for instance, would buy such a jam in preference to any other. I ""mention this com-: modity because it is one of those articles that are largely used in the back-blocks. Employers will find that it pays to use the union label. There are thousands who, like myself, wish to know where the goods which they consume are made, and how they are made. A friend of mine the other clay was speaking to a gentleman who was denouncing the union labe'j proposals now before us, ancl, after listening to him for a time, he said, "" Where were your boots made ?"" America.'' "" The n , "" said my friend, "" if you examine them, you will find that they bear a union label."" He did so, and my friend's prediction was verified. pened in Collins-street, and I made a convert of the man. and others who denounce these provisions are wearing boots bearing the union label. Mr Walpole sends out circulars to municipal ancl other organizations, and, because half-a-dozen of them support his views, we are told that public opinion is against this proposal. The Argus attacks the union label; and that in itself is said to show that public opinion is opposed to it. We have been asked. What will be the position in the States where arbitration laws prevail ? We have an Arbitration Act in force in New South Wales, and factory laws are in operation in Victoria. Manufacturers in those States export largely to other parts of the Commonwealth, and those who are among the first to place a union label on their goods will secure a big business throughout Australia. We should leave the question an open one. Those who desire to use the union label should have a right to use it. I have heard nothing to justify the suggestion that we should prevent the use of such a mairk. As; one who is within the inner circle of trade unionism, let me oay at once that there is absolutely no ground for the doleful predictions which have been made. There is no foundation for the suggestion as to boycotting. An illegal boycott is practised by employers, and has been practised by them for many years, but I have never heard those who oppose these proposals denounce it. True, when we refer to it, they reply that they do .not approve of it, but they have never disapproval. I fail to see how it would be possible, as the result of the passing of these clauses, to bring into play a system of boycott which would inflict injury on the people. We aire told that a man who prefers to use goods bearing the union label boycotts non-union goods. It might just as well be said that the sentiment so freely expressed todav in favour of Australian goods for Australian people amounts to a boycott. In various places public meetings, have been held, urging the people to buy Australian goods; and now when one orders a suit of clothes, one takes care to ask: "" Is this AusThe gentleman replied, "" In tralian-made tweed,"" or ""Australian-made serge,"" ao the case may be. What is that but a boycott, if such a term Js to be employed. But I hold that it is a misnomer. The proper word to use is "" preference."" Probably our State Legislatures will compel manufacturers to so stamp their goods as to show by whom' they have been made. There are thousands in Australia who, if they could, would give a preference to Australian-made articles. They need something to assure them that they are buying locally-made goods, and we say that anything that prevents deception in this respect serves a useful purpose. now to be stamped in Victoria. passing of the law requiring that to be done, one had to accept the word of the shopkeeper. Buti f a registered mark be placed on goods, we shall secure certainty in this regard. I propose to quote an extract from a sermon delivered by a clergyman, in Baltimore. A -clergyman is one who is not usually regarded as taking sides. Indeed, I bold it is wrong to speak of sides in this connection. Instead of seeking to drive capital and labour further apart, we should endeavour to secure mutual agreement between, them. In the United States an employer is allowed to use the union label because he observes fair conditions of labour. Does not that in itself suggest that the system tends to bring about harmonious relations between the two parties? Instead of driving employer and employee apart,-the union label legislation of the United States has caused a better feeling to prevail.

The union label will certainly tend to increase unionism, because the employers who avail themselves of it will increase their business, and so add to the Avork to be carried out in their factories. some trade union movements, attempts have been made to coerce men, but I challenge any one to disprove my statement that the movement generally is a voluntary one, and that, in a free country, it can exist only because it is voluntary. Those of whom, we speak as non-unionists are men who consent to be hired to displace others who are on strike. There is no difficulty in inducing the great mass of the workers in a trade to join a union organized in connection with it, amongst employers."" notable feature of the trade union movement in America to-day is the decrease that has taken place in the number of strikes. A large federation has been formed to mediate in disputes between employers and employees; the profit-sharing system has also been introduced, and, whilst the union label has admittedly strengthened the membership of unions, it has led to a more harmonious state of affairs as between capital and labour. Some few yearsago those who follow up the trade union movement closely were alarmed at the outlook in the United States. seemed imminent. Many strikes were taking place, and in connection with those disputes arms were used and blood was shed. But during the last year or two the outlook has become more hopeful. I contend that trade unionism has been largely responsible for the change. ing to which the honourable member refers has solidified the position of the capitalists. trusts is going on quite apart from trade unionism-. The union label will prove beneficial to employers, for there are many who, like myself, wish to avoid sweaters just as we should avoid any bad character. It will (enable the employer to secure the market, and thus assist him in paying fair wages. A t the present time the man who I did not say that. pays fair wages suffers from the competition of the man who pays unfair wages. the non-unionist? employed in a union shop, under union conditions, and will get better wages than he gets now.

To show the respect in which the union label is held in America to-day, I should like to read the following passage from a sermon recently preached by a Baltimore clergyman :What can be more sacred or more deserving of the reverence of men than the Union Label, which signifies that human life has been more highly valued in the production of commodities than the mere profits sought for by greed? The label is an emblem of justice, of fraA social upheaval ternity, of humanity. When you find a label on a garment, or a plug of tobacco, or a box of cigars, or a loaf of bread, or a piece of printing, you can be sure that none of them was made in a sweat-shop, that no little children's fingers were compelled to sew, or to sort tobacco, in the hours of the night intended for childish sleep.

Most of us would prefer to patronize the best if we could recognise it, to help the fair employer, and to stamp out the sweater, by purchasing the goods of the one and refusing those of the other, until all are compelled to act as decent men. and to comply with fair and reasonable conditions. I have always stood firmly for the equal rights of all men, whether they are unionists or non-unionists. If that is?"" not true and perfect democracy I do not know what is. I do not wish to prevent men from joining unions if they desire to do so, but I feel that they should not be forced to join unions if they desire to keep out of them.

This Legislature has no right to countenance such action. Not only the honourable member for Darling, but the Attorney-General-abou t whom I shall say a few words presently made the assumption that the union label stands for quality.

That is not what honourable members opposite desire. What they want is to legalize the union label, so that men who do 'not wish to do so shall be compelled to join unions. That is their one and only object. If they wish to secure that all goods used shall be of good'quality they will vote for my amendment. But, to secure the support of the public outside, they make, statemento which they know are not correct. We on this side of the Chamber wish to protect the public, and to prevent any but goods of the best quality from being used. But honourable members opposite wish only to do everything possible to drive into unions men who do not wish to enter them. able to keep their trade unless they make wares of good quality. bers wish to make certain that all articles sold shall-be of good quality, let them vote for my amendment. If they will not vote' for it, let us have no more of this hypocritical pretence that it isi the quality 'of goods about which they are concerned. Every man who enters this House should be perfectly frank, and should state openly what his intention is in connection with any , proposal . that he makes. No honourable member should, attempt to deceive the House in any way. An attempt is being made to mislead the House. The Attorney-General this-after*, noon endeavoured to make it clear that Senator Symon had made some remarks in favour of these proposals. orable ""member is' not reporting me correctly. Attorney-General intended to convey, after having quoted' certain statements made by Senator Symon, was that he favoured the trades union label. Symon stated that he was personally opposed to.the trade, union label, but that he did not propose to recommit the clause relating to it, for the purpose of opposing it on behalf of the Government. There was no statement that the Government were opposed to it. the Attorney-General to say that there was no declaration on the part of the Reid Ministry that, as a Government, they were not opposed to the trade union labei proposals. What is the evidence on that point? The Attorney-General read a certain statement made by Senator Symon, with a view to indicate that the Reid Government were not opposed to the trade union label. Would any Court assume that the other members of the Government were in favour of the union label, because Senator Symon, the only Minister who had expressed any opinion on the subject, had stated that he was opposed to it? it, they must have been in favour of it. to oppose it. Senator Symon stated distinctly that' he was opposed to it personally. But he did not sav that his colleagues were in favour of it. None of the other Ministers'said that they were advocates of. the trade union label, and yet the Attorney-General attempted to mislead the House in that direction. ber must not say that. Symon moved to recommit the clause for the. purpose of strengthening the union label provision, and made a suggestion that was accepted by Senator' Pearce. original statement was true. Senator Symon saidMy honourable friend will forgive me for taking advantage of this opportunity to say that it is a mistake to insert these provisions in this Bill. I thoroughly understand his object in desiring to legislate in this way, and I am not saying one word adversely or otherwise with regard to the principle he has in view, but I think that from his own stand-point, it is worth consideration whether he should ask us to'insert these provisions in a Bill relating to what is entirely distinct matter-trade marks-and whether it would not be better to have a separate piece of legislation dealing with this particular subject. .1 know that in America -and that is the pattern which my honourable friend has followed-som e enactments for this purpose have been passed; but it is noticeable that these are-not Federal enactments.

Later on, Senator Symon was asked to again recommit the clause, and I think that on that occasion he refused. He saidWhen, on the last occasion, there was a recommittal of this B ill , in order to effect some alterations where one or more unions are acting together, I indicated that in my opinion .these clauses were in the wrong place. ' I do not think they should be included in this Bill. I tried on that occasion to persuade my honourable friends opposite that it would be very much better to eliminate them from this B ill , and legislate independently in respect of what is sought to be dealt with here, as was done in New York, I think, where the State Legislature passed legislation of this character.' Senator PEARCE -The honourable and learned senator also said that he would oppose that legislation as vehemently as he opposed these clauses. honourable senator is right in stating that my persuasion would be equally applied to secure the rejection of such provisions if introduced by separate legislation. I wish it to be distinctly understood that I am not in favour of the introduction of these clauses in this B ill . That is a distinct declaration of his ""opposition to the union label provisions, and merely because his colleagues said nothing, the Attorney-General tried to induce honourable members to believe that they must have been in favour of the union label. read the reply of the late Minister of Trade and Customs to the deputation that watted upon him on the question? member has anvthing to say he can address the Committee later on. I am merelv replying to the statement of the Attorney-General, who insinuated that the Reid Government were in favour of the union label proposals. When Senator Gould asked for a recommittal of the Bill, Senator Symon saidT ask Senator Gould, in view of reasons I propose to give, not to press his motion to a division. him to discuss the subject on the third reading, and the views put by Senator Pearce in that regard are perfectly fair. Let me state the reasons which influence me. Of course, my honourable friends know-Senato r Pearce has twitted me more than once-that I am very strongly opposed to those provisions, first so far as place is concerned as being in this B ill , and secondly on principle. Nothing could be clearer than that. Senator MULCAHY -I s the honourable and learned senator going' to vote for them remaining in? am not going to move a motion for recommittal I did not every week, and I am sure that Senator Gould would not desire me to do so, especially at a period of the session when every moment of our time is extremely valuable. My honourable friend moved a motion to recommit last week. With two exceptions, every member of the Senate was accounted for in the division as to recommittal. There was an equality of voting, with the result that, according to the Constitution, the question passed in the negative. T voted with my honourable and learned friend in support of the recom-' mittal. But I am not prepared again to support the motion to recommit. I do not take the view that because an amendment is made in a B i ll with which I do not agree, I ought, therefore, to vote against the third reading. I do not think I ought to sacrifice a B i ll because of some provision in it which I do not like. This measure is intended for the regulation and registration of trade marks. I do not think that a trade union mark' -is strictly within the meaning of the measure at all. But the question has been fought out, and an amendment has been carried. Now the Bill is ready to be sent on to another place. There is very little hope of it being passed this session., But whether that is so or not, tlie other Chamber will be able to deal with the whole subject. "" If the trade union mark provisions are retained by a majority, they will form part of the B ill ; if they are rejected by a majority, they w ill come back to the Senate for reconsideration. Government were not opposed to the union label provisions. anything of the kind. Any honourable member who can make such a statement is apparently prepared to support the contention of the Attorney-General. Senator Symon was distinctly opposed to the union label provisions, and seeing' that he spoke as the representative of the Reid Government, we may fairly assume that his colleagues shared his views. The Attorney-General undoubtedly attempted to convey the impression that the members of the Reid Ministry were in favour of the trade union label proposals, and yet we find that all the evidence tends to show that the contrary was the.case.

The Attorney-General, however, mentioned that fact with a view to support his arguments in support of the present pro. posal. If that was not his intention, the fact referred to was not worth mentioning, The workers' mark of the time referred to was used by individuals. Nearly all the goods were manufactured in those days solely by individual workers. There was no such division of labour as we now see in our factories. Every man who produced an article and sold it for himself was entitled to use a worker's mark, and it would be open for him to do the same thing to-day. The Attorney-General knew this very well, but he wished honourable members to infer that because there was a workers' mark in existence 500 years ago, we should make provision for trade union labels to-day. Eveni f a trade union label had been in existence 500 years ago, it would not follow that we should make similar provision to-day. In view of the development which has since taken place, and of the improved methods of production, I say that the legislation which fitted 500 years ago is not applicable to-day. The argument of the Attorney-General was an absolutely foolish one. able member use it? I am merely replying to the statement of the Attorney-General. I endeavour to argue upon fair lines, and I would not use an argument which did not fit the circumstances of to-day in the way that he did. The honourable and learned gentleman also stated that in ancient times marks were given to the members of various guilds. That statement is perfectly true. But I would point out that members of the guilds were required to serve a long apprenticeship to their trade, and were only allowed to ""mark!' their goods after they had satisfied those whorn^ they had served that they were competent workmen. But do the members of trade unions serve any long apprenticeship to their trades, and are they required to establish the fact that they are good workmen ? No! They undergo no examination of any kind. None of the safeguards as to quality of workmanship, which used to be insisted upon was a in connection with the old guilds, are imposed in their case. ber ever join a union? that if I did, I should not remain in it ten minutes would ""boss"" the union. the union would attempt to ""boss"" me, and, as a result, I should be fired out very quickly. knows nothing whatever about unions. very little in regard to their internal working, I have seen enough from the. outside to prevent, me from joining them. The honourable member for Darling made some reference to the encouragement which he offered to certain employees in England to establish a co-operative society for the manufacture of sheep-shears. I commend him for his action in that connection. Many years ago a strike occurred in the district which' I have the honour to represent, and I was asked to speak at a meeting in Armidale. Upon that occasion I recommended the workers to db exactly what the honourable member for Darling advised the employees of Messrs. Burgon and Ball to do. I counselled them to start a co-operative factory, and to sell their own goods, and I offeredI was a member of the State Parliament at the time-to undertake the travelling for them-so far as the adjoining towns were concerned-withou t fee or reward. If a union can sell its goods voluntarily, it should have perfect liberty to doso. Nobody objects to that. But I contend that men should not be coerced intousing a union label. Such a label is not required for the n-prpose of guaranteeing the quality of goods, but merelv for the purpose of enabling unionists to boycott those firms which do not exclusively employ union labour.

We have np right to enact legislation which will create strife between any sections of the community. be applied to goods which are .the product of a minute division of labour ? The great bulk of the work to-day is done by 'machinery. What right has an employer to attach a union label to goods thus produced, and how can any such label be a guarantee of quality? Take the manufacture of oatmeal as an example. this provision, I suppose that the oats would have to be ground by union labour; the building in which the oatmeal was manufactured would have to be erected by union labour ; indeed, the whole of the processes connected with its production would require to be carried .out under union conditions. I say that it is utterly impossible to insure that. These provisions will merely provide the necessary machinery to enable unionists to boycott non-unionists. honourable member for Darling has assured us that their adoption will result in everybody being employed, and at a higher rate of wages. If that were so, I would vote for these proposals. I have as much sympathy with the working classes as those who stand up and ""mouth"" it so much. desire that men should have the fullest employment. But the adoption of the union label will not provide them with work. All these artificial methods for employing them will fail. In Victoria the Wages Boards merely help the man in employment-the y are of no assistance to the individual who is unemployed. In New South Wales, the Arbitration Court does not even help the man who is in employment. What we need to do is to bring natural. opportunities within the reach of the working man. Then he would be able to find work for himself, and would not need the assistance which it is alleged the adoption of the union label will afford him. The honourable member for Darling has said that every machine which was used pressed men out of employment. How will the union label help them in that case? I say at once that every machine invented would advantage the working classes if proper conditions obtained. The reason why machinery is apparently injuring the worker is that he is not free to take his natural place upon the lands of the country. The Labour Party profess to be the great friends of the people. They are in power in several of the States to-day. Let them enact legislation which will open up avenues of employment for the people upon the land. In Queensland and South Australia How can a union label at the present time they are in power. Why do they not act in the way that I suggest ?"" Legislative Council in those States. talk outside of what they will do; but when they are in power they do nothing. I do not wish to further Under discuss this question. I do not believe that the position of the workers can be much improved by means of legislation. Legislation of this kind will fail to accomplish its objects. I have the strongest desire to help the masses, but I have always voted against legislation of this character, because I believe that it can have no good effect. If the union label be legalized in Australia, the working classes will find that they have been fooled, and that it is The of very little service to them. Under present conditions, all who are seeking employment cannot find it, and if we give this power to the unions, non-unionists will find it impossible to obtain work. We know that'a wharf labourers' union in New South Wales demanded a fee of £ 5 from a man I who wished to join its ranks, and I have been told that in some of the States there is an aristocracy of labour which carefully shuts out others who would join it. The Arbitration Court in New South Wales has compelled ffie unions to open up their books to every one. Labour unions have tyrannized over their own class wherever they have had an opportunity to do so. for example, that in New South Wales the Court compelled the Shearers' Union to expunge from ""ifs' rules a regulation imposing a fine of ^ 3 on every member who voted against a candidate it put up. That was an attempt to take away from the members of the union liberty of speech and freedom of thought; it was ah attempt to make the union one great political machine in the hands of those who controlled it. There can be no defence for such conduct, and since the unions have not hitherto used their power wisely, it would be absolutely foolish to pass these provisibns, and so place in their hands a greater power than that which Thev now possess. fervid speeches of the two honourable mem-",58,Chicago Iii Dec 10 1904

There is no objection to the Trade Marks Bill as it now stands. Similar legislation was adopted in Tasmania some years ago, and any person desirous of doing so may, on payment of a small fee, register a trade mark, and thereafter prevent any one else from using it.

The union label is not a trade mark in the sense in which the term is employed to signify marks placed upon goods for the purpose of indicating the place of manufacture, or the persons by whom they were manufactured. The union label is not accompanied by a proprietary interest in the article to which it is attached, which is one of the essential and basic principles of the trade mark. I think it ought to be referred to a Select Committee, so that evidence might be taken and we might ascertain what justification there is for putting the clauses in the Bill, and whether the title of the measure should not be altered to "" A Bill for the Legalization of the Boycott, Intimidation,, and Minority Rule."" For, after all, those are the purposes for which tlie union label is to be called into existence. It is intended to distinguish goods made by trade union labour from goods made by non-union labour. Power is sought by those who are responsible for these clauses to put into the hands of trade unions the right to coerce the majority of workers into joining such organizations against their will. Not only so, but it is intended to give the right to trade unions to coerce employers into discharging non-union laboui. It is intended to limit the freedom of citizens to act on their own judgment in buying or selling. They are to be confined to goods which are marked with the union label. workers other than trade unionists register a mark under this Bill? It is not probable that they would, but, in any case, it would not give them any proprietary right In the goods they produced. It is the very essence of a trade mark, as ordinarily understood in trading circles, and as laid down by the most eminent legal authorities, that the user of the mark must have a proprietary interest in the goods to which it is applied. The union label is in no respect a trade mark in the proper sense of the term. An eminent legal authority in Victoria has pointed this out. It has also been pointed out by the courts of the^ United States. been given in America, in which it has been statedThe courts could protect organized, labour from seen what a powerful engine for tyranny any interference with their proprietary or quasiprop.iftary right in their union label as affixed and coercion the union label has been in to goods, and such labels were held not to be trade marks for several reasons : (i) Because they do not indicate by what person the articles were made, but only membership of a certain association; (2) their use is not enjoyed as incident to any business, and the right to use cannot be transferred with the transfer of a business; (3) there is no exclusive use, as many persons not connected in business and unknown to each other have the right to use, the right to use being acquired by becoming a member of an association, and being lost by ceasing to be a member. The judgments of the United States courts show that the union label is not recognised by them as a trade mark in the ordinary acceptation of the term. States the only opponents of the union label are the rings of boodlers. authority the honourable member has for saying that. An eminent legal authority in Victoria endorses the view which I have expressed. After carefully examining the law on the subject, he has arrived at the conclusion thatIn my opinion, the Commonwealth Parliament has not power to legislate in respect of what I have called for shortness "" Union Labels,"" on the ground(a) Because they do not 'indicate by what persons the articles were made, but . only membership of a certain association. (4) Their use is not enjoyed as incident to any business, and the right to use cannot be transferred with the transfer of a business. (e) There is no exclusive use, as many persons not connected in business, and unknown to each other, have the right to use, the right to use being acquired by becoming a member of an association, and being lost by ceasing to be a member. So that the grounds of objection which this eminent legal authority takes, are identical with the grounds of objection laid down by the Courts of the United States. But perhaps the most serious objection to this union label proposal is that it will condemn thousands of honest working men in this country to the loss of their employment.' That, I think, is absolutely a certainty. If we are to judge from the operation of similar measures in the United States, it will have the effect of coercing employers into giving employment only to those who are members of trade Several judgments have unions.

Where unlawful means are adopted to effect the purpose of such combination, there can be no lawful excuse. A combination of persons with intent to coerce their employer by means of a threat into dismissing from his employment, or refusing to employ another person, is actionable at the suit of that person, where the threat used is that of an unlawful strike. Such a combination can in no case be lawful. Where the dominant purpose and intention of a combination of persons is to harm another, and harm, in fact, results to him, it is no lawful excuse that they are pursuing their own business, or advancing their own interests, as, e.g., that they are upholding the principle of trades unionism or are punishing the person so harmed for a violation of such principle. same coal company to make it a condition precedent to the employment of men that they must be non-unionists. opposed to that sort of thing as I am to the otherThe person who procures the act of another is legally responsible for its consequence's, even though the act induced is within the right of the If is also pointed out that the immediate actor, if it be to the detriment of a third person, and if he can be shown to have procured his object by the use of illegal means directed against that third party.

Chief Justice Knowlton, of Massachusetts, United States, in giving judgment in the case of Berry versus Donovan, in which the plaintiff, a non-union shoemaker, sued an officer of the Boot and Shoe Workers' Union for damages for procuring his discharge from employment by Messrs. Goodrich and Company, boot manufacturers, of Haverhill, because he was not a member of the union, said-^The primary right of the plaintiff to have the benefit of his contract, and to remain undisturbed in the performance of it, is universally recognised. The right to dispose of one's labour as he will, and have the benefit of his lawful contracts, is incident to the freedom of the individual, which lies at the foundation of government in all countries that maintain the principles of civil liberty. Such a right can lawfully be interfered with only by one who is acting in the exercise of an equal or superior right, which comes in conflict with the other.

409,I Mr Johnson,"The honourable memby the introduction of the union label. In opposition, to that view, I wish to point out the effect of its adoption on the commercial value of trade marks, as instanced in the cigar trade in Canada. The cigar manufacturers there, 'controlling 85 per cent, of the cigar production, of that country, recently made strong representations to the Dominion Parliament in opposition to the Bill which was rejected early during the present year. case. A ll cigars are marketed to the consumer under labels or brands, and as certain lines grow in public favour, the Trade Marks, as covered by the various label designs, become very valuable assets of the manufacturer, and are saleable for large sums. If labour organizations are also permitted to register their particular emblem as a trade mark, and can then through the strength of their organization compel the manufacturer (as they oft-times do) to affix this label on each box of cigars, the value of the Trade Mark becomes practically ruined as a saleable asset. All the labels on a package of cigars are equally part of the Trade Mark with the brand name, and except they can be delivered complete, their sale is ruined. The manufacturer cannot sell the Union Label Trade Mark on his package with the rest of his Trade Mark, nor can he give any guarantee that the privilege of its use will be extended to the purchaser of his brand. Instances have occurred within the past few years where the presence of the Union Label has prevented the sale of a brand at a large figure. Any effort to discard this emblem of Union Labour has invariably been followed by the most strenuous and persistent boycott. The use of the Then, in the case of State v. Bishop, in Union Label is not optional, at least this is the 1895, Judge Burgess saidexperience of cigar manufacturers. have employed union labour, and complied with all union conditions except that they would is generally understood by law-writers to be a, not affix the Union Label on their brands. technical trade mark, because it does not pretend Strikes have been precipitated to enforce this or intimate that the cigars are owned, prepared, ruling. On certain high-grade brands of cigars or manufactured by the union as an organization, the Union Label is a serious drawback in the sale or that as such union, it has any interest or of the product, and to give this emblem the status property therein, nor by what particular firm or of a registered Tirade Mark is but the first step persons the cigars to which it may be attached to its compulsory use wherever the union issuing were manufactured. same has sufficient powers. The registration of the Union Label is necessarily illegal. It is not, nor can it ever be, made a Trade Mark by process of law. This opinion has been laid down by the Trade Mark Branch of the Department of Agriculture, and by several eminent trade mark authorities in Canada. trade mark is essentially a mark placed on a piece of merchandise to indicate its ownership. register the Union Label would be to accord the unions part proprietorship in every piece of merchandise to which their label was affixed. According to the legal advice of the Dominion Cigar Manufacturers' Association, such an act could not be sanctioned by law. The registration of the Union Label would be simply disastrous to cigar manufacturing terests in Canada, and would eventually ruin the immensely valuable assets owned by cigar manufacturers in their popular labels and brands. Mr Johnson. Here we have evidence that a large association controlling 85 per cent, of the total cigar production of Canada has issued a memorial to the Government of the Dominion, in which they positively state that the use of the union label has the effect of injuring the value of their trade mark, that the union label itself is not a trade mark, cannot in its nature, or by any process of law, be converted into a trade mark,, They thus stated their and that its enforced use, even upon goods; which have all been made by union labour, brings about the ruination of trade in many instances, and certainly depreciates 1 the value of the trade mark of those engaged in the production and sale of cigar* in that country. There are several decisions in the American Courts to the effect that a union label is not a trade mark, and also that trade unions are not tradingcorporations, and, therefore, cannot be entitled to the use of a trade mark. Here is one, which was given by Judge Williams in the case of M'Vey v. Brendel, in 1891, in PennsylvaniaI conclude that the Cigar Makers' International Union of America is neither a trader within the meaning of the common law, nor within the.,purview of the Act of Congress. Not being a trader in any sense, it can have no distinctive trade mark. Registration under such circumstances is not authorized by the Act of Congress, and if made, confers no title, and gives no standing ground in a court of law or equity. Factories' It may be conceded that the label is not what Then, in the case of Hetterman Brothers and Company v. Powers, in 1897, Judge Hazel rigg saidFirst we may admit that the label of the Cigarmakers' National Union is not used as a trade A mark in the ordinary sense of the word. It is not a brand put on goods by an owner to To separate or distinguish them from the goods of others. Similar decisions given in other cases could be quoted, and all the authorities agree that a union label and a trade mark are essen^ ti'ally different things, and that one cannot serve the purpose of the other. It cannot inbe argued for a moment that workers, whether working in their individual capacity or in association as unions could, by the use of a label upon the goods they produce, acquire a proprietary right in those goods; nor can it be urged that they could be classed as traders in those goods. The very essential purpose of a trade mark is absent from the union label. The purpose of a trade mark is to protect the owner, seller, or trader in goods from the piracy of others engaged 'in the manufacture or sale of similar goods. It is to protect individual rights, or the rights of corporations trading 'in goods or manufacturing them, that the trade mark is granted. possibly apply to all the workers engaged in the production of goods, and they cannot have the same proprietary rights as the owners or sellers of the goods. On these grounds I think that these clauses ought to be referred to the investigation of a Select Committee. I am assured that very many persons in this community are willing to come forward and give valuable evidence before such a Committee, which at a later stage might be used for the information of honourable members, and perhaps to convert those who are now opposed to.the union label to a different way of thinking. In, the absence of any investigation of the kind, and of such evidence as might thus be obtained, the Opposition are perfectly justified, on principle, in opposing these clauses, and in resisting the attempt to engraft such provisions on a measure dealing with trade marks. I wish it to be distinctly understood that, in opposing manufacturers and sellers of goods, to the these clauses, I am not opposing trade unionism., or speaking against it in any way. claim a protection for wares which they do Though some honourable members may laugh at that statement, I have always been an upholder of the principle of trade unionism. I have always held that it is a good thing for workers to combine for lawful purposes. fers to voluntary combination. is a good thing that they should form themselves into voluntary societies or unions for the purpose of securing better conditions and terms for their labour member objects to help them. them on right lines; but' I have -always contended that the principle of liberty should be steadily kept in view in the formation of these associations, and that the element of compulsion, should never be permitted to enter into them. As soon as it does, the free right of choice is lost to the individual, and that is a thing which should always be guarded against by every manwho professes any regard for liberty or correct principle. It is because of the compulsion which underlies the whole of these proposals, and because of that element of compulsion which has suggested their inclusion in this measure, that we are opposed to them. We object to the will of the minority being forsed upon the majority, and to coercive measures being brought to bear These conditions cannot to compel free men to sacrifice their freedom and to become members of organizations which they have no desire to join. At the same time, I would heartily recommend all workers to voluntarily join unions, and especially those who believe in freedom, so that, by their influence and reasoning, they may be able to convert those who are opposed to the principles of freedom from the error of their devious ways. If the unions form themselves into voluntary trading corporations, there is mo reason why .they should not have trade marks. I could see no objection to that. If trade unionists desire to secure the reasonable benefits of the provisions of a Trade Marks Act, let them form themselves into trading associations. Let them form themselves into voluntary co-operative institutions, and engage in the manufacture and sale of goods, and thenthey will be' equally entitled, with other protection of their wares, but they cannot not own. Therefore, it seems to me that to attempt to confuse a union label with a trade mark is one which can only impose upon those who are either wilfully deficient in understanding, or are willing to be imposed upon. rise to make an appeal to"" the AttorneyfGeneral to consent to progress being reported.

If we are to put our arguments, f r o and con, in such a way that they can be read and weighed by the people they should be delivered at reasonable hours, and therefore I make an appeal to the Attorney-General to consent to an adjournment. -There is no personal desire on the part of the Government to sit for long hours, but none of us can overlook the fact that the year is no longer young, and that there is a good deal of work yet before us. This question has occupied the attention of the House for a very long period, and although I 'did take up considerable time to-day it was only due to the members of the Opposition who had previously advanced their arguments that I should endeavour to reply to them.

The only reason why I would suggest to the Attorney-General the propriety of not proceeding further to-night, and not trving to force the Opposition into the position which he has laid down, is that there are at least ten amendments to be moved, each of which involves a separate principle. I recognise the force of what he said about I believe it took concluding the debate on this question, but I cannot see how he can propose to compress ten hours' work-for I presume that any amendment i's worthy of an hour's discussion-int o a six-hours' dlav.

The leader of the Labour Party spoke to .this question some few weeks ago. has addressed himself to it, but I do not think that the party generally can claim that they have done so. I do not blame them; it is fair for the Labour Party to adopt this attitude, in so much as they have thrown down the gauntlet on this question. But honourable members who until quite recently have been opposed to any such principles as are incorporated inthese clauses should most 'certainly have addressed themselves' to the question: There are' three honourable, members-Ministers -wh o are always mentioned in this connection, but ' there is one who so far has escaped mention. This is only another'indication'of the truth of the saying ""Least 'said, soonest mended."" Three of these honourable gentlemen, have statements in cold print showing their principles, the fourth has sliown his principles by votes, but, I think, has rarely expressed himself in the same forcible way as have his colleagues in opposition to the principles he is now prepared silently to espouse. It is for this reason that the Postmaster-General is in a much better position than are his> colleagues, the Prime Minister, I can assure my honorthe Treasurer, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council.

The Attorney-General this afternoon made a speech upon which we can all congratulate him* because his arguments were clear,even if his deductions were not so patent. He told us that the case for this proposal has not hitherto been put.

Mr IS AA CS I think that I said that I . have spoken twice. the case for the Government had not beerf down the Attorney-General to any disrespectful utterance in reference to the honourable member for Bland; I should not like to place any supporter of the honourable member in such an awkward position. But I shall pass from that subject. I take it that this is the first exposition that has come from the Government of its corporate view with' regard to ' these provisions: We are told in, this official pronouncement that the various sets of amendments which have been circulated are the same in principle, the only difference being an improvement in drafting and in verbiage, due mainly to the more concise form in which they now appear. That is a straightforward statement, for which I honour the Attorney General. It shows us that; so far as these different proposals are concerned, we have only to consider the same fact, and so we shall not waste time in looking up former amendments to see what they meant.

It must be clear to all honourable members that in Australia, the sense of fair play is so inherent amongst the people, piracy of a union label would be almost impossible, for the label, we are told, relies for its efficacy on the good-will and sympathy of the people generally, and that sympathy would be doubled if any employers resorted to piracy. to my honourable and learned friend's own showing, if a manufacturer were to resort to the despicable practice of pirating a union label, he would at once have all his goods boycotted. cott "" in tbe venial sense that is, the individual refusal to buy.

I suppose that every one in the community is such a sympathizer. If that be the case, it is clear that under present conditions any piracy of a union label which had not been improperly used would react on those who were guilty of it . What, I may say, in then, is the position? Do honourable members urge that we should guard against piracy in order to secure the unions from the natural consequences of any folly or malpractice in regard to the use of the It is for that reason only that I say union label? So long as it is properly used, piracy will be impossible, but if it is employed to promote such boycotting as We were told, has taken place in the United States ever since its institution there, should the unions be shielded from the natural consequences of such action? A t the present time, if such practices were indulged in in the Commonwealth, the If that be the unions would lose the sympathy and support of the public, and that alone would The honourable gentleman will make it possible for any manufacturer or dealer to pirate the union label.

That, I say, would be boycotting. The action of the members of that union would not be voluntary. It would not be the action of free agents. And such unions would be the inevitable consequence of passing these union label provisions ! I can, quite understand that members of unions should be governed by a majority of their fellow-members; and if the majority of the members of a union choose to pass a rule of the character fall of the institution. I have described, it is only a fair thing that the whole of the members should be bound by it; for, if they do not care to be bound by it they can, of course, leave the union. But, in such a case as I have instanced, not only the members of unions, but also their wives and families, would be bound. In this country we have not only manhood suffrage, but adult suffrage. The rights of women have to be considered, as well as those of men. A woman has to make the pounds, shillings, and pence of the household go as far as possible. I .am afraid that in many families there are only shillings and pence to spend. woman has to make the money go as far as it will. keep the household going. Is not such a woman to be a free agent? Can she not buy her goods in the market where she can get the best value for the money she has to spend? Is she to be affected by 'the tyranny of the union label? Certainly is a consideration which has not struck the Attorney-General. That is one form of boycott that naturally results from the adoption of this legislation. what is a boycott. I will tell them: If a walking delegate, upon entering a shop, ancl finding that 10 per cent, of the stock did not bear the union mark, afterwards hired a couple of sandwich men-of course, at the union rate of wages-to parade up and down outside) and announce that the shop should not be patronized-that would be a boycott. There are other forms of boycott to which I could refer, but to which I shall not allude, for fear that I may unduly lengthen the debate. opponents of these proposals have been accused of antagonism to trade unionism. Personally, I deny the charge. I regard unionism as one of the best and most hopeful institutions in our industrial life. Mr Kelly. of its members as constituting the very life-blood of unionism. What has made unionism a living force to-day ? Not compulsion, but the voluntary co-operation and mutual enthusiasm of the unionists. These elements alone have enabled the unions to tide over their most serious difficulties. If any system of compulsion were adopted, the involuntary recruits gained thereby would prove a source of weakness, and would eventually lead to the downFor this reason alone, the advocates of true unionism should range themselves alongside the opponents of this proposal. The Attorney General has laid considerable stress upon American precedents. He has told us of the States that have adopted union, label laws, and has given us particulars as to their population, which I presume, in the case of the southern States, would include the negro element. He told us further that some of the States had passed restrictive measures, in order to prevent blackmailing and boycotting by means of the union label. Honourable members seem to forThe get that in a number of the States union labels have been deliberately introduced, She purchases the stock to with the object, by levy upon the trusts, of raising funds with which to fight proposals for the enactment of restrictive measures. member's authority for that statement? she should not; but that authorities. My statement is absolutely obviously correct. America is the home of political corruption, and the system to which I have referred has been deliberately resorted to by the political parties in the States LegisHonorable members have asked latures. I do not think that the Attorney General was wise in asking us to follow American precedents. The United States is the home of Tammany, and also the home of ""place without power,"" .and ""power without place."" We have already had experience in this country as to what is meant by "" place without power,"" and "" power without place,"" and we have had a sufficiency of American precedents for the present. The Attornev-General and the honourable The member for Darling talked all round this subject, without touching its real crux.

When the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was under consideration, they desired a preference to He was speaking for be extended to unionists. They were defeated upon that, proposal, with the aid of several of the present Ministers. They did not get their undiluted preference, nor did they get political preference. They had then to consider a new method, or a I did not say upon, new form of the old method, to increase their political organization; and they devised the union label. If there is one thing on which I can congratulate the Labour Party it is on the possession of a Machiavelian trait, which no other political party in Australia can equal. There is no party in this country so far-seeing, Minister has not if so selfish, as is the Labour Party. The moment they were beaten in their endeavour to utilize this House as a recruiting agency for their own political strength they began to reach out for the union label. I shall show how they will use the union label to improve their political position. Under these clauses it can be used by any association, and not merelv by a union registered under the Arbitration Act. I appeal to honourable members opposite to say, before this debate closes, whether they are prepared, to restrict the use of the union label to unions registered under that Act. ber vote for the clauses if they agreecf fo do so? seriously to consider the advisability of doing so, should they be made innocuous in",72,Chicago Iii Dec 10 1904

481,Mr Kelly,"I should be prepared very,that way. If these clauses are passed in their present form, the result will be that new unions will be formed-to use the union label. They will be unions having political objects, finding funds for the Labour Tarty and voting for Labour candidates. Union label boycotts will be fostered in order to compel men to enter these political unions at the peril of their livelihood, because the products of workers who are not members of these unions will not be purchased. pared to compel men, at the peril of their livelihood, to enter formed to vote for themselves, and to pay funds into the party chest that supports them. These are the objects of these provisions. If honourable members opposite were in a Court of Law they could not deny that, and I hope they will not have the temerity to deny it in this .House. This accounts for their anxiety to have these provisions -passed this session-that they may be used as a means of organization for the next Federal elections. In these circumstances, the Attorney-General cannot -complain that the Opposition, feeling that this is the case, and knowing that these proposals have not been before the country. should desire that a reasonable time should he devoted to their discuission. If I were in order in saying so, I should be prepared to say that the Opposition hold the view that one of the grossest conspiracies ever known in tlie history of Australia is at present h e w , carried on in this Chamber. ber would not be in order in saying so. but, though I am unable to express certain opinions in an orderly way, I still must hold them, and when, in common with other honourable members, I hold such strong views in connection with this matter, I claim that we are entitled to ask for a. reasonable time to permit the debates in this House to operate as an educative medium throughout the Commonwealth. The associations who will take advantage of these proposals are associations which will be paying subscriptions to the Labour Party and voting for Labour candidates. As a proof that I am in no way extreme in holding these views. I should like to mention one of the reasons which induces me to hold them. One of the most important unions in the Commonwealth, ablv and subtly presided over by the honourable member for Darling, a year -ago had rules which compelled its members to vote in a certain direction. I refer to the Australian Workers' Union, which took a part in politics and ran a newspaper, circulating strongly partisan views, and which issued a levy upon its members of is. per annum. Under tbe Commonwealth Arbitration Act that union was compelled, if it' wished to register under the Act, to give up its political objects. Now there is nothing so certain as this : The moment the Trade Marks Bill is passed into law, with Honourable members are preits union label provisions complete, the Australian Workers' Union will register a unions trade mark; and, under its old rules and its political objects, start on a general propaganda under new auspices. Apart from the merits of these provisions, we certainly have the right to consider the inadvisability of bringing one Act of this Parliament into direct conflict with another. If we pass this Bill with these clauses, it will be found to be a direct inducement to one of the greatest unions in the Commonwealth to sever its association with the Arbitration Court in order that it may try to gain its object in another way. Is not that a condition of things which the Committee should regard with the utmost seriousness? ber aware that there are some members of the Labour Party who do not belong to any trade union ? have already expressed my complete sympathy with trade unionism. WhatI object to is that political unionism should, in this The honourable memHouse, be encouraged to the detriment of persons outside them. I do not object even The n I shall not say so; to political unionism, so long as it is voluntary, but I do object to giving political unionism power over its competitors by Act of Parliament. I do not object to the Australian Workers' Union having political rules. All I say is that if , for any reason, it wishes to compel persons by Act of Parliament to join its ranks, it must so frame its rules that every member will have absolute liberty of action. pletely changed its rules, but my fear is that the change has not been, voluntarily made by the majority of the members, and that, when it gets an engine which will enable it to proceed without the help of the Arbitration Court in the settlement of disputes, it wil l revert to its old political rules and register a union, label in order to increase its membership. That is a point",73,Chicago Iii Dec 10 1904

I can assure him that the members of the Opposition will be ready to respond to a challenge in that direction. I am satisfied that there is a strong feeling throughout the country districts in Victoria, and, I believe, throughout the rest of Australia, against the insertion of these clauses in the B ill . Practically, the only desire of the members of the Labour Party in seeking the enactment of this class legislation, is not to suppress piracy or sweating, but to increase the membership of their unions for political purposes. They intend to use the union label as a means of boycotting manufacturers and compelling workmen to join the unions. In supporting the union label, the Attorney-General is preparing a sword which will eventually be the means of politically slaying himself. The union, label can be of no value to the Labour Party unless it is to be used as a means of boycotting. According to Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, the word "" boycott "" means ""to combine against a landlord, tradesman, employer, or other person; to withhold social or business relations from him, or to deter others from holding such relations.""

528,The Chairman,,79,Batchelor Th E Honourable Member For Does Not Support It
529,Mr Wilson,"This is the opinion ofit can only be applied by an association of persons. It is desired to put the power of the boycott into the hands of the unions. The honourable member for Bland has gloried in the fact that he has indulged in boycotting, and he has admitted that employers have the right to do so. If it were not for the power which the union label will give the unions, they would not have asked their chief assistant, the Attorney General, to bring forward these clauses and to after them so many times. The word "" boycott "" as a noun is defined in Webster's Unabridged Dictionary to mean "" social and business interdiction for the purpose of coercion."" So that these clauses are designed to introduce not only a system of boycotting, but a system of coercion between employers and employees, between tradesmen and their customers. In my opinion,, the Attorney-General and his colleagues should have left the positions which they now occupy Tather than have been drawn by any means into bringing forward such proposals. The honourable and learned gentleman must know, from what he has read on the subject, .that in America the labels have been used almost entirely for the purpose of boycotting tradesmen who would, not submit to the dictation of unionists. ber give us any evidence that they have been so used?' dence of the honourable member for Bland that in Australia he has assisted in boycotting? knows that in America employers have black-listed employees in regard to their businesses.

Should we allow ourselves to be induced by the Ministry or any other section of the House to introduce this system into Australia? It is generally acknowledged that practically the object of the unions in seeking to legalize the union label is to apply this pernicious system to all the relations existing between employers and employees in the Commonwealth. No one takes exception to voluntary trade unionism, but the coercive unionists who recognise as their leader the honourable member for Bland are aiming at the introduction of such a system as that which exists in connection with the Flint Glass Workers' Union of America. should have a quorum.

I am not suggesting that the evil has been or is only on the one side. The Attorney General knows that it is customary for the members of the learned profession to which he belongs not to work with those who are outside the union. But the custom obtaining throughout the learned professions is due to reasons quite different from those which actuate members of coercive trade unions intaking the course I have indicated. The effect of these clauses will be to introduce into Australia the system that now obtains One man cannot in the United States.

540,Mr Kennedy,"That was not the causeof the burning questions at issue ? TheA ttorney-General has argued that the boycott to which reference has been made is a matter that affects only the United States; but I am showing that the system is not unknown in Australia. Another point having an important bearing on this question is that the workers' label clauses are designed,.not to 1 indicate the sweater, but chiefly to force all workmen throughout Australia into unions. Dealing with the position in the United States, Palgrave points out thatWhen the non-union man, denominated a "" scab "" by the union, tries to take the place of strikers, violence is often visited upon him by the but that the leather shall have been preunion, as some years ago in England; but the majority of the unions do not countenance violence. I know that the majority of trade unionists do not countenance violence, but this is an indication of the treatment which will be meted out to those who object to the union label by the coercive unions which .are represented chiefly, if not wholly, by honourable members in the Ministerial corner. The members of labour organizations and the general public will be urged to buy no goods except those -to which the union label is attached. All other goods will be boycotted, and as it will not be possible for manufacturers to use the union label unless the whole of the workmanship in their wares is that of unionists, the logical result will be that none but unionists will be able to get employment. aimed at is to force all the labour of the community into unions, and I do not envy the name which the Attorney-General will leave to posterity if he is successful in getting these clauses placed on the statute book. The secretary to the American Federation of Labour reported, at the Convention of 1896, that a large-number of trades, of which he read a list, had adopted the union label; and spoke of the growth of the label as sure. He added, "" It is the backbone of some of our unions."" of the unions in Australia are at the present time without a backbone, and that, I suppose, is why they are so anxious to adopt what is said to be the backbone of the American unions. As honourable members know, the union label was used in the first instance to distinguish cigars made by white labour from those made by Chinese labour. adopted in the cigaT trade of Australia, and there are many union propagandists as energetic as is the honourable member for Darl[20512 ing, its use will be pushed to an extreme, which will mean that the label cannot be attached to cigars unless none but unionists have been employed in connection with their manufacture in all its processes. Asi n this country the tobacco leaf from which the local cigars are made is grown chiefly by Chinamen, that, I think, will present a difficulty in the way of applying the label to cigars made from local leaf. If the shoemakers adopt a label, and the principle is again pushed to an extreme in their business, it will be necessary not only that the boots and shoes to which the label is applied shall have been made by unionists, pared by unionist tanners, and the hide flayed by unionist butchers. Perhaps they may even go so far as to require that only the hides of cattle reared on properties worked by union labour shall be used. The honourable member for Yarra has shown me the design of the label u.sed by the Hatters Union of America. HaTs are made of various materials. I do not think that many straw hats are made in Australia, but many of the hats worn here are manufactured from rabbits' f u r. the honourable .member is in order in going into the details of manufacture. portant matter. of relevancy.

In. fact, goods tearing a fraudulent label might actually be better in quality than goods which bore the genuine union label.

We have to submit to the views of tlie Government and their supporters, but I do not think that their tactics are reasonable.

"" He did not tell us that this subiect was discussed for five months ' in the"" Dominion Parliament, and' that, notwithstanding that, the Bill did not succeed in passing. House, but the nominee House threw it out. in a state of alarm about the Bill. As a rule people engaged in commercial pursuits do not take alarm for nothing. They are hard-headed business men. They see in this measure a menace to their industrial occupations, and to the ramifications of business, and their alarm seems to be based upon the experience of this kind of legislation elsewhere. The Attorney-General told us of benefits which would accrue to the community from the adoption of the union label. He referred to its successful operation in Amerifca, and pointed' but that from the highest moral stand-point there was every reason for adopting such legislation in Australia. If it be true that in the interests of morality these proposals should be passed-if they are necessary in the interests of the higher development of our industrial relationships-wh y has the Government been so careful to drop from the Bill anv direct reference to trade unions? Judging from the way [REPRESENTATIVES.] Marks Bill. in which the Attorney-General has shorn down his amendments, one would think that he was ashamed of trade unions. Why has he eliminated every reference to trade unions, and at the same time preserved to them every privilege? If the union label the morale of the workers as a whole, and of preventing sweating, why has every reference to trade unionism been omitted from the Bill? the state of the Committee. [Quorum formed.] one of the main purposes of these provisions is to prevent fraud and piracy-to prevent other people from taking advantage of the labels which will be owned by the trade organizations of Australia. Surely we do not play at legislation in this Parliament. We do not reel off so many Acts without some objective in view, other than to make the people outside believe that we are a grand lot of fellows, and that we are doing thema lot of good by our statutes. I challenge the Attorney-General to show the necessity for legislation of this kind in Australia, to show that piracy is proceeding, or that fraud is taking place in regard to the sale of union-made goods. I challenged the honourable member for Darling this afternoon on the same point, and he mentioned an incident which had occurred in his own expedience. He stated that he was setting up house, and was anxious to buy his furniture at a union shop, and he wanted to be saved the small trouble of making inquiries at the Trades Hall as to the place at which he could get what he required. Are we to pass a Bill of this kind in order to facilitate the honourable member's purchase of his furniture? Dees he pretend that a little incident of that kind affecting his likings ancl his pleasure is to furnish a basis for legislation of this kind?

I do not believe, however, that we should legislate upon the off chance that something of that kind may occur at some time or other. We should not go to the trouble of introducing drastic legislation merely because fraud has occurred somewhere else under conditions which are entirely different from ours.

He told us that trade union label Acts were in operation in forty States and territories, but I was not clear as to whether the union label provisions were in every case attached to a Trade MarksB ill , or embodied in a separate measure. separate Acts, but I do not think that is material. Unless union labels are trade marks, we have no power to deal with them. pared to believe that the Attorney-General is acting in perfect good faith, and that he believes that we have power under the Constitution to legislate in regard to union labels. It is a curious fact that in America, where they have a Federal Constitution very similar to our own, the trade union label provisions have been embodied in separate Acts, instead of being bundled up in a Trade Marks Bill, as is proposed here. I ' believe that in the Canadian case the head of the Trade Marks Department declared that union label provisions could not be incorporated in a Trade MarksB ill, and declined on, that ground to register them. That was the reason why the Parliament rejected the union label provisions in the first instance. All the expert evidence was to the effect that the union labels were foreign to the object of a Trade Marks Bill, and could not be incorporated in it . The same view was taken by the Commissioner of Patents at Washington, who said that union labels were not trade marks, because they did not include ownership. Shall we not accept the dictum of an expert who has devoted his lifelong attention to trade marks matters rather than that of a Judge versed merely in the drv technicalities of the law ? I do not think that it was ever contemplated that we should meddle with legislation of this kind. TheI want the hondrafting of the Bifll now before us makes it very clear that the union label is foreign to the purposes of a Trade MarksB ill. If a union label is a trade mark, why should parts i i i . , iv., v., and v i . of the measure have to be made non-applicable to it? Why could not the whole of the machinery of the Bill be made to apply? The anI say that we swer is that there is an immense difference",85,Batchelor Th E Honourable Member For Does Not Support It

He cannot attach it to any goods, ship? union label is the employer, who cannot own it. allowed to use it, whereas the worker is permitted to own it, but cannot use it . If there were any tangiblemarketable ownership which' could be transferred, surely a man would have a right to its use without the interference of an outside done fore the workman cannot own a union label in the sense that a man owns a trade mark, and provisions such as those now before us must necessarily be foreign to the genius and purpose of a Trade MarksB ill . I do not think we have any right to interfere in industrial matters, which are expressly, placed beyond the range of our powers. Eminent counsel tell us that we -shall lay up a heavy crop of constitutional difficulties by acting in the manner now proposed. the statement of one of the American Judges to the effect that a man had a right to have his special skill labelled as such on the market; but the Bill does not propose to give a working man that right. He cannot use the label. That is left to another man, in whom tlie proprietorship of the label w not vested. Without the intervention of the employer, all the workman's efforts to put an indication of his special skill on the market must be futile. The Attorney-General has so tied the workman up in this B ill that he cannot move hand or Toot without the employer. arrangement must be a mutual one, and that neither can do anything without the other's consent ? there is no actual ownership in the union label. The Attorney-General went to America for all bis illustrations, and I think it would have been better if he had selected some from British communities. I have no wish to set up in Australia industrial conditions such as those which exist in America, and I shall do my best to prevent anything of that kind occurring.

If these be the result of 'the successful working of the union label provisions, there is every reason why we. should not introduce them into our legislation.

Our cigar-makers have tribunals operating all over Australia, to which they can represent their grievances. that they have tribunals all over Australia ? a Court to -which they can resort if they, choose. very doubtful whether that Court could be invoked, unless a dispute had already extended over more than one State in the form of a strike.",86,Batchelor Th E Honourable Member For Does Not Support It

My point sistently evading the award of the Court. thing whatever to do with my point. I apprehend that when this law is passed it will be evaded. My point is that we have already established a special tribunal to look after the cigar-makers, the hatters, and the clothiers, and in that respect those trades differ entirely from similar trades in pave the way to the establishment of peace America. We were assured by the Attorney-General that so popular is this legislaployes. Have they done so in, America? tion in America that forty States and Territories, representing 68,000,000 people, have adopted it. But what are the relations between labour and capital which obtain in those States. there is great competition, which is the honourable member's ideal. that it is. The honourable member for Bland and the honourable and learned member for West Sydney are constantly telling the people that in America trusts prevent competition. They declare that these forty States are under the thumb of the trusts, whereas the honourable member for Wide Bay, affirms, in effect, that they are free. Had not these honourable members better settle the form of their shibboleth, before they begin to proclaim it? honourable member with brains. member has not been endowed with too much brains himself, and, judging by the speech which was recently delivered by his lieutenant at Hurstville, that honourable member has none to spare.

That is the only test of the value of this legislation which we can apply. This afternoon, the honourable member for Darling told us that these provisions would and goodwill between employers and emhave occurred there are not due to the use of the union label. They had no connection with it that the introduction of the union label there has done nothing to prevent the existence of bitter relations between capital and labour.

The honourable member says that .the true view is to make this class war as keen as possible, in order to force the workers to insist upon their rights. If I 'could see any chance of improving the -relations which exist in Australia between capital and labour by means of the union label, I would hold up both hands for it to-morrow. It is because I recognise that to bring it into operation will only intensify that class bitterness, which the honourable member for Barrier so earnestly seeks, that I am opposed to it, root and branch. accentuate that bitterness, and increase that friction. else, and it will do so here. Its compensating advantages are small indeed when weighed alongside that bitter class feeling which it has begotten in other portions of the globe. It has always been my strong desire to bring capital and labour closer together. with the coal miners and coal proprietors in the place where I was. brought up, I had access to every manager's office, and I settled all disputes which arose over the office table, and I left the miners with better wages and conditions than they have since enjoyed. old days. cisely where I always stood. I never did believe in this later movement, and I do not understand why the honourable member for Barrier should so constantly jibe me about it. He knows very well that twelve years ago he and the honourable member for Bland chased me around my electorate because I would not subscribe to the labour pledge, which is the basis of the solidarity movement. ever to do with the programme of the party. thing to do with it. velopments, of which the trade union label forms a part, can have no result other than to further embitter the relations which exist between the worker and his employer. For that reason I am very much opposed to them ever taking root in Australian soil. Whatever objects trades organizations in America may hope to achieve by means of the union label, we have other means of securing them in Australia. There is no I believe need for this mischievous, meddlesome legislation. We have been .led to believe by some honourable members that the States Legislatures in America are all more or less under the thumb of corrupt persons -that they are invariably subject to corrupt influences. I think we may fairly be suspicious of the laws which are enacted by those Legislatures to which we hear such constant reference in terms of opprobrium and reproach. Whilst honourable members have nothing but evil to say of them in respect of other matters, they single out their action in connection with the adoption of I believe that it will the union label as a pattern for Australia. Is it not just possible that these labels are It has done so everywhere manipulated for trust purposes? inconsistent with the literature upon the Subject. those States is supposed to be under the thumb of trusts. Is it unreasonable to When I had something to do suppose that in some way the trusts havis prompted this legislation for their own advantage? To-day the Attorney-General ranged over the whole of those forty States, 1 and he could not find in any one of them such a tribunal as a compulsory Arbitration Court. He could not point to one in which Wages Boards had been established in the good by statutory authority. I see no reason why we should adopt this Yankee idea here. In my opinion, if this legislation be passed the unionists will suffer in another way. Honourable members, I presume, do not imagine that there will not be retaliation on the part of the capitalists. Before today we have seen labour circumvented by the machinations of capitalists. We have known this sort of legislation to turn out nothing but dead sea apples, as the result of the pressure that is applied from without. Do honourable members imagine that there will not be retaliation upon the other side? Judging by the feeling which exists outside this House, I am of opinion that class bitterness will be intensified by All these later dethese proposals to a very great degree. The final result will certainly not be to the advantage of those who are most earnestly seeking to place this legislation upon, the statute-book. That is the view which I hold very strongly. Time alone will show whether my fears in that respect are well founded.

I was more than surprised to hear the honourable member for Bland deliberately defend the boycotting of capitalists the other night. I have never made any pretence of defending boycotting by the capitalists, and I never shall. does not buy from a "" SAveater,"" if he knows it. had been engaged in my trade instead of in the coal mining industry, he would have been a ""boycotter"" too. been ready to boycott the "" sweater,"" and I would do so to-morrow. When the honourable member for Bland made the statement to which I have alluded he was referring to the practice of black-listing byemployers. He saidSome honourable members have seen a copy of the black-list circulated amongst the pastoralists of Western QueenslandI have seen black-lists circulated in respect to other callings. I do not say that an ""employer who boycotts is necessarily wrong in doing so often justifiable. The result of a boycott is always to stir up further strife In my opinion, when it comes to boycotting, the capitalist in every case gains an advantage, because he has the means of carrying on the war, whereas the worker has not. In another portion of his argument, the Attorney General said that this was not a case of union as against non-union labour, and could not be argued in that way. He said it was the case of a great body of workers who were asking that the same rights should be extended to them as were given to other trade-mark owners. so, there must have been a strange modification of feeling amongst members of the Labour Party since this matter was introduced into the Senate. I recollect Senator Drake moving the insertion of the following new clause: Notwitstanding anything contained in this Part, no trade union shall refuse to authorize a manufacturer or .employer who adopts the rate of wages and the hours of employment fixed in reference to the trade of such trade union under any law of the Commonwealth or of a State to apply if he so desires its union trade mark to the products of the labour of the members thereof ( employed by him or to the same kind of products of the labour of any employees not members of such union employed by him. I am sure that I could draft a better clause than that myself. However, its meaning can, with a little trouble, be discerned. It is intended to apply the benefits of the union label to non-union shops which have observed good conditions as to employment and wages. permit the union label to be attached to non-union goods if the conditions governing their manufacture were the same ? that the main purpose of the union label is to insure good conditions so far as the employees are concerned. Senator Pearce drew a very sharp distinction between unionists and non-unionists. In that respect, he differed entirely from the position taken up by the Attorney-General this afternoon. Of course, that is a minor point, and I do not press it. One of my main contentions against this legislation is 1 that it is a further attempt to "" politicalize "" the trade unions of Australia. I am a strong believer in the value of voluntary trade unionism, and I hold that all the good which is being derived by trade unions to-day is due to their organization as such, quite apart from their political aims. I A boycott is would further point out that in America the workers will not hear of such a tribunal as a Compulsory Arbitration Court. They will not allow the State to interfere' in the settlement of their disputes. Neither will the great body of British unionists. The great body of unionists in Great Britain and America would reprobate a man if he dared to stand up for this tinkering with politics, as we know it in Australia. But here a man who does not subscribe to the full extent to the politifcal influence which is exercised by unionists is branded as a traitor, a renegade, and a ""rat.""

740,,"Mr FULLER (Illawarra) -It is very,has not been so successful as to lead us to introduce them in Australia. The Attorney-General in his very able speech pointed out that union label legislation had been adopted in some forty of the States of the American Union, but I have heard no argument to show that there is any necessity for the introduction of such legislation in Australia at the present time. the Commonwealth the various Federal Governments, instead of dealing with, the important matters for which the Federal Parliament was created, have introduced legislation which has caused dissension and dissatisfaction throughout Australia. This is class legislation, and, as such, is sure to cause further dissension. cedents quoted by the Attorney-General were American precedents, and the state of affairs existing between employers and employees in that country is not such as to induce us to place our people in a similar position. to establish trade unions of a political character, and we are justified in opposing it on that ground. to hear the Attorney-General on. the constitutionality of the proposal now made, because I have heard very strong opinions expressed, not only by lawyers in this House, but by lawyers occupying prominent positions in New South Wales, to the effect that these union labour provisions are unconstitutional. the Attorney-General expressed any views in regard to that matter. fully. missed that part of the honourable and learned gentleman's speech, but I can assume that he looks upon these provisions as constitutional, or he would not be proceeding with them. very doubtful whether, under the powers conferred on this Parliament by the Constitution, we have any right to interfere with the industrial legislation of Australia. In dealing with The American legislation on this subject, it should be borne in mind that it is a matter of common report that briberv and corruption goes on in American Legislatures, and the mere fact that this legislation has been passed by the Legislatures of fortv States of the American Union is not a sufficient reason for adopting it here. America in the introduction and establishment of a regular system of boycott in trade. orable member might, with just as much force, contend that we should abolish trades unions because of the boycotting in America. of the union label in. America has led, in Since the inauguration of many instances, to the establishment of boycotting. where that has been caused. mislaid a reference to such a case; but I shall bring it under the notice of the Attorney-General. The honourable and learned All the pregentleman made the point that there has not been one non-unionist in Australia who has raised his voice in opposition to these proposals. That is easily understood when we remember that although non-unionists form by far the largest proportion of the This is really an attempt workers of Australia, they are not organized. Buti f the voice of the individual non-unionist is not heard in opposition to I should like these proposals, many members of this Committee, who represent large bodies of non-unionists, raise their voices in opposition to these clauses on their behalf. sent non-unionists in the same way. I do not know whether do, and it is strange that the Government should be forcing this Bill through under tbe whip of the Labour Party, who are keeping them in power. The Attorney General has said that in these clauses he is trying to hold the scales evenly between unionists and non-unionists, but I think that the honourable and learned gentleman has failed to do so. It is to my mind a matter for extreme regret that members of the Ministry, who are notoriously in opposiI n my opinion, it is tion to legislation of this character, should be prepared to sink their strong convictions and assist the Attorney-General in carrying iit. How they can. reconcile their consciences in this matter, I am unable to say. If I thought that legislation of this character was necessary, that industrial conditions in Australia warranted its introduction, that it would benefit the workers, that it would not set class against class, would not establish an industrial boycott in Australiaand would insure the manufacture of goods under proper conditions, It has resulted in I should be disposed to support it.

They have been so introduced under pressure, and the Government are resorting to pressure to have them passed. The Prime Minister said at few days ago, ""The task must be done,"" and it appears that this is part of the task to which the honourable and learned gentleman referred. I need only add that I shall be prepared' to resist the passing of the clauses proposed by the Attorney-General as strongly as I possibly can. tinuing my speech I should like to appeal to the Government to permit those who are in attendance upon honourable members to secure some rest, even though we should ourselves be compelled by tyrannical action on the part of the Government to remain here. When speaking before, I regarded a remark made by the Vice President of the Executive Council as a promise that we should adjourn at about 11 o'clock, but had I known that there would be an all-night sitting, I should not have condensed my. remarks as I did. I was dealing with some decisions given in American Courts bearing on the union label. I showed that this legislation in America had led to such abuses that frequent appeals had to be made to the Courts for protection against the tyranny, coercion and intimidation of the boycott,, which had assumed such alarming proportions in the United States as to institute virtually a reign of terror in that country. I quoted American judgments to show that these boycotts were considered illegal, and that the union label was illegal. the honourable member were cases against rascals and counterfeiters The Court may not interfere in that the Courts did not hold the union label to be a legal instrument. passed to put down rascality. learned gentleman, is aware that the legalisignifies merely membership of an associazation of the union label is not. universal tion.

General desires a reference to opinions on the union label, I can refer him to a leading article which appeared in the Age of the 17th of this month. I find that in the case of the Cigar-makers' Protective Union v. Conkam, in 1889, Judge Gilfillan, of Minnesota saidThe device is wanting in the essential characterization of the legal trade mark. 1. It is not adopted nor used to indicate by what person the articles were made, but simply to indicate membership of a certain association. 2. Its use is not enjoyed as an incident of any business, and the right to use it cannot be transferred even with the transfer of the business in which it may be employed. The right to use it can be transferred only by becoming a member of one of the unions or employing those who are members, and lost only by ceasing to be a member or to employ members. 3. There is no exclusiveness in the use or right to use what is a necessary thing in a legal trade mark. All these authorities, so far as I am able to discover, are in absolute agreement that a union label and a trade mark are two entirely distinct things, and that one cannot take the place of the other. A union label is merely a mark to indicate the goods made by the members of a certain union, and has absolutely no commercial value, such as is inherent ""in a trade mark. In the case, Carson v. Wry, in 1889, Justice Thayer, of the Federal Judiciarv, saidThe union label does not answer to the definition ordinarily given of a technical trade mark this instance as in ordinary trade mark cases. Here, again, we have an absolute distinct tion made, and the right to interfere in the The protection of the Court could not be exJudge Devens, of Massachusetts, saidWe are of opinion that the label alleged by the Bil l in the case at bar to have been counterfeited cannot be treated as a trade mark. . , .

If the f u l l report of the case is looked at it will be found that the Judge decided that he could on equitable grounds do it, and he did. I can assure the honourable member that these quotations, from whatever source they come, are garbled. I do not say that the words are not correctly set down, but if the honourable member read the cases throughout he would form a different idea of the decisions from that which he has gained from these garbled reports. it may be a garbled account of the judgment, the Attorney-General admits that the words are correct. which contains a complete statementThe Court may not interfere in this instance as in an ordinary trade mark case. By that observation, it seems to me the Judge laid down a very definite distinction between a union label and a trade mark in the ordinary acceptation of the term. a measure like that which we are considering, and that makes all the difference. ther the Attorney-General has read an opinion which was given to a certain association Here, by learned counsel, who, if [206] I remember aright, lays it down that the union label cannot be legalized, and calls' I think not. I think in question the legality of this legislation. getting his information from the same source, and it is right, so far as it goes; but they have carefully omitted that the learned counsel said that it is a matter of extreme difficulty. opinion directly. I repeat that in the United States the judicial authorities seem to recognise a distinctionin character between a union label and a trade mark. legislation. even legislation can change the essential character of the union label. From House Documents, volume 88, for the session of 1900-1, I propose to auote a section from the labour laws of California. It appears on page 1005, under the head of "" Trade Marks, & c , of Trade Unions,"" and reads as .follows: Any person engaged in the production, manufacture, or sale of any article of merchandise made in whole or in part in this State, who, by any imprint, label, trade mark, tag, stamp, or other inscription or device, placed or impressed upon such article or upon the cask, box, case, or package containing the same, misrepresents or falsely states the kind, character, or nature of the labour employed or used, or the extent of the labour employed or used, or the number or kind of persons exclusively employed or used, or that a particular or distinctive class or character of labourers was wholly and exclusively used or employed when in fact another class or character or distinction of labourers was used or employed either jointly or in any wise supplementary to such exclusive class, character, or distinction of labourers, in the production or manufacture of the article fo which such imprint, label, trade mark, tag, stamp, or other inscription or device is affixed, or upon the cask, box, case, or package Here is a sentence containing the same, is guilty of a misdemeanour, and punishable by a fine of not less than F if t y nor more than Five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the county gaol for not less than twenty nor more than ninety days, or both.

The TEMPORARYCHAIRMAN would ask the honourable member to refrain from repeating any statements which may have been previously made. that I have made the statement only once. Whilst the enactment of the union label may be justified in countries which do not possess industrial legislation, such as these States possess, for the special protection of workers in various ways, there is no justification for its enactment in Australia. Our Wages Boards, Arbitration Courts, and pressly to insure to the workers those very conditions, which it is urged the enactment of will the United States On that subject, I propose to read a short extract from an article which appeared in the Atlantic Monthly, of October, 1904. J. Bullock, and is entitled "" The Closed Shop."" as follows:A little reflection should convince any one that the conditions under which a man shall dispose of his labour are of such exceeding importance to society that, if freedom is to be denied, the restrictions imposed should be determined by the. Government, and not by any other agency. Such regulations should be just, uniform, and certain; they should not be subject to the possible caprice, selfishness, or special exigencies of a labour organization. Here, as elsewhere, we should apply the principle that when it is necessary to restrict the freedom of labour or. capital to enter any industry, the matter becomes the subject of public concern and public regulation. If membership in a labour organization is to be a condition precedent to the right of securing employment, it will be necessary for the Government to control the constitution, policy, and management of such associations, so far as may be requisite for the purpose in view. Only upon these terms would the compulsory unionization of industry be con[206]2 ceivable. Of course, before such legislation could be enacted, a change in the organic law of the I should like to know how some States and the nation would need to be effected, for we now hnve numerous constitutional guarantees of the right of property in labour. These guarantees include the right to make lawful contracts, and the individual freedom so ordained can be restricted by the Legislature only when the restraint can be justified as a proper exercise of the police power. Time and effort might be required for securing such constitutional amendments; but our instruments of Government provide a lawful and reasonable method of accomplishing this result. Coming to the question of the repeated rejection of the union label in Canada, I propose to read some extracts: A Bill to legalize the union label was first introduced in 1895, and has been reintroduced I almost every year since. It does not appear at any time to have been a Government measure, but was in the hands of private members, its latest sponsor being Mr Ralph Smith, M.F. In Canada, as in Australia, the union label I assure you, sir, cannot be registered as a trade mark under the existing law. Therefore, special legislation is required to legalize it. Up to and including 1903 the Bill to effect this purpose was introduced as an amendment of the Trade Marks and Designs Act. When the B ill of that year was discussed in the Upper House (where it was first brought in), the principle involved in' recognising the label as a trade mark was declared to be unsafe and undesirable, and the measure was thrown out. factories laws are designed exIn this year's Bill all reference to the Trade Marks Act was dropped, and it was styled "" The Union LabelB ill . "" It was introduced the union label will secure. It in the Canadian House of Commons on 30th January, 1905. introduce what are known in as ""closed shops."" THE CASE FOR THE LABEL. The Bill seemed harmless, and tlie reasons urged for its adoption looked specious enough on the surface and at a first glance. Its promoters claimed that its intention was to prevent It is from the pen of Mr Charles the use of bogus labels, and to protect' the community from the products of prison labour The concluding paragraph reads and the sweat-shop, and tp legalize a guarantee that all goods bearing the label represent fair wages, reasonable working hours, and good sanitary conditions. THE CASE AGAINST THE LABEL. , The case against the label was presented to members by the Canadian Manufacturers' Association. While offering numerous and weighty argument's against the label and its use, as shown, in the United States and in Canada, the employers really rested their case on the principle involved. They claimed that the questions for the Dominion Parliament to settle were1 1. Whether or not any labour union should have a legal sanction to use or abuse any right which history had shown to be used to the detriment of the whole community? 2. Was it desirable to forge a weapon to be placed in the hands of erratic, capricious, and financially unsound organizations to enable them to coerce employers to practically surrender the control of their factories to them, and to intimidate free and competent workmen,",96,Batchelor Th E Honourable Member For Does Not Support It

But upon close examination, I find that the divergences are considerable and well worthy of men. The first proposition with which we had to deal was one for trade union marks ; the next was -for union trade marks, whilst the third and last is a proposal to provide for workers' trade marks. 'difference between a trade union mark and a union trade mark if it be not a mere juggle in terms ? observe that the note at the head of the latest list of amendments sets forth that they embody the princiole and substance of the amendments contained in the list first circulated Bv me. difference between the definition of the two ^propositions put before the Committee by the Attorney-General, but. in the series of amendments now before the Chair, unfor"" workers' trade mark."" sub-clause 1 of clause 73. the giving of the definition in the clause itself is an evidence of bad drafting. consideration, at this stage. position in order that we may gauge the accuracy of the Attorney-General's judgment that there is no material difference between the first and second list of amendments circulated by him. Honourable members have framed their judgment on the original proposition made by him, and the moment I begin to show that there is a vital difference between the two, the Attorney-General would stifle discussion. I am surprised at that omission of a definition of a vital provision, since simple words like ""production"" and ""produced"" are defined at length. We can only regard those definitions as padding designed to cover up the deficiency to which I have referred. There is also a difference between the original proposition as to regisI hope that tration and that now under consideration. This appears to indicate that the Attorney General's first proposal was loosely-drafted, because it did not protect the unions. In his second proposal he has corrected a number of his errors of omission. Another point is that in the original proposition there was a proper differentiation made between individual workers' marks and association workers' marks. That difference was a very real one. I think that there is a flaw in the present proposition, and that the two proposals ought to be the attention of serious-minded properly separated. Although there is a pretence of similarity between the two, they have really nothing in common. The one deals with associations registering labels for definite purposes, and the other with What is the individual workers' marks which can be of no value to the individual, since no article is the product .of one man. This is an indication of the need for further consideration of these matters on the part of the Attornev-General. Some days ago I quoted a statement from an American journal that the union label was typical of American industrial conditions-condi tions which did not exist outside that country. But I heard last night that an honourable member of this House was instrumental in introducing the principle of the union label in one of the greatest unions in the",97,Batchelor Th E Honourable Member For Does Not Support It

794,Mr Kelly,"I have dealt with the promother country. We know what has been the effect of the union label in the United States and the honourable member in question ought certainly to tell us what has been the experience in England in this regard. We can only assume, in the absence of any explanation, that it has been still more unfortunate than has been that of the United States. The honourable member for Darling said that these provisions would be exceptionally beneficial to non-unionists. He proceeds on the assumption that whenever the union label is used, higher wages will prevail. tion. the majority of the Commonwealth are concerned one tribunal settles all questions of wages. But if the honourable member's original assumption be right-and we know that it is not-h e is still wrong when, he proceeds further with his line of argument. He says that if non-unionists are forced to join unions because of the union label, they are forced into improved conditions. In that respect he is egregiously wrong. There is only a certain yearly amount of national production. All wages, whether of capital or of labour, have to be paid out of that yearly production, and if all men have to be driven into unions, does it not necessarily follow that there will be a levelling down as well as a levelling up of wages. The amount of wages to be paid practically remains stationary within narrow limits. If men are forced into unions the result will be, not to bring all wages up to union rates,, but to. draw a mean between the lower wages which the honourable member claims are paid outside the unions, and the higher wages that are paid inside. I trust that the Attorney-General will seriously consider the points that I have endeavoured to put before him. make a personal explanation. During the course of my speech this morning I referred to the fact that the honourable member for Wide Bay-the deputy leader of the Labour Party-ha d paid a visit to my electorate, and in the course of a speech had referred to the adulteration of food and clothing in. a way that suggested that these proposals were designed to remedy that evil. When asked to quote the authority for my statement, I referred honourable members to the Sydney Morning Herald and the Daily Telegraph, but was not able at the moment to put my hand on the report which I had in mind. I have now before me the Daily Telegraph of the 27th ult., which reports that in the course of the speech in question the honourable member for Wide Bay saidAdulteration permeated the whole range of food and diet, and the persons who thus defrauded the public were murderers in effect, as the little ones were starved and killed by false foods. . . . They had been engaged for the past two weeks in the Commonwealth Parliament on an endeavour to remedy this in some degree by the union label. Yes, continued Mr Fisher, if they liked to so call it, but the right of the majority to enable the consumer to find out at least who manufactured I contest that assumpwhat they ate, drank, or wore. It is clear that, so far as It will thus be seen that my statement was the workers in absolutely correct. statement was called in question, I take this opportunity of showing that it was not, as has been suggested, a deliberate misrepresentation. Sitting suspended at 8.30 a.m., Friday, until) 0.30 a.m. In the course of an able speech,, the honourable member for Parramatta has dealt with this question from the unionist standpoint, and has shown that to pass the proposals now before us would be to make a serious mistake. The honourable member for Wide Bay recently visited the electorate of Lang and sought to show that the union label was designed to protect the people from adulterated goods. That was an unfair position to take up. I hold that the Labour Party should be ready to deal with this matter without any attempt to introduce considerations that must tend to confuse the public mind. The union label was introduced in America to meet special conditions. The-people there had no such industrial legislation as we have in Australia to enable the workers to secure fair treatment, and it is because we do not desire an injustice to be inflicted upon any section of the community that we feel it our duty to point out that these provisions will not confer upon the workers the benefits which some honourable members claim will flow from them. The Labour Party, when in power, failed to pass any law designed to improve the position of the workers. All the great reforms that have led to the improvement of their conditions were brought about by the very men whom the Labour Party declare to be their enemies.

In conclusion.

My great desire is that But before proceeding to deal with them at length, I should like to express regret at the practice of some honourable member in removing from the Library books of common reference.

It favours the ambitions of a minority of workmen against jthe interests of the majority. 3. TheB ill, if passed, will, by the admission of the Labour leader in the House of Representatives, be made a weapon of boycott, to the serious detriment of the free workman, of the manufacturers and producers, and of the community generally. The people of the Commonwealth will inevitably have to pay higher for their necessities. 4. TheB ill appears to be framed solely as a means of coercion in the hands of the unionists, and is certain to be detrimental to the trade of Australia, both at home and abroad. The provision to enable an individual free workman to register a label, the Council considers, is of no value whatever under I ask the indulgence of the modern conditions of manufactures, and the proposed Commonwealth label is also regarded by this Chamber as worthless, either to the workmen themselves or to the manufacturers and producers. were forwarded to the Hon. the Attorneybetween Mr Isaacs and this Chamber on the subI have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, C.

Sir, I am directed by the Attorney-General to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 17th instant with reference to the union label clauses in the Trade MarksB ill , and to inform you that the Attorney-General would be glad to be informed at your earliest convenience1. What allegations of piracy by Australian manufacturers of goods reputed to be made by trade union labour are referred to, and where shall he find those allegations ? 2.

Sir, I have the honour to acknowlege the receipt of your letter of the 20th instant, and am directed to reply to the questions contained therein, in their regular order1. With regard to the allegation of piracy, I am directed to refer you to the remarks made by the Hon. J. C. Watson, M.P., which appeared in the-Age newspaper of the .'2nd October, 1905 :"" As to the Trades Union Label, to which exception has been taken, at present there was nothing in the law to prevent persons putting a label upon goods. Federal Government proposed to do was to prevent the fraudulent piracy by those who wanted to use another person's label. The opponents of the Trades Union Label were actually showing sympathy with thieves and pirates."" Again, Mr Tudor, M.P., is reported to have stated at PrahTan on the n t h October (see Age, 12/10/05), that the object of the Trades Union Label was "" to prevent goods made by union labour being pirated."" 2. In answer to this question, I beg to refer you to the sub-leader of the Age newspaper of the 17th instant, as follows :""The case for the union label clauses, from the workers point of view, was practically given away by Mr Watson, when he remarked in the Federal Parliament last Wednesday evening that he would Mr Knox. glory in a boycott undertaken to prevent some of the conditions which prevailed before the institution of Wages Boards and Arbitration Acts."" (See Hansard, p. 5202.) 3. In regard to your last question, I am desired to mention that it is notorious that in America the Union Label has been used as a means of boycott, a forcible and tyrannical means of coercion, and there is no reason to suppose that the unions, here, who desire to force this measure upon the public against the interests of every other section of the community, wilL refrain from making similar coercive use of the power they covet.

I have also received a resolution of protest from the Victorian Reform League in the following terms :That the Council of the Reform League regards the Union Label clauses of the Trade Marks Bill as designed to give a minority of the workers a tyrannical power over their fellows, with the intention of enforcing compulsory unionism upon the large majority holding the just principle of Mr Knox. freedom of contract. That such unjust and injurious legislation is intended to afford the means of boycotting the workers and distributers outside the unions, and the wares they may produce, is demonstrated by the text of the proposed clauses. This council protests against legislation at once dangerous and unjust as subversive of liberty and the well-being and peace of the community. It is also resolved that this council heartily approves of the Opposition members' energetic and patriotic efforts to prevent the inclusion of the Trades Union Label provisions in the Trades MarksB ill , and hopes that those efforts will be continued unflinchingly until successful.

I therefore see no justification whatever for the imputation of improper motives. member says that he regrets the circumstances under which we are discussing the Bill? circumstances and conditions under which the Bill is being discussed. My little experience in business and in the affairs of the world, teaches me that men can generally deal with matters of material concern to themselves, without incurring any undue physical or mental strain. Honourable members have now been out of their beds for the last twenty-eight or thirty hours, engaged, under abnormal circumstances, in discussing a question of grave importance. I am inclined to believe that there is a great deal of misconception and misrepresentation in regard to the proposal now I thank honourable members for before the Committee. Within this Chamber we hear these clauses described as union label clauses, whereas in the Bill itself there is no restriction whatever as to the persons who may desire to use this label. I may be permitted to give an illustration of the misconception which prevails outside this Chamber. In a remote part of the country a public meeting was convened in order to obtain an expression of opinion on the merits of the proposal. When the meeting assembled a gentleman present, who had not seen the measure, asked the chairman the exact nature of the provisions. After inquiry amongst those present, it was found that no one was in a position to give any definite information. A little common sense was brought to bear, and a member of this House was written to, and asked to supply a copy of the Bill, and the meeting was adjourned until that should be received. That illustration does not convey an extreme idea of the condition of affairs prevailing throughout some of the rural districts of Victoria. Some few months ago a deputation Interviewed me in regard to my attitude towards what are designated as the union label provisions of the Bill. As I stated when speaking on the second reading, I was prepared to approach the question with an open mind; and I told to hear what they had to say.

Strange to say, not one of the deputation was in a position to distinguish between these different proposals. When we hear this label continually referred to in this Chamber as a union trade mark proposal, designed to carry with it preference to unionists, it is not to be wondered at that misconception should prevail in the minds of the public, who have not the same opportunity to inform themselves as have the members of this Parliament. tion is still sending out the original circular, containing misrepresentation. speak at length, because I do not think there is any necessity to do so. I desire, however, to clearly state my position, and to show what my attitude has been on the general question. I have been amongst the workers all my life, and I am rather proud of the fact that I am a worker today. I may not at all times have seen eye to eye with those who worked beside me as manual labourers many years ago. I have been an advocate of unionism, but there has been no stronger critic than myself of many of the actions taken by unionism. In my opinion, unionists have been as wrong and as extreme on many occasions as have the capitalists or employers, whom unionists are prone to denounce at aid times. people. same in a.ll classes and conditions of society. There may be a little more veneer and polish in one section of society than another, but that veneer has only to be rubbed to show that nature is the same in ail men. Environment may alter views, but, at bottom, we are all alike. However, let me return to the principles which have always governed my actions.in matters of this sort. Whenever an enactment, legislative or otherwise, will tend to ""the peaceful adjustment of disputes between employer and employed, I shall be prepared to give it my support, no matter how far that enactment may go. Buti f any proposed enactment will, To my mind, cause friction in matters industrial, as between employer and employee!, then my support must be withheld. I have had no experience of industrial troubles beyond Australia, but I have been an eye-witness of much that has happened in Australia in this connection. The advice tendered, more particularly by employers and capitalists, has always been to adopt peaceful means of settling these industrial disputes-to set aside the old barbarous methods of brute force, such as the boycott, and to get on speaking terms one side with the other. Twenty years ago it was within the reach of the most vivid imagination that industrial disputes would be submitted to a judicial tribunal? That, however, has been brought about; and still we have capitalists and the employers to-day expressing a dread of something which the industrial population propose to do. I do not in the least share that dread; but I do say that a legislative body cannot be too careful about placing in the bands'of any section of the communitv a power that may prove a source of friction in the future. This Is where I join issue with those who are advocating the label proposal, even in its present form. month or two ago described ""this as a very equitable proposal.

' I remember clearly and distinctly what I did say when speaking on the second reading. I then directed my attention particularly to the remarks of the honourable member for Corangamite, when I expressed the opinion that I did not think it at all necessary to go to the United States for illustrations of the effects of this particular class of legislation. I added that I intended to approach the question with an open mind; and no further commitment BidI make then, nor have I made up to the present time. To return to the merits of the proposal, what do we find? It is of no use talking about this as a trade union mark: that is done with.

Consequently there is not that great divergence of opinion to-day amongst members o i this £fouse that there appears to be amongst the public outside.

W ill there be a separate and distinctive trade mark for trade unionists, as distinguished from others engaged in precisely the same industries? whether apart from factories laws and the Arbitration Courts, those who work in factories where there is no competent authority to prescribe the conditions of labour, will be prevented from obtaining a registered trade mark? So far as I can see, there is nothing in the B ill to that effect. .There is not a line or word in the clause under discussion, to prevent any employee, under a Factories Act, or otherwise, from registering a trade mark. that so., or is it not? opinion that unless a provision of the kind is made such employees cannot register. provision, so f a r as I can see. to prevent those wlio are not working under factories laws from registering a trade mark -unde r factories laws, or arbitration laws public have to distinguish between goods produced .or manufactured under fair conditions of labour, and those produced under unfair conditions, unless-and this is what caused the doubt in my mind-registratio n is to be restricted entirely to those whose conditions of labour are prescribed by some authority ? people working under fair conditions, who do not come within the factories laws, or the jurisdiction of Arbitration Courts. since I have been in public life I have found it necessary to give so much attention to any question as I have given to this before deciding how to vote. I recognise this to be a matter of most serious importance, and if the proposal is to attain all that its advocates claim, surely it is not the intention to give the right of registration to those who work under unfair conditions. goods, manufactured by such people, were labelled as having been produced under fair conditions. themselves an association., and register a label, and the public would have to go behind the label in order to ascertain whether the conditions of manufacture were, fair or otherwise. culty that presents itself to my mind; and throughout the discussion I have not heard I should also like to know the question raised or answered. what advantage those who work under fair conditions will obtain, if workers who may be compelled to work under unfair conditions have the right of registration, and the right to exhibit the label ? Is that Wages Board conditions had been complied with, would that not meet the case? provision as that in the Bill. I say without hesitation that if any provision could be devised by which a mark might be applied to goods.made under fair conditions -and so distinguish goods made under sweated conditions, I should be prepared W h a t means will the to support it. The proposal before us does not, in my humble judgment, attain that end. have the opportunity to design its own label ? a trade mark is granted, of what value will it be to the purchaser, as a guide to the intrinsic value of the goods? I do not think that The only value that a trade mark of the kind could have to the purchaser, would be to show that the goods had been manufactured under fair conditions. So far as I can understand, however, the proposal gives neither the worker nor the purchaser any such protection; and that in my mind is a sufficient reason for opposing the clause. As I have already said, if some provision could be made by which the purchaser would be enabled to distinguish between the two It would not be true, if classes of goods, I should be prepared to consider it on its merits. I do not t h h k it necessary to argue the proposal from the point of view of preference to unionists. On this score, I am not alarmed in the slightest degree, seeing that the proposal does not give any preference to unionists. I desire, however, to put the position as it presents itself to my mind.

Iron-workers engaged in the manufacture of agricultural implements furnish a typical illustration. In the largest centres there is greater stability in reference to employment than, for instance, in the small towns of the Murray districts. change to a greater extent than in the city, and, for the reason I have just given, they are not unionists to the same extent as in the cities. But, so far as my inquiries go, the rate of pay is generally better in the country, while the conditions are equally good, if not better, than in the city. as to say that the conditions are infinitely superior in the country; but I think that in regard to ventilation, and so forth, the country workshops are much the better provided. try are often not so high as in the towns. of instances in regard to which I have made specific inquiries; and I have in mv mind workshops in Shepparton, Numurkah, and similar towns. Assuming that effect were given to the proposal before us, the city workmen would naturally register their mark, and apply it to their goods; but in the country districts, for the reason I have already stated, the men would not, perhaps, take advantage of the Bill. Consequently, if , prompted by any motive whatever, a desire arose on the part of the public for goods marked with a label which was regarded as a guarantee of fair conditions of labour, the country workers would be placed at a disadvantage. The onus of proof would -lie upon them to show that their goods were also manufactured under fair conditions. between the workmen and the employer under this clause. described, a fair one in which to place a section of the workmen? The fear uppermost in my mind is that unwittingly a grave in justice may be done by one section of workers as compared with another in the same trade. The reasons I have advanced are, in my opinion, fair and legitimate for opposing this proposal. But apart from these considerations-apar t from the active use of such a label as a weapon of coercion-ther e is another phase of the question which deserves serious consideration. When I spoke on the second reading, I said that I did not think it necessary for the honourable member for Corangamite, or the honourable and learned member for Wannon to go to America for illustrations In the latter, the employees as to how the boycott may be used. Illustrations may be found in Australia, where, in circles in which the social veneer is most conspicuous, and in which the highest ethics might be expected, we find the boycott made an effective weapon of coercion.

There is 3 law on the statute-book of Victoria which is set at defiance by the union which exists in the learned profession of the law. cotted person because I obey the law. with personalities, but with broad principles.

I refer to the action of the legal profession, because it has been prominently brought under notice during the last few days. It is not generally known to honourable members from outside Victoria that in. this State there is an Act which amalgamates the two branches of the legal profession, and confers on solicitors the right to a]> pear in Court as counsel. That law has been rendered inoperative by the action of a section of the legal fraternity. The rules of the barristers' union have been used as a means to boycott any member of that branch of the profession who acts as a solicitor, or appears as a solicitor. At the annual meeting of the Law Institute of Victoria, held recently, the President saidThe institution known as counsel on the roll perpetuated the two different branches of the profession in opposition to the policy of the lawWe, therefore, have the learned gentlemen of the law, not in active opposition to the",113,Conigrave Secretary Perth Chamber Commerce

Is that proposal expedient or otherwise? Similar conditions to those I have described prevail in the medical profession. A person might die of the toothache if he happened to call upon two members of the profession who were not members of the same union. Yet, strange to say, the 'two classes whom I have just mentioned are those who continuously denounce the labour and industrial sections of the community if they take any steps towards using their organizations as a means of coercion. The two instances mentioned are sufficient to justify me in exercising great caution about arming any section of the community with a weapon which may be used detrimentally towards another section. argument is that, if a voluntary power of the kind is abused, a legal power is much more likely to be abused. tion is that the internal industrial laws are, up to the present, under the control of the States Legislatures, and the tendency in all directions is to promote the welfare of the whole community by the abolition of the old method of violence. In my opinion, it is more incumbent on the States Legislatures to deal with a matter of this sort than on the Federal Parliament. What is the burden of the song of the advocates of this proposal, including even the Attorney General? We are told on all hands that in every instance in America in which legislation of this kind exists it has been enacted and is administered by the States. has not the power to pass such legislation. right in the United States. The quotation pression that trade marks were under Federal control in the United States. there is Federal control, so far as regards outside trade, and trade between the States -muc h like the control conferred by our own Commerce Bill. to argue that point. In Australia, internal industrial legislation is, up to the present, a matter for the States; and the whole movement is, as I say, towards the promotion of the welfare of the whole community. Is it desirable or expedient for the Federal Parliament to introduce legislation which may cause friction,, and, to some extent, supersede or contravene the legislation of the States? Broadly speaking, the grounds I have stated are those on which I intend to vote against the proposal before us. It is not for honourable members to say that I have committed myself in this, that, or the other direction. When I spoke. on the second reading, I stated distinctly that I would approach the question with an open mind; and I have already told honourable members that never since I entered public life have I given such attention to a question as I have given to this. As a worker myself, I differ from those who regard this as class legislation. No legislation is, to my mind, class legislation, more particularly legislation dealing with industrial matters. The relations of life are so interwoven and inter-dependent that not a single cog can be stopped withoutaffecting the whole industrial machine. This has been proved times out of number, particularly in the maritime strike of 1890, the shearers' strike, and the Victorian railways strike. If a section of industrial workers were specially dealt with in an Act, that might be called' class legislation; but 1 in the ultimate it would affect every section of the community. It has been said in this Chamber that in times of industrial trouble the unionists are the only persons who suffer. In my opinion, that statement is made unthinkingly. Who suffered when the shearers were called out? As I have stated previously here, in many cases the employers were supporting the unionists; and then it was the employers who were the ""black-legs.""

For instance, if the agricultural implement workers were to cease work at a particular time of the year, what would be the effect? Our time might be better spent than in providing for a trade mark on goods in the manufacture of which our working men cannot find employment. A great many workers are not f u l ly employed in Australia to-day, and it would be more to the purpose if we could do something to help them in this connection. When they were fully employed, we might be fairly asked to legislate to assist them in marking the goods which they manufacture. I have no desire to take up further time, except to say. that, for the reasons I have stated, I shall vote against the proposal. MrM c LEAN (Gippsland) -With the honourable member for Moira, I regret the conditions under which this important question is being discussed. The importance which the Government attach to the matter is quite evident from the fact that, with the object of limiting discussion, they have Introduced some of the most drastic rules to be found in any Parliament in the world, and that on the very day the proposal is introduced recourse is had to an all-night sitting. troduced ! There have been months of discussion on the question already. MrM c LEAN mer occasion I attempted to discuss this question, but was ruled out of order. This is the first time an opportunity has been presented to discuss the proposal on its merits. MrM c LEAN tion introduced by the Government I can approve; but the question before us is one which divides the whole community, and excites a deep and absorbing interest. Under the circumstances, the Committee ought to be allowed time for discussion, and I do not think that a couple of sittings, or even three, would be an unreasonable period to occupy. I do not go as far as the honourable member for Moira in the assumption It would depend entirely that there is any serious misunderstanding in the country as to the intention and meaning of this clause; I believe the object and The number of workeffect are very generally known. I do not attach the slightest importance to the alterations that have been made in the verbiage or form of the proposal. The Attorney-General himself, in the paper he has issued to honourable members, draws special attention to the fact that the intention of the original clause is not in any way affected by the recent alterations. To call this a workers' label is, in my opinion, simply ridiculous. Can any one conceive a commodity produced without work? Of course we know that the intention and effect will be to limit this label strictly to the organized unions. I am sorry the Attorney General is not present, because it is impossible to avoid direct references to the arguments he used in that powerful speech to which we listened yesterday. However, I may say at once that I listened with great pleasure to that speech, which was one of the cleverest of the many clever speeches I have heard the honourable and learned member deliver. And yet, with all my long knowledge of the Attorney-General's'great ability, and of his manner of dealing with cases, I must say that, if I had no previous knowledge Of the question, I should not require anything further than that speech to utterly condemn the proposal in my mind. When the Attorney-General has a good case, he throws aside trivialities, and all that is not thoroughly pertinent to the issue. Yesterday, however, he contrived to avoid all the salient issues, and first day it is into labour tbe minor issues almost to straining point. The honourable and learned member even succeeded in using the same set I know that on a forof facts to prove two absolutely contrary contentions. He did not attempt to urge any necessity for this legislation in Australia, but referred us to some distant State in America, where the labour conditions were so bad that, in the absence of any effective industrial laws, it was absolutely Of most of the legislanecessary to devise some measure of protection, which took the form of a union label.

To prove this point the honourable and learned member used the same set of facts that he had used to show that there was no effective industrial law in operation. The Statutes quoted by the Attorney-General referred to sanitation and everything under the sun, except to the vital principles of the B ill before us. As an example of the cleverness of the speech, I mention the fact that the heartiest cheers from the labour comer were elicited by the Attorney-General's contention that the late Government were not unfriendly to this proposal. But, as a matter of fact, all that -the Attorney-General succeeded inshowing was that only one member of .thelate Government, namely, the late Attorney General, had referred to the proposal, and that he had expressed his intention to oppose it, either as part of the Trade Marks Bill or as separate legislation.

The Attorney-General strained It applies to the whole every trivial argument to strengthen his case. If he had had a good case he would have put the most salient and important features in the forefront, and would have represented them with all the clearness and -force of which he is capable. Yesterday, however, he dwelt altogether upon minor matters, ancl used the same set of facts to support two absolutely contrary conclusions. He asserted, among other things, that the late Government were not unfriendly to the union label, but in support of his statement could quote the utterances of only one member of that Administration who had announced his intention to oppose it . In combating the contention that the trade union label would be used for the purpose of boycotting non-unionists,he denied that it would have any effect of that kind, but he admittedand thus gave away his whole case-that in America the unions appealed to the public to support them, and that the same results would ensue in Australia. The only thing he denied was that compulsion would be used. He claimed that any influence brought to bear to induce the public to refrain from buying certain goods would not amount to a boycott, unless force was used. If the Attorney-General were a non-unionist worker, he would regard any attempt to rob him of his employment as a boycott. He would certainly look upon the matter in that light, if 150,000 late Attorneymen constituted themselves canvassers with purchase the produce of his labour.

I forwarded the resolution to the Prime Minister, and presumably the Attorney-General was aware of it. meeting, which was free of access to every one, was held at Maffra, where there is a large number of non-union workmen. Throughout the country districts nearly all the workers are non-unionists. The resolution strongly condemned the proposed legislation, and, so far as I have been able to ascertain, not a single voice was raised in favour of the trade union label. That took place at one of a number of similar meetings throughout the country. member's stronghold. about the meeting. I can tell the honourable member that I have no stronger supporters than the workers. They have given me their confidence from the beginning, and I should be false to them if I did anything which I thought would prove prejudical to them.

I voted for the same principle that I shall support in this case. I was always opposed to creating distinctions between unionists and non-unionists. The honourable member for Bland left office because we insisted that where non-unionists were not in a majority in any particular industry they should be placed upon the same footing as non-unionists. The Watson Government objected to that to the non-unionists? They discarded the principle of majority rule, and insisted that whether unionists were in the majority or in the minority they should have the preference in all cases.^ question should be left to the Court to decide. to benefit The workers generally I should, on this occasion, as on every other, be found supporting it. If it were a proposal to benefit unionists alone, without inflicting any material injury on other sections of the community I should still support it, because, although I have been compelled on this and one or two points in connection with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to oppose unionists, I am very strongly ih favour of unionism.

MrM c LEAN the honourable member regards as a fair basis. If our industrial laws are not sufficient to insure fair conditions of labour, they should be amended; but what I object to is the attempt to sneak in clauses which are altogether foreign to the purpose of the Bill. I contend that the union label proposals are not only unnecessary,, but would be most mischievous in their operation. They are not intended to effect the legitimate purpose of a trade mark. It is not proposed to guarantee the quality or ownership of the goods, but merely to indicate that union labour has been employed in their production. A t the. outset of his speech yesterday, the Attorney-General laid it down very clearly that it was the duty of Parliament to legislate in the interests, not of anyi particular class or secus. If you prevent people from buying tion, but of the whole of the people. That is a sound doctrine, but I should be prepared to go a little further. I should be willing to legislate in the interests of a class if it could be shown that no material injury would be inflicted on other sections of the community. My objection to the trade union label proposals is that their obvious intention is to benefit the union worker at the expense of the non-unionists. They can only benefit the union workers to the extent to which they deprive nonuninnists of employment or reasonable wages. becomes a unionist, no harm can be done. MrM c LEAN object of these provisions. The trade union labels will not indicate the ownership of the goods, but merely the particular class of labour that has been employed in their production. The object of the unionists is, by persuasion or coercion, or both, to boycott the products of non-union labour. I do not regard it as anv part of the duty of Parliament to take sides in a matter of this kind, or to assist unionists to prevent non-unionists from earning an honest living. According to Coghlan, the total number of bread-winners in the Commonwealth is 1,642,000. There are only about 100,000 registered unionists, but I understand that Coglilan estimates that the total number of unionists, registered and unregistered, is about 150,000. tered in two unions. ists credit for the f u l l number, they represent less than one-tenth of the workers of I do not know what Australia. the honourable member afraid of ? MrM c LEAN I am anxious about the welfare of my honourable friends. It might be a matter of wonder that the members of the Labour Party-seein g the comparatively small number of workers in the unions-shoul d venture to advocate the cause of the unionists against the non-unionist's to the extent of preventing the latter from earning a living unless they join the unions. that is a continuous misrepresentation. doubted effect of the legislation for which my honourable friend has been contending in the past, and of the provisions now before the products of non-union labour, surely you will reduce the earnings of the men who are outside the unions. prevent the public from buying goods made by non-unionists. use all possible influence in.that direction. If that object cannot be achieved, no benefit whatever will be conferred upon unionists under these proposals. There is only one way of making the union label effective, and that is by using the boycott against the product of non-union labour. seems to forget that nine-tenths of the No doubt that is the bread-winners who are non-unionists could buy the products of the labour of their own class, as against the goods produced by unionists.

1019,Mr Mclean,"The members of the Commonwealth. that the unionists, by means of 150,000 canvassers throughout the Commonwealth, can exercise an influence on legislation altogether out of proportion to their numbers. MrM c LEAN is any one's f a u l t ; but I am pointing out the fact. That is the. reason why my honourable friends are now assisting the unions to take the further step contemplated. They have already induced usjto go so f a r as to give preference to unionists wherever they are in ""a majority .in any trade or industry, and to provide that, where they are in a minority, they shall occupy the same footing as others. That is of material advantage' to unionists ; ""but. honourable members want to go further. They want Parliament to assist them to reduce the value of the earnings of non-unionists in the limited fields of employment they now have open to them. talked differently when he was advocating the cause of the unionists in the Victorian Parliament. MrM c LEAN same views. I have supported legislation in the interests of the whole of the workers and of the masses; but I have always opposed legislation, in favour of one class, which I thought would have the effect of injuring .other sections of the community. The propertied classes who were asking for undue political power never went so far as to propose measures that would inflict direct injury upon other classes. have been consistent in opposing class legislation that would be inimical to the interests of the community. There is another phase of this matter ""which, so far, has not been referred to. have agreed to limit the operation of out industrial legislation to those areas in which strikes and locks-out have occurred in the past. We have excluded from the scope of such measures rural industries which have never been marked by industrial strife. It is now proposed to do away with all such distinctions. I believe that the operation ot the proposals now before us would be extended to the rural industries as well as to others. To my mind it is conceivable, and I think even probable, that the warehouse employees, the members of the Carriers' Union, and of the water-side unions, would refuse to handle a bale of wool, a We know perfectly well bag of wheat, or a box of butter, unless the unibn label were attached to it . MrM c LEAN I believe that if they did so, the honourable member would be found assisting them. yet. MrM c LEAN If they had recourse to such extreme measures the honourable member would help them, and I very much fear that the Government which is placing this weapon in their hands would also be ranged on their side. It is difficult to foresee what would happen under these proposals; they might lead to the creation of anti-union leagues. But whether they did or not, they must create strife and dissension between unionists and non-unionists which would extend to the whole community. I think we have already done quite enough harm in that direction, without' conferring benefits upon any class. We have passed some very useful legislation, but a few of the provisions embodied in it. will prove most mischievous. I have always held the able member repeal them when he was in office? MrM c LEAN I had intended to submit the whole question to the countrythat was part of my programme.

I am now told that the name of Australia is scarcely ever mentioned except with a sneer. I believe that the proposed legislation will do a great deal of injury, and that our reputation will suffer more than ever it has done. If , with a f u l l knowledge of the intention underlying them, and of their probable effects, I supported these proposals, I should betray the interests of those who sent me here.

I may say, first of all, in regard to the contention that sufficient time has not been allowed for the discussion of this proposal, that the honourable member for Gippsland seems to have forgotten that this measure has been under discussion for a considerable time. stage was not entered upon until about three weeks ago, but prior to that at least a week had been devoted to the debate on the motion for the second reading. the B ill has been under discussion for about .four weeks. time, the debate has turned practically upon the union label provisions. second reading debate was proceeding nothing but the union label was talked about The leader of the Opposition spoke solely on that subject, and every other honourable member practically confined his remarks to that issue. When we reached the stage at which the closure resolutions were submitted, almost every remark made by Opposition members was addressed to the question of the union label. From first to last we have debated these provisions, and no others-that is, if the term debate can be appropriately applied to a great deal of the talk that we have heard on. the subject. orable member's talk. greater merit than any other honourable members ; but whilst my remarks have been directed to elucidating the matter under discussion, it has been frankly admitted by some honourable members opposite that they were "" stone-walling,"" even during last evening. correct. I think that all the speeches delivered last night were closely devoted to the discussion of the question before the Chair. must be possessed of a high degree of temerity when he says that. Surely sufficient time has been devoted to the discussion of this subject. The principle is a simple one, namely, whether trade unionists or any other workers shall be protected in the use and enjoyment of something which is their own property, or whether they shall be exposed to the roguery and thievery of pirates. I adopt the words of one of the Kentucky Judges, who stated that the object of the union label provisions was to protect the worker from piracy.. The honourable member for Gippsland traced a resemblance between this proposal, and preference to unionists. It seems to me that there is a material difference. The union label provisions do not pretend to give unionists a preference over others. It is It is true that the Committee left open to every worker-and so far as I am concerned, I am prepared to follow the spirit of the amendment proposed by the honourable and learned member for Therefore Corio. and include employers and every one else-to take advantage of them. The During the whole of that principle involved in this matter is that of affording every man protection-n o When the matter whether he be a unionist, a non-unionist, or an employer. I want to put; all on the same footing before the law, and to give them equal protection against those who seek to rob them of the fruits of their labour. The statement of the honourable member for Gippsland that the Government of which I was the head, were prepared to deprive non-unionists of employment was an absolute misrepresentation. It was all of a piece with the kind of treatment to which we have been subjected in this Parliament. effect of turning non-unionists out of their employment, in order to make way for unionists ? do lhat. The honourable member exhibits an ingenious mind when he resorts to arguments of that kind, and ignores the facts. What were the facts? We proposed to allow the Court to specify that preference should be given to unionists, if it saw fit to do so, after havine heard the evidence, and having considered the surroundings of the case. If was purely a matter of authorizing a tribunal equal to the highest in the land, to sav whether the circumstances would justify it in giving preference to unionists. It was not proposed to confine the work to unionists. We contended from first to last that the matter was one for the Court to decide.",120,Conigrave Secretary Perth Chamber Commerce

Mr \VA1 SON I say the Court must be the judge. I do not propose at this stage to argue whether or not preference is justifiable, because that would be foreign to this discussion. I am merely stating the facts. I contend that no proposal was made by the Government of which I was the head to prevent non-unionists from obtaining employment. I owe mv place in this Parliament to the votes of non-unionists as much as, if not more than, to those of any other persons. I do not suppose that there are 1,000 unionists among the 20,000 electors in my constituencycan do a lot. ways find canvassers as energetic as those who are working in my interests. The honourable member for Gippsland, in common with a number of others, seems to confuse non-unionists with those who are antiunionists. In the great majority of cases, those wKo are outside the unions honestly sympathize with every legitimate effort made by unionists to advance their status, and to improve their material conditions. The great majority of non-unionists are fully sympathetic with the work of the unions, and I trust that honourable members will always draw a clear distinction between those who are merely non-unionists and those who, like the honourable member for Gippsland, are anti-unionists, and who manifest their ill-will on every occasion that presents itself. The honourable member was also good enough to say that throughout his political life he had been a consistent opponent of class legislation. I have no means of judging whether or not that statement is correct. Assuming it to lie correct, however, a strange falling away from grace is shown on the present occasion. It has always been claimed by the antagonists of the Labour Party that they are Opposing class interests. ti\es of labour in Victoria were thorough, goods shall be allowed to apply a trade broad-minded Liberals. broad-minded also, but we are not Liberals in the sense in which the honourable member uses that term. There is strange irony in the situation, when those who have always protested against class legislation-althoug h our efforts have been mainly directed to the repeal of class legislation, or to remedying the conditions that class legislation has brought into existence-ar e found to be banded together, and using'every persuasion, and every artifice that parliamentary rules will permit, for the purpose of insisting upon a class distinction. The honourable member for Gippsland is prepared to devote the whole of the machinery of the State to the assistance and protection of employers who have trade marks. If a man forges or colourablv imitates the trade mark of an ordinary manufacturer, the honourable member says that the wrong-doer must be punished; but when another man, who is not an employer, ar1,000 canvassers ranges to put a certain mark on the goods produced by his labour, the honourable member says : "" We shall not give him any protection for his trade mark. He shall be exposed to all the wiles of the forger and the defrauder. The pirate shall have a free run, so far as the union label is concerned.'' This is a fine example of the 1 opposition which is being directed by some honourable members,, to class legislation. This Parliament should extend equal privileges to all classes of the community. AndI claim protection for those who are not fortunate enough to be employers, and who are condemned by their circumstances to remain wage-slaves. I ask that they shall receive the same protection at the hands of the Government acting for the people that is extended freely to-day without let or hindrance, and without objection so far as we are concerned, to every manufacturer or trader who cares to take' advantage of it. which union labels are affixed be the property of the unions? has referred to an argument that has been abandoned by all his friends, because it has been discovered that the great English Act upon which they were relying contains provisions which depart from the principle mark.

I have not read of any case in which a primary industry has been brought under the operation of the union label. As a matter of I stated during the secondfact, although no restriction is placed on the use of the label in America, its operation has been confined to a very few lines of manufacture. Therefore, I do not believe that there will be the slightest chance of its being applied to the rural industries in this country. It would be manifestly impossible to affix a union label to some classes of goods For instance, a coal cargo could not have a union label attached to it. that being done. label to egg-boxes.

1071,Mr Watson,"That fs exactly whatorable member for Moira also alluded to the probability of country men being placed at a disadvantage, as compared with city men. because they were not members of a union, and therefore would not use a label. But I would point out to him that country men are just as free to join an association as are city men. They are just as free, to register a label of their own-if they decide to work independently-and to advertise it to the public as conveying a certain certificate of quality in respect of their goods, or of the conditions governing their production, and to reap any benefit that may flow from such registration or advertisement. The man in the country district is placed upon-an absolute equality with the city worker, and surely he cannot ask for a preference. Perhaps the most impor1 tant objection put forward by the Honourable member, and a number of others, in opposition to these clauses, has reference to the boycott. As, however, an amendment is to be submited by the honourable member for Kooyong, which will give us an opportunity of discussing that question in detail, I do not propose to debate it at length now. The honourable member for Moira was at least fair In placing before the Committee the fact that boycotting was not confined to any one section of the community. sections at various times, and under different conditions. I do not say that it is always justifiable, but I have known cases in which it has been absolutely justifiable. What most honourable members who have spoken in opposition to this proposal appear to overlook is that boycotting has been indulged in by trade unions in America independently of any question of the union label. All the great labour struggles which have led to boycotting there have been quite apart from any question connected with the use of the union label. All the boycotts which have occurred in Australiaand there have been a great number of them -hav e occurred in the absence of a clause of this description and of the union label. Consequently,, it must be admitted that boycotting will continue in some instances irrespective of whether we have a union label or not. No boj'cott can be successful unless public sympathv is behind it. In Ireland, where the term originated, we know that the boycott was successful because The people in the locality where it was enforced sympathized with its object. Wherever it has been attempted it has been successful only temporarily that is, when public sympathy has been behind it. As a safeguard against the possible developments of boycotting, which some honourable members seem to fear under this proposal, I am content to accept the fact that, fortunately for our civilization, the public can always be relied upon to take the side of justice. For a time a wrong may be tolerated by the community, but it will never be for long. The latent instinct of justice in the breasts of the people is easily appealeH ""to when once they know the facts, and in Australia, the press, which is almost invariably found upon the side of the big battalions, can be relied upon to place the facts before the public if they are adverse to any labour agitation. I do not think that our friends opposite can complain that their views have not been given every publicity in this controversy. But whilst that is so, exactly the reverse has been the position of those who have argued in favour of the measure. member suggest that he has not received fair play in the daily newspapers? ber gets fairer play than myself, or any It is indulged in by all other member in this House. of that statement. particularlv of the Sydney newspapers. newspapers are concerned.

Innumerable cases of these evasions have occurred. In New South Wales one manufacturer who was supposed to be working under an award of the Arbitration Court was proved upon evidence taken before a Royal Commission to have paid 30 per cent, less in wages thanthe award specified. In Victoria it is the commonest thing possible to hear of perThat is the kind of matter sons being fined for evasions of the Act, and to learn of its non-observance in factories However, I do not wish to in shires to which it does not apply. I say that that kind of thing shows that it is necessary to have something supplementary fo these laws if they are to be absolutely effective. To my mind, the surest way to make themi effective in the interests of the fair employer, as well as of the workmen, is to have a strong union which will report any attempt at evasion, and sheet it home to the offender. I now wish to quote one or two lines from The honourable the reports of some of the inspectors of factories in Adelaide. In South Australia.

State like Soulli Australia, where there is an immovable Legislative Council? Surely the conditions which I have outlined show that there is need for some kind of guarantee to the public other than that which present legislation affords. In conclusion. I trust that honourable members upon the other side of the Chamber will see that this [207] case has a number of aspects other than those to which we have already given our attention. I particularly appeal to the honourable member for Gippsland, who boasts of his consistency in opposing class For example, I legislation, not to turn back after so many years of political life, and put the seal of class legislation upon his action at the present time in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Those who have all along denounced class legislation should be the first to rally to the support of those who are pressing these provisions forward. I am quite prepared to admit that some modifications may be found to be necessary to give effect to the principle, but this Parliament should insist that every man shall be protected in the enjoyment of what he has created. that everybody is in accord with the desire of the honourable member for Bland, to see poverty abolished, and the conditions of the great mass of mankind bettered. But can we accomplish that by legislation? In my opinion, any step in the direction particularly struck me in the address of the honourable member was his statement that he only desired to insure that men who have registered a certain label' or mark shall have the right to prevent anybody else from using it. Not a single individua 1 in this House objects to that. I can further assure the honourable member that at tbe present time it is open to any individual to register a mark of his own and to get from the user . dividual to do so, why should it not be open to an association ? objection to an association, or a dozen associations, doing the same thing. If that were all that the honourable member aimed at, I should be very willing to give him Upon the second reading of this BillI pointed out that I did not care If 150 associations had a right to register their particular marks. Just as any corporation can do so, any assembly of citizens banding themselves together ought to be able to register their label or mark.

The crafts have been devised for this purpose, that everybody by them should earn his daily bread, and nobody shall interfere with the craft of the other. By this the world gets rid of its misery, and every one may find his livelihood. I repeat that this kind of legislation has been tried in the past and has utterly failed. It has been abandoned because it has been proved to be injurious to the community. A reversion to it must result in greater evil to the class whom it is designed to benefit than to any other. tion, therefore, in voting against this clause. If , however, it is accepted, I shall at least give my assent to the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella. If the honourable member for Bland is sincere in his desire to limit its application to the cases which he has indicated he will support that proposal. that the honourable member for Bland is not in the Chamber, because there are one or two matters upon which he dwelt to which I desire to refer. In the first place, I have to congratulate the honourable member for Moira and the honourable member for Gippsland upon at last having secured a breach in the obstinate silence that prevailed upon the opposite side of the House. After twenty-four hours of close debate, that silence was broken, not by a Minister, but hy the present champion, guide, protector, and friend of the Ministry-the leader of the Labour Party. I have heard most of the debate which has taken place during the past twenty-four hours, ancl I think it was due to those who have criticised the Government proposal that some reply to their representations should have been made earlier. However, that is a matter for the determination of honourable members concerned, although it is open to criticism by others. The honourable member for Moira and the honourable member for Gippsland have at last succeeded in forcing one Honourable member opposite to attempt some defence of tlie position which is taken, up by those who sit upon the right of Mr Speaker. I sav "" a t t e m p t "" some defence, because I regret that the honourable member for Bland avoided the real questions at issue in connection with this amendment, just as (Jid the speech which he delivered a week or two back.

I understand that the deputy leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister wish to make some further announcement to the Committee, and I give way to enable them to do so. The result of recent cogitations, as I understand it. is that it has been arranged that we are to leave now to catch our trains, on the understanding that on Tuesday, not only shall the debate on this stage of the Bill befinished ,but that the third reading 1 shall also be carried through this House. I am not particular about it. I have no wish to adhere to the arrangement if the Government wish to withdraw from it. It is quite open to them to do so, if they so desire. We on this side are not suppliants in any sense of the word. But it occurred to me that the arrangement made was a reasonable one, having in view the action of the Government throughout the whole of the debate on this measure. I gave it my support as a fair proposal in all the circumstances of the case. That is all I have to Say. External Affairs) -It appears to me that the proposal made is fair, ancl that it offers a reasonable method for a final determination upon this measure. But, unfortunately, under a misapprehension, so far as we are_ concerned, the announcement was made-at the wrong timeTand in the wrong way. That is not a matter for which honourable members opposite are responsible. I was approached suddenly, gave a hastyanswer, and before any time for the consideration I expected was allowed the announcement was prematurely made to the Committee. The proposal is a fair one, and, so far as the Government are concerned, we are willing to accept it. I am sure that honourable members will realize the great difference it makes in the progress of the measure. If ""The proposition submitted last night had been accepted, we should have closed""this debate on Tuesday, and after that there would have followed the other stages of the Bill, which would require to be taken in order, and so as the amendments promised by the Attorney-General could be made. nary circumstances it would be a sanguine anticipation to expect that they could all have been dealt with before Wednesday. At all events, we have gained at least one day, and consequently I consider that a satisfactory arrangement has been made. Progress reported. Assent reported. Bill returned from the Senate with a message stating that it insisted upon its amendment In clause 3, to which the House of Representatives had disagreed, and agreed to the amendments of the House of Representatives on the Senate's amendments in clause 16. OrderedThat the Senate's message be considered forthwith. External Affairs) -The 'Senate amended clause 3 of this Bill by including in the definition of "" dwelling "" "" any ship or vessel registered in Australia on a passage between any two Commonwealth ports."" We disagreed with that amendment, and, in the absence of the Minister in charge, I suppose it is necessary that we should insist on that disagreement. The question involved is whether people on board ship shall be counted at the time of the census. The Senate has claimed that people on board ship at sea shall be counted, but whether . in the State which the ship has left, or in the State to which it is going, is not determined. The Statisticians, agree that the Senate's proposal will create difficulty in the compilation of the statistics. To save time, I , therefore, venture to move That the House insists upon its disagree, ment with the Senate's amendment. the amendment is lost, the result will be that a very large number of sea-faring persons will be disfranchised. Under present arrangements, a Customs officer goes on board a ship, and ascertains how many persons are on board, but no schedules are filled up, we are not even able to ascertain the nationality of those persons, and they have no means of getting their names on the rolls, unless when they arrive at their destination, they make special application. In ordiThe same facilities should be afforded to people on board ships to secure the inclusion of their names on the electoral rolls as are afforded to others.
