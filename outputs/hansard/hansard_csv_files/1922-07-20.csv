In view of the fact that thc Department has notified ineii concerned that if they find the premiums to be paid are more than 6 per cent, of their salary they will be permitted to come under Public Service Regulation 184, will the Minister suspend action pending the decision of Parliament in regard to the Public Service Government intend to introduce this session, and, if it becomes law, will be compulsory upon all officers?

The responsibility for this blundering lies on agreement. the sheuldcrs of the Government, and partly on thc shoulders of the Country party; we, on this side, accept no responsibility whatever. This is only one of the many illustrations of the incapacity and incompetence of the one-man Government with which Australia is burdened at the present time.

The. honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) knows perfectly well, as I venture to say most of the memhers on the Government side know, that the agreement is ""too hot"" -to o flagrantly unfair; and the honourable member, like many others, is now endeavouring to find some way out of the -impasse into which they have heen led hy the 'Government. .There are certain people outside interested in this particular activity, and interested only be made several qualifications. cause it means dividends; and it is well that the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), who has investigated the matter thoroughly, should have launched his amendment, which has caused the Government and their supporters more worry and anxiety than any .proposal during the last four or five years.

The question of an independent chairman was, apparently, by some means or other, intentionally or otherwise, overlooked. It was generally accepted by the Committee, so f a r as I can learn, that there was to be an independent chairman, hut because of something of which I have no knowledge, the matter was dropped, and we have an agreement in which we find no mention of an independent chairman. M ay I say in passing that to get an independent chairman from the officers of the different Nationalist Leagues outside is an i m possibility. independent chairman is from the Labour party. the Nationalist party, whether it be to the National Club or the different council* and executives of the parjy, we find a l l linked up in the ramifications of finance andcommerce throughout the country.

The amendment readsThat we desire to advise His Excellency that the agreement mentioned in clause 12 of the contract made between Amalgamated Wireless Limited and the Commonwealth should, before acceptance by the Commonwealth representatives on the Board of Directors, be agreed to by this' House.

Whilst the Government have been lax and stupid, w i l f u l ly stupid, I believe, in . allowing the Marconi Company and other companies to dip their hands into the Commonwealth Treasury, there is nothing to prevent the Government instructing their representatives as to what procedure shall be followed in regard to an extension of the period mentioned in that olause.

61,Orahle Member F O R Fawkner ( Mr Max,"by so doing they might jeopardize the Go-, vernment sibility for their own mental gymnastics, but to my mind if a thing is bad it is bad. As for this amendment being a party issue, there is no doubt as to where members of the Labour party have stood right from the inception of the project. We knew that it was just another of those boodling schemes which the Government have been perpetrating ever since 1916. Despite what may be said by the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Bobert Best) and the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), the amendment affords a means of escape from the present unsatisfactory position. I am not at all satisfied with the Commonwealth representatives on the directorate-Si r William Stinson, and MrM . Allard. extraordinary fact that in some instances Mr G. M . Allard is mentioned and in other instances MrM . All a r d ; obviously both names apply to the same man. Sir William Vicars is, firstly, a business man,.and, secondly, a strong adherent of the National party. He is one of the first directors of the National Club in Sydney, the meeting place for the Nationalists and anti-Labourites in that city, and I suppose that ib is because of the money ' he put the club and into the party funds that he wealth representative on the Wireless directorate. cial interests, not only in woollens, but also in banking, insurance, and many other large concerns, aud when we remember that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is linked up with the Sydney Ferries, and the Sydney Ferries are linked up with the ABO Bank, and so on right down the list, we see that these three directors have identical financial interests. In one directorate we may see the names of SirW ill i a m . Vicars and Mr Mason Allard. On some other company Sir William Vicars and Mr Stinson are the directors, and right through the list these three men are linked up with almost every financial or commercial interest of this country. How can we expect such men to represent the Commonwealth ? They are representing the commercial and financial world, not Australia. Th|jy must accept tbe responexperience of no value? is, provided it is given for the country's good. But if it is given for the benefit of certain private financiers it is of no value to the' Commonwealth and should not be tolerated. Why have the Government made this extraordinary departure of putting private commercial men on the Wireless directorate, when, on * all other concerns of a like character the Commonwealth is represented by public servants only? What control has the'Commonwealth, over Sir William Vicars? What penalty can it impose on h i m orr Mr. Stinson or Mr Allard? from the Board.

In connection with the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, a company in which the Commonwealth is partnered with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, the Government have selected representatives upon whom they can visit punishment for any misbehaviour. They are men whose honour and jobs are at stake, and they would not lend themselves to manipulainto tion by any outside financial interests. One of those representatives is Sir Robert is chosen as a CommonGarran, a servant of the Oommonwealth, whose reputation and position are at He has very great finanstake.

All three are men who have a record of long public service and good reputations, and they have something tangible to lose if they do anything that is not honest and upright.

68,Sir Robert Best,"Si r Robert Gibsonappointment he waa. first time in which the people of Australia, have been robbed by the wireless people. This is not the first occasion on which lies have been told and Governments misled. Honourable members probably retain painf u l recollections of the manner in which the Commonwealth was bled in 1914 by this same gang, namely, the Marconi people and Amalgamated Wireless. Honourable members wil l recall that the Labour party investigated certain patents of Father Shaw. following examination and inquiries by Mr Balsillie. Then Amalgamated Wireless and Marconi, acting much on a par with the methods of American finance, lodged an injunction against the Commonwealth. Sof a r as one can 'learn, the Marconi and Amalgamated Wirelessi nterests had not the slightest tittle of evidence to prove that they were entitled to an injunction. The wheel of political fortune turned. Tho Labour party went out, and the Liberal party came in . While Marconi and Amalgamated Wireless could not "" p ut any jokes over "" the Labour Government, they certainly could and did "" put the joke over ' i the incom.ing Liberal Government. with the. coming into power of the latter Administration, Amalgamated Wireless and the Marconi people stepped forward to secure some spoils. So far a; one can ascertain from all known sources, they had no case; but that di d mot prevent them from entering into an agreement. I think it was Sir, Joseph Cook who conducted the negotiations on behalf of the Commonwealth, w it h the understanding that each, of the parties should beartheir own costs. But the point is that the Commonwealth paid £5,000 for' certain patents. A f t e r the injunction had been lodged the Government instructed a Mr Swinburne to investigate the patents. I refer now .to the Father Shaw patents; and he reported that there was absolutely no infringement whatever.. Probably at that time no greater expert in wireless matters could have been consulted than Mr Swinburne; and he reported that the Shaw patents were actually 33 per cent, more effective than the others which Were in dispute. same' Mr Fisk who has now "" so l d a pup "" to this .country, much, to the edifiA t the time of his cation ' of the Marconi interests, and of the shareholders in Amalgamated Wireless, and of men like MrH . R. Denison, T h is is not the who is another of .those gentlemen whose name honourable members wil l find in the shareholders' lists of ail the banks and insurance companies, ferries, and wharfs ber, in fact, of the inner financial gang. This same Mr Fisk, I repeat, . approached the Government in reference to bringing about a settlement. For the These were adopted, sum of £5,000 the Commonwealth Government were to be given certain patent rights. Two months r>rior to that settlement having heen offered and accepted, Amalgamated Wireless held certain rights so far as the Goldsmith patents were concerned, and when the agreement was entered into between the 'Government and the Marconi and Amalgamated Wireless peoplo it was understood, without its being set down on paper, that the Goldsmith patents were to be transferred, too. That just shows that the cunning of the Amalgamated Wireless and Marconii n terests was the same in those dayseight years ago-as to-day. The Government knew; the Solicitoir-.General's office Simultaneously knew; every one interested knew, that the company held the Goldsmith patents in, March, 1914. But, on 26th May of that year, when the agreement was entered into, no Goldsmith patents were held by the company. It had transferred them to a German firm; namely, the Telefunken. It was actually not until after war hod broken out thab the peopleof Australia knew that those patents had been sold by the Marconi and Amalgamated Wireless concerns to the Telefunken Company. And , so f ar as one can leam, no transfer took place; which makes one think that ths roguery of 1914 and the cunning trickery of 1922 have been carried out in exactly the same way by exactly the same people. If there is one thing that should have prevented the Goveniment in these latter days from entering into an agreement with the Marconi and Amalgamated Wireless crowd, it was that demonstration of their trickery in 1914. The company carried out whatwas quite a spieler's trick-althoug h one might meet with much cleverer spielers on a racecourse. That was to transfer all the patent rights they possessed.

The oniy difference in the whole of the two sets of circumstances is in respect of the time, the one incident having to do with the year 1 9 U , and the other, with 1922. Tho influences whioh were at work in 1914 are those which have been at work in this present year; and they have operated in each instance upon the same Goveniment. Later, the Amalgamated Wireless people again controlled those patents which tihey had sold in 1914. They bought them during the war. Sir Joseph Cook had been recommended to buy the patents, which were on the open market. The Commonwealth was then spending huge sums on wireless. Government of the day refused to buy, so Amalgamated Wireless came into their own, and again controlled those patents which the Government in 1914 had thought they were purchasing. The company misled the Government in 1914; they "" sold them a p u p . "" misled us to-day, and have sold us a bigger "" pup."" In 1914 the "" pup "" cost us £5,000.

Adelaide Steam-ship Company is not wholly Australian, nor is that of the Marconi English Company, which is on the list of shareholders.

82,Mr Blakeley,"It is.member a complete list of' shareholders ? the company an injustice, but I am doubtful whether it is a complete list of shareholders with which we have been -supplied. I have no desire to reflect in any way on Mr Shepherd, .but I consider it is highly dangerous to permit public servants, who may be called upon at any' time to make inquiries of this character, to have nnancial interests in a company of this kind. A public servant so situated might be called upon to obtain information which might make or break a company in whicb he had a personal interest. In this instance, Mr man of the company, whereas yesterday Shepherd, a shareholder in the company, was asked by the Parliamentary Committee to procure certain information, and practically the only source in London from which he could obtain it was the Marconi companies, which hold a very large number of shares in the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. Everything, of course, may be perfectly fair and above board so far as those companies are concerned.' Mr Shepherd, I believe, does his work honestly ancl well, but public servants are expected to protect the interests of the Commonwealth even at the sacrifice of their own, and should not have any financial association with a company of this kind. Any information that came from England would be of a character calculated to lead the Committee to believe that the agreement was a desirable one from the point of view of the Commonwealth. I am not satisfied with the agreement, nor is my party satisfied with it. venture to say that a majority of the supporters of the Government do not approve of it. and general demeanoxir, it seems to me that' this agreement is altogether too hot for the supporters of the Government to ' carry. Apparently it is not too hot for the Prime Minister. Nothing is too hot or too heavy for him. When he addressed himself to this question yesterday he spoke as he might have done at an Empire dinner in London. He referred in glowing terms to what might be achieved as the result of this enterprise. I am satisfied that even if a distance of 24,000 miles Allard was chairman of directors of instead of 12,000 miles separated us from the. Old Country, the tight honourable gentleman would he prepared to tell the House that neither atmospheric nor any other conditions would prevent us from having, hy means of wireless, direct communication with England for twenty hours out of every twenty-four hours. The Prime Minister came here, I have no doubt, primed with information supplied by Mr Pisk and a few others who are behind this scheme. I am convinced that. he did not consult his colleagues in regard to it . We havo had evidence of a complete lack of communication between the Prime Minister and his colleagues with respect to this question. On Priday last the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) made a certain .statement with regard to the chairthe Prime Minister made an absolutely different statement on the subject. He told us that he had already informed the company that, the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes as seventh director was not acceptable to the Government. The Treasurer, however, knew nothing of this on Priday last, and I do not believe that any other member of the Government was aware of it. If that he so, a most extraordinary state of affairs is revealed It is remarkable that one man-the Leader of the Government-shoul d be able to do these things 'and "" get away "" with them. During the last five 'years tlie Prime Minister has ""got away"" with a good many things in this country, but not one of them is a3 questionable as thc matter at present under review. It will probably be found that those who contributed to the honorarium which the right honourable gentleman received not long since-from a number of grateful residents of I Australia and other parts of the Britisli' Empire, are connected with such enterprises as the Amalgamated Wireless (AusJudging iby their interjections tralasia) Limited,' the Marconi Companies, tlie Colonial Sugar Befining Company, the Sydney Ferries Limited, variousgas and electric lighting companies, and' other financial and commercial institutions.

84,Mr Blakeley,"J [ may be doingBourke quoted from the Australian In vestment Digest, of October, 1921. The honourable member for Parramatta said his statement was wrong, and quoted from the Australian Joint Stock Company's Tear-Book, for 1913-14, which set out that at that time MrH . B. Allard was chairman of directors of Messrs. Beard, Watson and Company Limited. Australian Investment Digest which superseded the Australian, Joint Stock Company's Tear-Boole, shows that in October, 1921-seve n years laterMr G. Mason Allard was chairman of directors of the firm. It is set out in the Digest that the firm .of Messrs, Beard, Watson and Company Limited was registered in New South Wales, on the 3rd August, 1901to acquire businesses carried on at Sydney by W. H. Beard, J. H. Watson, and Jas. Kebblewhite under tlie style of Beard, Watson he and his two co-directors may protect and Co. The company was reconstructed in September, 1920, under tbe above name. That probably explains the change of chairman. It is set out further in this publication that the directors areQ. Mason Allard (chairman), James Kebblewhite (managing director), C. P. Bartholomew, E. H. Buchanan. I think that is sufficient evidence of the accuracy of the statement made by the honourable member for. Bourke that Mr We had to deal with highly technical subG. M . Allard, who has been appointed as a representative of the Commonwealth on the Board is associated in business with Mr C. P.

Beard, Watson and Company. I venture to say that the 10,860 shares held by Mr Bartholomew are owned, not by him, but by Messrs. Beard, Watson and Company. Mr Allard would in that 'case be part owner of those shares, and would not he likely as director of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited to give a vote calculated to decrease his own personal dividends. ber has no foundation for these statements. names of the directors of Messrs.

In fact, we could not very well have done without the services of those gentlemen, and we were extremely fortunate in having them to advise us in regard to the technical side of thc question. The agreement, as submitted to the Committee, did not find acceptance from any member of the Committee. We turned it into one that could almost be termed a new agreement. I was very much surprised at the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) when he said that the agreement meant that the Commonwealth was to undertake a huge experiment.

89,Mr Gibson (Corangamite) [3.36],"Ientering into this agreement. did not know what the Commonwealth was .to get. The Committee had one special object in view, and that was to see that the Commonwealth would not be called upon to carry out what we regarded as an experiment by entering into an agreement w it h the company for the maintenance of commercial wireless communication over 12,000 miles, whereas the longest stage operating was about 4,500. ""We said to Amalgamated Wireless Limited, "" Y o u claim that you have the goods; we say that you must deliver them."" Thereupon we drew up clause 12 in the following terms:The company shall, within six months after the date of this agreement or within such extended time' as the representatives of the Conunonwealth on the Board may approve, enter into an agreement providing for the erection and operation of the stations mentioned in paragraphs / and g of clause 5 of this agreement. Tlic agreement shall contain guarantees of such a nature and to such an amount as ore approved by the Commonwealth representatives on the Board of Directors for tbe provision of a direct commercial wireless service between Australia and the stations in the TJnited Kingdom and Canada. The agreement referred to is the very eSsenco of the whole business. The success or f a i l u re of the new' company depends on the contract to be approved of by the directors appointed by the Commonwealth Government, in whom are vested even greater powers than those possessed by the other four directors. They have f u l l power to say whether the agreement referred to in clause 12 is acceptable to the Commonwealth Government or not. The honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Wise) says that many honourable members have swallowed thc statements made hy Mr Fisk.'but I can assure the House that the Committee looked upon that gentleman's statements with a good deal of suspicion. That was one of their reasons for .stipulating in clause 12 that these people must put up a monetary consideration to prove that they could .do what they claimed to be able to do. We stipulated that they must provide commercial communication which we described in a sub-clause in the following terms: For the purposes of this agreement, the Commercial Wireless Service means a service on their capable, as regards plant, apparatus and personnel, of maintaining communication throughout 800 days of every year on the T h a t is so. But we minimum basis of twenty words per minute each way for twelve IIOUTS per day. The point is that if they cannot give this service they are not to get £500,000 fro m the Commonwealth Government. Possibly they may be able to provide a service worth £100,000. If that is so the Commonwealth Government wil l pay them £100,000 . be paid before it is ascertained that we are getting a satisfactory service. an absolute test, and for a monetary consideration acceptable to the representatives of the Commonwealth on the Board of Directors. has to be given within six months or an extended tune. wealth directors to say what the monetary consideration shall be and what the time shall be. Members of the Committee were not experts, and therefore, they placed upon the representatives of the Commonwealth on the Board of Directors the responsibility of saying what a satisfactory commercial wireless service should be. However, the Committee were competent to draw up the agreement which the Government accepted, and which has been signed by Amalgamated Wireless Limited, and the least the Government could have done was to have asked the members of t h at Committee who should be the representatives of the Commonwealth on the Board of Directors. It is extremely unfortunate that Sir Thomas Hughes 'should be chairman of the company. In the first place the Committee set out to secure effective guarantees. It s next object was to secure the appointment of an independent chairman. It took us a long time to come to a conclusion, but we all understood that we were to secure the appointment of an in dependent chairman. Four of the members of the Committee were lawyers and the Solicitor-General( Sir Robert Garran) looked over the agreement afterwards and finalized: it .

If what the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) says be true, that two of the directors are partners, one of them having been appointed to represent the Commonwealth Government and the other having been chosen to represent the Amalgamated Wireless Limited, it seems to me that the position is positively bad. I hope that the Governmeut will have learned a lesson, and that they will see that the agreement specified in clause 12 will safeguard the Commonwealth, which the Committee appointed by this Parliament, tried its best to do. The Government are not to be called .upon to undertake an experiment, because the Committee has provided that the other party is to put up monetary guarantees. The original agreement specified that the Marconi Company were to erect a high-power station at a cost of £600,000. Under the present agreement, as drawn up by the Committee, open tenders are to be called for the erection of this station. They are not to be submitted by one firm only. It will be the fault of the Government and of its representatives on the board of directors if that provision in the agreement is not carried out. I wish to say a few words with reference to the controversy concerning tbe relative positions of Mr Horace Bateley Allard aud Mr George Mason Allard as 'chairman of Messrs. Beard, Watson, and Company Limited. I have made a close investigation and find that the only connection Mr Horace Bateley Allard has with the company now is that the firm of Messrs. H . B. Allard, Way and Hardy are auditors to the firm of Messrs. Beard, Watson, and Company Limited. A l case of Sir though Mr Horace Bateley Allard was chairman of the firm of Messrs. Beard, Watson, and Company Limited for many years, a reconstruction has taken place, and within the last year or two Mr George Mason Allard has taken his place. Therefore, at the present time, Mr George Mason Allard is chairman of the firm of Messrs. Beard, Watson, and Company Limited, and the statement t'o that effect made last night by the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) was accurate. I regret that I challenged its accuracy, and I take the earliest opportunity to let the House know tbe exact position. When I think of tbe history of the wireless agreement, I am perplexed at the attitude of honourable members opposite. 0 In the first place, the agreement was on the table of this House for about two months, and when the House finally considered it it was decided to refer it to a Committee, and the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) was authorized to act upon the advice of that Committee. As we have heard, the Committee examined the original agreement, made very material alterations in it , and sent it back to the Prime Ministeri n an amended form. The matters raised by the Committee and in dispute between them and the Amalgamated Wireless Limited were all settled, as the Committee thought, in favour of the Commonwealth. The question of taking over the Commonwealth's existing radio plant and personnel was agreed to. The suggestion that guarantees should be put up by any company undertaking any contraot in connection with the plant or other requisities to Garry out the agreement was also agreed to. The question of the election of the board of directors, and, consequently, the control in the board of directors of the company was compromised. We must always remember",25,Aodkess In Reply

The personnel of the appointments has been criticised, and it has been suggested that men in the employ of the Commonwealth ought to have been selected. But I remind honourable members that the whole cry has been that we should get the assistance of business men; and if we get business men of importance who can successfully conduct business affairs, we get men who are interested not only in one industrial concern but in many. The very fact that they are interested in other enterprises shows that they have experience and ought to be able to conduct the affairs of the Comimoaiwealth in a satisfactory way. I do not know anything about Mr MasonA l l a r d except as an accountant; but I do know Mr Stinson and Sir William Vicars. Sof a r as these two are concerned, I believe that they will give the Commonwealth good service, for they are as good men as could have been selected. When Sir Robert Gibson, of Melbourne, is mentioned as against them, I see no difference, so far as a selection is concerned, betvjeen that gentleman's position in this city, and the position tliat SirW ill i am Vicars holds in Sydney. I cannot see why these men who have proved their worth should be objected to. Like other honourable members, I have been astonished at one or two things in connection with this business. been astonished at the action of Sir Thomas Hughes, who has a reputation, and a high reputation, as one of the most honest, straightforward men in the business life of Sydney. ' It has come as a tremendous shock to rae to see h i m lend himself to such a thing as this. all these astonishing things? it has caused perturbation in my own minds; and it casts such a suspicion over the business that in my opinion we shall have to watch very carefully and closely the whole of the transactions. There is no doubt that, so far as Sydney is concerned, Sir Thomas Hughes is one of the most prominent ""men interested in wireless, aud it was because of that he was elected as director of Amalgamated Wireless. But if the Amalgamated Wireless were going to "" play the g a m e"" in an ordinary straightforward business manner, one of the first men they would have nominated as one of the three directors to be selected by them would have been Sir Thomas Hughes. There is no doubt he would have been the first chosen, but, knowing his strength in the community, and knowing his in t i mate knowledge of wireless, those interested apparently held him back to be put forward ultimately as the seventh director. I consider this is a breach of the clause of the agreement. How a man of the standing of Mr Consett Stephen could construe that clause of the agreement as giving h i m an absolutely free hand I do not know. He apparently took the view that his only duty as arbitrator was to select the best available man for the position irrespective of fhe question as to whether or not such a man had any connection with either the Commonwealth or the Amalgamated Wireless. It is a narrow interpretation such as I should not expect from, a man of Mr Stephen's ability and reputation. The very wording of the clause ought to have put h im on his guard. We know that representatives of the Commonwealth, particularly Mr Stinson, put the case most strongly that the seventh man ought to be an in dependent man; but, in spite of that, the , arbitrator made what I consider an extraordinary appointment. As I have already said, it has caused great perturbation, not only in my own mind, but, as I can see, I have in the minds of other bono' able members.

134,Mr Mcgeath,"Thre e members ofimmediately found themselves opposed by the Telefunken and Marconi companies, who sought an order of the Court to restrain tbe Commonwealth from proceeding with its scheme. As the Court ivould be influenced only by expertevidence, the Government imported the best wireless expert obtainable in the world, Mr Swinburne, at a cost of, approximately, £3,500. Mr Swinburne reported to the Government that the system which they were proposing to adopt was the best in the world at that time, and that it did not infringe any of the patent rights of the Marconi and Telefunken companies. Then the so called Amalgamated Wireless Companyreally Marconi and Telefunken-becam e scared, and on 26th May, 1914, just prior to the outbreak of war, wrote a letter to the Government offering to withdraw the legal proceedings if the -Commonwealth would pay them £5,000, each side to pay its own legal costs: The company also offered to sell certain patent rights to of his own partner. Of the original the Government, including the Goldsmith rights, which at that time were considered the most efficient in the world for long distances). The Postmaster-General at that time was the Honourable Agar Wynne, and the Government accepted the company's offer. A sum of £5,000 was paid to the company, and the Commonwealth was to receive certain patent rights; but, upon investigation, it wa° discovered that these German Jews, who were behind the company then as they are behind the Marconi Company to-day, had sold the Government a right that would expire within two months of the sale, and could then be used by anybody for nothing. Two months before the outbreak of war these so-called patriots transferred to the Germans the only patent rights they possessed which were of any value. Those are the people whom we are asked to trust to-day; they are the same old gang of German Jews. That, briefly, is the history of their early connection with wireless in this country, and the efforts made by certain Australians to establish an independent system controlled by the Commonwealth. If , knowing the past history of the wireless negotiations, honourable members are still prepared to allow the Government to escape censure for their action in connection with the present agreement, they must answer to their constituents. Personally, I believe this to be a most "" fishy "" 'transaction. From the honorten) we heard not one word of criticism of the Government, but he calmly admitted to us, the custodians of the rights of the people, that George Mason Allard, who has been appointed to represent tlie Commonwealth on the wireless directorate, is a partner with Charles Bartholomew, one of the representatives of the company. I have never heard of anything more scandalous. What is the use of making a fuss about the independence of the chairman? Already the company has a majority on the directorate. If Charles Bartholomew, who is a partner with George Mason Allard in tbe firm of Beard, Watson, and Company, is appointed to represent the company, and Allard sits on the same board as the nominee of the Government,' the Wireless Company will have in those men two representatives, for we may be sure that Allard will not vote against the interests 200,000 shares in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited the Marconi Company held 60,000. In order to increase the private capital. to £500,000, as required by this agreement, an additional 300,000 shares have been issued. Were any applications invited in Australia for those shares? Was the issue advertised in the press, and was the Australian investing public asked to contribute capital to the company? No. Mr F'OWLEK Mr Shepherd, Secretary to the High Commissioner's Office, has fifty shares. a sort of bonus to Mr Shepherd, although he might have held those shares for a long time. The Marconi Company have 60,000 of the original 200,000 shares, and according to the share list just issued the company has, -so far as we can discover, another 100,000 shares of the new issue. We were told that this was to be an Australian enterprise of which we might all be proud, and why is it that Australian investors were never invited to take shares? Instead of that, a little game has been played, by the German Jews-Godfrey Isaacs and Mossey Myers, who, after all, are the Marconi Company. Tbis little gang of German Jew financiers controlling the Marconi Company have managed to secure the good services of the Prime Minister of the -Commonwealth.

Practically every transaction with which the Government have been connected since the £25,000 bribe was given to the Prime Minister has been "" fishy."" We heard the,honourable member for Corio( Mr Lister) supporting the Government in the disposal of the Woollen Mills at Geelong, although they were making a profit for the Commonwealth. It is all right to allow private enterprise being compelled by the procedure adopted to to take charge of a paying concern, but in connection with wireless, because there may be a shadow of a chance of losing money, private enterprise is not to be trusted. Private enterprise asks the Goverument in this matter to find £500,000 of the people's money, so that it may be utilized for the benefit of a few speculators. The whole transaction is shady, and investigation should not stop with the discussion of the amendment. The criticism should not be confined to the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes as seventh director, b u t should extend over the whole history ,of the company since 1914. rate, plead that Sir Thomas Hughes was appointed by an arbitrator, but no arbitrator appointed George Mason Allard. Knowing the business relationships of Allard with Bartholomew, the Government deliberately nominated the former to be their representative, allowing h i m to sit upon the board with his partner representing the opposite interests. It was only by accident that we heard that Sir Thomas Hughes had been appointed to the directorate. There was no protest from the Government against his appointment until the information regarding it was elicited in another place. A most serious charge has been established against the Government, and I cannot conceive of any honourable member voting with them on this amendment. Much has been said concerning the fact that honourable members have not had the matter of the wireless agreement properly placed before them. But when it came under the attention of the House at the Government fag-end of last session, some honourable members, at any rate, entered an earnest and, indeed, a violent protest. I shall show, by reading excerpts from the Hansard records of December last, that there were some honourable members who warned the House of the true position. One saidI oppose this agreement because I believe it is unfair to ask the people of Australia to become shareholders in a company under conditions that a man would never think of advising a member of the ordinary public to accept. The honourable member proceededHonorable members seem to be anxious to come to a vote on this question but we are do what we do not want to do. It is not fair for the Government at the last moment of the session to attempt to force such an important matter through the House simply because honourable members want to get away from their labours as quickly as possible. ' What are we here for? We are here to protect the interests of the public, and why should the Government be allowed to make this proposition which is not a proper business proposition-n o one would so describe it-and , because it is the fag end of the session, tell honourable members that they are expected to say nothing ? Then the proposition to appoint a Committee was mooted, and the following objection was made to the appointment The Government might, at any of such a body:It may be that the Committee will not fairly represent the opinion of Parliament, even if it is composed of members of several parties; and unless we are given full and fair opportunity for discussion of its decision, we have no right to go into recess. Yet honourable members have been in formed, during the course of the present debate, that the House accepted the position, not knowing what it was doing. I say honourable members were warned. I admit that the House had not reasonable time in which to deal w it h so important a project; but the scheme was placed before the House, and the House was undoubtedly blind to its'duty. orable member been quoting? ber for Robertson.

The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) advanced the wireless proposition; and, in some way or other, he persuaded the House to swallow it. Surelyi t is time that we, as the representatives of the people, not only awakened to the' dangers of such a state of affairs, but took drastic action to remedy it ! The Prime Minister yesterday quoted the words of the Leader of the Country party, the honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page), and inter-, preted them to mean that he had spoken in favour of the agreement. But, in reading the Hansard report, the right honourable gentleman forgot, or omitted, to tell the House what were the last few words employed. The honourable member said, in conclusionI should be sorry to be the cause of any long mitted matters to drift. Could any one delay in the settlement of this matter, but, in my opinion, it requires more investigation. for Cowper only wanted to investigate the bona fides of the company. I invite the honourable member to read his leader's remarks prior to those words he has just quoted. ber for Cowper said, "" but, in my opinion, it requires more investigation."" company's bona fides. The honourable member for Cowper made that clear. He did.not go as far as the honourable member for Robertson, nor did he take the same stand. one or two other members of the Country party, said definitely that we were bitterly opposed to the agreement. But the leader of our party had perceived the danger, to a certain extent, at any rate, when he made those remarks orable member to try to save his leader. The honourable member for Cowper swallowed the proposition holus bolus.

The trouble is that the House did not insist upon [20 JULY, 1922.] Address-in-Reply. 671 further investigation; and now we are told we are bound hand and foot, because a majority of honourable members servilely followed the Prime Minister, and had not the courage to' insist upon an inquiry should not forget that the Leader of his party voted against the suggested inquiry. He was obviously not leading the honourable member for Robertson on that occasion. now. with the work of the Committee. Honourable members are informed that its task was carried out excellently. The Committee certainly improved what was originally an extremely bad agreement. But, here, honourable members see merely another evidence of the manner, in which this House has perhave conceived that, prior to the appointment of the Parliamentary Wireless Committee, this Parliament would have reached such a stage in its affairs that a Minister of the Crown would be permitted to continue to act as the chairman of an investigating Committee, after he had been promoted to the Ministry? I can only say that the whole of the facts constitute a highly improper situation. I was extremely sorry to see the honourable member ;for Flinders( Mr Bruce) continue to occupy such an invidious post. The Treasurer, with his traditions and training should have seen at a glance in what an anomalous position he had been placed. Had he not been associated* with such men as have been around him he would have perceived immediately that it was time for him to get out and have no further association with the inquiry. It has been said that honourable members in this corner have been spending their time in traducing Australia, and that we must flow take our courage in both hands and make an effort to vindicate ourselves. I ought not to have to say that we ardently believe in our country. Our trouble is that the country is not getting a fair run. We have no faith in the man who is at present at the head of affairs. Here is the justification of our lack of faith: We do not want to decry Australia.

But we know that those hearts are being broken because of such things as this agreement, things which are brought down here and forced upon a servile House, things for which -the people must eventually pay. The debate has disclosed a number of features which no honourable member had previously dreamed of. If the Government will take advice, I would urge them to get out"" of the arrangement on the best possible terms. In the best interests of the country they should approach the Amalgamated Wireless Company and see if they cannot come to some business like arrangement for the termination of the contract entered into. One thing has struck me forcibly during the debate. I cannot think that Mr Consett Stephen, when asked to act as arbitrator, did not have all the facts before him. But, if he did possess all the facts, I cannot conceive how hea lawyer-coul d have appointed an individual who was interested in Amalgamated Wireless to be the seventh director. I may be doing Mr Stephen an injustice; I hope that I am not. But I feel satisfied in my own mind that, when asked to act as arbitrator, his attention was 'drawn to the alterations made iu the agreement. In the original draft before this House, which was not accepted, provision was made that foursevenths of the directors should be representatives of Amalgamated Wireless, and that three should be the nominees of the Commonwealth. Nearly the whole of the old agreement is to be found in the present agreement; but, in the altered personnel of the directorate, there may be seen one of the main changes. that there should be six directors, three appointed Ifrom each side, and the seventh to be selected by those six. But, in the event of disagreement, the six directors were to appoint an independent arbitrator, who was to select the seventh man. those facts. appointing Sir Thomas Hughes he must have known also that he was simply putting the whole situation back into its original unsatisfactory state. The Government are now in duty bound to try We have to get out of the arrangement on the best possible terms. orable member's suspicions directed?

Or can he tell me who wag the other person whom the arbitrator had to consider together with Sir Thomas Hughes? my own knowledge that that gentleman was put forward by any one, or by either party. Buti t is clear that the Commonwealth could have had no voice in suggesting him to Mr Stephen; otherwise 0 the Government would not now say that they cannot accept him. conclusive. That is just the point that I was wondering about. that the Government put Sir Thomas Hughes forward, whoever may have suggested him to Mr Consett Stephen. Anyhow, if I can see an opportunity to bring about the cancellation of his appointment, I shall certainly make use of it. As for the agreement itself, there is one point on which the Committee is to be commended. It has safeguarded the interests of the Commonwealth as fully as was possible. I refer to the fact that Special provision was made the agreement provides that the company shall, within six months, proceed to do certain things and give certain guarantees regarding the despatch of messages, and the like. If the eompany does not satisfy the Government upon those points within the period specified it will be Mr Stephen must have known open for the Commonwealth authorities Andi f he did, then in to cancel the agreement.

If , as many honourable members bave advised, tbe Government were to cancel the agreement and repudiate the whole business, the Commonwealth would not be in as good a position as if the Government were first to try to employ fair and business-like methods. It will be time enough to repudiate the agreement when the company has refused to ""let us out"" on proper terms. However, I am quite satisfied with the assurance of the Government that they will not go on with the agreement while Sir Thomas Hughes remains in the position of seventh director. We are safeguarded in that respect, and I therefore know no reason why I should vote for the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Batman. ' I think that 'the Government, if possible, should withdraw from the agreement, but I have not yet come to a decision as to whether, in the event of fresh steps being taken i u connection with long distance wireless telegraphy, operations should bo conducted by the Government or left to private enterprise under Government supervision. Apparently very little is known, in Australia about long distance wireless I was under the impression that certain people whom I consulted on this subject in December last knew more about it than they seem to know to-day, otherwise I should not have taken their advice and have voted as I did when the agreement was before us at that time. I sincerely hope that in the event of the Government being able to withdraw from this agreement, no further step will be taken by them in connection with an enterprise of this kind without first obtaining the advice of the best availwhich we are confronted. I do not think able experts. mean in the long run a material saving to the Commonwealth. When this matter was before the House in December last I was assured, not only by certain persons outside, from whom I made inquiries, but iby an honourable.member of this House, that long-distance wireless was reliable and effectire. I voted for the reference of the agreement to a Parliamentary Committee, subject to the condition that, if the Committee approved of it, the Prime Minister should be empowered to execute it, because of the plea of the right honourable gentleman himself that it was a matter of great urgency, and that he did not want it to be held up until the next session of the Parliament. It was because of the plea of urgency, and the fact that I was assured that long-distance wireless was effective, that I voted as I did. The Committee was by no means satisfied, as the result of its investigations, that long-distance wireless was uot reliable, and we have no positive assurance to the contrary. If the company cannot, within six months, do what is required of it by the agree-. ment, then the 'agi'eement will go by the board. that the Commonwealth has already paid"" into it? whether there will be any means of recovering the money so paid. I am not going to blame any one for the position I took up and the vote that I gave when the agreement was before us in December last. The vote that I shall cast to-day will be consistent with that then given by me. The object of the honourable member for Batman's amendment is to turn the Government out of ofiice. to a motion of censure? honourable member to turn to the job he was sent here to do. the amendment would not get us anywhere unless it be to the country. It would not affect the position of the Commonwealth Government under the agreement which has been entered into. It has no application to the position with Money so spent would that, in submitting his amendment, the honourable member had any knowledge of many facts which have been disclosed iu the course of the debate upon it. He did not know that Sir Thomas Hughes had been appointed as a seventhdirector, nor do I think he knew anything as to two members of the one firm having been appointed as directors, one to represent the Commonwealth and the other to represent the interests of private shareholders. Had he been cognisant of such matters he would have introduced them into his very entertaining and interesting, if not convincing, speech.

162,Mr Atkinson,"The carrying ofduring this debate I have come to the conclusion that it would be wise for the Government to get rid of the agreement. The amendment, however, has no bearing on that point. It would lead us nowhere, and in view of the position that I took up when the original agreement was before us, it would be inconsistent for me to support it . 1 [4.42] I fail to appreciate the reason for all the fuss that has been made about the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes as seventh -director of the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. We aTe told that his appointment means, in effect, that there will be on the Board four representatives of private shareholders, and only three representatives of the Commonwealth. To my mind the appointment means only that there will be seven instead of 'six directors. Even the most ardent supporters of the Government will admit that the three directors appointed to represent the Commonwealth are just as suitable, from the point of view i ploiters of Australia generally, we kuow of the Marconi crowd, as are the men who have been selected by those people. The complaints that have been made in regard to the selection of Sir Thomas Hughes are quite beside the mark, because he will be no more able to beat the remaining six directors than "" Sir"" Thomas Walsh would be. Strong man though he, is, Thomas Walsh could not beat the six any more than Sir Thomas Hughes could do. I marvel at the impudence of the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) in committing the Commonwealth to an agreement of this sort. If , while he was Leader of the Labour Government, he had made such an agreement, and had endeavoured to put into good positions men sharing his political beliefs, there would have been a howl from Dan to Beersheba. It would havo been said by honourable members opposite tliat he was handing over the country to a band of agitators. Yet, as the Leader of a Conservative Government, he has the impertinenceto enter into an agreement providing for the appointment of seven directors from the Conservative section of the community, and to empower them to spend £500,000 of public money. I am by no means exaggerating the position when I make this statement. When a Queensland Labour Administration had the courage to appoint a Labour man as Chief Justice of that State the whole of the legal fraternity rose in pious horror; yet we are expected to accept without protest the appointment of Conservatives to all sorts of positions. When Dr. Jensen was appointed by a Labour Government as Government Geologist for the Northern Territory, there was a howl of indignation from the Conservative party. His qualifications were not disputed; they were of the highest order. The sole ground of, complaint was that he was a Labour man. In this case we have £500,000 of public money handed over to a private company presided over by seven Conservatives. The time will come when even the . Prime Minister's supporters will tire of such impudence. I hope that honourable members will cease to complain further about the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes, because, while his appointment to the Board «of Directors of. this company will strengthen "" F a t "" and the exthat there are six other directors of the same class. The real gravamen o,f the charge made against the Government is not that Sir Thomas Hughes has been wrongly appointed, but that we have been sold something that is worthless. Not one honourable member who has spoken during this debate has said that wireless telegraphy is effective over a distance of 12,000 miles. The Government have put £500,000 into such a project at a time when we are told on all sides that we should economize. The Government are not prepared to increase invalid and old-age pensions. They tell us that the country cannot afford to increase them; but at the same time they are ready to spend £500,000 in bolstering up a big financial concern that can well afford to pay its own way. The Government are going to sell the Commonwealth Woollen Mills at Geelonga socialistic concern that has proved a success-and are putting £500,000 into something which looks like a failure. They cannot afford to increase the invalid and old-age pensions, but they have agreed to give £500,000 to "" Uncle Three-Balls.''

163,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"than I have. When the Prime Minister returned from the Old Country last year he told us that by means of wireless we were going to be kept in direct touch with B r it a in every hour and every minute of the day, so that in time of trouble we would have a quick and effective means of communication w i th the centre of the Empire. There is no proof, however, that wireless is effective over a greater distance than 4,000 miles, and this company w ill not be penalized if it fails to carry out its part of the contract. We are told that we are bound hand and foot by the agreement. No one w ill ' charge me with having joined in the howl for (iconomy. What some people speak of as economy would, to my mind, lead only to iuefficiency, and such men as Ashworth, Knight, and Twigg-Patterson would do well to focus their attention on expenditure of this kind, and to call upon the country to deal w i th those who are responsible for it . Then they might justify their existence by pointing to an economy which is essential. We know now from the expert evidence submitted to the Wireless Committee that wireless communication has not a greater range than 4,500 miles, except under very favorable circumstances, or, perhaps, by accident. tried wireless beyond 4,500 miles? message from Berlin was picked up at Perth; but the honourable member knows that it was a freak. On two occasions a friend of mine has picked up messages from America with a primitive wireless receiving plant. We were told that the system was so perfect that Australia was in communication with Great Britain every hour of the day. In my innocence I thought that if any one knew anything about wireless the Marconi crowd should. I thought that if they made a statement that they could communicate over 12,000 miles it could be done. they are paid proportionately. be valueless if it does not have a range of 12.000 miles. say to-day that a range of 12,000 miles is not possible; because there is no high power station at this end to receive messages from that distance. member went into a grocer's .shop in ol der to buy a t in of fish would he buy if the grocer said, "" I do not say that it is good, but no one can say that it is bad."" The only course the honourable inember could pursue would be to believe that the fish was bad until it was proved to be good. We have no proof that we can have direct wireless communication over a distance of 12,000 miles. The incidents referred to in the debates this session are the strongest proof of the failure of the present social system. Here we have a body of men with all the money of the world at their command, men associated with a nnancial circle in Europe which could find £500,000,009 if necessary, coming out here to the people of Australia and "" taking us down."" I I do not say that the Government are ' ' in the show"" in "" taking us down,"" b u t through this bargain of theirs they have clearly shown their unfitness to occupy the position they hold to-day. We are bolstering up a huge financial concern, and yet Ave cannot afford to keep paying woollen mills running. If this is ""good business "" I do not know what "" bad business "" is . ' The case in which the Marconi Company sued the Pederal Government must still be fresh in the minds of honourable members. In 1911, a young man named Balsillie came like a flash on thing subsequently went wrong with h i m ; he had brains in plenty, but evidently he lacked balance. A t any rate, the highest expert of the day decided that his ideas were . sufficiently unique to warrant patenting on their own. They were no infringement on the Telefunken or Mar-1 coni systems. A t that time the Telefunken and Marconi crowds were quarrelling with one another; they were sueing one another; like Kilkenny cats they were cutting one another's throats, each claiming that the other was trespassing on its own particular field of profiteering.

It is time the Country party listened to what honourable members of the Opposition place before the House, and ceased shaking their heads, and thinking that nothing good can come out of Nazareth. If they had been doing their duty, none of these agreements would have eventuated. Therefore, they must be prepared to accept their share of whatever blame falls upon the Government in connection with this wireless agreement. not intended saying anything in this debate, but after listening to a speech last night, I felt that I must make a few observations.

Indeed, ihe suggested that we were giving away £500,000. regret that, in the earlier stagesI presume when the matter was under discussion by Cabinet-h e was not a free man, so that he might' have denounced the agreement on the floor of the House.

Therefore, I suppose there is public the impression that they are dissatisfied with the actions of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, though not sufficiently dissatisfied to hold the Government responsible for its stupidity, or worse. The remarkable part of the disclosures, so far as the debate has gone, is that on the last occasion when this question was mentioned in the House, the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) was f u ll of determination to see the business through. He told us that Sir Thomas Hughes had been appointed, though he ( Mr Bruce) could not understand how, and so forth, but in any case, he said, there were insuperable obstacles-to use his own language-in the road of remedying the position. The Treasurer conveyed the impression that the Government were going to stand by the agreement, that there was to be no surrender ; if any mistakes had been made by the Government the Government would stand by them, and there was an end of the matter.

I do not know that there was any other; but it is unfortunate for the company that, owing to their lack of perspicacity, they insisted upon Sir Thomas Hughes being selected to occupy the position of seventh director when it is now obvious that Amalgamated Wireless would have been quite safe in any case. Their interests would have heen conserved even had not Sir Thomas Hughes been chosen by the arbitrator. The Government are now endeavouring, under cover of the fuss aroused by the appointment, to divert attention from the fact that Amalgamated Wireless would have been in complete control no matter whether Sir Thomas Hughes or some other nominee had been selected.",41,Smith Hav E They Ever The Scene He Was A Genius Although Some

The old International Munitions Combine was a plaything compared with it. ThisMarconi combination, with its international ramifications, is an altogether sinister thing by comparison. It is not to be wondered at that it has such power in Australia, seeing that it has been able to control events even at the heart of the Empire, and actually at the international gathering recently held at Genoa.

And it was because of the failure of that firm that its Marconi interests, bringing to bear the power and weight of their British affiliations, secured the holding of the International Conference at Genoa. The honourable member for Bourke referred to the Marconi influence in the Lloyd George Cabinet. It was Mr Lloyd George, friend of Godfrey Isaacs, managing director of the Marconi Wireless Company, who proposed the holding of the Conference at Genoa. The same identities control the Australian wireless business as those who controlled the calling together of the International gathering in Italy. They are those same individuals who raided 'and robbed the British public during the war. They are the same as those who formed the British Cellulose Company-betterr known as the ""Dope Corporation."" This is how they saved the Empire: They secured a Government contract for cellulose, which is used in the treatment of aeroplane wings. They floated a company, and put down 6d. per share..

I wonder how that argument would apply personally to the Treasurer. sociation from certain big business interests occurred only a little while ago.

Unlike the honourable gentleman, I am not a wage slave with a "" bosses'"" mentality. The position is that the Ministry have the numbers; they know that they will have the support of a sufficient number of members of the Country party to insure"" them a majority. That being so, the Prime Minister can afford to treat the House and the country with the greatest disdain. He does not worry; he has no reason to do so. He knows that all the His disbig business interests, the press, and also, with very few exceptions, the politicians on his side of the House, will stand behind him when an appeal to the country comes. He knows, too, that the people who have put up with all the outrages on public decency that have been committed by his Ministry will continue to vote for him, irrespective of any criticism that' may be levelled from this side of the House. The Government rely on the power of the purse and the press, together with their own scandalous misrepresentation, of facts,'to return them once more.

I cannot believe that the Government, had it been seized of the facts, would have consented to Mr Allard's appointment to the Board. We are going to give the Government the benefit of the doubt so f a r as Mr Allard's appointment is concerned; but the information which has been afforded the House as a result of this debate goes to show how necessary it is that the fullest inquiries should be made by the Government before, making any such appointment. I am inclined to think that the Government did not know that Mr Allard had been associated with the Wireless Company, and was not aware that he was in partnership with a gentleman who had been selected to represent private shareholders on the Board. I believe tliat they were guided"" by Mr Fiski n the appointments they made. No doubt they sought expert advice, and asked Mr Fisk and others associated with wireless telegraphy for information for their guidance. In all probability Mr Fisk told them that Mr Allard knew a good deal about wireless, but was in no way associated with the company. If such a statement were made to them they would feel justified in appointing Mr Allard as therewith, the matter in dispute shall be rea director. Later on, however, the Government discovered that he was in partnership with another gentleman, holding, in his own name, some 10,000 or 11,000 shares, who was also a member of the Board. Mr Francis.

That is the all-important pointnnd thc seventh director shall be selected by a majority vote of the other six directors, and if the voting is equal shall be selected by arbitration in the manner provided by clause 20 of this agreement in respect of matters in dispute between the Commonwealth and the company, and shall hold office for a period of three years, subject to removal at any time during the period by the unanimous vote of the other directors. ' The Board of Directors so constituted shall appoint its own chairman. There the intention of both parties that each should have three representatives on the Board, and that the seventh member should be an independent man, is clearly shown. In clause 20 we have the further provision thatIn the' event of any disagreement between thc Commonwealth and the company as to the meaning of any clause hereof or toushing any matter arising out of the same or connected ferred to one arbitrator mutually selected, or failing mutual selection, shall be determined by arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1915 of thc State of Victoria or any amendment thereof for the time being in force.

274,Mr Gabb,The honourable member,45,Smith Th E Arbitrator S Those Of The Company
275,Mr Francis,"I do not. The honthe view that the arbitrator, in selecting Sir Thomas Hughes, did not act in accordance with the terms of the agreement. The agreement clearly implies that the seventh director shall be an independent man. England, one' of the greatest authorities on questions of this kind, it is set out very distinctly thatWhere there exists a real common intention between the parties to a transaction, but mistake occurs in the expression of that intention, the Court may correct the mistake in order to give effect to the real intention. To justify the Court in so doing, it must appear that there has been a mistake common to both the contracting parties, and that the agreement purports to have been expressed in a deed or instrument in a manner contrary to the intention of both. In this case we have a mistake common to both parties. The Government and Amalgamated Wireless have both signed the agreement that there shall be three directors from each side, and any Court would hold that the appointment of a seventh director was to be arrived at by mutual consent. The arbitrator has not carried out the desire which is so expressed in the agreement. I venture to say that I am not f a r wrong in this view. Where two lawyers are fighting on behalf of clients they each tell their clients that they have every chance of winning, but one must lose, and it is the Judge who decides the winner. I claim that the Government has a very clear line of action to pursue. Lord Halsbury's opinion continuesThe relie'f given may be either by way of rectification or rescission as the case may require, for in such cases the difference is only one of degree, A deed poll may also be rectified on proof that it is not in accordance with the intention of the person who executed it. Equity will also interfere where by mutual mistake a document has been signed which operates in law contrary to the express intention and agreement of both parties. There is no distinction in principle between a mistake aB to the legal effect of tlie words used, and a mistake in the words themselves, and, therefore, if a solicitor in drawing a dead, through error, either inserts or omits terms contrary to thc intention of the parties, or uses words capable of a meaning different from that which the parties intended, relief will bo granted. So it appears that equity would also relieve if a solicitor innocently misled parties as to the legal effect of a document, and they were induced to sign it under a misapprehension of its meaning. The principle upon which thc Court acts in correcting deeds or instruments is that the parties are to be placed in the same position as that in which tbey would have stood if the error to be corrected had not been committed. Thus in a proper case the Court will rectify a deed of settlement, an appointment, a lease, a bond, a bill of exchange, a schedule of quantities annexed to a contract to execute works In the Earl of Halsbury's LOADS of for a gross sum purporting to show how the gross sum is made up, a policy of insurance, and a declaration of shipment under a policy of marine insurance, even after a loss had become known. Thus the Court w ill rectify any appointment made contrary to the spirit of an agreement. There are hundreds of cases in support of this decision, dating as f a r back as 1838. Lord Halsbury's opinion, which would be accepted in any Court of law, indicates the road this Government can take. I believe that Ministers are in favour of settling the matter in a f a i r and equitable way. A great deal has been said about the capabilities of Sir Thomas Hughes. If that gentleman stands on the pinnacle of fame he is said by some to occupy, if he is a publicspirited man who has the interests of the Commonwealth at heart, I cannot understand why he has not resigned before this. The agreement in question is about as loose a document as any one could d r a f t . I should think that in a matter involving the expenditure of £500,000 it would have been made, if not exactly watertight, at least something which would not leave loop-holes for a company whose earlier litigation against the Commonwealth, according to some honourable members, has been surrounded by incidents not altogether palatable. Senator JohnD . Millen, who was a member of the Wireless Committee, is a man who thoroughly understands wireless, and his advice was accepted by other members of the Committee. He signed the agreement thinking that it was a good one, so far as such documents went, but yesterday, in another place, he said that the agreement should be torn up. He said that the correspondence that passed between the Government and Amalgamated Wireless Limited prior to the drawing up of the agreement amounted to an almost distinct understanding that the chairman of the proposed Board of Directprs should be an independent man. He also said that the appointment of Mr Allard and other matters had utterly destroyed the value of the agreement from the Commonwealth point of view. I have read through this agreement, and I can see nothing in it as to what happens should one of the Commonwealth own interests. Australia compares favordirectors die or be laid aside by illness. ably with other countries; but we are a Has the Conunonwealth power to appoint mere handful of people, and in order to a deputy director? case of a director dying under the ordiImmigrants mean life or death to a comnary company law the remaining directors munity like our own, and the subject dewould appoint some one in his place. ence to the Minister for Defence we have have immigration run mad, and it first been presuming too much.

280,Mr Francis,"There is one point inotherwise, owing to the illness of a director, the Commonwealth representatives might he out-voted on a matter involving a large sum of money. that there is no provision in the agreement for a quorum, and that is another omission which helps me to the conclusion that the agreement is as loosely drawn as it could be. prepare the articles of the company should make them more complete than this agreement has been made, and that no matter what number is fixed as a quorum, it must include the three representatives of the Commonwealth. An .honourable member suggests by interjection that I want the earth; I certainly want all I can get for the people, and I shall not vote for any further agreement that does not provide' that the quorum shall include ful l representation of the Commonwealth. I have given the House the benefit of my legal knowledge. One honourable member suggests that a little knowledge is dangerous, but lawyers inside and outside the House endejivour to convince rival parties that they can win if they go to law. Obviously both cannot win, and some of our most eminent lawyer's find their opinions declared wrong by the Court. This wire-' less project, involving such a large sum of public money, is of vital importance to the community, and I think the time has arrived when the Government should get out of all trading concerns and throw the responsibility of trading on the shoulders of private people. The debate on this amendment has been most extraordinary; like the Biblical cloud, at first no bigger than a man's hand, it has political situation. One of the most useless as well as the most . aggravating things that can be said to any one is "" I told you so."" It is not a very sporting attitude to take up, but I am bound to say, in order to make my position plain, that what I said when the original agreement was before us I say nowI am uncompromisingly against the whole project. peculiarly interesting and extraordinary for two reasons: Firstly, we heard the honourable member for Darling( Mr circumstances, it does not follow that one Blakeley), a little earlier in the session, make a very interesting speech on the subject of arbitration. Personally, I think the case he made out for the non-acceptance or breach of an arbitration award was wrong, but the extraordinary feature I notice also of this debate is that from the Prime Minister downward, honourable members, on both sides, have as a matter of course accepted and advocated a distinct breach of arbitration. The Attorney-GeneralI suggest that those who ( Mr Groom) yesterday announced to the House the very successful result of arbitration in regard to the claim made by a shipbuilding firm against the Commonwealth. I congratulate the Minister on that result. But are we, after accepting with delight yesterday the fruits of one arbitration, to deliberately advocate a breach of arbitration in regard to another matter? The second extraordinary feature has been the marked readiness for repudiation shown by honourable members on both sides. From the Prime Minister downward, thei'e has been the 1 most simple and straightforward advocacy of repudiation in its lhost direct form unless the Commonwealth can get its own way. Most honourable members, in excusing their vote of last session for the reference of the agreement to the Committee, wish to treat the agreement, signed on behalf of tlie Commonwealth by "" W. M. Hughes,"" as nothing more or less than a scrap of paper. That is a most inconsistent attitude. I do not believe in repudiation in regard to leaseholds nor in anything else. When the Prime Minister submitted to the House the original agreement, which is admitted by everybody to be most unsuitable and, in fact, impossible, he concluded his speech with these words: : ' I ask honourable members to take their courage in both hands and to' have a little faith in the future of this country."" overcast the whole There is a saying that persons of a certain class will rush in where angels fear to tread. Far be it from me to apply-that saying to the Prime Minister; I have too high an opinion of his talents and ability. But I think I am entitled to say, and I hope the Leader of the House will take note of this, that because one is not willing to agree hurriedly to the expenditure of large sums of money for this or any The debate has been other project, because one is not willing to risk the public funds recklessly, either in a spirit of enthusiasm or in any other is less a believer in his country. I hope that when the Minister for Defence( Mr Greene) next accuses members of the",47,Smith Th E Arbitrator S Those Of The Company

I , personally, was opposed to the scheme at first, as I am now, and I would do anything to get the Commonwealth out of it in an honourable way, but as that does not seem practicable it seems to me that the amendment moved by the honourable member for Batman offers the best alternative.

It has been said that the amendment is tantamount to a. motion of want of confidence, or that it will be so treated by the Government. Batman, when he moved the amendment, distinctly said that he was not moving it as a motion of want of confidence. The amendment saysbut we desire to advise His Excellency that the agreement mentioned in clause 12 of the contract made between Amalgamated Wireless Limited and the Commonwealth should, before acceptance by the Commonwealth representatives on the Board of Directors, be agreed to by this House. I can see no words there which may be interpreted to represent a motion of want of confidence. The Government may treat it as such, if they like, but, if they do, that is their own. funeral. -The subject under debate has been almost talked to a frazzle; and, in offering a little further criticism, I feel that I may only be reiterating what has been already said. A t the same time, I desire to make a few observations. This wireless business. represents one of the greatest mistakes, and will stand on record eventually as one of the gravest scandals in the history of the Commonwealth Parliament. In the first place, the Commonwealth Government have made a present of £500,000 to a company of a very doubtful character. The whole of the associations of this dubious company I see no repudiaare wrapped in mystery. We are in formed that it is well known as "" AmalI t is a breach of the gamated Wireless."" A f t e r being told that it. is purely an Australian concern, I can discern no aud that its personnel and its shareThe amendment holders generally are honest and reliable persons in whom the Government can place f a it h , we find that it is merely an off-shoot of a big international concern. We learn that it is nothing like what it was represented to be when the Government were inveigled into accepting a lopsided agreement. The Government have the larger portion of the capital vested in the company, and there was to have been provision for Government control on the directorate, but the Government nominees on the Board are persons associated with the promoters of the old' company, which I s not that amendwas dissolved, but which really re-formed itself. These Government nominees are not in a position to give an impartial deal I do not think it in behalf of the people of Australia. It is astonishing that Sir Thomas Hughes, above all others, should have received the appointment to the position of seventh director, which, I understand, carries with it the chairmanship of directors. I wish The honourable member for to know when the board of directors met, and whom the Government representatives and the company's representatives nominated for the consideration of the arbitrator.

288,Mr Lambert (West Sydney) [8.16].,"open way immediately upon the announcement, of the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes. The Government should cancel the agreement. Even if I were not against the principle of the private and the semi-private control of means cf public communication, I would still say that the agreement is so rotten that it blioulcl be cancelled without hesitation. I am all the more emphatically of opinion that it should be cancelled, seeing that I am altogether opposed to the principle of allowing private interests to even participate in the control of means of communication either in Australia or between Australia and other countries. Government made a present of £500,000 to what is practically a foreign company, principally financed, as it is from overseas, and, to a large extent, from countries which were recently considered to be enemy countries. One thing of which I am proud is that no member of the Labour party can be held blameworthy for the present position. No responsibility rests ivpon the shoulders of the Opposition. When this matter was first raised in the House it was not, and was not treated as, a party one. I regard honourable members in the Corner as the most conservative end of the Nationalist party. only two parties in this House. One is the Labour party, and the other is the anti-Labour party. So much for my opinion of the stand taken by the so-called Country party. One hears various legal luminaries, strewn so profusely about the benches of the House, asking what are the Government going to do about the agreement. Bad as the Government are, I do not believe that they expected to find themselves absolutely helpless upon the directorate. But the company was ""too many"" for them. prises a shrewd gang of speculators, operating throughout the world. When these people can get hold of a Government so remiss as to furnish a good opportunity for the "" raking off "" of easy profits, they naturally go "" all they know"" for their objective. There is only one way out of the business; that is for the Government to revoke the agreement. BeforeI would allow £500,000 of the people's money to get into the hands of the company, and before I would, concede the loss of control upon the directorate, I would revoke the whole business and take all responsibility. That is my advice to the Government. And then I would suggest that they should take up the matter of wireless communication afresh. If they can find £500,000, they ought to be able to find £1,000,000 with which to make a Government monopoly of wireless communication. As the methods of radio-telegraphy become perfected, the system should prove to be one of the greatest paying propositions in the world. I believe that what induced the Government to enter into negotiations was their belief in the encouragement of private enterprise. At all costs, they The must have, private enterprise dabbling in Government services. It is hard to find words severe enough to condemn them. Wireless is in the experimental stage. From what I can gather from world publications on this subject there is no record of messages having been transmitted direct over a. distance of 12,000 miies. There must be intermediate stations from 2,000 to 3,000 miles apart. In the circumstances, therefore, this must be a risky experiment. If the agreement is proceeded with the result from a . party point of view will be excellent, so far as the Labour party is concerned. That is one reason why I think it probable that some members of the Country party will There are, in fact, vote against it . I should not like to be a member of the party or the Government responsible for giving effect to such an agreement. With tlie exception of the Labour party and the party in the far left hand corner, known now as the "" Pussy party ""-whicli , by the way, is not present to-night-ever y one in the House is responsible for what I would describe as this outrage on the rights of the people and the public funds of the Commonweal th. -As a member of the Cabinet when the draft agreement was laid on the table of the House, and as one who later on, as a member of the House, voted for its submission to a Parliamentary Committee, I am prepared to take my full share of responsibility for it. I voted for the reference of the draft agreement to the Parliamentary Committee knowing that uuder the terms of the resolution that Committee would have power to alter it andi to make recommendations, and that if it approved of the scheme the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) would be able to give",49,Smith Th E Arbitrator S Those Of The Company
289,The Company Com,"Mr Laird SMITH (Dension) [8.32].effect to it. The Committee held a number of sittings, and from the limited notes that have been put before us of the evidence it took I am satisfied that it did excellent work. I regret that a verbatim report of the evidence given before the Committee was not taken and published. We should then have been able to refer to a printed report of the evidence just as we may refer to-day to the reports of the debates which took place in the House of Commons, and the controversy between experts in connection with the laying down of the Atlantic cable. The objections taken to that scheme were precisely the same as those which are levelled to-day at this agreement. It was said that the Atlantic cable would not work effectively, and that it was farcical to attempt such an experiment. If a full statement of the evidence given before the Parliamentary Committee were available to us we should probably find that the views of the experts, who were examined, were different altogether from those which some of the lay members of the House are inclined to attribute to them. Notes of the evidence have been prepared for us by Senator John D. Millen, a very able member of the Committee, but I should have preferred a detailed report. I take my full share of the responsibility for the agreement as first submitted to the House, and as amended by the Committee, for the reason that we were given every opportunity to peruse the proposed agreement and to protest against it. If we were opposed to it we had every opportunity last December to voice our objections to it. I gave very careful consideration to the scheme, not only because of the occupation that I followed before I entered this House, but also because of my experience in the Old Country in 1911, which clearly demonstrated to me tbe absolute necessity for improving our means of communication with the old world in order that the people there might know more about Australia. my opinion the adoption of the wireless system will mean an enormous improvement in the dissemination of news of Australia in the Old Country. A careful examination of the agreement satisfied me that under it the Commonwealth would not give away anything. Commonwealth Government agreed to put into the undertaking one pound more than did the private shareholders, and it did so for the same reason that influenced Mr Laird Smith Disraeli to secure for the United Kingdom a majority interest in the Suez Canal. The object of the Government was to secure a controlling interest in the company. The ordinary shareholders, on the other hand, were prepared to take the risk of putting their money into the project. Mi-. PKOVVSB The ordinary shareholders, ' perhaps, were induced to put their money into the enterprise because the Government were foolish enough to do so. every man, whether he has money or not, as being dishonourable. I have found the majority of the men inall walks of life with whom I have had dealings to be straight and above board. I fail to see why honourable members on this side of the House should be subjected to such bitter criticism by honourable members of the Opposition, while they remain members of their respective unions and still occupy a seat in this House advocating certain privileges to unionists. I do not say honourable members opposite should withdraw from their unions when they enter Parliament, but I do say they should be logical and fair in their criticism. The finding of the Committee and the criticism to. which the Government have been subjected demonstrate how unpleasant it would be for any member of the House who took part in any shady transaction, or joined with others in an enterprise that was not clear and above board. I am pleased to observe that the share-list in this company does not contain the name of a member of this Parliament. would like to have our names on the share list. that I should like to be a shareholder, In since grave responsibilities may attach to membership of the company. Who will say that this long-distance wireless scheme is not likely to be a success ?

The operators are able not only to read the messages as they are received by these twenty sounders, but to type them, notwithstanding the noise made by the typewriters. My experience convinces me that the atmospheric electricity of which we hear so much w ill not prove an insurmoimtable difficulty in the way of direct wireless communication, w i th the Old Country. Tho atmospherics to which reference is so often made consist of lightning storms of high potential current which give out a different wave, and hence produce a different sound on the receiver from that of the current sent out by wireless. have many million volts of pressure in excess of those of the machine that produces the current used in wireless. have listened to messages being received in a little station which we had in the Navy Office as well as at the station in the Domain. member to go to-morrow to the Wireless Stationi n the Domain and there to hear a station in France calling New York. messages, and simultaneously the sounds caused by atmospherics. casioned by atmospherics may be described as a scratching one, while the sound sent out by a machine consists of * the uniform dot and dash. operator is able to disregard altogether the sounds made by atmospherics. The reason why no expert in this country will give sworn evidence before a Committee that direct wireless telegraphy over a distance of 12,000 miles is possible is that there are no facilities' here for working over such a distance. All the high-power stations are on the other side of the world, but our small stations in 1 Australia are constantly picking up messages sent out from them. They take them without difficulty because a very high potential or high-pressure wave is sent out, and goes on expanding and expanding u n t i l it eventually reaches this country. If we had a very high-power station here-on e tuned in unison with a high-power station in the Old CountryI have no doubt that we should be able to send messages direct just as we pick To up such messages from the other side of tlie world to-day. In the early stages of wirelefb, I worked under an engineer who was experimenting w i th the system. In those days, we had the old coherer, which was thought to represent the last thing in wireless. It was composed of a fewsteel filings so placed in a glass tube that when a current was sent out the steel filings were caused to take up a certain position. The tapper separated the filings, and the operator thus got the dot and dash sound. All that has been changed, and, as> the result of the invention of the valve system, our receiving stations will receive messages sent over very long distances such as those to which I have referred. Honourable members no doubt read recently of the wreck of the sailing shipFrance.

300,This Thin Wire Is Con,"Mr LAI RD SMITH -If the Leaderresponsible, particularly in a case such as this, when we hear one say that the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes came to him as a shock, that Cabinet had no knowledge of it, and immediately it learned of it set about rectifying the trouble. Who brought the knowledge of it under the notice of Cabinet? It was a member of the National party, a gentleman sitting in another place. His action showed that the party has nothing to hide. We, as a party, have nothing to fear. I do not mind standing before my electors and telling them the facts of this case. I will tell them that the wireless system established by the party behind which I sat for so long was a huge failure, and that I do not feel inclined to allow the Government to take it on again. We put np stations all round Australia which are useless because they are established in places where there is no need for them. The system was certainly valuable for short distances, hut is not equal to the demand to-day. Even honourable members opposite have admitted that the companies concerned in this agreement possess all the patent rights. They will also, admit that we cannot put up a plant which is patented by the companies. I would not he a party to any proposal to utilize other people's patent rights. Inventors are ofttimes the humblest of men, and should be protected. By the agreement before us the Commonwealth Government secure all the patent rights of a concern which is working world-wide. All vessels are equipped with this patented apparatus which the Australian Government has no right to use. We would haye no possible chance of setting up in opposition to the company. Under the agreement, however, we get a controlling influence by paying our fair share, which we should do. I have nothing to fear from the electors. I find that they do not try to twist matters on to one. They do not "" pitch "" little stories in sundry places about men's characters. They know well that honourable members would not be influenced in the way some people have indicated as being possible. In mv opinion, there is not a man in this House the Wireless Company or any other company would dare approach. Mr Eisk never approached me. I do not think I have had more than two words with him at any time. Honorahle members are level-headed; they are not at all likely to be influenced by button-holers. What chance would a button-holer have with the honourable member for Barrier( Mr Considine), or any other honourable member? Any one who wanted to get a certain thing carried out would not attempt to button-hole an honourable member with that object in view. Erom what I know of honourable members of this House, they are clean and above-board; and I would like to see any oue dare approach them offering them ""boodle"" for anything they do here. There is not an honourable member who would accept a gift. If he did, every other honourable member would rise to denounce him and would refuse to sit with him here. I helieve that this agreement was entered into with one object in view, namely, to give Australia that direct wireless communication which will be of such great benefit to the country. Direct communication will prove to he much superior to the relay system. Where were the relay stations to be? In India, Egypt, and so on. Under that system, however, if one station should break down, the whole of the service, would be upset. That was its weakness. With a high-power station here, we shall have communication far and near when we get it to work, which I have no doubt we shall do. Scientists can do much if they are given the time. The other day I heard of an industry which proposed to expend an enormous sum of money in Australia, but something cropped up which might have caused a failure and heavy loss. However, the people concerned said to a scientific man, "" Here is £20,000, overcome that difficulty."" That man went to work, and for a few pounds' expenditure succeeded in overcoming the difficulty, with the result that the industry has been a great success. It will be the same with wireless. Scientists are careful men. They will not commit themselves in giving evidence. They know that their reputations are at stake, and that they must live up to what they say. Had the evidence they could have given been taken, we should, I think, have heard from -these scientists statements that would (have led us to believe that, when this scheme is established, it will be an assured success. intend to speak on this amendment. have heen waiting in the chamber two days to speak on a different subject, and I do not now propose to address my remarks to the amendment more than to say that, having endeavoured to fairly weigh the evidence brought forward on both sides, I am of opinion that the whole transaction is ""fishy"" in the extreme, and therefore I shall vote for the amendment. The subject to which I propose to address my remarks is very different from that covered by the amendment, but I have been led to helieve that possibly I may be excluded from making the remarks I wish to make if I do not take this opportunity of doing so. Consequently, I propose to avail myself of it. Possibly, after the heat and stress of debate in the House during the last twenty-four hours, the subject may seem somewhat dry. but I make no apology for introducing it, seeing that it concerns so many thousands of farmers in this State, and, to a large extent, consumers as well. I propose, in the first instance, to address myself to paragraph 19 in the Governor General's messageMy Ministers, recognising the great value of the primary industries to Australia and the rapidity of their expansion, have taken definite action to open up new markets and further exploit old ones To this end they have in every way in their power assisted the producers to place their goods upon the world's market by co-operative effort. My Government proposes to continue its support of voluntary movements for the collective marketing of primary products upon the same broad principles upon which was based the assistance given by the Government last year to the wheat, fruit, and dairy farmers. 1 take it that that is an open declaration on behalf of the Government, and, if so, it is one with which I am quite in agreement. I am pleased to note that the Government not only propose to do something for the wheat-farmers, but also to help the soft fruit-growers and dairymen. There is no doubt that both these latter industries are deserving of every help m the handling and marketing of the produce that the Government is able to give. are voting against the Government? my constituents if I did not vote as my jonscience directs. Eveni f the Government offered to do anything in return for ny vote for thc wireless agreement I would not give it. I am not going to reI flect on the Government, our friends opposite, or any individual. I shall not indulge in any way in recriminations such as we have heard during the lastfew days, but will confine myself to my immediate subject. I ask the indulgence of the House, because, as I say, it is a very dry subject, on which, possibly, some honourable members are fully informed, but on the other hand, I may be able to give them some interesting facts. During the present year we have had three separate Pools in the various States. W« have had a voluntary Pooli n Victoria with a State guarantee, a voluntary Pooli n South Australia and New South Wales undur a Federal Government guarantee, and a compulsory Pool iu Western Australia under a State guarantee. We are asking that the pooling system shall be continued, in every State. clean up the old Pools? to give the House and the country some information, and I shall deal with the old Pools, the South African contract, and other subjects presently. The wheat-growers in each State, through their representatives and organizations, have made a definite pronouncement in favour of a continuance of the voluntary Pool, going right away from the old compulsory system. We made an effort fairly"" early last year to get Pools established, but it was some considerable time before they were got going. In Victoria, the Pool was in operation before that in New South Wales or South Australia, with the result that these latter States were severely handicapped. We desire an early pronouncement from the Government as to what they propose to do.

I am not attacking the Government, but simply desire to put forward a proposition. The farmers of this country are represented by tbe Federal Farmers Organization, which consists of the organized farmers of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia. We recently met in conference at Adelaide, and adopted certain resolutions which I desire to place on record as follow :1. This conference affirms the desirability of continuing thc pooling of wheat under the voluntary system. 2. I s in favour of a committee who shall act as trustees to control the Pool in each State being elected by the growers interested. The number constituting such committee and method of their appointment to be a matter for each individual State. 3. That whilst the trustees shall have the right to appoint their own receiving and handling agents, we strongly recommend that as far as possible all genuine co-operative companies be employed to do the work. 4. We allirm the desirability of effecting selltime. ing and chartering arrangements in London which w ill eliminate competition between thc various State Pools. 5. That such selling and chartering board at thc London end consist of four, and not more than live, one of whom shall be the representative of the Australian Producers Co-operative Federation, thc other members of such board to be the nominees of tlie Pool Committees within each State. 6. Local sales to be controlled by and on account of each State Committee. 7. A i l sales overseas or otherwise to be on account of each individual State. Time is pressing, and the weeks go by.

The following figures deal w it h the intake and out-turn of the seasons 1915-16 to 1920-21 of Victorian Pools. In the year 1919-20 there was a drought and the crop was very small. Over the five pools we gained 1,343,832 bushels. On account of the mouse and weevil plagues there was a loss of 1,245,836 bushels on the 1916-17 Pool, which I tbink could hardly have been prevented in the circumstances, but there was a net gain over the whole six years of 97,996. bushels.

"" through the medium of the Pool the Victorian growers will probably have returned to them about £2,000,000 more than they would have received if their wheat had been sold in the open market without the. aid of the Pool, the consumer has not been asked to pay more than he probably would have had to pay had there been no Pool. O'f the total wheat harvest of Victoria, 75 per cent, went overseas, so that of the gain of £5,000,000, about £1,500,000 oame from overseas. Honourable members may think that the local consumer had to pay too much for his wheat. But whilst in the early part of the year the price of wheat would have been low, as soon as the grain I mention this passed into the possession of the speculators, and the market advanced, the local consumer would not have received his wheat any chearjer than he did receive it through the Pool, if , indeed, he would have received it as cheaply. On this subject there has been a good deal of press I s Government assistcontroversy, and honourable members w ill realize how very difficult it is for a man I shall come to that. The occupying, as I do, the position of trustee for the time of the growers whom I represent, to give balance-sheets and statements from time to time. The Victorian Wheat-growers Corporation has been told that it was charging the local consumer a higher price than was justified. I have never tried publicly to exonerate the Corporation, but the members of it have always felt that we could establish a good case for the price we fixed. Until recently we kept the price for local consumption as near as possible to London parity, but the time arrived when, for certain reasons, we had to raise the local price above London parity. I shall state those reasons directly, and ask honourable members to pass judgment as to whether or not we were justified in the course we followed. Local consumption in Victoria requires approximately 9,000,000 bushels per annum. Purchases from the corporation to the 30th June of this year amounted to 5,695,700 bushels. Millers are holding in stock on account of the I shall deal w i th that corporation, under contract to purchase, up to the 15th December, 1922, a further quantity amounting to 3,334,000 bushels.

Under the voluntary pooling system millers and others were free to purchase all the wheat they could get in open competition with the voluntary Pool in every State where such a Pool exists. Millers have been absolutely free to purchase any quantities on thc open market. are not known to the corporation; but, if the Statist's estimate of the harvest was correct, the maximum quantity that the millers could have received on the open market was 4,475,000 bushels. ing to the figures emanating from the Millowners' Association, which appeared in the press recently, the millers must have purchased not less than 6,000,000 bushels. If that estimate is correct, they must be holding a considerable portion at present. Thef u ll quantities nominated by country millers at the commencement of the season, and, in some cases, increased later, have been retained by the corporation and purchased from time to time as approved by the contract. When stocks held by the corporation were* approaching a low level, metropolitan millers were informed, and given an opportunity to consider the position, aud of purchasing, at the current price, whatever further stocks they required. consideration, amounting to four weeks, the corporation refrained from chartering and of making any further f.o.b. sales, so that the stocks available should not be depleted. able member mean by the nominations of the millers? ment with the country millers. The contraot provided that they could purchase on the open market as much as they required. And, if they decided to take a certain quantity from the Pool, they could do so on the understanding that whatever quantity a miller took would have to be paid for at the end of three four-monthly periods starting on the 15th April, the second payment on the 15th August, and the last payment on the 15th December. Por instance, a miller would negotiate for the corporation to supply him with 90,000 bags. He is supposed to use, during the first of the three four-monthly periods, 30,0^0 bags. During that term, whatever he uses has to be paid for from week to week as he uses it. But, in the event of his not using up the whole by the end of that four-monthly period, he must pay for the quota remaining on the basis of the market price ruling at that date. Another important factor to be considered by the corporation was that the The quantities so purchased ci""op prospects covering large areas in many parts of Victoria and New South Wales were anything but promising. In sufficient rains had fallen in Victoria, and what was practically a drought Accordexisted in the western part of New South Wales and the wheat areas of Queensland. It has been only during the last three weeks that the fear of drought conditions has been removed. I want to explain now why the local price was slightly above parity, and I wish to offer a justification for that condition. While these negotiations were in progress, it was not known what stocks were held by millers or merchants, and it was thought that there might not even be sufficient for local requirements. Profitable business was lost to the corporation during this period. The purchase by metropolitan millers meant, of course, that they had to take the risk of market fluctuations. And, naturally, they deDuring this period of sired the corporation to hold stocks available for them to buy as they required them. But this meant that the risk of the market would fall entirely on the farmers, together with delay in realization, interest charges, and storage and carrying costs. Various conferences took place between the millers and the corporation. The necessity of conserving stocks for local consumption was fully placed before them, especially in view of the expressed intention of certain mills to continue export business whenever obtainable. The millers were informed that as soon as the Government were satisfied that local supplies would be safeguarded the corporation would review the position. That has now been done. The corporation was afraid when it found that its stocks had got low, that if the market price was reduced to enable millers to do profitable export business at a certain time, those millers would continue their export business, with the result that our local consumers would be left high and dry. I suppose that in that",58,Smith Th E Arbitrator S Those Of The Company

329,Mr Hill,"We entered into an agreeevent wo would have been taxed with leaving the country without the necessary supplies of flour. We protected the consumers by holding up several million bushels in the first instance; and now, since the millers have bought portions of those supplies, we are down, to an amount, which can be exported in the shape of flour or wheat, totalling 1,300,000 bushels. But we have not been satisfied that the stocks which the millers said they held were really held. We have been strongly of opinion that the amount of wheat which they said they held was not in the countiy, and we informed the Premier of Victoria of our views upon that matter. We told Mr Lawson that we were willing to reduce the price for local consumption to about parity at the earliest possible moment at which he could get a guarantee from the millers that they would not over-export, and leave us short for home consumption. taking a census, and he subsequently informed the corporation that he was satisfied that sufficient wheat would be retained for local consumption, and that, in fact, the millers had guaranteed accordingly. We received that notification on Monday afternoon last, and at 10 o'clock on Tuesday morning the price of wheat was reduced 3d. per bushel. That is our justification for keeping the market for a short period above what could have been said to have been reasonable world parity. While our price is 5s. Sd., the price in New South Wales is 5s. 9d., .and in South Australia also 5s. 9d. a bushel. I would point out, further, that, if there had not been any Pool, and if other interests had been holding the stocks of wheat which we hold to-da,y, the local price, in all probability, would have been well up to 6s. per bushel.

It soon became evident, however, that the South Africans had a claim which it might be hard to enforce in a Court, although on the moral side it was un< doubtedly strong. The delegation had several interviews w i th members of the Board, and the Board realized that, by reason of the fact that much misconception existed in SouthA f r i c a as to the nature of the goods merchants there were to receive, the Australian Wheat Board had been most materially assisted in the marketing of goods, in disposing of which they would otherwise have had difficulty. Aa a matter of f a i r dealing, the Board felt that it had no option but to make some allowance to the SouthA f r i c an merchants, which, while only to a small extent recouping them for their losses, would still leave the Board an excellent return on the wheat it had disposed of. direct. e moral claim made by the South Africans is best indicated by the fact that the Western Australian members of the Board, from whicli State none of the flour complained of had been shipped, feeling that the Board had benefited ""by the misconception of South African merchants, agreed that a recompense from funds, which would have to be partially met from Western Australia, was the only equitable way of dealing w it h the matter. The total claims made amounted . to £518,000, and the amount agreed to be paid was £115,000, of which the Commonwealth Government ihas accepted the responsibility for £32,500. The Australian Wheat Board will also finance this claim to the extent of £30,000, the Victorian Commission to the extent of £26,250, and the South Australian Wheat Harvest Board to the same extent, making a total of £115,000. I wish to make it clear that the amount paid by the Australian Wheat Board, the Commonwealth Government, and the two States concerned was in respect of flour only, and in no way concerned wheat, although lit w ill be found by honourable rmembers that, in the final settlement, we get a clearance from any claims that might eventually be made in regard to second or third grade wheat exported to South Africa. An honourable member, when dealing last week w i th the quantity of second-grade wheat exported to SouthA f r i c a , said we were not justified in sending such wheat out of the country. A t the time we were sending it to Japan and SouthA f r i c a the people of those countries were very glad to get it at almost any price. Having regard to the fact that we had several million bushels of second grade quality for which we could find no market at home, surely we did the right thing in disposing of it in the best market. We sold it to Japan and SouthA f r i c a, but there was no misrepresentation whatever on the part of the Board. We took up the moral ground, however, that the Board might have gained .by a misconception on the part of SouthA f r i c a n buyers on the one hand, and that to some extent we might have gained by misrepresentation on this side, although we do not admit that any misrepresentation took place. If misrepresentation was indulged in by merchants in this country, I can only say that they have suffered bitterly for it , beN o .

One of the metropolitan newspapers in this State has been ungenerous enough to assert that the officers of the Board, or the Board itself, have been holding up the finalization of the Pool so as to maintain their present positions. In reply, I would point out that at the present time the staff of the Australian Wheat Board consists of only three accountants and one lady typist. Our manageT has practically returned to the Treasury, and we have vacated some of our rooms. We axe doing everything possible to expedite the fihalization of the Pools. Accounts covering a large number of shipments have only recently been received from England, and these are now being closely analyzed. Before final distributions can be made, the accounts must be audited, as the States will be responsible for any overpayments. There have been large overT h e explanation I have payments in New South Wales. That is the only State, I believe, in which such a thing has occurred. Another reason why we have been unable to finalize all F r o m my point of view, the Pools is that the Board is defendant in a Court case that is being brought by a Japanese buyer of 1916-17 wheat. The enormity of the business transacted can be seen from the fact that the total realizations for all Pools amounted to over £1SO,000,000, of which 98£ per cent, has been paid away to growers or to meet expenses.

365,Mr Parker Moloney,"There isPerth was the only logical interpretation that could be placed on the utterances of the ex-Postmaster-General last night. Let me take the remarks of other honourable members supporting the Government. The honourable member for Wilmot ( Mr Atkinson) says, "" The thing is wrong from start to finish. We should let the whole thing go."" He is just like a Tasmanian senator, who says that even now the whole agreement should be torn up. I wonder what he would do if he were here. He is free to talk as he likes in the Senate, where he is not responsible for keeping the Government in office. Other honourable gentlemen in this Chamber who aro behind the Government have spoken just as strongly as Senator JohnD . Millen has in another place, but they have resumed their seats with the expression on their lips that they are prepared to accept the assurances of the Government. I have spoken about what the honourable member for Perth said concerning the honourable member for Gippsland, but what is the attitude of the honourable member for Perth himself ? He took the ex-Postmaster-General to task for doing a certain thing, and every one naturally had the right to expect that before he sat down he would declare that he would not follow the road taken by the honourable member for Gippsland, and would show his independence in this Chamber. What did he say? He said, "" I believe that this is one of the shadiest pieces of business ever heard of in this House, but I am not going to vote for the amendment. I do not propose to vote at a l l . "" I prefer the attitude taken up by the honourable member for Gippsland, bad as it is. He said, "" I am much more opposed to this agreement now that I am able to deal with it with an individual mind than I was when I could only deal with it with a composite m in d ; but, nevertheless, I propose to vote against the amendment."" The honourable member for Perth chastised the ex-Postmaster-General for adopting his attitude, and then said, in effect, "" My attitude is that I propose to run away from the. thing altogether."" Of the two attitudes, both of which are contemptible, I prefer that of the man who stands up and votes. orable member must not apply the word Government owed the duty to the House"" contemptible "" to any member of this and the country, not only to tell us all House. applying the term to an attitude. It is Those representatives of the Government well that the statements of honourable members on the Government side should be exposed for what they are. I conclude by referring to the honourable member for Balaclava ( MrW a t t ) . That honourable member for a little while left honourable members in some doubt as to how he would vote, but I think I know how the honourable member would like to vote. Honourable members opposite have no misgivings about the result, and it was, I think, the Ministerf o r Works and Railways( Mr Richard Poster) who boasted that the Government had the numbers, so we may take it that he knew the honourable member for Balaclava was "" in the bag."" That honourable member, however, said that if he were in the Ministry he would have no hesitation in saying that the contract should not be accepted. If there is one man more than another in this House who claims to be independent, it is the honourable member for Balaclava, and he declares that if he were in the Ministry, when, of course, he could only use his composite mind, he would have no hesitation in declaring that the contract should be torn up. He added, however, that he* was prepared to accept the assurance given by the Prime Minister, though if there is one man who should not be prepared to do so it is the honourable member himself. In this, the honourable member for Balaclava has absolutely passed the limit . I should like to refer to one* statement that was made by the honourable member for Nepean( Mr Bowden), who said that if this trouble in regard to Sir Thomas Hughes had not arisen, thc agreement would have been at once accepted by the House. The honourable member expressed that opinion with assurance; but he must know that honourable members on this side of the ifouse, at all events, never at any stage approved of the agreement. It is remarkable how that, honourable member could "" strain at a gnat and swallow a camel."" He made a mouthful about the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes, but said not a word, or The about the agreement, but also who were I was the representatives of the Government.",63,Smith Th E Arbitrator S Those Of The Company

What have the Government got to say about that appointment? Bad as the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes is, the appointment of Mr Allard is infinitely worse, yet we hear not a word about the latter from either the Prime Minister or the Minister for Defence.

This business has created more public comment, and greater feeling in tlie publio mind, than any I have known of for a considerable time, and for that reason alone the Prime Minister ought to be candid w it h the country. The honourable member for Nepean can see nothing wrong with the agreement, except the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes, but, right from the beginning, what does the agreement purport to do't The agreement provides that the Commonwealth should forthwith, after the expiration of one month from the date of the agreement, apply for, and the company shall allot to the Commonwealth 500,001 shares, for which the Commonwealtli shall pay on allotment the suni of 2s. per share. That means a payment of £50,000, and then on the 1st J u ly this year the Oommonwealth had to pay 6s. per share. This means that at a time when the company is returning nothing and all the expenses are being met, the Commonwealth has to put up its money while the other parties are not called upon to pay a brass farthing. . according to the agreement. Thus the Commonwealth will be providing money to give a great return to individuals who are asked to contribute very little on their part. Commonwealth gets the worse of the deal; yet we are told that there is nothing wrong about the agreement, except the appointment of one gentleman. One aspect of the case was overlooked until the honourable member for Moreton (Mi"". Wienholt) called attention to it . Several honourable members, including the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr. Maxwell) said that if we accepted the amendment it would not lead us anywhere, because the agreement had been signed, and the result would involve litigation. I am inclined to. think that that honourable member did not closely examine the amendment. point out that the amendment applies to clause 12. clause provides: The company shall within six months after the date of this agreement or within such extended time as the representatives of the Commonwealth on the Board may approve enter into an agreement providing for the erection and operation of the stations mentioned in paragraphs / and g of clause 5 of this agreement. The agreement shall contain guarantees of such a nature nnd to such an amount as are approved by the Commonwealth representatives on the Board of Directors for the provision of a direct commercial wireless service between Australia and the stations in the TJnited Kingdom and Canada. That refers to the agreement to be entered into in order to give an effective service. If this amendment is carried it w ill , according to my reading, give Parliament a voice in approving or rejecting the agreement yet to be entered into between the representatives of the Government and the company. to the agreement to be entered into between the company and some constructional company that is to erect the high power station. well.

PARKER MOLONEY The honourable member said that as the agreement has been signed we shall only -involve the Commonwealth in litigation if we try to upset it ; therefore, it is better to accept it as it is. member for Perth( Mr Fowler) described the agreement as criminal, and I suppose that it is fitting that the honourable member for Eawkner, who has a professional reputation as a defender of criminals, should declare himself a staunch defender of it. I think the descriptions given by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Fowler) and the honourable member for Echuca( MrH ill ) are appropriate. I could not describe the agreement better, and if honourable members opposite believe what they say-that the agreement is ""fishy,"" and one of the worse transactions that has ever come before the HouseI hope that they will stand up to their opinions and vote for the amendment. This is the fourth week that the House has been in session, and nothing has been After reading the Governor General's SpeechI was very anxious that the Government should proceed as soon as possible with business in order that some of the legislation mentioned therein might be put into operation before the next election. Most honourable members have said The or inferred that the final session of a Partioneering, and I thought it would be just as well to place the proposals mentioned in the Speech on the statute-book so that I did. they could not be used as election cries.

As a member of the Committee appointed It is remarkable that to inquire into the agi'eement, I do not desire to give a silent vote.

405,Mr Hunter (Maranoa) [10.38],"approval or otherwise of the agreement should be l e f t i u the hands of the Wireless Committee. Any honourable member perusing Hansard will see that I voted for the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton). I believed that the matter of a wireless agreement should be referred to a Committee, and that the Committee should report it back to the House. I , therefore, supported the honourable gentleman's amendment. next motion submitted was that proposed by the Prime Minister, and upon that motion the Wireless Committee was appointed. That was the position I took up. I was absolutely against anything in the shape of a hybrid company. I even went so far as to say that I was against having anything to do with any private company in the way proposed. In my view it does not matter what protection is sought by having two or three representatives of the Government on the Board of Directors of such a company. We might have five or six representatives of the Government, and there would still be no safeguard. Any one who knows anything about company law must be aware that directors are expected to have a monetary interest in the company of which they are given control. In addition to a director's fee they get a return from the company, if its operations are prosperous, in the shape of dividends. But representatives appointed by the Government upon the directorate of a company like this have no monetary interest or are supposed to have no monetary interest in the company. They have only their director's fee to recompense them for the time they spend on the Board, and in the circumstances they cannot be expected to neglect their own businesses for the purpose of considering the business of the company to which they are aj>pointed as directors. why I am totally against having anything to do with these hybrid companies. The fact still remains that this House has approved of the agreement, and we cannot get away from that. debate which has taken place during the last three days should have taken place last year. We know that the House rose on the 10th December last, but most of us thought that it would not rise u n t i l the 16th. hurry to get away, and another week's sittings would have made l it t l e difference to. honourable members. I live furthe r from the Seat of Government than do most members of this House, and I was naturally anxious to get back to my home. But what was a week .extra when, by continuing to sit for that time, we might have given this matter proper consideration last year. I have learned two things from my experience as a member of the Wireless The Committee. It has confirmed me in my view as to the necessity of submitting matters of this kind to a Committee. The responsibility should not be placed upon I voted against that motion. this House to come to a decision upon such matters without ample time for consideration. It is absolutely necessary that Committees should be appointed to go thoroughly into proposals of this character, and bring back to this House the conclusions to which they have come, and the evidence upon which those conclusions are based. If that course is adopted, the House can properly consider the subject in question and will be in a position, to cast an intelligent vote upon it . I am sure that a majorit y of honourable members w ill admit that when this proposal was first brought uuder the notice of the House most of them were absolutely ignorant of everythingconnected with wireless telegraphy. I certainly knew nothing of the subject. We know, too, that every agreement requires very caref u l consideration. A Committee is required, i u dealing w i th matters of this kind, to obtain information which honourable members, busy as they are, are unable to obtain for themselves. I might say, in language which may be used outside, but which probably would not be allowed here, that much of the talk we have heard during the last three days, has been so much "" tripe."" sir. I will say that it has been irrelevant. It has not been to the point. Many honourable members have spoken as if the All the amendment moved by the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) was submitted for the purpose of rejecting the agreement. They have spoken as if the agreement was being weighed in the balance in this House now. But under There was no very 'urgent the powers given to the Wireless Committee, if they had recommended the",67,Parker Moloney The N It

AlthoughI was against anything of the sort, I still say that the agreement is a good agreement. member of this House has said that it is loosely drawn up, but the only looseness in connection with the matter was the looseness, carelessness, and abandon with which the honourable member exercised his vote on the 9 th December last. honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr lesson which we ought not to forget. The Watt) criticised the manner in which the Wireless Committee conducted its proceedings. He said that there were no minutes and that the evidence was not brought before the House in proper form. members that the Wireless Committee was not bound even to keep the notes which have been presented to the House. The reference to it was so broad that it could do exactly as it liked. That again shows the carelessness with which the motion was voted upon last year. It is useless to try and throw blame on the Wireless Committee. The only persons responsible in this matter, if there is anything wrong, are those who voted for the motion to which I have referred on the 9th December last. I do not intend to go into the details of the agreement, because to do so would be to repeat what other honourable members have said; but I will say that, in my opinion, the Commonwealth is absolutely protected. clause of the agreement which has been mentioned so many times, and which is particularly referred to in the amendment now under consideration. tected also because of ordinary business considerations. Any one who has money at stake in a business concern will do all that is possible to insure that the business shall be carried on at a profit. The men engaged in this business can be trusted to do their best to make it a paying concern, and the Commonwealth being concerned in the business, much as I regret it, will share in its profits. Many things might be said in support of the agreement from the point of view of the company. for the company. Mr Hunter. be said from the point of view of outside investors is that they would be fools to permit the Commonwealth to be.represen ted by a majority of the board of directors when its representatives might be appointed by any Government, and One amateur legal might be men without business or technical experience. Private investors would be fools to risk their money in a business concern controlled by men without business experience. Though the debate which has taken place may be regarded The as futile, it should have for us a amendment submitted by the honourable member for Batman reads. . . . the agreement mentioned in, clause 12 of the contract . . . . should before acceptance by the Commonwealth representaLet me tell honourable tives on the board of directors be agreed to by this House. Many opinions have been expressed, but my opinion, which I think would be supported by any lawyer who went into the matter, is that that amendment represents a direct interference with the contract. The clause which it is proposed to amend readsThe agreement shall contain guarantees of such a nature and to such an amount as are approved by the Commonwealth representatives on the board of directors for the provision of a direct commercial wireless service The amendment would have the effect of altering the clause to read, "" As approved by the Commonwealth Parliament,"" instead of, ""As approved by the Commonwealth representatives on the It is protected under the board of directors."" in putting that in. involve an alteration of the contract. Any contract signed and sealed should be held in the eyes of all men of honour as a sacred thing, like the word of a gentleman. It should not be subjected to any attempt to change it . It is well, of course, that all honorahle members are not possessed of the same opinions; but I assert that any member who votes for the amendment will vote for the alteration of the contract and for having the Commonwealth posted before all the world as a defaulter.

Are they such that the arbijected agreements, after having' been considered by any Committee-eve n though composed of representatives from this Chamber-shoul d be ratified by Parliament itself. I am sorry that the honourable member for Batman has moved his amendment, for, if it were carried, it would have the effect of causing Australia to be pilloried as a defaulter, as a country which pays no respect to the sacred terms of a signed and sealed contract. I had hoped that the Government would see their way clear to extend the ordinary courtesy of providing a reply when the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Lambert) sought certain information in the public interest, namely, who were the persons whose names were submitted along with that of Sir Thomas Hughes for the consideration of the arbitrator, Mr Consett Stephen. can be no valid reason why this information* should be withheld; yet it has been refused. In adopting such a course of action, the Government are not merely flouting the honourable member for West Sydney; they are ignoring the publio. The Government are merely the custodians of the people's rights. The people are entitled to know all that goes on. There is no war now. There is no reason why, when information is sought, it should not be furnished, particularly as practically every honourable member behind the Government has described the Wireless Agreement as fishy, corrupt, rotten, criminal, and altogether unscrupulous. I have read many of the volumes of Hansard produced during the history of the Federal Parliament, but I have failed to find anything approaching the weight of denunciation which has issued from, the supporters of the Government on the present occasion. So long as th* Government refuse to divulge the particulars sought for, members will be lacking in their duty if they allow Ministers to cross a "" t "" or dot an ""i."" for eliciting the necessary particulars.

Who was nominated ? Were they suitable persons ? The Government should, answer. I direct attention to the persistent rumour that four nominees were mentioned for the consideration of the arbitrator, and that three of them were men who were so unsuitable, whoi knew so little about wireless, that the only . nominee left for the arbitrator to deal with was Sir Thomas Hughes, the former chairman of Amalgamated Wireless. This debate has proceeded for several days, and has been afforded wide publicity. During that .period the Govern-, There ment should have invited a report from the arbitrator, so that honourable members and the pubilc might not form erroneous ideas of Mr Consett Stephen, and of the part he has played in this altogether doubtful business. However, it is only to be expected that the Government would do what they have done; for this is the culmination of a long series of blunders perpetrated by blunderers and incompetents. The Government have done things, and survived, which would have brought about the sudden death of any other Government. Only the fact of their possession of a servile majority has saved them.

424,Mr Charlton,"I could understand theappeared in the press, that the old company entered into an agreement with another company to install the necessary plant for £2S4,000. By having a majority on the Board of Directors, the old company will turn the agreement over to the new company at the price of £600,000, and thus rake off over £300,000 for itself. stances, as the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) said, the company will consent to an amendment of the agreement. about honourable members on this side the Government take action straight away, even going so far as to expel honourable members ou the uncorroborated newspaper statements, but where individuals outside are concerned, as in this case, the matter is treated in quite a different light. What a magnificent idea the honourable member .for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) has of his duty in this Parliament as the custodian of the people's purse! He says that the agreement is right. He is willing that the Government should find half-amillion sterling, and hand the control of the company over to private enterprise. Why not let private enterprise undertake all the functions of Government, and even come into this Parliament? Under the agreement, we are asked to hand over the control of wireless telegraphy in Australia to these people, and give them a Government monopoly. Is that right not worth anything in the future? The honourable member for Maranoa, who now says it is right to hand over the control to private enterprise, has somersaulted on the vote that he gave on the 9th December, when he favoured referring the matter to a Parliamentary Committee. There has also been a somersault by the Government themselves, because in one week they want to get rid of all socialistic enterprises, and in the next week they subquestion in which he is financially insidize a company pound for pound, and give it a monopoly of a big publio utility. Honourable members on the other side of the chamber say that we cannot get out of the agreement. If we cannot, then let us get rid of the Government who axe responsible for the agreement. Are we to continue to keep in office this Government, and to bo treated to more of these things ? I would ask the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Maxwell), whether, if he were putting £5^0,000 of his own money into this concern, he would agree to what has happened? His well-knownScotch caution would lead him to say that, if he were paying an equal share, and giving away a monopoly of his business, No doubt in these circumhe would expect a controlling voice. AndI say unhesitatingly that one should be more careful with the people's money than with his own. Parliament When Tumours are circulated has been delegated the duty of looking after the interests of the people, and honourable members should faithfully discharge that trust, because the people cannot do anything to protect themselves in cases such as this. Honourable members on this side have taken exception not only to Sir Thomas Hughes, whose appointment is only the effect of other happenings, but exception is also taken to Mr Allard. The Government can remove Mr Allard, if they so desire. The senses of honourable member's opposite seem to have been dulled since last night. They were shocked when the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) stated that Mr Allard was chairman of directors of Beard, Watson, and Company, and the honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Pratten) indignantly denied the allegation. He has since admitted that the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Anstey) was correct in his statement. If it is right for a man to hold shares in a company that is a shareholder in the new company, and accept a position as director, on the Board, why does the Treasurer ( Mr Bruce) make it plain that he has resigned from his position in the firm of Paterson, Laing, and Bruce, with which he was connected? Wasi t not in order to maintain the purity of public life? There is a well established principle, as old as Parliament itself, that a man shall not vote as a custodian of the public funds on a terested. And yet we find that some members of the board are to deal with half-a-million of public money in respect, of matte'rs in which either they ""themselves or their partners are interested. They are asked to serve two masters. They are to serve the Government or themselves and their partners. That they cannot do, and give justice to the people of Australia whose interests they are supposed to represent, and, unfortunately, the people of Australia are to suffer. The Opposition wish to know whether the Government intend to remove Mr Allard from the board, or whether they propose to allow this scandal to continue. Under paragraph v. of clause 3 of the agreement the Government have ample power to remove Mr Allard from the board of directors, and we want to know why they do not propose to do so."" It is provided in th© paragraph in question thatThe directors nominated by and representing the Oommonwealth shall need no other qualification, and shall not be subject to any disqualification or to removal by thc company, and shall not be subject to periodical retirement, but shall hold office subject to the pleasure of the Commonwealth, which may from time to time retire them and make new appointments. It will thus be seen that the Commonwealth Government have power to remove Mr Allard, or any of their representatives on the Board at any time they please. They have not power, however, to remove Sir Thomas Hughes. may go to law in the effort to do so, -but their attitude in connection with the Kidman-Mayoh shipping contract suggests that they are not very brave where litigation is concerned. The same conclusion may he drawn from their action in connection with the payment of compensation for inferior flour sent to South Africa. There again we have another scandal with which this House must deal if the interests of the taxpayers are to be protected. . We shall give these matters the fullest publicity. We shall see that the publio are made aware of all the facts, so that they may be in a position to determine whether the Government should continue to have their confidence. Thomas Hughes is likely to retire as a result of this debate? he will. There are supporters of the Government who have urged that we should repudiate the agreement. That, in my opinion, would be neither wise nor honourable. There should be no talk of repudiation. If some one has to suffer, let it be the Government. They are the responsible parties, and should carry the opprobrium, attaching to the execution of the caning which the honourable member the agreement. afraid to accept responsibility for it ? Is it for them to seek to throw the responsibility on the Crown Law officers or the Courts of this country? If the Government attempt to repudiate the agreement, I venture to say that they will find themselves involved in costly litigation, and will be beaten. In refusing to agree to the appointment of Sir Thomas Hughes, they have not a leg to stand on. opinion of another lawyer! to he a lawyer, but even lawyers differ, and often with costly results to their clients. There is no excuse for attemptiug to repudiate the agreement. If it was badly drawn, then t i e blame should be placed upon the Government. It is upon them alone that the responsibility must rest. If this scheme were proceeded with, and proved a gigantic success, does any one think that the Prime Minister would say that the credit for it belonged to Parliament? Not at all. In such cirThey stances, he would say, "" The credit is wholly mine. AloneI did it . "" But when transactions of a fishy character are brought to light, he tries to shelter himself behind either a Parliamentary Committee or the House. He cracks the party whip over the backs of his supporters, and they fall -in behind him like a team of working bullocks. I would remind those honourable members who talk one way and vote another that it is by their votes the people will judge them. They may denounce the agreement, but it is by their votes that their attitude with respect to it will be determined. It is with that object in view that the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has submitted' the amendment. We desire to line up honourable members opposite and to show the people of Australia whether or not they stand for this corruption-for these suspicious transactions, and for what have been described by some of them as "" these criminal acts."" No word has been too severe for some of them to use in condemnation of the agreement, yet wben we proceed to a division on the amendment we shall find them voting again with the Government.

The trouble we have been landed in is the result of the attitude adopted by the supporters of the Government in their desire to accept every ill-digested scheme that the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) chooses to put before the House. The agreement, in the first place, was ill-considered, b u t honourable members sitting behind the Government were almost falling over themselves in their haste to accept it , w i th a result that there is every probability of half-amillion of public money being absolutely squandered. The case for delay is very strong. We have only to consider the opinions of the agreement expressed by honourable members who usually support the Government. One honourable member described the agreement as fishy, another described it as being criminal, another said that it was rotten, another said that it was questionable, another alluded to it as a serious matter, another stigmatized itas being corrupt, still another referred to it as smellful. These are the terms used by honourable members in describing an agreement in which £500,000 of public money is at stake. In view of these serious allegations, and in view of the suspicious circumstances surrounding not only the appointment of the so-called independent chairman, b u t also that of Mr George Mason Allard as one of the directors representing the Commonwealth, while Mr Bartholomew, co-director with Mr George Mason Allard in a big Sydney business concern, is one of the represenThis amendment by the honortatives of the Wireless Amalgamated Limited, the Minister should give me leave to continue my remarks to-morrow, If they do so that I may have the opportunity of placing before honourable members and the country generally other suspicious circumstances that have come under my notice.
