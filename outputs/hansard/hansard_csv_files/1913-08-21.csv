Debate resumed from 20th August (vide That the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed to by this House :MAY IT PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCYWe, the House of Representatives of the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, beg to express our loyalty to our Most Gracious Sovereign, and to thank your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to ParliamentThat the following words be added to the proposed Address :But regret your advisers(1) propose to destroy the beneficial character of our social and industrial laws; (2) indicate no intention of taking such steps as will reduce the high cost of living; and (3) fail to realize the urgent necessity of an immediate revision of the Tariff.

The speeches of the Opposition have evidently the object of preventing the performance of the imwhich is portant business of Parliament for which Does the country is crying out. Those honourable members are giving no consideration to the claims of the taxpayers who bear the cost of elections, and send representatives here to do the work of legislation. When an election is held, let it be on a question regarding which there can be a positive verdict by the electors; let us not have an election which can only be futile. The Government has wisely directed the attention of Parliament to the need for amending the electoral law. No doubt, members on both sides are democratic. We, on this side, are anxious to conform to the principles of democracy, and we therefore conceive it necessary that our laws must be democratic. The Government programme opens with a proposal for the amendment of the electoral law. It is clearly laid down that if the country is to be soundly' governed on democratic principles, the electoral law must be sound and democratic. Honourable members on both sides will agree that a great deal can be done to improve the electoral rolls. Neither of the political parties represented in this Chamber is desirous that tliere shall be any election, the result of which does not represent the will of the majority of the people of the continent; and, tlierefore, no objection will be raised to any revision or preparation of the electoral rolls that, in the event of another contest, would give us clean lists. say that the rolls last used were unclean. able member on this side say that either It is well known are a great number of duplications which It is questhe right to vote: but when we hear of",12,Personal Explanation

This matter is worthy the consideration of the Government, and it is gratifying to see from the Memorandum that the electoral machinery is receiving immediate attention. The honourable member who preceded me said a good deal about the postal voting system being open to objections of various kinds. We all agree that no matter what the electoral system may be some one w ill be found prepared to declare that there are abuses. member is rather illogical in view of his previous remarks. It is a recognised fact that there are always people ready to take advantage of any law from time to time; if it were not so, there would be no necessity for any law. The absent vote, which was in use at the last election, is just as much open to objection as is the postal vote, though in the case of the absent vote there are certain propositions which honourable members on both sides will feel disposed to agree with . Under this absent vote, concessions are given to certain sections of the community, and those concessions could, I think, be very well extended to others. Eor instance, sailors and others whose avocations necessitate their travelling, have the right to record their vote before leaving the country; and this privilege, to which I am sure there can be no objection, might be granted to other classes, thus making our electoral system fair and free to all. It is quite impossible for all the electors throughout the Commonwealth to record their votes on any particular day. Many of our back-country residents are many miles from a polling-booth; and the law might be so amended as to make it possible for them to record their votes at any time when they happen to be in town after the issue of the writ. These people are doing pioneering work, and developing this continent for the benefit of a l l . polling booth. member knows anything about country life, he must recognise that it is impossible for all the members of the family, for instance, to get to the polling-booth on one day, and, further, we must remember the adverse weather conditions that prevailed, especially in the mountainous districts, on the occasion of the last election. Those people may be 40, or even 100, miles away from the nearest polling-booth; and it is absurd to expect them to attend on a particular day under such circumstances as I have indicated. Another class who are placed at a disadvantage by the present conditions are those who conduct hotels on country roads at a very considerable distance from any polling centre. The Licensing Act of Victoria, at any rate, provides very clearly that no hotel shall at any time be lef t under the control of a minor, so that some responsible person must always be in charge. It will readily be seen that iu many instances it is impossible for one person to go to the polling-booth, and reI do not think so. turn in time to enable another to exercise his rights of voting. Then there is the postal vote, to which some reference has been made. A great deal has been said on this subject, not for the purpose of hindering the developing of an Electoral Act to benefit every section of the community, nor with the desire to prevent people going to the poll, b u t in many instances because honourable members did not realize the great disadvantages very many people are subjected to in their avocations.. A t the last election I saw a man being carried on a stretcher from a hospital five days after a serious operation in order to record his vote. It was necessary for him to do so. The honourable member for Bass said last night that it was not known that such people were anxious to vote, b u t it became compulsory for this man I saw to vote. I say it is known that these people are anxious to vote, and they have just as much right to record their votes as others I trust the Government will carry out their intention, as expressed in their announcement to the House, to restore the postal vote to the statute-book, not for the benefit of any section of the community, but in order that every elector shall have his just right of recording a vote.",13,Governor General S Speech Address In Repl Y

15,Mr Bennett,"If the honorabledid our best to give every facility for voting. ber's best was a very poor one. it to honourable members who were here in the last Parliament, and witnessed the efforts of the then Government to curtail the electoral system of Australia, to the advantage of some and the detriment cf others, to say whether honourable members opposite did their best. that if a man was away from home he could vote, but if he was sick in a hospitalhe could not. under my view was that of a man who had undergone an operation in a large town, and had to be carried 15 chains to a polling booth. stretcher broke down, and the man ran the risk of his life. A law that compels a man to do this is not democratic, and is not a credit to any Parliament. On the same occasion I saw an aged lady who had been invalided for two years being wheeled half-a-mile in an invalid chair to the polling booth. She said she had been a resident of Australia for seventy years, and that this was the first and only time since she had the right to exercise a vote that she had been denied the opportunity of doing so. Surely that is not a credit to any country. Members opposite must realize that the people of the country have a decided claim. We all recognise that the whole success of the community depends on the development of Australia's agricultural and mining resources. The success of society, or of the government ""of the country, stands upon the development of these, and if the electoral law is not fair to the people engaged in these industries it is no credit to the Parliament. I do not wish to touch all the subjects in the Ministerial announcement; time would not permit me to do so; but there are various items that call for serious consideration. Much has been said by honourable members opposite in reference to arbitration. Every one is agreed that the time for arbitration is well at hand, not only in industrial matters, but in national matters also, and in the course of the next few years we shall amongst the nations whereby it can be brought about. ear to the progress of arbitration, but I [14] have spent all my life in an industry in which I claim that arbitration or the fixing of rates and conditions is absolutely impossible. I refer to the agricultural I leave industry. One of the items to which honourable members of the Opposition raise cousiderable objection seems to be the paragraph dealing with preference. They are of opinion that preference should be given to one section of the community, but I ask those honourable members to be open and frank, and tell us what is behind all this. It is only a pretence to say that they want preference for a certain section of the community, because they have done so and so. The real point is how they are going to enforce this preference, how they are going to follow it up. These honourable members know perfectly well that the natural result of carrying this In the process the preference, and the only method by which it can be effectively carried out, is the establishment of the union label, of which we have heard so much in the past. in your policy. able member is trying to side-track me. I maintain the Prime Minister's manifesto does not lay down that preference is to be given to one section of the community over another. We give, if we have the opportunity to do so, freedom of action to every section of the community and preference to none, which is a f a i r proposition. As I have said, the natural result of preference, if carried out in its entirety, which, no doubt, honourable members opposite are aiming at, is to bring into existence the union label, the only method under which complete preference can be given effect to. Everyone knows what that means. Farmers and producers of Australia are just as much awake to this as honourable members opposite, and they know what it means. It means that everything produced by the unionist w ill need to carry a label, and if an article does not bear that label the kindred associations will not carry it . It is that very thing that has driven the producers of to-day, and will drive the producers of to-morrow who are the workers of probably see an arrangement to-day into the most determined opposition to the penalizing of any I do not t u r n a deaf section of the community.

23,Mr Bennett,"No doubt the honorwho life in agriculture, I maintain that it is impossible for any Court or any body of men to lay down the conditions of employment in agricultural pursuits. It is not a question of wages or hours or anything like that; it is a question of doing your work when you can do it . There are times in the season when it is impossible to do any work. Who w ill lay down a fixed rate of wage for harvesting operations in the wheat area? seen the thermometer at 104 degrees at 9 o'clock in the morning, and still at that point at dark. Who could work under those conditions? opposite know perfectly well that no one could. Even if the human being could the animals could not. is impossible fco carry ou under those conditions. It is just the same in the winter. If there is a fal l of snow or bad weather of another kind it may utterly forbid the use of the animals and the men, and, seeing these abnormal conditions will cease to prevail only when those gentlemen who wish to legislate in this direction can control the elements and guarantee an average rainfall, will the producers of Australia be ready to accept the application to their work of the principle of arbitration ? Bil l in the Queensland Parliament regulating the rate of wages in the cane-fields. wheat-growing are two different things. Cane will stand on the field for twelve months, with a depreciation of 15 to 20 per cent, in the cane value, whereas grain will stand on the stalk only until the next storm, so that it is necessary to harvest it when you can. The difference between cane-growing and grain-growing is as great as the difference between the sun and the moon, and the honourable member would have known it long ago had he studied the question. thing made a great deal of by speakers on the other side of the chamber is the question of this bounty. I do not propose to offer an opinion as an expert on this question, but I wish to make a few observations on it , because it affects the locality I have the honour to represent very materially. A great deal has been done during the last few years to re-establish in Victoria the production of beet-sugar. An effort of that kind on behalf of the State Government to estabhas spent the whole of ray lish an industry is a laudable one, and should receive reasonable consideration from every member of the House. member not think it would be better to try to raise reindeer? every probability that Victorian producers will be able to establish the beetsugar industry on a sound financial basis. I have no doubt that, in the course of I have time, when the population of the State is three or four times what it is to-day, the cultivation of the sugar beet will be one of the leading industries of the rich agriHonorable members cultural areas of this State. I believe that this may be made a profitable industry, and certainly no obstacle should be SoI maintain it placed in the way of those who are attempting to establish it . I have no hesitation in admitting that I was one of those who were anxious for the issue of the proclamation repealing the Sugar Bounty Act. I was anxious because the present is the planting season for the beetgrowers of Gippsland. Mr Knibbs, at page 395 of the Commonwealth Year Book, saysDuring ihe past few years an effort has been made to revive the sugar-beet industry in Victoria. Duringi g i o -n ,£5,5,4 was paid as bounty on 1,847 tons of beet, and £2,244 on 7,481 tons during ign-12. It is anticipated that the latter quantity will be increased by at least 75 per cent, during the coming season. With such a prospect before us for the production of an agricultural commodity, I venture to say that honourable members who consider these niatters from a national point of view will offer no opposition to anything calculated to remove restrictions upon that production. The beet-growers of Gippsland are particularly anxious that this matter should be brought under the consideration of Parliament, and I have received a large number of communications on the subject. The Ministry are anxious to assist tlie producers of the Commonwealth, and by so doing they will Another benefit the rural workers and every other section of the community. The greater the area under cultivation, the greater the number of men employed in the agricultural industry, the greater the volume of production, and the better for every section of the comniunity. The development of the beet sugar industry has been arrested by the conditions laid down in the Sugar Bounty Act, and consequently those who desire to see the progress of that industry welcome the repeal of that Act.",15,Governor General S Speech Address In Repl Y

I am personally aware that no fewer than f if t y men, from one cause or another, were incapacitated from earning the minimum wage laid down, and when they applied to the Department for an exemption under the A ct to permit of their employment they never received a reply to their communication. These men lost their work and the wages they might have earned, and the producers lost services for which they were willing to pay. I say that that was an unfair and harsh condition, and I consequently welcome the repeal of the Act and the fact that the matter is now lef t to the control of the State Government, as I hope w ill be the case with all our industrial work. One of the clauses of the censure motion sets out that the Government have failed to It is at present realize the immediate necessity for a revision of the Tariff. Surelyi t is evident from the memorandum submitted by the present Government that it is their intention to make a strenuous effort to secure for the benefit of the community a satisfactory Tariff. They have lost no time in giving effect to the policy which honourable I hope the State Governmembers on this side have all along been advocating. They did not lose a moment in the appointment of the Inter-State Comniission, which the last Government shelved for five or six months. Their action in that inatter should be accepted as a guarantee of their intention to go forward with this great policy. We are all aware that the importations of goods from abroad have been very extensive. This results in lack of employment for our own artisans, and in the exportation of a considerable amount of coin and bullion to meet the cost of the imported goods.

We often hear statements made by , admittedly irresponsible individuals of a wholly improper nature, and which lead to thoughts of disloyalty to our own nation. No Government or party should lend colour to ideas of that description. Another question which requires our serious consideration is that of establishing a uniform railway system throughout Australia. .This requires i m mediate consideration, and it is a pity that it is not one of the subjects for immediate discussion instead of the no-confidence motion with which we are engaged. establishment of a uniform railway system is, in my humble opinion, of the utmost consequence to the well-being of Australia. It is not a question of expense; it is not a question of the number of miles of a certain gauge which one State may have in comparison with another; but it is a question of what gauge will give the greatest efficiency in working for the benefit of the Commonwealth as a whole, bearing in mind not merely what is good for to-day or for to-morrow, but what will redound to the interests of the country in fifty, or perhaps a hundred, years' time.

When they were acting in complete unison the other day, and were chorusing their leader's every statement, they irresistibly reminded me of a boy whistling in the night to keep up his courage. The present position of parties in this House is certainly unique. The amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition makes tliree distinct charges against the Government.

Two days ago the honourable member for Yarra accused the Government of having allowed the Commonwealth revenue to be depleted to the extent of £100,000 or £150,000. Undoubtedly, that charge has been substantiated. This morning we learn from the newspapers that that philanthropic society, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, were the first to indicate the blunder which the Ministry had committed. Act of the late Government. ministration of an incompetent Minister of Trade and Customs. There are not many honourable members upon this side of the House who believed that disaster to the public revenue was likely to be evaded very long, seeing that the Trade and Customs Department was under the control of the honourable member for Darling Downs; but few imagined that such a blunder would be committed so soon in the history of the present Governmenta blunder which has undoubtedly cost Australia anything between £100,000 and £150,000. more. orable member for Darling Downs has asked whether that blunder was not W h a t the honourable the resultof a defective Statute which was passed at the instance of the late Government. I do not admit that it was. But let us view things from the worse possible standpoint, so far as the Labour Ministry are concerned. The Sugar Bounty Abolition Act and the Sugar Excise RepealA c t were proclaimed on the 26th July last. If the Minister of Trade and Customs knew that the revenue of the Commonwealth would be depleted by the proclamation of those Acts, and if he were considerate of the interests which he has sworn to safeguard, he would have delayed bringing those Statutes into operation unti l he had appealed to the Legislature. He knew that Parliament would reassemble on the 12th August. That being so, was there any particular urgency to proclaim the Acts, and thus to sacrifice the revenue? knows that the revenue will not be sacrificed. thing of the kind. If it is not going to be sacrificed, it is because that philanthropic institution, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, has recognised that the Government have made fools of themselves, and deems it its duty to help them out of their difficulty. the game straight. by the Postmaster-General. In effect, he says to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, "" Under the provisions of the Sugar Bounty Abolition A ct and the Sugar Excise RejsealA c t you are entitled to pocket this money; out for goodness' sake give .it back to us, because we are being denounced in Parliament for having committed a great blunder."" Does the Minister of Trade and Customs deny that it was the intention of the Legislature that the Sugar Excise RepealA c t should apply only to sugar upon which bounty had not been paid ? late Government put that in their Bill1 gentleman had held office as Minister of",19,Governor General S Speech Address In Repl Y

Does my honourable friend say that the matter was of such pressing urgency that if there was a defect in the Act he could not wait for a fortnight and give Parliament an opportunity to amend it? Were the interests of the sugar-growing industry going to be sacrificed by the continuance, for a fortnight longer, of conditions that had prevailed in Queensland for the last twelve years ? No ; the position is that the present Government have, in consequence of their blundering maladministration, sacrificed, except for the good grace of the people directly interested in the matter, the revenue of the Commonwealth to the extent of probably £150,000. did not discover the difficulty.

I do not say that there will not arise cases in which it will be satisfactory to both parties to give pairs, but in ordinary circumstances, if we were to give pairs indiscriminately, my honourable friends opposite, when they found themselves hard pressed, would have simply to rely on our good graces to pair up their recalcitrants, and so to remain in office for ever. We are not taking part in a I repudiate nothing. business of that description. The Opposition will give every consideration to the Government so far as the conduct of legitimate business is concerned, but when the Prime Minister throws a policy statement on the table, saying in effect, "" Take this, without any explanation,"" and we find in that printed statement proposals designed to destroy the effective legislation which was passed by our party during the three years that they were in office, he cannot expect any consideration from us. There have been some achievements on the part of the present Government. My distinguished successor, the Postmaster-General, conceived the brilliant idea of carrying farmers' produce, Apparently they themselves such as eggs and butter, by parcels post. He entered upon his duties with all the enthusiasm of a newcomer, but I am inclined to think that by this time he has realized that there are many difficulties to contend with in connection with the Department, and that an enormous increase of expenditure would be involved in so extending country mail services as to make them a convenient means of carrying such produce. There is another proposal with which I am in absolute disagreement, and that is the declared intention of the Government to place the Postal Department under the control of three Commissioners. The Department is, roughly speaking, carried on at a loss It cannot be denied that the of about £500,000 a year, and the obligations which it has to accept in the effort to meet the necessities of the people, are tremendous. Wherever a few people are settled-fro m the Gulf of Carpentaria to Cape Leeuwin-the Department is under an obligation to give those people some sort of communication with I would the larger centres of population. There of the are, consequently, in the outlying districts, many mail services that are run at a very heavy loss.

General, the honourable member invited these people to pay. able member what I did. When we took office the rule in the Department was to call upon the persons served by a mail service to an outlying district to make up any deficit that arose. They were asked to take the revenue from the service, and to make good any deficit. able member for Barrier, as Postmaster General, liberalized that rule, his policy being to establish a required service, to give the residents concerned the revenue from it , and to pay 25 per cent, of the loss incurred. He initiated that system, and when I took office I made the conditions still more liberal. I provided that in the case of these out-back settlements the parties served should be allowed to take the revenue from the service, and that the Department should bear half the loss incurred, and I did the same thing in regard to country telephonic . extensions. to the congested centres ? centres the mail services were al l payable. There is no doubt about the centres paying for the country extensions, and personally I think it is a fair thing. It is because I believe in extending these facilities, whether they are likely to be paying propositions or not, that I am absolutely opposed to a Commission which would be independent of Parliament taking control of the Department, which assists so much in the settlement of this country, and contributes to the peace and happiness of the residents in the more remote parts. As an indication of the tremendous extension that is going on in connection with the Postal Department, I might mention that from the 1st January, 1911, to the 1st January, 1913, 356 new I have already said post-offices were opened, 8,475 miles of telegraphic lines erected, and 98,000 miles of telephone lines constructed.

"" My friends on the Government side have taken up the attitude that they are the particular friends of the farmers, the producers of this country. I do not agree with that view. I do not think there are more than two genuine farmers among the whole of the thirty-seven members on the Government side of the House. The Attorney-General is a farmer from Chancery-lane, and he has nine other lawyers with, him on that side. There are also four or five commission agents, two or three auctioneers, a journalist or two, and a few squatters. The honourable member who preceded me said he was a farmer-ther e were not many people on this side who thought he was one, but we accept his assuranceand I believe there is one other genuine farmer on the Government side. able member for Richmond? ber for Richmond represents a constituency he understands, and he does not take up the attitude that his special mission in life is to look after the interests of the farmers. On the Government side there are ten who farm the farmer in Chancery-lane, and the others deal very considerably in the by-products of the farmer instead of being directly associated with the land. I asked the Attorney-General the other day if he was associated with the Marconi Company. I submitted to the honourable gentleman what I thought to be a very fair series of questions. The Marconi Company had Mr Blackwood goes on to an action against the Commonwealth Government for the right, to inspect, and they were successful by a majority of the High Courti n getting an order to inspect, the'decision of the majority of the High Court being ultimately sustained by the Privy Council through the Privy Council refusing the right to appeal. Now, the Attorney-Generali n that action by the Marconi Company against the Commonwealth was counsel for the Marconi Company, and naturally became cognisant of all the facts the Marconi Company could get against the Commonwealth. This is the position of the Marconi Company, so far as their Australian rights are concerned. They originally intended to set out in opposition to the Telefunken Company, disputing the rights of that company in Australia. When the Commonwealth, as a consequence of the change of Government, and another decision, adopted the Commonwealth system assigned to them by Mr Balsillie, the Marconi Company and Australian Wireless-the company having the Telefunken rights in Australia-amalgamate d their Australian rights in order to fight the Commonwealth. They stopped the contemplated action between themselves, and proceeded as one party to fight the Government. They offered their rights to the Commonwealth for £45,000. I say that, in my judgment, whilst the honourable member for Flinders occupies the position of Attorney-General, he ought not to be associated in any way with a company which directly or indirectly is challenging the position of the Government. It is all very well for my honourable friend to say that he has handed this particular matter over to his colleague, the Minister of External Affairs. I accept the honourable gentleman's assurance on that point, but I want to point out the position in which the honourable gentleman has placed himself in having a general retainer from the Marconi Company, which is in litigation with the Commonwealth. Suppose that the Minister of External Affairs comes down to the Cabinet and recommends a compromise with the Marconi Company to bring about the stoppage of the action between them and the Government, what position will the Attorney-General occupy then?

184,Mr Frazer,"The honourable memis not disposer! to tell me. He told me very politely the other day that I did not understand what a general retainer meant. I think I do. I believe that the honourable gentleman would not be holding a general retainer from the Marconi Company without being paid for it , and, if he is in the employ of the Marconi Company, how is he going to do justice to the interests of the people of Australia in a position such as that which I have described ? In my judgment, the honourable gentleman's position is positively and absolutely untenable. If he is going to retain the position of Attorney-General, he should dissociate himself absolutely from every interest which is likely to clash with the interests of the Commonwealth. may say that I am in very distinguished company in holding this view, and I do not submit the opinion merely as my own. A scandal, involving the British Cabinet, arose only the other day over this same Marconi Company, and Sir Rufus Isaacs Administration, had that Government absolutely tottering in the as a consequence of their association with outside interests. I want to remind the Attorney-General that it was not in the Marconi Company that was dealing with the Imperial Government that the M in isters referred to had their interests, but the Marconi Company formed for the purpose of exploiting the American market. There was no association between that company and the Imperial Government at all. tion of the Attorney-General, what Mr Asquith said in connection with this matterProceeding to challenge some of the standards of Ministerial conduct which had been set up during the controversy, the Prime Minister formulated a code of rules of "" positive obligation."" They were these :Ministers ought not to enter into any transaction whereby their private pecuniary interest may even conceivably come into conflict with their public duty. How does that f it my honourable friend? May not his pecuniary interest in holding a general retainer for the Marconi Company, which is contesting a matter with the Commonwealth Government at the present time, conceivably clash with the interests of the public? My honourable friend has his own code of morals, evidently, and the code of positive obligation set out by Mr Asquith is of no use to him. Mr Asquith went on to sayNo Minister is justified in any circumstances in using official information that is given to him as a Minister for his own private profit or for that of his friends. I say q u it e f r a n k l y t h a t I do not t h in k my honourable f r i e n d w o u l d do t h a t ; b u t there is another r u l e l a i d d o w n . No Minister ought to put himself in a position to be tempted to use his official influence in support of schemes or in furtherance of contracts in regard to which he has an undisclosed private interest.

The honourable member for Echuca cannot get over that. There is, however, still balance another rule laid down which seems to fit my honourable friend the AttorneyGeneralNo Minister ought to accept anv kind of favour from persons who are in negotiation with or seeking to enter into contractual or pecuniary relations with the Government. That hits the Attorney-General where he lives, does it not ? If it does not, all I can say is that the code of morals formulated by Mr Asquith, as a consequence of the indiscretion of members of his GoI propose to read, for the edificavernment which made the Administration totter in the balance, apparently does not appeal to the Attorney-General at all.

The Treasurer' has said that he is going to maintain the present Tariff policy "" as may from time to time be determined by the electors."" That is really the fiscal policy of honourable members opposite. In other words, they say, "" We will do this, but if it does not suit we will alter it . "" We say that, while they remain in power, our social legislation is in danger, and there can be no doubt that it is. It is not long since the present Attorney-General, speaking in this House of the old-age pension system, saidI feel that it is not only repugnant to common sense, but opposed to the best instincts of our people, that we should plant here a tree which will not stop at the growth that it has already got, but which will go on growing if we do not substitute for it something based upon the contributory system. That was his declaration, and it sums up the attitude of the Government. We contend that the old-age and invalid pensions systems are in danger while under their control. able member has crowded this charge into the last five minutes of his speech. Whip, who has remained silent, whether the Attorney-General is a man who is likely to eat his own words? Do honourable members opposite say he was only joking when he made this statement? from his speech stopped short deliberately at one word. If that last word had been given, his statement would have appeared in a different light. member thinks that anything of the kind has occurred in this case, I invite him to read the quotation which I just made. Here is the copy of Hansardi n which it appears. because the honourable member has put it into the last five minutes of his speech. result of the honourable member's association with Oxford; he has developed a suspicious mind. distinctly said, some time ago, that he would not alter the existing pension system. since the Attorney-General is able to justify his association with the Marconi Company, and his acceptance of a seat on the directorate of a bank-sinc e he is able to find the holding of such offices consistent with his occupancy of the Attorney-Generalship-h e will be able to adopt an attitude with regard to old-age pensions that will make him acceptable to his colleagues. I submit, however, that the social legislation of this country is in danger while the present Government remain in office; that they have not submitted any proposal to bring about more reasonable conditions for the people, and that in deciding to place the Tariff under the control of the Inter-State Commission they are simply putting off the consideration of that question. Those who have been associated with Commissions know what such a proposal means. It means an end to Tariff revision for the rest of this session. No serious effort is going to be made by the Government to do anything except to try to destroy the beneficent legislation which was placed upon the statute-book of the Commonwealth by the late Administration. There is no indication of any effort on their part to build up; their policy is to do nothing except to alter the legislation of the previous Government. I wish them luck, but I do not think that they will remain where they are long enough to do so. new member, I rise with a great deal of diffidence, and with the hope that the House will adopt the suggestion made the other day by the large-hearted Whip cf the Opposition when he said, "" Give the new members a show.""

285,Mr Kendell (Corio) [4.58],"As aundoubtedly been of a high order. am not one of those who declare that great abuses of our electoral law took place during the last general election; but I defy any member of the Opposition to say that great abuses might not have taken place without a chance of detecting them. We know quite well that it is not wise to place temptation in the way of any man, and in tlie amendment of the law which the Government propose, they will, I presume, take temptation out of the way of the electors in this respect. proposals mentioned in the Ministerial programme are too ambiguous. Naturally the Government were not able to go into any details, but I presume that, in any measure they submit, they wil l endeavour to improve the electoral law. opinion, the improvement of the electoral law will not be perfect unless it establishes preferential voting and restores the postal vote. The ex-Prime Minister said that one of the grave charges he had to make against the postal vote was that the employers had a great "" p u l l "" on the employees and their wives in mining districts and other places. and their wives, he said, were obliged to vote against the employers, and in connection with the postal vote the employers had a lot of influence. In the same speech, he mentioned that more postal votes were recorded in Kooyong, where there are no miners, and very few employees, than were recorded in the whole of Queensland, where most of the miners and the employees reside. It goes to show that his statement about employers endeavouring to influence electors had no force at all in connection with a large numvise every young fellow who gets the ber of the postal votes recorded in Kooyong. W it h regard to the absent vote, I do not think that one of my honourable friends on the Opposition side will deny that there are possibilities of abuse. I do not intend to traverse the ground which has been covered by various speakers, but to touch only a few questions. In the first place, I want to refer to the rural workers. The minds of various speakers in this debate have been exercised as to the occupations of honourable members sitting on this side. They say that they doubt if there is more than one farmer amongst us. I believe that I have the honour and glory of being that one farmer on this side. A t any rate, I can claim that I am a farmer, 1 though possibly retired at present. The honourable member for Werriwa claims that he is a farmer, and he is just the stamp of man to make a good solid farmer. I can speak with some authority in connection with rural workers. I am not one of those who say that the rura l workers sliould be kept without the pale of some tribunal under which their work and wages may be regulated. I am not one of those who think that the rural workers are the only parties who should be kept outside. But, in my opinion, as It has been stated that the I said before, the Federal Arbitration Court is not the right tribunal to settle industrial matters relating to rural production for the whole of Australia. It seems to me that any sort of Wages Boards or conferences between the In my masters and the men from the various districts would be the best means of settlin g industrial disputes. If you established cast-iron rules regarding the hours of labour, and how the men shall work in rural industries, you would simply deplete those industries and throw hundreds of rural employees out of work. The whole system would recoil upon tlieir own heads. The employees That is where the trouble would come in . A sneering remark has been passed here in regard to share-farming. Now, in Australia to-day there are thousands of farmers who started as share-farmers. As an old rural worker I was able to start as a share-farmer many years before I could have started on my owu account. Many a man has started as a dairyman. An honourable member of this House has. started numbers of young men in dairying on the share system who are successf u l men to-day. I would strongly adchance to start on share-farming, assuming that he gets fair conditions under which to begin. Questions affecting the rural workers, it seems to me, should be settled distinctly between themselves and their employers. Let them confer together. The conditions vary so much in different parts of Australia that they call for varying treatment. I have in my pocket a copy of the rura l workers' log. I have not so much fault to find with the demand as to wages as with the conditions as to the hours of work. As we all know quite well, there are times in the year when a man may have the whole of his harvest hands waiting about the stable or elsewhere unable to do anything on accountof the wet weather. But when the sun. does shine, then they have to ""go for it"" for all they are worth. actively engaged in farming, used to ""go for it,"" for they knew quite well that I would treat them fairly other directions. gard to the present-day unionism is that Labour organizers-I agitators-do orable member says, to rise and become farmers. men to remain members of the union, contributing to its funds. become farmers and employers, they are no longer any good to the Consequently the organizers are trying to get all the men into their and to breed strife. One or two other remarks have been made in this debate which astounded me. It has been stated by more than one honourable member that there have been no strikes as the result of arbitration awards. what is the difference between a strike and refusing to work. Monday's newspaper we read that shearers in a certain shed refused to go on, and cleared out because the boss had arranged to have his wool carted by a motor lorry. tween that act and a strike? is the same to an employer. statement that the Arbitration brought about universal industrial is so much moonshine. pliment the Government, the appointment of the Inter-State mission, but upon its personnel. compliment them on the fact that one of the first duties devolving upon the Commission is to inquire into matters to the Tariff. ment which has been launched against the Government seems to me to be most astounding.

"" innards "" of this thing to discover why they did not revise the Tariff during their term to have it revised at once in the first session of the new Government.

I am of opinion that the Tariff should be revised. There is someorganizers. thing wrong when 4,500,000 people import nearly £70,000,000 worth of goods per organization annum, although there are thousands of persons unemployed. A proper Tariff would enable all those persons to be employed in the manufacture of Australian raw material into finished goods for home conI want to know sumption. The policy that we should pursue should make that possible. I am glad It was only in that the Government intend to work in the harmony with the Governments of the States.

During the past three years, the bench, relations between Commonwealth and State Governments have not been haryears."" monious ; but such a state of affairs is not in the best interests of Australia. The The late Government had three honourable member for Bass last night referred to a farmers society in Tasmania present which he had been asked to join. He is We have only to analyze the a gentleman of such splendid proportions that it might be taken as a personal reflection if I made any reference to the of office, and are so anxious fable of the mountain and the mouse. WhatI wish to point out is that, although he was asked to join this union, Under it our 'jnports have there was no compulsion. No bluestone arguments were used. The committee of the society seemed eminently respectable, most of them adding "" J . P . "" to their names. There is no analogy between a society like that and a trade union. A farmer in Tasmania may or may not join the society as he likes; but the unions seek to compel workmen to join them. I am an old worker, having commenced at the age of ten, and no one has greater sympathy with the workers that I have; but I know that if my friends tie up the workers with too much legislation they w ill chafe under it . already. are. freedom, and should show that they are trusted to a certain extent. trusted to pay their own levies. fair of the honourable member for Darling, in dealing with the receipts and expenditure of the Australian Workers Union, to strike an average for a period of twenty-five years, because in the beginning the Australian Workers Union had few members, and the contribution was, I think, only 5s. a year.

It has been said that the land tax has had the effect of bursting up large estates. Those who introduced it said that it would burst up large estates and provide revenue for defence purposes; but, apparently, it does neither. imposition of the tax and Socialistic legislation generally has frightened people from buying land, so that not so much is changing hands to-day as was changing hands three years ago. did succeed in bursting up large estates, there would be no revenue from it In order to raise revenue for defence purposes, the exemption will have to be lowered-that is inevitable, if the present policy is continued. There is one particular defect in the land tax to which I desire to call attention. For this defect, I do not blame the men who in troduced the measure, because it cannot always be foreseen what is necessary. It was said by the Labour Government that they were going to make it easier and cheaper for young men to get on the land. Under the old conditions of three years ago, it was possible for a young fellow to acquire land with a deposit of 5 petcon t., and it was a common occurrence in the Western District of Victoria to take 10 per cent., but, under the operation of the land tax, 15 per cent, is demanded. worth £5,000 before he pays any tax. of the deposit that is necessary when a young fellow wishes to purchase a farm from a big land-owner. Another regulaare not even tion under the land tax which appears to me to work harshly is that which imI t was rather unposes a fine of 10 per cent, when, by some oversight, a man may be only two days behind in paying the tax. Considering the time that the man is behind, this means in many cases a fine at the rate of some 600 per cent, per annum; and the law should be altered so that the fine shall be at the rate of 10 per cent., with a minimum penalty of halfa-crown or 5s. It is not fair, because of a little omission, for which the taxWherei t goes, I do not payer is uot really responsible, to fine him at the rate of 500 or 600 per cent.

But the position to-day is the same as when the Leader of the Opposition tendered his resignation. Why did he not ask for a dissolution then? If a dissolution is a good thing to-day, it was a good thing at that time; and, under the circumstances, I think it would be wise if I endeavoured to pour a little "" oil on troubled waters."" The Our friends opposite, it seems to me, are suffering a certain amount of disappointment at the reverse they have met; and are now, as it were, "" getting it off their chest.""

The ex-Postmaster-General some reference to statements by Mr Blackwood; but if we on this side were to condemn the whole of the Labour party for statements made by some union president or secretary, it would not be fair to them as a body. Mr Blackwood is presi dent of a certain Employers Federation, but a very small number of the employers of Australia are connected with that association. I know that I am not, and thousands of others are in the same position as myself; and I therefore contend that honourable members on the Government side of the House should not be held responsible for any statements made by a prominent Liberal in any other place. We are here, I take it , to do the best we can in the interests of Australia, and that, I believe, the present Government are desirous of doing; but, so fa r as I have seen during this week, the Opposition are determined not to give them the opportunity.

These matters are not party questions, and that the business of the country could have been proceeded with was the opinion of many outside; but despite that opinion we were doomed to a grievous disappointment. did the House meet than the honourable gentleman at the head of the Government, in placing his memorandum or manifesto on the table, gave us to understand emphatically and distinctly the attitude of the present Administration towards past legislation. It was a declaration of war on the workers of Australia. I am quite willing to admit that the It is l e f t to the brilliant geniuses who honourable member for Corio does not understand the game like those on the Ministerial bench, but they were aware that putting the memorandum on the table was a challenge that members of the Opposition could not ignore. H a d we ignored it , and accepted the invitation of the Government to go on with the business of the country, Ministers would have had their tongues in their cheeks, and gone to Sydney, and said, "" We put a memorandum on the table of the House, and challenged the Opposition, but they took it like whipped curs, and we can walk over them any time we like."" ministration would have done if they had had the opportunity. As I say, I was charitable enough to believe that they would have gone on the lines I have already indicated, considering the state of parties, but that was not their game. Honourable members on the Government side ought to realize that we exist here in consequence of a BritishA c t of Parliament; that we take our life from the Mother Parliament in the Old Land, and that we belong to a people who understand parliamentary government better than their brethren of European civilization. And what has been laid down by the greatest statesman, who has spoken our language? That whenever a measure of reform has been passed the Conservative party cannot repeal it . That principle has been recognised by the Marquis of Salisbury-who , although he was a Conservative, was a statesman, and not a political "" messer ""-and Lord Derby. All the distinguished and able men of the Conservative party and not the "" rag-tag and bobtail "" allowed to act unrestrained in Australia-admi t that reform legislation once passed by the Parliament of England cannot be reversed, but here in Australia we have the new doctrine, that whenever the Conservative party get into power they are to reverse all the legislation passed by their opponents, or, if not all, certain sections of it . I hope the country w i ll speak out in no unmeasured No sooner language against this monstrous innovation. For some time past the tide has run in a certain direction, and reforms have been carried, and now the Conservative party have come in to reverse them. We shall have endless trouble. British statesmen recognised such a course would lead to trouble, and laid down the principle I have indicated. adorn the Treasury bench in the Commonwealth Parliament to-day to lay down this new doctrine and set this pernicious precedent. Whatever the result of this debate may be, I have no doubt that before long the people will condemn it . I think that the Prime Minister must be aware of that. Probably no one knows the feeling of the people of Australia better. He has issued a declaration of war against the working classes of this country, and the man who goes into a job like that with a light heart may be a poli'tician, but he is not a statesman. but merited, I dare say. and the honourable gentleman will get some more of it presently. I wish to say a word or two about the administration of the present Government. I think, in this connection, that our motion of censure was launched a little too soon, because we did not give the Government sufficient time in which to disclose their brilliant administrative abilities. Every day that passes gives only greater proof of their incapacity for the positions which they hold. However, the motion was tabled with my hearty support, and with the support of all my friends on this side, for the reasons I have already given. A leading instance of the adminstration of the present Government occurred only a day or two ago.

I should say that I have not seen, and do not know, what is contained in the Acts passed by the Queensland Parliament. No doubt the Government do know what they contain; but I am given to understand that, in order to preserve the White Australia policy, the Queensland Parliament has provided for an education test. value of this will largely depend upon the officers administering the test, and any' Japanese or other aliens who can pass the test applied will have a perfect right to settle and work in Queensland in the sugar industry.

The people of our Dominion overseas are so strong upon it that they regard the provisions of the measure as necessary to maintain their standard of living."" These British statesmen, no doubt, said, "" It is not desirable that there should be bad blood between us and any of our brethren across the seas.

310,Mr Archibald,"The r e are engigreater part of their lives in trading round the Australian coast. I come now to the Government memorandum. the opening paragraph we are told that the existing electoral law has not been found to work satisfactorily. I do not desire to cover ground that has been traversed by previous speakers, and I shall, therefore, say shortly that I agree with those who have asserted that, in connection with the recent general election, there has been circulated a most infamous slander on the people of Australia. I believe that the rolls, so far as the number of electors enrolled is concerned, are in a very healthy condition; and I am pretty well convinced that there is no foundation for the allegation with regard to duplicate voting. Before my return to this House, there was scarcely an election in South Australia in which I did not act either as a scrutineer or in some other capacity. I , therefore, claim to know as much about the conduct of elections as do honourable members opposite and their supporters outside, who are "" skiting "" all over the country. If the Attorney-General could supply me with the information for which I asked regarding the number of duplications alleged to have taken place in connection with previous elections, making due allowance for the enlarged rolls MrW . H . IBVINE the information, but am told that it is impossible to obtain definite information, because there has never previously been a general scrutiny in respect of the whole Commonwealth. The omcers express the opinion, however, that there is no evidence that the duplication of votes at the last general election was much in excess of the average. plaining because the Attorney-General has failed to supply me with information for which I asked. I was merely leading up to the point that a cruel and infamous libel on the people of Australia had been circulated by those who have alleged that at the last Federal election duplicate voting was largely indulged in , and that there were many cases of impersonation. The statement just made by the Attorney General shows that there is absolutely no proof of the truth of such assertions. Mr W. member will recollect that, when I referred to the matter on a previous occasion, I expressly said that we had no knowledge of whether there was any In duplication whatever. that the honourable member uttered the libel of which I complain. he did, but many others did so. It was not so much honourable members of the Liberal party, or their supporters, as the press who lied all over the country about this matter. The press supporters of the Liberal party were responsible for it . I come now to the question of absent voting. Why is the old system of voting by post so highly valued by members of the Conservative party? They value it , not because of their large-hearted humanity, not because of their solicitude for the sick, or for those living in sparsely-populated districts, but because their advisers -expert s in electioneering-tel l them that it is the easiest method of corruption that could be employed. the absent voting system. member would only apply to this question a little of the common sense that he applies, no doubt, to his own business affairs, he would admit that nothing lends itself I have asked for more readily to corruption than does the postal voting system. I am strongly of opinion that we might wisely go back to the old system of voting by ballot-that we should declare that men and women shall be entitled to vote in the districts in which they reside, and that if they cannot do so they shall not be allowed to vote at all. l t may be said that that would be a very great calamity, but we must all recognise that the purit y of elecI am not comtions is essential, and that those who fought for the introduction of the system of voting by ballot were never in favour of these new-fangled notions. Those who advocated the adoption of the ballot had no idea other than that of secret voting in contradistinction to the old system of open voting. This proposal will cut both ways, because there are just as many electors on one side in politics as on the other who will be unable to vote. Great facilities should be given for the transfer of names u n t i l almost within a day or H. IHVINE -The honourable two of an election. That would get over the difficulty now existing.

I was very anxious to know how my constituents behaved in regard to the Senate candidates, and I found that the record for Hindmarsh is similar to other records. there has been no personation practised in Australia, because I believe that it has been, and always will be, practised to a very slight extent; but I venture to say that no more personation was practised at the last elections than at previous elections. dulged in , because there is a certain number of reckless persons who are prepared to take the risk. system of election, there is nothing, in my opinion, to justify the statements which have been mads. quiry .to be made into the allegations, and in default of an inquiry we had better let the matter drop with an admission from the other side that the electors of Australia are not open to any reflection for the way in which they recorded their votes on the 31st May. The absolute necessity for the no-confidence proposition from this side lies' in the fact that the Prime Minister has stated in a memorandum that the Government in tends to repeal preference to unionists. That is a declaration of war with the workers, and we take it up. Whether the Prime Minister intends to do anything in the matter is a horse of another colour. I am inclined to think that if a big breeze should spring up he will hesitate. He will need a good deal of courage to proceed with his proposal; he will need more courage than I give him credit for possessing. I know it is thought by a great mypart to submit a proposal of that kind, because I consider it is foolhardiness for a public man to throw down the gauntlet to the workers of Australia, and that is what the Prime Minister is doing. Now, what is preference to unionists so far as the Government is concerned ? Ministers have only control of a certain amount of patronage, or, if you It is utprefer the term, employment. The rest is in the control of the Public Service Commissioner, and there, of course, the I have been supplied by the Chief rule of preference to unionists does not come in . It only applies, practically, to apI had pointments made by the Postal Department. The rule is that, other things being equal, preference should be given I was not to unionists. casuals. principle was adopted in our legislation I do not mean to suggest that tice Higgins so ably presides to give, when it was essential for industrial peace, preference to unionists. Repeatedly His Honour has said in Court to a party, "" Y o u do not want preference to unionists; I am not going to give it , "" but he would grant preference if he thought it Personation will always be in was necessary to do so. It is now proposed to withdraw that power from the Judge, who exercises his jurisdiction in As regards the present equity and good conscience. The High Court Judges are never guided by equity and good conscience. W it h them equity I should like an in is out of the question, and it is a matter of what the law says. W it h them, too, good conscience is out of the question, and it is a matter of law. If the exercise of this power did not rest with the A r b i tration Court, but with the union secretaries or the Executive Government, I could understand the proposal of the Government. Has the Conservative party in the Commonwealth sunk so low that it will refuse to allow a Judge of the High Court to deal with industrial trouble and bring about peace? It is proposed to take away the Arbitration Court's power of giving preference when, if exercised, it would often bring about industrial peace. The Ministry are not actuated by any other motive than that of deliberately defying the workers, because preference to unionists is the high-water mark to which trade unionism has risen in the present day.

I come now to another matter of very great importance. The Government, according to the memorandum that the Prime Minister has laid on the table, in tends to put the maternity allowance on a contributory basis. We shall have another opportunity to discuss that proposal, if it ever comes before us in tangible form, which I very much doubt. WhatI wish to refer to now is the honourable gentleman's statement that 90 per cent, of the mothers of Australia do not need the allowance. wrong. When I make a denial of that kind I am in a position to prove what I say, and I shall give proof in this in stance. I asked the last Government, and I ask this Government, to give instructions for the preparation of information to accompany the Budget showing as nearly as possible the social conditions and income of the population. I do not ask for statements of average income based on statistics. If the wealth of Australia is divided by the population, poor fellows getting only 30s. a week are allotted an average income much above that sum. Information obtained in that way is of as little value as information regarding the average weight of adult Australians, which may vary in individual cases fro m 8 to 26 stone. aggregates are taken, is mere humbug. But a great deal of valuable information can be obtained by averaging in groups. If a statement made up in that way were presented with each Budget, we should know what the incomes of Australians are, and how wealth is distributed in this country. I do not wish to know the income of Brown, Jones, or Robinson, or of this or that wealthy man; my concern is not with the incomes of individuals, but with the incomes of groups. We get a certain amount of information of this kind from the publications of the Commonwealth Statistician, and I am going to quote now from Bulletin 8, the monthly summary for August, 1912, which gives, at page 49, a table showing the distribution of incomes in Australia, estimated as for the year ended 30th June, 1911. £200 a year amount to £62,637,896, I shall not say divided among 114,195 persons. Thei n comes above £ 3 0 0 a year amount to £52,126,765 , and are divided among 57,517 persons, a drop of nearly one-half. The incomes above £500 amount to £41,455,747, and are enjoyed by 25,485 persons. The incomes above £750 amount to £35,408,930, and are enjoyed by 15,393 persons. The incomes above £1,000 amount to £30,664,673, and are enjoyed by 9,257 persons. The incomes above £1,500 amount to £25,397,094, and are enjoyed by 5,001 persons, and the incomes above £2,000 amount to £22,053,874, and are enjoyed by 3,536 persons. I have no faul t to find with the Commonwealth Statistician, because I know what difficulty he has in That is entirely obtaining from the States the information that he needs. It would be well if honourable members got the State members whom they know to insist OJ. the preparation and publication of returns of this kind on the same basis, so that they might be accessible to the Commonwealth Government. I have heard that in one case a State Government wanted £ 8 , 0 0 0 from the Commonwealth Government for a return for which it asked, although the information was available. The people of Australia should see that that kind of thing is stopped. The figures which I have read take no account of the incomes on which income tax is not paid, but it is not difficult to ascertain the amount of those incomes. Those who have made a study of these questions arrive at the in The system of averaging, when formation in this way: The average family consists of the breadwinner, his wife, and three children. It is only the head of a household who pays income tax, and only one in nine heads of families have incomes above £200 a year. W ill honourable members say that in all other households the maternity allowance is not needed ? I think that it is. Let us consider the question in another way. There are 311,000 factory workers in the Commonwealth, men, women, and children. They earned £27,500,000 in 1911, which, on the average, meant £ 2 a week for the men, £ 1 ls. a week for the women, and 10s. a week for the youngsters. Of course, some of the male workers would earn £ 3 a week, and some considerably less than £ 2 a week; but where is the 90 per cent, that the Prime Minister tells us do not require a maternity bonus 1 I The total incomes above desire to arrive at the wealth of Australia by another method. I have taken some",45,Wynne W E Could Not Find The British Government More Liberal
320,Mr Archibald,"interest in this study, both in the Old Country and here; and, thanks to the statisticians and economists who have written on the question, it is possible to know exactly the condition of the people of the Old Countryi n groups-thos e who possess colossal wealth and the millions who have not bread for their wives and children. That, however, is of no value to us; we require the same rules and tables applied to Australia as in the Old Country, so that we may know exactly the condition of the working people. One method of arriving at the wealth of the country is to take the value of the deceased estates which come under the review of the various probate omcers; but both we and the public know, of course, that a great number of people leave no estates at all. According to Mr Chiozza Money, if we multiply the deceased estates by thirty we arrive at the value of the property of the l i v in g ; and now let me see if I can prove that. Mr Chiozza Money, in his Riches and Poverty, tells us that from Queen Anne, in 1702, to GeorgeV . , in 1910, a period of 208 years, the Crown has passed eight times, on the average about every twenty-six years. This, it appears, is the fair average for the transfer of estates in Australia as well as in England, but the point is that relating to the value of the deceased estates. According to the Year-Book, No. 6, page 814, the value of the deceased estates in Australia, in 1907, was, in round figures, £20,000,000; in 1908 it was £20,000,000; in 190& it was £22,000,000; in 1910 it was £22,000,000; and in 1911 it was £28,000,000, or a total of £112,000,000, showing an average over the five years of £22,000,000. To this I add £4,000,000 a year, because there is a certain amount of plate, jewellery, furniture, and so forth , whioh always eludes the requirements of the law of probate. £26,000,000, which, multiplied by t h i r t y , gives £780,000,000 as the wealth of Australia in 1911. On page 824. of the Year-Book, No. 2, there are the figures for the previous five years, showing that the value of the deceased estates in 1906 was £18,000,000; in 1905 it was £17,000,000; in 1904 it was £16,000,000; in 1903 it was £19,000,000; and in 1902 it was £16,000,000, or a total of £86,000,000, giving an £17,000,000 per annum. When we again add £4,000,000, and multiply the total by [15] thirty , we have £630,000,000 as the wealth of Australia in 1906, showing an increase in five years of £150,000,000. Honourable members have been asking questions about the rise in prices and the increased cost of living. I have a suspicion, as I believe any intelligent man or woman outside must have, that if the wages have gone up proiits have gone up also; and, as the London press has said, we have had a "" glorious time "" in Australia during the last five years. There are people who howl about the "" bottom dog ""-abou t the working man's increase in wages and his wickedness in adhering to his labour organization and to preference to unionists-bu t the wealth of the crowd to which those people belong has increased by £150,000,000. In the face of facts like this, what is the use of the Prime Minister saying that 90 per cent, of the women of Australia have no need for a maternity bonus 1 I am not one to say that the working section of the Australian people are hard-up or starving, or to talk any rubbish of that k in d ; on the contrary, I have said over and over again that this is the best poor man's country in the world. The only astonishing thing about the worker here is how on earth he can, under any circumstances whatever, get it into his thick head that he ought to vote for a Conservative. A peer of the realm said years ago in the House of Commons that the working man who voted for a Conservative was a fool. Of course, he is. Conservatives are the defenders of vested interests and of privilege, and all that sort of thing. Here we have the Government, in spite of the increased wealth and the present condition of Australia, making this suggestion. I have advocated the cause of my fellow-workers for forty years, and I have never seen any necessity for changing my opinion. I hope that the House This brings the figure to and the country behind it will insist' that the maternity bonus shall not be interfered with. There might be some excuse for doing so if we were a poor country, but we are a wealthy country.. One honourable member preceding me haa asked where the money was coming from,, seeing that the progressive land tax was being whittled away, but I can tell the. honourable member where we can get the revenue for the maternity bonus. In average of doing this, I am not binding my party. I simply speak for myself when I suggest that out of the £150,000,000 £5,000,000, which is the amount now paid in Customs duties on the necessaries of life, and on the necessary clothing of the working people, should be set aside for this purpose. George, Mr Asquith, they will have to pay the tax imposed, and they ought to be prepared to pay it. having to pay double my income tax; the Commissioner would never have any trouble to get it out of me; he would be welcome to it, because the income tax is a genuine and honest tax.

One way is by legislation. And there is another way. There are millionaires in Australia.

Honourable members opposite represent one section of the community, and vote every time as their masters tell them. Some time ago, we had a remarkable announcement in one of the Labour newspapers in Western Australia. It is well known that honourable members opposite are controlled by the Australian Labour Federation. Some three years ago, Mr Minahan, in Sydney, told the Prime Minister of this country that he was a servant of the federation. member's authority for that ? from the Vanguard, a Labour newspaper published in Western Australia.

He must have been reading the War Cry, I think! monwealth BankA c t. Undoubtedly, the Constitution gives this Parliament control over banking other than State banking. But a deliberate attempt was made by honourable members opposite to destroy the State Savings Banks. I do not know whether they realize what the State Savings Bank means to the people of Western Australia. Through our Agricultural Bank, which is financed by the Treasurer of the State, we have been able to give cheap money to the farmers. How is the Treasurer going to finance that bank in the future? He cannot, owing to the competition of the Commonwealth Savings Bank, and to the fact that the Commonwealth has turned the States out of the post-offices. I know several instances in which storekeepers have been appointed to take money for the State Savings Bank; but a good many people who have a £ 5 note to put in the bank do not care to go to Even the farming community a storekeeper for the purpose. W h y did the Commonwealth Government, under the Labour rigime, deliberately t r y to destroy the State Savings Banks? D i d they want money? No ; they had an enormous revenue. They had established a Commonwealth Bank of Issue, and had obtained possession of nine or ten. millions. There was no need to treat the States as they did. But I believe that the object they had in view was to destroy the financial balance of the States, so as to force adopted by the Socialist Government in regard to our transferred properties. A f t e r the abolition of the Braddon section, when the States were receiving 25s. per head from the Commonwealth, how It was well understood that the was it that that Government charged the States 3^ per cent, for money lent, whilst But the they refused to grant them more than 3 per cent, on account of the transferred properties? Was that fair treatment? 1 trust that the present Government will see that the States are paid on account of the transferred properties at the same rate as they are charged for money which I am perfectly well they borrow from the Commonwealth. But that is the way the late Government treated them. It is true that at a subsequent stage, owing to the trouble whicli arose, they W h a t nonsense ! Where raised the rate of interest from 3 to 3£ per cent. I hold that the rate should be the same in both instances, or else the Commonwealth should pay for the transferred properties.

I would have much preferred if the Parliament had granted some money to the States and asked them to establish maternity institutions in which nurses could be trained, and assisted to go into the back country and give the residents that attention which is required at a critical period in their lives. Apart from the fact that from 8,000 to 10,000 women were disfranchised, why were people in the back country disfranchised ? I know many persons who came over 100 miles to vote for me. I have letters from persons pointing out, more especially in the huge district from Carnarvon to Broome, places 50, 60, 80, and 100 miles away from a polling booth. It would be quite easy for people to come into a town between the issue of the w r it and, say, a week prior to the day of polling. exercise the postal vote later than a week before the names of such persons voting oould be crossed off the roll, and they would not have an opportunity to vote again. I hope that the Government will push forward a B ill which will provide for the restoration of the postal vote. It meant in my electorate the disfranchising of a large number of persons, and I certainly object to a special facility being given to one section which is denied to others. I also hope that some system of preferential voting w ill be in troduced. We shall be able shortly to deal with an Electoral B ill , and I hope that honourable members opposite w ill help us to t r y and make the electoral system a good one. In my opinion, the present Act leaves an imperishable stain upon the honour of the Socialistic Government, and all those who helped in placing it upon the statute-book. I am pleased to see that the Government are alive to the necessity of immigration. If we want to doubt about the possibilities of Australia, build up our resources-and there is no It is quite possible -w e must do the best we can to induce people to come to our shores.

It is only a short time ago that I read in the press a speech by the Treasurer of Canada, who said that immigrants were going to the Dominion at the rate of 1,200 a day, and that they had brought in during the last year about £30,000,000 of capital.

I have no time for the Socialistic fads and theories of honourable members opposite, and no belief in the leasehold system for the settlement of the country. I would like the Prime Minister to introduce a LandB ill dealing with the Northern Territory, and would be prepared to give away the land there free, subject to proper conditions to insure settlement, and prevent any one person from having too large an area. I know very little of the resources of the Northern Territory, but I think that, instead of the Minister framing ordinances to deal with mining there, this Parliament should pass mining legislation to enable investors to know what security they have for their expenditure on the development of the mining industry. It is strange that the mining industry, which is the most uncertain df all, should have the most restrictions placed on it .

No man, woman, or child should have special consideration because of membership of any organization or union. I hope that a measure will be introduced as speedily as possible to abolish preference to unionists. We have heard of discrimination against unionists, but the tyranny of unionists on many occasions has been discreditable to the unions. -member can give examples of it ! mine who dared to be a political supporter refused to join a mining union at Cue, and the unionists there told the manager of the mine that, unless he was dismissed, they would strike.

Then the carrier said that he could not continue to cart timber for him, because of his fear of losing other customers. In the same way he was hunted out of a second, and out of a third, place. This is an instance of the tyranny to which I object. Similar tyranny was exercised in Perthi n connection with the tramway strike. Photographs were taken of those who worked, to be put in the "" thieves' gallery "" in the TradesH a l l , as they termed it . The place was well named.

A law should not be obligatory on the employer, and not on the employee. would not compel men to work, but if they refused to work they should not interfere with others who are ready to work. Personally, I am opposed to the Arbitration Court.

Wages Board system, which brings together the employer and the employed, men who thoroughly understand a business from A to Z, and appreciate the difficulties on both sides. bunal is surely better able to make an award than any outside person, no matter how otherwise highly qualified. I am quite in sympathy with the desire of the Government to keep the rural workers out of the Arbitration Court; in fact, I think that in this respect we are overriding the Constitution. such matters, ought to be l e f t to the State Arbitratio n Courts. alone should deal with those subsidiary industries, leaving to the Pederal authority only matters of Inter-State and international concern. If u l l y agree with the defence policy of the Government. all, I think, admit that, as f a r as possible, defence questions should be kept out of party politics; but I must say that, in my opinion, greater consideration should be given to the rifle clubs. Those who advise the Minister of Defence are, apparently, not so much in sympathy with this movement as they ought to be, although the rifle clubs form a magnificent auxiliary to any system of defence. I therefore hope that the Minister of Defence, even if his departmental advisers do not approve, will extend more assistance to the rifle clubs than they have received in the past. cur in the proposals of the Government in regard to their public works policy. Personally, I should like to see public works carried out by contract wherever possible. . Occasion may arise when it will be expedient to use day labour, but, generally speaking, the contract system is the best, and has proved to be of greater profit to the States and the Commonwealth. Further, action should betaken as speedily as possible towards the I do not know formation of a Tender Board, to exerIf cise control over tenders and purchases made by the Crown. Some most extraordinary agreements have been entered into, more especially in regard to what I is known as the powellising process, which, by the way, is known in Western Australia as the "" p a r a l y z in g "" process. As I say, some extraordinary agreementshave been made for the acceptance of offers, involving large sums of money, without calling for tenders; and I am sure that honourable members on both sides will be of the opinion that, with a T believe in the Tender Board, there should be considerable improvement. Uniformity of legislation in regard to trusts and combines is also required, in addition to a good companies law; and I ask the PrimeM in Such a t r i ister to consider the advisability of asking the various States to give the Commonwealth Parliament power, under paragraph 37 of section 51 of the Constitution, to that end, so that we may have one law applying to the whole of Australia. The State Parliaments would, I think, be quite willing to hand over a The control of all power of the kind, but there is great, objection to the desire of honourable memThe States bers opposite to give to the central authority power to nationalize industries. I feel quite sure that the desire of honourable members opposite is not, as they endeavour to make out, to reduce the We high cost of living, because we know very well that if the huge industries contemplated were controlled by the Commonwealth, the cost of production would beincreased, and, necessarily, the cost of subsistence. The real desire of the Opposition is to force people into the unions, so that their politics may be controlled,, and the position of the Labour party made much stronger. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition seems rather amusing, and it has very aptly been described as a sort of boomerang. Undoubtedly the proposal does strike very hardly on honourable memI quite conbers opposite. The amendment declares that the Government have indicated nointention to take such steps as will reduce the high cost of living. What is the cause of the present high cost ?

421,Mr Gregory,"While they werenot think that many people care how high the wages are if , at the same time, our production is increased; but if production is reduced the resources of the country are destroyed.

What have they done to reduce that cost? risen all over the world. Labour party propose to do in order to reduce the cost of living? Although the report of the Royal Commission on the sugar industry pointed out that nationalization would increase the cost to the consumer, the Labour party adhered to their determination to nationalize. Postmaster-General announced to the publio in Western Australia that it was the intention of the Government to nationalize the industry, and, apparently, it did not matter what the nationalization would cost. that the Labour party themselves have increased the cost of living. The amendment also says that the Government have failed to realize the urgent necessity for an immediate revision of the Tariff. Well, the Labour party were in office for a long' time, and failed to do anything in that direction. I am pleased to see that an Inter-State Commission has been appointed, and I hope that, when a revision of the Tariff does take place, greater consideration will be given to the primary producers than has been the case in the past. dangerous ground, but I think that there might be reduced duties on many of the implements required by farmers and producers generally. manufacturing industries? the farmers that we have our manufacturing prosperity.

The whole future of Australia depends on the development of our primary industries. again congratulate the Government on the policy they have brought forward. gives us a clear line of demarcationsomething on which we can go back to our people, to explain the policy we have in view. I believe the people are beginning to realize who are their friends.. Honourable members opposite are great believers in majority rule. They have a large majority in the Senate, and they know they have a minority in the country, and that the votes of the majority of the people of Australia were cast against the Socialistic party, and in favour of the Liberal party. Honourable members opposite should recognise the f u t i l it y of trying to carry on with the anomaly of a major i ty of Liberalsi n this House and a majority of the other party in the Senate, and surely they will see the necessity for helping us to get a double dissolution, so The exas to enable one party to be dominant in both Chambers. They must recognise what a loss it will be to the community if the House of Representatives alone is dissolved. It will mean a big expense, and if the l i be r a l party come back again It will be seen, therefore, to power, we shall be in exactly the same position-the Senate obstinately opposed to the legislation the Liberals desire to put on the statute-book. Therefore, in the interests of the country, and, probably, in the interests of the Socialists, it will be better to arrange to have a double dissolution and let the people of Australia say which party is to rule the Commonwealth. considerable time ago my father supplied ine with a book called the ChatterboxI know I am now treading on light literature of ineffective value in the way of education-and I am afraid that during this debate we have had much chattering that certainly has not been in structive, nor aided in any way the elucidation of the problems before us.

The honourable gentleman asked why I did not place in formation received from officers on the table. I have gone to no officers for in formation; but even if I had done so, can it be said that the private information I would receive would be on the same plane as that received by Ministers from official sources? The Ministry have in their possession reports whicli are the work of the mind and brain of capable engineers, whose services this country has bought. Such a report is not a secret document, and the Prime Minister has no more right to it than I have. gentleman is prepared to let the truth be known, why does he not lay the reports on the table of the House or the Library, and so make them public property, in order that every honourable member who is interested in the safe conduct of that establishment, and in the preservation of life and limb, and of the property of the Commonwealth, may be in a position to weigh the information supplied, investigate it , assess its value, and speak upon it according to his ability? Ts my private information on the same plane as such reports? Surelyi t is not, and it is not correct for the Prime Minister to take up the attitude which he assumed last night. The fact that the honourable member for East Sydney, and the honourable member for South Sydney, and myself have not laid our private information on the table of the House is no justification of the Prime Minister's refusal to table papers which have been bought by public money in the interests of the country. answer to the Prime Minister. I think it shows that there is nothing in this business but a piece of political dodgery and quackery. It is an attempt to depreciate the last Administration by a Government that is lacking in administrative capacity, and lacking in a policy of progressive legislation. On lines of defence, the Government are making an attack upon an Administration who did well. so do we on this side. In the best interests of the country, we attempted to establish an effective system of defence; and associated with that system we took over what is known as the Fitzroy Dock, or the Cockatoo Island Dock. what advice did the last Government take over that dock ? It was under the advice of Admiral Henderson and of another gentleman, who came out from the Old Country with the reputation of a skilled dockyard man and a capable engineer. We paid for the property, and certainly have paid a large sum of money-ove r £800,000. Having paid for it , the party on this side suddenly find themselves attacked because something is supposed to be defective at the dock. It was known when the property was taken over that the boilers and plant generally were not in an effective condition; but I agree with the honourable member for South Sydney in the statement that 75 per cent, of the If the honourable plant is practically new, and very high class plant it is. I have seen it , and know it , and I challenge contradiction of the statement. Then of the plant supposed to be old, there is scarcely a machine on the island that is not effective for reasonable work. I do not propose to defend the past or the present Administration in this connection. I believe that Mr Julius waa appointed to report upon the matter by the late Administration , and his report has been presented to the present Government. I do not blame any Government for appointing .an officer to report upon such a matter; but the real question is whether the officer appointed was capable and did the work he was appointed to do> effectively. I venture to say that the work in this case was done largely under the control, advice, and direction of Captain Clarkson. I ask what are the qualifications of Captain Clarkson? What is his status? What is there in him to justify his appointment to the Naval Board, and what is the position in which That is my he stands when he ventures to report adversely upon a matter approved by Admiral Henderson? go into the question of the boilers ? tion of the suitability of the Fitzroy Dock. come to the boilers presently, and will Ministers believe in defence, and "" blow u p "" the honourable member for Wentworth.

458,Mr Howe,"B y the Minister on thewhereas formerly he had spoken of six. Where does the truth lie ? Does it lie in the comment of the Minister that there were fourteen boilers which had been examined, or in the statement of the engineer who is supposed to have made the examination, and who said there were six? The fact is that Mr Julius never examined one boiler on the island. I challenge this Government to tell me when one boiler at Cockatoo Island was examined by this engineer. hearsay, and made a report that, of course, was quite satisfactory to Captain Clarkson and the Naval Board, because it condemned the dock. If the Government were satisfied with Mr Julius' report, why was a re-survey instituted ? Did they doubt the efficiency of the engineer appointed on the advice of Captain Clarkson and his associates on the Board? Why were 400 men turned out of employment ? men ? off. them off on the Thursday, and paid them up to the Saturday, and many were out of work for a fortnight. Indeed, I have information to show that they are not all at work yet. four more being employed now than there were. ister for that interjection. He tells us that forty-four more men are being employed to-day than previously. Under what conditions ? If the boilers have been turned down as inefficient, and the pressure of the plant has been reduced, what are the additional forty-four men doing? complaining because work has been found for these men ? the political dodgery and trickery of this Government. I know what it means from top to bottom, and I think I am getting the better of the argument. it not, that these forty-four extra men are employed ? does not know.

Seeing that the boiler power of the establishment which employed about He went by 1,281 men before it was shut down has been reduced by one-third, and that tliere are 1,325 men employed in it to-day, I fail to understand how the increase has been brought about. Where have the additional men been placed? In the first instance, the foundry and the blacksmith's shop would be closed down. Aa a matter of fact, I know that, at the present time, the blacksmith's shop is not ia full working order, for the reason that the If not, why this fresh survey? boiler power which is being utilized has been diminished to the extent I have indicated. Consequently, the men have to COOK -Fou r hundred work any hours that they can. Theni t would be impossible to get heat for the converters for the steel foundry. If plates were ready for plating a vessel, well and good, but if they were not, the plates could not be rolled without pressure, which means boiler power. Then there would be no power available in the carpenters' shop. Similarly there would be no power in the fitting and machine shops to operate the cranes and machines. These fortydifferent branches, representing a very large percentage of the working power of the establishment, were shut down, and I say unhesitatingly that to-day they are not in full working order. Of course, the Minister of Defence may have taken on artisans as labourers in the dock-yard where they are not needed, in order to cloak Ministerial ignorance and maladministration. I come now to another aspect of the case. The Government have been very determined iu their investigations into the condition of affairs afi Cockatoo Island. Why do they not investigate the condition of affairs at the naval base at Williamstown ? What about the boilers installed there which were taken from the Countess of Hopeloun, and which are working effectively now ? How is it that the boilers placed on Cockatoo' Island are defective, whilst those placed at Williamstown are quite effective?

Instead of endangering life, it would safeguard it . W hy is a safety-valve placed on a boiler ? Simply that it may afford a means of escape for any undue pressure of steam. You have your fires under a big iron shell filled with water, ancl the heat is going through the tubes while the water is expanding, and is being transformed into steam. If in such circumstances the safety-valve of the boiler were closed down, and an excessive pressure of steam were used, naturally one thing or the other would have to give way. she goes."" seal down the safety-valve, so that a certain pressure, fixed upon, cannot be exceeded. The greed and avidity to make money exhibited by the average employer will prompt him to r un his boilers at more than a reasonable pressure, with the object of securing greater efficiency in his machinery. That spirit of greed and grab has in some cases been so strongly manifested that an inspector has had to lock down the safety-valves, so that they could not be opened without his assent. It is true, as has been said, that we have been fighting for boiler inspection ; but not in a Government dockyard where there are efficient engineers and men capable of taking charge of boilers. ber suggest that these weak spots in a boiler constitute, in reality, so many extra safety-valves ? boiler were being worked at a dangerous pressure, the moment it developed a leak through which the hot water and steam could escape, the pressure would be relieved ; so that, instead of being a danger to life, such a weak spot would afiord relief. bear out that statement.

The Ministerial party have made so much' df this matter that I must deal with it . As I was mentioning when interrupted, I have details of the results of private tests to which some of the boilers at Cockatoo Island were submitted. The loco-type boiler, No. 3, was tested at a pressure of 330 lbs. to the square inch, the working pressure being only 110 lbs; and the report of those who conducted that test is that the boiler is ""as tight as a bottle."" This is one of the old boilers that has been condemned. A t this private test the Tlopetoun's boiler was tested at a pressure of 250 lbs., and the working pressure was only 110 lbs. to the square inch. The report is that the tubes leaked a little , but that the leakage would not cause bursting. It would simply put out the fire. The Protector's boiler in the blackI say at once that, if a smith's shop was tested at a pressure of 180 lbs., and there was no leakage. In one of these cases the test was made at a pressure three times in excess of the ordinary working pressure, and in the main the boilers were found to be fairly effective.

Another aspect of this matter is that the tlopetoun's boiler was tested at a pressure two and a half times in excess of the workiug pressure, and that is regarded as a destructive pressure for even a boiler in good condition.

It was no uncommon thing for a a gift which I fully appreciated, not for the limit to be put on the output of a man's work. sake of the money, but because of the spirit (Opposition dissent.) to-day, were really political organizations of an aggressive character. Apparently, the honourable member's view the is that they were not political organizatical Labour tions in the pastIn New South Wales and Western Australia have not contributed money, while the unions had to furnish returns showing their total Attorney-General has suggested that they income and their expenditure under certain headings. In the last New South Wales returns the are making contributions. total income of the unions was given as ,£161,448, ment is correct? and the total expenditure ^146,599. Of the latter sum, the expenditure on claims for accident, sick benefit, & c , was ig.5 of the total. But management and other expenses represented 7.1-.13 per cent. Not alone the implication, but the statement of the honourable gentleman, was that this large sum was being spent in political organization. If the thought had occurred to the honourable gentleman, he might have made an application to the Statistician of New South Wales, from whom he would have learned that the Registrar of Friendly Societies and Trade Unions issues a special form setting out clearly and distinctly the headings under which must be stated the moneys received by a union, and the purposes to which they are devoted. I ask the honourable gentleman to obtain from the Registrar a report as to how much money has been spent in political organization for political fighting. I venture to say that, after he has obtained a report, he will retract the innuendo or the suggestion which is embodied in his statement here. take my own organization. BecauseI am a politician to-day, my fellow members will not even allow me to hold office in the organization. They say that no man who is not working at his trade has a right to hold office in the union. Why? Because he might unduly influence its operations to his own interest. I justify my fellow members in taking up that attitude. I am a member of a union over 10,000 strong in Australia, and with seventy-seven branches. but 1 have never received a penny out WhatI did Unions, as they existed of good fellowship which it represented. The same thing can be said of most of unions. A day or two ago the Prime Minister quoted the secretary to the PoliLeague of New South Wales as having said, in effect, that the unions Which stateWorkers Union did not give me a penny for the last electoral fight. on political purposes. We have other things to spend them on. There are sick and accident and other benefits to provide; there are also the proceedings in the Arbitration Courts, for which the lawyers charge so much. That is where a great deal of the money has been going for a considerable time past. The Attorney-General has perhaps gained his share from the other side. We have been forced to pay through the nose for law expenses. Then, too, the cost of administration is always great when those in charge are not trained accountants cr business men. The members of unions are at their work all day, and have to conduct the union business as well as they can. Consequently there is extravagance in administration, but there are also gifts I will to charities and to associated unions, of which nothing is heard, but which eat up the funds. Mr W. H .

I direct his attention to the Conflict of Capital and Labour, Webb's History of Trade Unionism, and the Guilds and Companies of London.

I understand tliat the men engaged upon the construction of a new drill-shed at Kelvin Grove are receiving only 8s. a day, and must provide their own tools, while not far away other men are receiving from the Commonwealth 9s. a day, and have not to provide their own tools. I want to know whether this distinction is being made, It is not agreeable to me to reand, if so, what is the reason for it? Is the drill-shed at Kelvin Grove being carried out by the State Government? Is that why the men are not receiving the wages that are paid in another case by the Commonwealth Government? There are -The question raised by the honourable member is a very important one. I have already called attention to it by correspondence with the Department of Home Affairs, as well as in the House. I know there has been some friction between the Department of Home Affairs and the State Department of Public Works in Queensland, because of the Federal Department insisting on certain rates of wages which happen to be higher than the usual State rates. Twelve months ago I called attention to the fact that the painters on Commonwealth The unions are aswork in Queensland were not being paid the 10s. rate which had been stipulated by the Department of Home Affairs. The We will State Department, which was carrying out the work, was paying 9s. to their own painters, and declined to have two rates of pay; and it was only after correspondence and very definite instructions It is steadily coming in, and is by the Commonwealth Minister that the State Department agreed to pay the higher rate. Even then the State Department resorted to a subterfuge, because they paid their own workmen 9s. per day and 6d. for travelling expenses, I while they paid the Commonwealth men 9s. per day and ls. 6d. travelling expenses.
