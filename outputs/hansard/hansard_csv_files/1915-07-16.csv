Has the Minister come to any determination on the matter? a matter of policy which it is not considered desirable to finally decide until the termination of the war. AII trainees who are members of tlie Expeditionary Forces are, of course, exempt from the universal training clauses of the Defence Act as long as they serve in the Australian Imperial Foroe.

It is to take advantage of existing governmental machinery, whether that machinery be under the direct control of the Commonwealth, the States, or the municipalities.

And when tlie information has been tabulated at great cost, it will take the Government Statistician a long time to deal with it .

Honourable members, I trust, recognise, as I do, that after all is said and done, the wealth of our country I do not mean to rests on our system of trade. You cannot touch that system by taxing the actual capital without bringing the whole fabric tumbling down to earth like I believe that, whea pack of cards. All that can be done effectively, and all that the Government should attempt to do is to levy upon the actual productive wealth of the countryupon the produce of the country's resources. That can be done without going to anything like the expense that the Government propose to incur in taking this wealth census. covered by an income tax. that is the right way to go about it . If you attempt to tax other than the income which is the result of the capital invested if you attempt to levy uoon the capital itself-the result must be disaster.

160,Mr Greene,"I dare say it wouldis held on fixed deposit in the banks. He argued that this money was not being properly used, and that, therefore, the Government should come along and use a certain portion of it . To fchat argument I would point out that, although the original owners of this money are only getting 3 or 3Â£ per cent, interest on it , the banks themselves are using the money again and again. in the Savings Ranks is turned over five or six times. man may be getting 3^ per cent., but some one else is using the same money, and getting 4 per cent, on it ; whilst a person may be using the same money in a still further direction, and getting 5 per cent. because inoney is deposited by the original owner in a bank at 3J per cent., the money is not being used. deposited in this way is used right throughout the whole trade and commerce of the country, and that is why I urge honourable members to be careful in any contemplated taxation not to impose the tax upon other than the produce of the country's capital resources. care how heavy the tax is. It will have to be heavy. The rioh must pay in common with the rest of the community-and I believe that, with very few exceptions, everybody will be willing to pay cheerfully. It is because of all this that I believe that the wealth census, if taken in the manner that the Government contemplate, will be unnecessary. I would like to see it taken in quite a different way, and I believe the information the Government desire could be got much more cheaply, and when the actual taxation is imposed it oould be imposed much more' effectively, if other methods were employed. The matter, however, is one for the Government to determine. for what steps are taken must eventually rest upon them. That is why I regret fchafc the Government when bringing down this measure were not perfectly frank with the House and with the country in that they did not say exactly what was contemplated, or explain the reasons that induced them tb call for a census of wealth in this particular form . W it h reor time to issue a special schedule with a gard to fche registration of individuals, I do not think the Government are going far enough. One has only to look at the schedule to see that the Government's chief object is to ascertain the number of men actually fitted for the firing line. That seems to be the one underlying idea. While I would not discount for a single moment the almost stupendous efforts that Australia has put forward up to the present time, and while I admit that the fullest tribute must be paid to those who have so grandly come forward in their country's service, no one can but admit that Australia has not yet given of its manhood to the same extent fchat the Old Country has. We have a long way to go before we do that. I am inclined to think that, owing to the distance that separates us from the actual scene of conflict, it will not be possible for us to give our f u l l quota of men. But there are It cannot be said that, simply many other things that we can do. A great deal is wanted besides men in this war. We want material; we want munitions. Money As this census has to be taken, and as the expense must be incurred, I think the Government could very well have gone a little further in fche matter by endeavouring to ascertain how far it is possible to organize certain particular industries. In an in I do not direct way, no doubt, the Government w ill get information on that point, but I think We all recognise that. they could get a great deal more than they w ill get, and tlie value of the information would be infinitely greater, if they set fco work to obtain direct schedules affecting certain trades. Take, for instance, the textile industry. There are people working in various parts of Australia who have been trained in the textile industry, b u t who are not now engaged in that industry, . just as there are men who have been engineers, but who are following some other occupation. The' schedule as contemplated in this measure w ill not result in f u l l information on that point.

We cannot find it -The people who are carrying on the woollen industries cannot find it. ready to our very hand, to come in contact with every individual in the CommonAvealth capable of working in a woollen mill. that information? Similarly, in the engineering industry, particularly in that portion of it concerned with the manufacture of munitions, it is possible that large numbers of people are scattered about the length and breadth of the Commonwealth who have been employed on that particular class of work, and whose services would be valuable now. Here we have an opportunity of finding out where these people are, and of saying to them as our organization extends, ""We want you to go to such-and-such a factory."" Why not take advantage of the census to do that? . Again, in regard to the industries directly connected with the equipment of troops, we should endeavour to find out as quickly as possible every individual in Australia who can assist. That information can only be obtained by the issue of additional schedules.

All I want to say is that, so far as the Bill goes, I believe the idea underlying it is right, and it will have my full support; ""but I suggest, in regard to the wealth census-withou t knowing what is in the Government's mind-that it is quite possible that we are spending a lot of money unnecessarily, and for which there will be no adequate return.

W it h conscription in operation, we should always have men trained and ready to go to the f r o n t well prepared to meet any emergency, and, as the honourable . member for In d i has said, we may need the services of such men on our own shores. Instead of having to send them abroad in defence of Australia we may, unfortunately, have to employ them here. I have only to say, in conclusion, that I considered that I should put before the House the view that I hold with TJnder conscription regard to conscription so that at least one man amongst us may be able to say when the time is ripe, "" I told you so."" MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [12.28]I think it well to emphasize a point t h a t has been entirely overlooked during this debate, and which is that from the very inception of this war more men have volunteered in Australia than the Department of Defence has been able to train and equip. all the British Dominions. MrM c WILLIAMS L is t e n in g to the speeches of some honourable members, a. stranger would imagine that Australia It is before tlie Lords. was a country of shirkers, and that it was My reply to those necessary to use compulsion to induce our men to recognise their duty to the Empire. In these circumstances, therefore, I think it wise to mention the actual position. It is to be regretted that the Department did not get a move on earlier than it did. It was because of We do not want to repeat, in connection with our equipment of troops, the stupendous folly that has been associated with the Small Arms Factory.

I do not believe that 33 per cent, of those volunteering are physically incapable of serving at the front, but that is about the proportion of volunteers who are being rejected to-day. And yet we are told that we ought to register men in order to secure more soldiers. Some of the men rejected are amongst the most physically fit men in Australia. They are trained athletes, who would hold their own in any arena, and yet they are rejected by the medical officers. An Imperial officer told me that he had seen men rejected in Melbourne who would be received with open arms by any recruiting sergeant in Europe. Numbers of men who have been rejected in Australia have gone to England and been accepted there. Mr J. H . CATTS -That is because, in Australia, more men of perfect physique were offering than could be handled. to tbe point that we are commencing our reform at the wrong end. If Parliament and the Government would concentrate their energies on preparations to receive the men who are enlisting, and who are eligible, we should do much more good, and secure a greater number of fighting men than we are getting at the present time. It is now proposed to remove the backbone of our recruiting system by calling in the rifles from the rifle clubs. Would it not be possible for tbe Government to secure 50,000 or 100,000 rifles, with a corresponding amount of ammunition, from Japan? I am credibly informed that it would have been possible, and is possible, now to get those rifles from Japan. "" But,"" says one officer, "" the Imperial Government cannot accept them, because it would mean tliat there would be two classes of rifles in the trenches."" three or four different classes of rifles in the same trenches in Belgium to-day. There are tlie Belgian rifle, the Erench rifle, the British rifle, and the Canadian Ross rifle, all being used side by side in the trenches. I have never seen any necessity for this Bill. The men of Australia are volunteering in far greater numbers than the Department is able to deal with. Instead of turning our attention to matters of this kind, the first great reform should be in the Defence Department itself, iu order that some"" better system might be devised for handling the men who do volunteer, and especially of discontinuing the absurdity of rejecting as unfit some of the finest men in the country. Tliere is a suspicion that many men .have been rejected, and that the high standard of physical fitness has been enforced because the Department was not able to train and arm more men. member not to discuss that subject. mentioning that matter in order to show that there is no great necessity for this Bill, and that better work could be done by placing the Defence Department in a position to accept all the men available under present conditions. is a novel experience to hear an honourable member expressing the view that this Bill is not necessary. Until the honourable member for Franklin spoke, all honourable members had agreed that the measure is necessary. I cordially support the Bill, which I believe to be absolutely essential at the present time. I have no wish to be at all pessimistic, but I do think that the people are blind if they fail to realize the present serious position of affairs in the Old World. We may be hopeful with the hope which our race always possesses, that we shall come out of this conflict successfully, as we have always done in the past; but a man is blind if he shuts his eyes to the fact that the position is very serious to-day. I quite agree that up to the present the voluntary system has been successful in Australia, and partially successful in the Old Country. But I cannot help feeling a considerable amount of sympathy with our Allies who are fighting under conscription, and putting Why, there are millions of men into the field, knowing all the while that the British Empire is not sending to the front as many soldiers as it ought to send. I was very much impressed by figures which were contained in a cablegram published in the Herald on Saturday night. They purport to be from an official report of the French Relief Society, and they show that, from the beginning of the war to the 1st June, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, nearly",20,Moloney Th E A Good Many People Were Ready To Throw

It does seem that we have not been putting into the field as many men as we could send, ancl ought to have sent, in justice to the otlier nations who are allied with us. One fact we have to remember is that in this matter time is the essence of the contract. The Germans were prepared for the war; we were not. They have an enormous army, and every man put into the field is a trained soldier, ready to take his place in thc fighting line at once. ""We are not only short in numbers, and have to raise our armies, but we have to train them. The men who are enlisting to-day will not be fit to take their position in the field for some months to come; in fact, they may be looked upon as the soldiers who will be required to do the winter service in Europe. to so organize our forces now that we may be in a position to do more, if necessary, at stage. There has been some objection to the Bill on the ground that it means conscription. The measure does not necessarily mean conscription, but it does mean that if conscription should become necessary-and it will be adopted in the Old Country and Australia only when the situation has become desperate-w e shall be in a position to put the system into force at once, instead of having to spend months in gathering the information which, by the aid of this Bill, we shall now get immediately. In the Defence Act, we have recognised and approved of the principle of conscription for home defence, and have given the Executive power to call all men between the ages of eighteen nnd sixty years fo the colours for tlie deI f Ave do not defend Australia there, but fence of Australia. In one respect, conscription is more satisfactory than the present system of voluntary enlistment; it prescribes tlie order iu which men shall be called upon to serve. The men between certain ages and unmarried are called first, and the married men without children are called before the married men with children. J agree with the honourable members who have said that we have been sending to the front too many youths and far too many married men. If we had a properly-organized The figures which particusystem, or if we were operating under the conscription sections of the Defence Act, many of the men who have gone to the had lost front would not have gone; we would have called upon the other men who aremore suitable-the single men who are without responsibility, and below a certain age. I do not say that Australia has not done well, nor do I decry the Commonwealth's contribution to the war. Nothing disgusts me so much as to hear prominent mtn who have done well in Australia always decrying the efforts of this country. It must be remembered that while Ave have been giving men, if Ave have not been giving in the same proportion as the people of Great Britain, we have been giving of our substance, as the AvidoAv gave her mite. This great country is in need of population, and every man we send to the front is of the country's life blood, and therefore every soldier we give is a gift of our substance, Therefore, it is necessary whilst the Old Country is giving probably of its surplus population. I shall not be afraid of supporting conscription if a later such a course becomes necessary. I hopo the voluntary system Avill continue to be successful as it has been in the past, but Ave cannot shut our eyes to the fact that if the war continues into next year, some desperate means of bringing it to a successful issue will be necessary. Having recognised the principle of conscription for the defence of Australia, it seems to me to matter nothing Avhether conscription is to be applied to war in other parts of the world, or war on our own shores. It is admitted that men would be called upon for service in Australin. For Avhat? For the purposes of defending Australia. We are defending Australia by fighting the enemy at the Dardanelles and on the battlefields of Europe. Avait to fight the enemy on our shores, we shall have to fight a very inglorious battle indeed. I pity those Avho have to fight a victorious German army in Australia if the Allies are beaten in the fighting in Europe. It seems to me that there is no difference between sending men to Europe to defend Australia and in compelling them to serve in Australia for the same purpose. In fact, there may be more justification for compelling them to fight in Europe, because they may be able to do something of an effective nature there, whereas if we wait u n t i l the enemy comes to our shores, our men may be fighting a forlorn hope and losing their lives in what would possibly be a very hopeless final struggle for existence. MrJ . H . CATTS (Cook) [12.43] The scheme which the Attorney-General proposes to put into operation for taking a census of the manhood and wealth of the country is a step in the right direction. Proposals have emanated from Opposition members, who are supposed to bebusiness men,, which would mean that the taking of the census, instead of occupying only a few weeks, would occupy a few months. have had experience of handling large bodies of men engaged in voluntary work, the idea of utilizing voluntary labour for tlie census i u different parts of the Commonwealth-whic h requires accuracy and expedition-is ridiculous. We must have information before we can; take action. acting without information. A number of lionorable members are discussing, the B ill as if it provided fbr action. It does nothing of the kind. It provides merely for the accumulation of information. As a matter of fact, this Parliament has done practically nothing. It has not done a solitary thing of substance in connection with our present difficulties beyond the passing of two or three Supply Bills. True, the Referenda Bills have heen carried. This is a necessary prelude to much necessary legislation. But we have done nothing as a Parliament regarding many great subjects over which we have undoubted power, and which it is essential should be dealt with . There has been no definite authority obtained from Parliament for the sending away of any number of troops. We have passed an incidental measure-the 1 War Pensions Act-bu t Parliament itself has sanctioned nothing. It is proposed to acquire the sugar crop of Australia, at a cost of about Â£2,000,000, but this Parliament has not authorized it , nor have we considered the proposal. Judging from the speech of the A t torney-General, it is in contemplation to acquire the whole of the wheat crop of Australia, or it is thought that it may be necessary to do so, and to harvest, transport, and market it at a cost of about Â£25,000,000. But no proposal has been put before Parliament for dealing with the matter. Parliament has not been asked to consider the scheme in detail, or to sanction it . In all the great financial arrangements that have been made, whatever they may beI have very vague ideas of what they are, and doubt whether any honourable member has precise information concerning, them necessary to consult Parliament under the present regime. Mr J. H . CATTS -Parliamen t has not considered 'the financial situation, To those who and has not arranged it . In that respect we have full' control of the finances of Australia. But we have not even had a chance to put our heads together to grapple with the financial difficulties of the Commonwealth. In regard to foodstuffs So far we have been member think this relevant to the Bill? Mr J. H . CATTS , I think it is quite relevant. The Attorney-General, in in troducing, the B ill , discussed all these subjects. but he did not discuss them. MrJ . H .

MrJ . H . CATTS I do not wish to refer to them in detail; but to make a passing reference to them. In regard to our food supplies, and the production of the country, all that Parliament has done, or is now asked to do, is to obtain information. If that is all that is necessary, the government of the country may be carried on by the appointment of Ministers who will undertake the management of our affairs, and elucidate problems of the greatest magnitude whioh arise during a time of war, when most serious consequences may arise put of what is done.

230,Mr Fisher,"As good as any in theAs the Bill will probably be rushed through at the Committee stage, I desire to take this opportunity of saying a word about the machinery. It has been suggested by members on the other side that voluntary labour should be made use of in a wholesale fashion. We have large numbers of men who are prepared to offer their services. I have had some experience of the employment of considerable bodies of voluntary helpers in political campaigns, and, in my view, the honourable members who have suggested tliat we should make use of voluntary help in work of this character can hardly have had much experience in the organization of voluntary help in their own electorates. In my own electorate, in the electorates that my party have asked me to take charge of in New South Wales for organizing purposes, and in the general organization of the work of the last campaign in New South Wales, I had a good deal of experience of the value of voluntary help from persons who were inspired with the ideals of the movement, who were extremely enthusiastic, and whose help was given under tlie best conditions, and my conclusion is that such help cannot equal in value the help that -could be obtained if the same persons were regularly employed under direct and continuous supervision in some systematic and methodical way. I do not disparage in any way the great work voluntarily done for the labour movement. I am merely trying to compare voluntary, as against paid, labour for taking and analysing the census now under consideration. During the last State election I was asked to take charge of the second ballot campaign in that electorate of New South Wales in which the State Attorney-General was interested. The time at my disposal was only a, week or ten days, and we had to engage paid labour to do a certain part of the organizing work; yet by its help we transformed a minority of 100 into a majority of 300 after a very strenuouslyfought contest. The voluntary help was magnificent, but it would have even been more effective if we could have paid the same persons and insisted upon more rigid carrying out of instructions. If we could engage our political helpers regularly at an election, work on definite lines, with power to insist upon the carrying out of instructions, our results would be immensely increased and improved. make a fair comparison? Mr J. H . CATTS -Oh, yes. It .was rather an important election, and I am bound to say that all the money required was available. The Attorney-General did not stick at a pound or two so long as the work was effectively done. I would like to see what employment is going to be distributed, particularly at a time like this, but the distribution must not be at the cost of inefficiency. It would be a most inefficient way of handling this matter if we were to have a number of depots in various parts of the Commonwealth. All these cards will have to come in through the Post Office. They will arrive on different days on account of the distances they have to be sent, and if arrangements could be made for their complete handling at one common centre that would be the most efficient way of carrying out the census. The idea of utilizing voluntary labour in all parts of the Commonwealth is. in my view, absurd. As many inspectors as employees would be required to see that the work was carried out. Voluntary helpers can come in when they like, do what they like, go out to lunch when they like. It is impossible to exercise the same supervision aud discipline over such assistance as it is over those whose duty it is to carry out the work under effective control. I was surprised to hear the suggestions that came from honourable members of some experience on the other side of the House, and I thirds their suggestions ought not to be followed. If tlie Attorney-General, with the experience he has had of matters in this direction, would consult with Mr Knibbs, I feel sure that they would be able to evolve some scheme which would enable the work of tabulation and analysis to be done properly and at reasonable cost. have great pleasure in supporting tliis proposal, because I think it is a first step towards that marshalling of our resources which has already been too long delayed. Por months I have advocated the adoption of a system which would enable us to obtain the information that we hope to get as the result of this census. Suggestions of conscription have been made. We have been asked what the intentions of",27,Moloney Th E A Good Many People Were Ready To Throw

In short, this census will enable us so to marshal our resources as to fit us, not only to put up a bigger fight oversea, but to prepare for whatever the final shuffle of the cards may mean in regard to the defence of Australia. If because of a thousand and one contingencies that may arise, and which need not be too clearly defined, it becomes necessary to do battle in Australia itself, we shall then be able, in stead of being turned over utterly bound and helpless to the enemy, to put up a final fight such as only a free people struggling for their very existence can do. member send all the idle men to the front ? auy man to the f r o n t without his consent.

The spirit of freedom has so permeated the people of Australia that the one thing necetesary in connection with this war is to bring them to a realization of the fact that the best way to bring about the ruin of the Commonwealth is for every capable and able The wealth that I refer to helps man to leave it . They need to be reminded that we must retain some of the capable and able of our people in order that the solvency of Australia may be maintained. Who is to say that the war is likely to end a few months hence, or We fco be brought to a close by one special effort? We must be prepared for a long sustained effort, and we can best make that preparation by actively developing fche resources of Australia. It ds in fchat way that the Government charged with the administration of the affairs of this counBy this census we hope to obtry will be able to f u l f i l its functions while pursuing its duties in a truly patriotic spirit. I am sure my fellow-countrymen throughout the Commonwealth will be prepared to make every sacrifice. It is essential that there should be a census' of the bone and muscle as well as of the wealth of the community. And it is equally essential that property owners, as well as those who have but their labour to offer, should be prepared fco make sacrifices, since all that we hold dear, all that we love, and everything that makes for the progress of humanity is now in the balance. It is not by mere spasmodic effort, nor by throwing prudence to the winds, thafc we shall assist in tliat final victory which I hope ultimately w ill be ours. That victory can be secured only by treading the road of selfsacrifice and self-abnegation. In time of peace I am a keen In d ividualist, but in time of war, when the welfare of the country, and all that we enjoy, depends upon the action of the Government of our country, I hold it to be the duty of all to get behind that Government. This is particularly so at No .

Marvellous enthusiasm is being manifested throughout the country. member propose to connect his remarks with the Bill? show that the country, by its response to the appeal for recruits made during the last few days, has practically shown its approbation of the measure which the Government are now putting before us.

I believe that most of the information which it is proposed to obtain by means of this census can already be obtained through State channels. If there is one fact by which I was struct more than by any other during my recent tour of the country it was the manifest anxiety on the part of the people that a lead should be given.

I express my regret that fche honourable member for Eawkner saw fit to say last night that the men on the land had not played their part in connection with this war. I did not interject while the honourable member was speaking because I was anxious to hear his deductions, and I certainly think that they were hardly f a i r ones. fche people on the land have just passed through a terribly trying tim*. No section of the community has more contractual obligations than the man on the land, and during the dreadful time of drought through which these people have just passed, many of these contractual obligations have had to be suspended. In addition, we must not overlook the fact that when foodstuffs were running short an appeal was made to our farmers to redouble their efforts, and to cultivate larger areas. To this appeal there has been a very general response. Additional areas have been sown in many cases, but many young men have left the farming districts for the front . In a number of localities a very good response has been made to the call for volunt.ers. In other localities I have been disappointed. But there is no section of the community for whom I have always entertained a stronger admiration that the people upon the lands of Australia. They have never shirked their obligations at home, and a great many of the burdens of citizenship are cast upon them. In following their everyday employment they are exposed, summer and winter, to the roughest conditions, and I am satisfied that in peril or danger the white feather would never be shown by them. If the response to the appeal for volunteers has not been as large as might have been expected from our farming districts, I think that, upon examination, it w ill be found that there are a good many reasons for this. I know that tremendous sacrifices have been made. I by some of the people on the land. In some cases two or three sons out of one f a m i ly have gone to the front , and those left behind w ill be dependent upon outside assistance for gathering the harvest. I do not think there is much in the suggestion which has been made that the school The Government will boys would be of much use to the farmers in taking off their crop. Wheat is raised most successfully in the dry parts of Australia, and the temperatures of our wheat areas are very high; in many cases they run up to 110 degrees and 112 degrees in the shade during the harvesting season. Therefore, I do not think fchat school children are going to be of much service in the harvest field. They may be of use in the f r u it industry, and they niay do good service in stooking hay, but I would not place much value on the assistance that school ""We have to remp.mber that children can give to our wheat farmers.

All its available horseflesh, its machinery, and its manual labour is then taxed to the utmost. the utmost in their domestic duties, and it is not desirable that the feeling should be created that the places of able-bodied men, who at the request of the various Governments have put large areas under cultivation, and have since gone to the front, can be taken by the children of the country. which I desire to refer, and I approach it with some reserve. When war is declared every man and woman is called upon to state hia or her position; I feel that, for the most part, we can depend upon every man in this country"" to do his duty when the time arrives. Australia has to make is that every foot of land in this country is British soil, that there is not one inch of neutral territory. If there is any one who feels to-day any embarrassment by reason of the nationality of his parents or his own nationality, he must not forget that he has enjoyed to the ful l the privileges of citizenship in this country, and that now is the time to discharge the highest national obligation that could fall to his lot. Conscription, of course, brings in all. but the present system leaves it open for those of all nationalities who are enjoying British freedom in Australia, who have been able to establish homes in the Commonwealth, and have reaped the benefit of our institutions, to recognise the part that they ought to play. All that I have to say is that the response has not been as general and as uniform as we might well have expected. We might very well issue a word of warning that, in connection with this census, the nationality of those who remain at home, as well as of Jhose who go to the front, will be made known, so that when the question of discrimination between duties has to be dealt with, we shall know exactly how the peoples of different nationalities living in Australia have played their part. When Australia determined upon the adoption of compulsory training, it was intended that the system should apply to all males between the ages of fourteen and twenty-five years. That system, unfortunately, had not been in operation long enough before the war [184]2 to provide for the military training of the whole community. Many young men escaped by a few days the compulsion to train, others escaped it by months, and still others by years. As it is, we have, drawn The women, too, are taxed to off about 100,000 of the best of our young men.; but many of the others who remain at home have had the benefit of that compulsory training system. As part of: cur preparatory measures, compulsorytraining should be given to everybody in* the community._ There is another matter to member is now wandering from the question before the Chair. mit that this is pertinent to the question of the census, because one of the obligations that may be placed on the males of the commimity is that they shall go into The declaration that active preparation for war. orable member to wander into these little by-paths he will be dealing with some other question that is not before the Chair at all. subject beyond saying that I am an advocate of compulsory training for all able bodied men. forty-five years. In manv places the community has notÂ» waited for a lead from the Government; awkward squads have been formed, and are being drilled, and there could be no better incentive to recruiting than this form of preparatory training. With regard to the mustering of the material resources of the community, the honourable member for Capricornia, by way of question, and other honourable members by implication, have indicated the early introduction of a system of income tax to raise funds for the better prosecution of the war. With such a proposal I shall be in hearty accord. I have always advocated the imposition of an income tax in the Federal sphere as one of the best means of raising money for the good government and defence of Australia. t:\xation.

249,Mr Rodgers,"My view is that the land. Such an arrangement would avoid the duplication to which the right honourable member for Swan objects. the States .might give back to the Commonwealth portion of the 25s. per head they are receiving? of time to consider that proposal at the expiration of the existing arrangement. If there was ever a time when the entire wealth of Australia should be taxed for national purposes that time is the present. I know that tlie party now in power are committed to taxation, direct in its incidence, for purposes of defence. Their policy is that Naval and Military expenditure shall be provided from the proceeds of direct taxation. I have always been unable to understand wliere the Labour party could get the money for the carrying out of that policy, and now tliat plank in their platform is being put to the test. Nobody has a right to escape his proper obligations with regard to defence. I have never been able to' discriminate' between the duty of men who put their money into shipping, mines, or manufactures, or other classes of business, and the duty of the man who puts his money into the land. Yet the latter has been unfairly picked out by this Parliament to carry the greatest burden of taxation. If ever an exemplification, of the injustice of the system was given it was during the last period of drought, when the great producing interests of the country were in a condition of absolute paralysis. But even though the great landed interests have failed to yield a return, and the nation is at war, other people in the community have been making fortunes. Many of them have been providing the war supplies for the community. foodstuffs, and some have had war fortunes given to them by Act of Parliament. I refer particularly to the fixation of the price of wheat in Victoria. Could anybody say, as a matter of equity and fairness, that those who are enjoying' tbe greatest prosperity in war time sliould be exempted from contributing in proper proportion to tbe necessities of the country? I do not fear the imposition of a Eederal income tax. I shall welcome it as the most equitable system by which the Government can finance its activities. I do not believe in the duplication of taxation, and, as I have already remarked, I would prefer that this Parliament should hand back to the States the power of taxation of land. Could there be any stronger reason for such a course, from the point of view of the present Government, than that the party which they represent in politics has governmental control in five out of six States, and is, therefore, able to deal with the land settlement and taxation problems? ber is again straying beyond the Bill. why I particularly support the Government in their desire to provide fresh means of taxation is that the entire resources of the country, whether in land, accrued wealth, or cash reserves-thos e musty cash heaps to which the honourable inember for Werriwa referred-shal l be at the disposal of the Government for the prosecution of the war. With regard to recruiting, I hope that the Government will recognise that those men who are from 150 to 300 miles from the big recruiting centres should be given an opportunity of registering at convenient local depots. member to adhere to the Bill. say that I hope that while the Government are recruiting the raw material for soldiers, they will devise means of registering recruits closer, to tlieir homes, instead of putting them to the expense and trouble of coming to the city to offer their services. allow the second reading of this Bill to pass without expressing my feelings in regard to the measure. . If tliere is one Others have been providing thing more than another that impresses me with the idea tliat this Bill is a measure that should not be enacted, it is the whole-hearted support which it has received from tlie honourable members of the Opposition.

258,Mr Pagei Do Not Say That Honor,"believe they are sincere, and, therefore, it is a godsend to Australia that they are not in office to-day, otherwise we should have had conscription introduced. Some honourable member's of the Opposition have beeu careful to keep out of their speeches all mention of conscription, but the honourable member for Flinders, and other honourable members in reply to interjections, have said that they would be in favour of conscription if such a course became necessary. The honourable member for Flinders says that this B i ll means that every male between eighteen and sixty years of age is morally, if not legally, liable to service. That statement is sufficient to indicate to me what would be tlie outcome of the B ill if the Opposition were on the Treasury benches. Both the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General have stated that the Bill does not mean either, directly or indirectly, conscription for service outside the Commonwealth. Tliat assurance removes a lot of my objections to the B ill .

Never1 gang. Csesar. What are the British troops doing ? They are leaping out of the trenches and rushing to death. On the other side, we hear of men being shot down because they w ill not leave the trenches. That is the difference between conscription and volunteering. I remember an incident which occurred when I was in fche Transvaal. The commanding oflicer formed up the gunners, and asked for six men who would volunteer to go to certain death. There was a slight pause, and then the whole fifty-six men present stepped forward. That is what happens under the voluntary system. TJnder the pressgang system all those men would not have been ready to risk their lives. The six men who went did not put their Honourable members opposite hands into the hat to pull out their numbers; they had them beforehand. I am sorry fchafc the B ill has been introduced. What is meant by asking electors to state whether their general health is good, bad, or indifferent; and. if it is not good, to suffering from blindness, deafness, or the loss of a limb, fco give particulars'?

Why is. this information needed ? It grieves me that members of my party are congratulating the Government on the introduction of the Bill, just as members of the Opposition are doing. support the Bill for the collection of a census, because I think ib is highly necesthat. sary that the Government should have the information that is sought for. As for there being too much detail in the questions asked, the honourable member for Maranoa must know that an elector will not have to answer every question. for failure to answer questions. be penalized for failing to answer a quesof the Chair. tion which he could not answer. The questions regarding the possession of prosire of the Government is to raise money perty will take a considerable time to answer, and it seems to me that it is hardly necessary to obtain the desired information in this way, because it can be more readily obtained in another way. It can be got from the State authorities, and from the municipalities and shires. There are also the land tax and income tax officers to apply to. I suppose there is not a State of the Commonwealth that does not collect an income tax. As for particulars of stock-in-trade, I know that in New South Wales every farmer and primary producer makes an annual return of the value of his farming implements and other possessions. I do not know what is in the minds of Ministers, but I advise them to hesitate before imposing taxation upon the landowners and agriculturists of Australia. The land-owners of New South Wales have ten taxes to pay. return from income and land taxation is Â£47,000 more this year than it was estipublic interest to interfere with une mated at, although during -the year we had the biggest drought on record. cities have been making tremendous profits out of the war.

Taxation proposals will be submitted by separate measures. ting this information as expeditiously as possible; but I hope that the Government will embarrass the people as little as they can, and will not take unfair advantage of the information that they obtain. However, as I am prevented from speaking on these very important matters now, I shall reserve my remarks concerning them for another occasion. I wish to place on record my views on this Bill, because they may appear somewhat contrary to those I have expressed in the past regarding militarism. I do not believe in militarism or in war, and I do not believe in people who believe in war. But I recognise that, at the present time, we are quite ""up against it ,"" and are involved in a war against our own wish, and that, consequently, we must make the best of a bad job. The honourable member for Maranoa seems to deprecate my want of power or influence to alter the determination of employers dn South Australia not to employ single men who they think ought to enlist. I ask that honourable member to tell me, out of the wealth of his knowledge, what power I have over the private employers in South Australia. The honourable member knows that I have no power of the kind, and his remark, I think, was a somewhat contemptible one to make. honourable member meant. member's assurance that he misunderstood my remark. because I regard it as indicating that we are beginning to systematize our war -energies; and we all hope that this will be honourable members confuse the issue by done thoroughly. There are honourable members who seem to be afraid of conscription or compulsory service; but, I ask, means the system adopted in countries what have we to-day but morally compulsory service? We began by offering contingents in the way they were, offered by -the Leader of the Opposition when in -power; but now we are told that the war 5s ours-that the liberties of AustraUa are being fought for on Gallipoli, and that it is our duty to take our proper share, and not as a merely volunteer affair. As I have always said in relation to the Defence Act, if a man chooses to make his home in Australia, and yet declines to give his aid to defend it, it is time he left the country. If it be a fact that Australian liberties are being fought for at Gallipoli, it is quite time the people were told that they must step into line and give their assistance to the defence of those liberties. We should not be dependent on voluntary service. I wish no man to take my share in the defence of the country, but I do not think I ought to take my place in the firing line while others, whose duty it is to go before myself, stay behind. I am prepared to take my active share-and I think I may say without egotism that I am skilled enough to make a ""good fist"" of it if I got to the front. There are placards about the streets showing a cap with the. inscription, ""Does this cap fit you?"" Well, if this cap fits any man in the crowd who will not put it on, why should we not put it on him? Another placard shows a vacancy in a row of soldiers, with the inscription, "" This place is left for you "" ; and, as I said before, if it is a man's duty to be in that vacant place, why not put him in it? That is the proper attitude to take up if we mean to defend Australia. What are all these placards and other efforts but moral compulsion? We can imagine the sensations of a man after the war, who has not been to the front, and who is asked by his child what part he took in defending the liberties of Australia in 1915. It may be that such a man has done as much as any in the firing line; but the child will not realize that sitting at a desk making out pension orders for the maimed and the bereaved might take the place of fighting. I support this BillI regard this Bill as the first logical step that we have taken towards the shouldering of a responsibility that is ours. Some playing on the word ""conscription""; but, as I understand the term, it really where men are taken from their ordinary daily life for a term, and forced into military training, so as to be ready if they are needed.

Married men have gone, leaving behind wives and several children, and in case of the death of such men we are pledged to pensions for the dependents. A t the same time there may be families of hefty, lusty sons who remain behind, the loss of any one of whom would, perhaps, not mean so much The pension of f l a week to a wife and 5s. a week for children I cannot help regarding as a mere charity dole, because, with such a provision, a woman will have to work in order to bring her family up in any way respectably. I take it that this Bill, if carried to its logical conclusion, will avoid many of these effects of the present system. Every man who can fight would be brought into line, and even supposing the Bill does not result in compulsory service, we shall at least know definitely what are our resources in men, means of transport, and so forth. We are told tliat all employers of labour are offering the greatest facilities for their men to enlist: and we are asked to go upon the public platform and stimulate the recruiting. I wish to bring under the notice of the House a statement which was made by Mr E. Massey Burnside, general manager of the Omnibus Company, and which, as reported in the Argus of this morning, shows that he does not believe in recruiting. The secretary of the union had made some remarks in regard to wages paid, and Mr Burnside repliedNo man is shown on our books as having received Â£ 1 19s. for his last week's work, .but four men received Â£ 1 17s. 4d., Â£ 1 13s.

I would not like fco go to the f r o n t and leave my wife and girl dependent upon the pension that would be paid to them in the case of my death. We are told that the liberty of the Australian people is being decided by this war, and that it is necessary for us to take this census in order that we may successfully prosecute our efforts in the way of providing troops and financing our part of the struggle. If , in order to do this, it is necessary for the people to give all they have got, I think that should be taken, even if it means a main's last penny. I would use every means to obviate the necessity of paying interest on any war loan, because I would not pay any man interest on the money he lends in order to protect that money. "" When a man gives his life he gives all he has, and in the same way that this man has given his a l l , I think the capitalist, or any other man, should b""e asked to contribute all they have got. A man cannot grow another leg or another arm. He cannot come back to life once he has been killed. He has made his sacrifice, and whatever sacrifices are necessary to properly finance this war, I hope, when the census is taken, that the proper methods will also be taken to see that posterity does not have to pay for it . ' I heartily support the Government in this measure, which I do not tliink is preliminary to the introduction of conscription. The history of the war has shown us what the position is from tbe point of view of conscription. When the Cook Government was in power, 20,000 men were asked for. They came forward without any pressure. Then 50,000 men were wanted. Now 100,000 men are either in camp, on transports, or at the front. shows that the voluntary system is quite sufficient to supply our needs. I look upon this measure not as a measure of conscription, but as one that is necessary fco the proper defence of the country. If it should happen that the country needs defending, the census will enable the Government to know where to look for the men capable of carrying on that defence. .TheB ill is the first step towards national defence. towards conscription. otherwise I would not vote for it . No one can tell what the result of this war may be, and if the situation were to arise in which we required men here, there would be a good deal of indignation, if , owing to absence of organization, the Government had sent all available men away. I admit that this census should have been taken some time ago, but it is better to do it now than not at all, and I believe the w ill of the people is in favour of this census. .Just as we have taken the first step in the way of organizing the manhood of the country, so T think those who have wealth should not have the slightest objection to similar organization of their wealth. I would likn to see a clause in the B ill under which the resources of the various States could be tabulated-the possibilities of transport from one State to the other, the rolling-stock and the number of locomotives. All this information would be useful to the Commonwealth Government. We need also to obtain a census of the number of motor cars, which would probably be a greater factor in national defence than railways. to cover the same ground twice. They have all information with regard to motor cars at the police stations. to have all information with regard to transport facilities. I have not the slightest hesitation in extending my hearty support to fche B ill , though I hope when it is dealt with in Committee, the Attorney-General w ill agree to wipe out some of the details regarding the returns which have to be submitted. I refer, particularly, to that calling for returns of f u r n it u r e and personal effects, They were easily obtained. about which there is likely fco be a good deal of complication and annoyance. SupA l l that pose I am in co-partnership w it h another party in the matter of furniture and personal effects. I should like to know who is going to fill in tliis return for me. That is one of the many little things tliat will probably cause irritation. I hope fche Government w ill not insist upon that clause, because I fail to see how information of that kind can be of any service, whilst the task of filling in the return will be a great nuisance to people who just have a few pots, pans, and tables",37,William Ibvine D O You Think Set Down The Cause And I F They Are

I am quite satisfied bhat both bhe censuses proposed under this B ill are necessary, in order to make up deficiencies in our statistical information. Neither of them, however, go to bhe limits to which I am prepared bo go. As bhe B ill sbands, our information on these matters will cease with the war. order to continue the supply of this in formation we should have to revive t h is Act or to pass an entirely new measure. If bhe spirib of tliis clause be properly interpreted, then this information is wanted only during time of war. That being so, the B ill is for war purposes, and the information to be obtained under it is wholly, solely, strictly, and definitely limited to War purposes. T t is quite futile for the Attorney-General to persist in his Committee: disclaimer bhab this is not in any sense of the term a conscription measure, since such a disclaimer is inconsistent with this clause. This census of the people, their condition, their ability, and their wealth is to be taken in order that we may use them in connection with the war. The Prime Minister said to-day quite clearly and distinctly that the wealth census is being taken, as everybody believes, for the deliberate and special purpose of raising a war tax. Reorable member cannot discuss the purposes of the B ill on bhis clause. He may do so when we reach clause 4. blie B ill is to be determined by the duration of the war, and therefore the B ill is for the purposes of the war. That is a logical deduction. but it is not parliamentary. The honourable member, in other words, is not withi n the Standing Ordersi n discussing bhe question at this stage. therefore, is on the Parliament, and nob on my logic. In my judgmenb bhe information sought to be obtained under this B ill should be collected in time of peace as well as in time of war. The proposed census relates to information bhab we should have obtained long ago, and it could have been secured by an amendment of the Census and Statistics Act . I should like this clause to be omitted. Ifi t were, we could continue to obThat, to me, is most objectiontain this information after the war had ceased. We are going to spend, it is estimated, from Â£150,000 to Â£200,000 upon this census. We are going to set in motion a lot of machinery, and, perhaps, before that machinery has completed its operations the war will be over. Let us hope that it will be. The whole machinery, however, is to be set up, and as soon as the war is over, it is to autoT h a t is so. In matically disappear. I object bo that.

TheB ill is entirely unnecessary. objects not to the principle, but to the title of the B ill . whole thing. I am not opposed to the taking of a census of the life and wealth of the Commonwealth, but what is now proposed is that we shall take a war census. Despite the Attorney-General's disclaimer, this war census can be intended only for a specific purpose, and that is to enable the Government to provide men and money to carry on the war. It is very pleasing, of course, to hear the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders, and others saying that this B ill does not mean conscription, and that if they thought it did they would have nothing to do with it . When I was speaking on a previous occasion, I said that I did not like to use the word "" conscription,"" which is an ugly one, and probably the compulsory service to be rendered under this B ill will not be conscription in the ordinary acceptation of the word. According to Webster, conscription means a compulsory enrolment of men for military or naval service. nothing to do with enrolment, compulsory or otherwise. Defence, speaking at the Inter-State Conference held in Melbourne on the 14th instant to deal with the question of munitions, said-Â» Judging by the recruiting returns of the past few days, they would have sufficient men for the firing line. There is, therefore, in the opinion of the Minister who is responsible for tlie defence of Australia, no need for this compulsory enrolment. More men are offering to-day than the Department can honestly and properly handle. Between 35 and 40 per cent, of those offering are being rejected for paltry reasons. Whatever the voluntary system may achieve in other countries, in Australia it has proved absolutely equal to every demand. There is no need for this census in order to ascerT h e honourable member is tain what men are capable of serving, because those who are capable of serving are offering themselves in larger numbers than we can handle. A Bill on I said that I obsimilar lines is now before the British Parliament, and Lord Lansdowne, a member of the British Cabinet, in speaking to the measure, saidTlie country realizes that the "" old go-as-youplease system has broken down."" . . . There is not a word regarding compulsory service in I object to the the present Bill, but I believe that the country will not tolerate voluntary service with tiie present anomalies and injustices much longer. This .Bill will greatly assist compulsory service, because it will shorten the interval elapsing between the decisions to resort to compulsion and absolute compulsion. I believe with Lord Lansdowne-and I .find myself in unusual company in this respect-that the B ill now before the British Parliament has behind it the same idea as that which is behind the B ill now Attorney-General, the before us, and this B ill can only have the same result. What Lord Lansdowne says is correct. The Registration B ill in Great Britain means a shortening of the interval in the ultimate step towards absolute compulsion. OurB ill is a step towards absolute compulsion, and, if the definitions in Webster's unabridged dictionary are correct, "" compulsory registration "" is "" conscription."" For that reason I oppose the B ill , and likewise tlie proposal to take a census under the provisions of a War CensusB ill . My objections would vanish if the census proposed to be taken were taken under a Statistics T h is clause has Act, or some such measure, and if the Government were prepared to say that, in their judgment, the position of affairs The Minister of was so serious that the exigencies of the situation could not be met without compulsory enrolment and the demanding of men's services-if they said that we must have compulsion in the matter, I would be prepared to accept tlieir decision and support them. The Government, however, cannot say tliat there is need for taking that step, because their own Minister of Defence says that he has sufficient men for his purposes. Evidently the Government have become scared, or they are simply slavishly following the lead of a Tory Government in the Old Country.

We can get all the engineers we require by asking for them. Furthermore, we have unlimited authority to reject men offering for service on half-a-dozen different grounds. solely for being undersized, or for having defectiveteeth or flat feet.

I need hardly say that the wealth schedule is onÂ© which will create an enormous amount of practical difficulty in various directions. People who have had to make out returns in connection with land and income taxes are already making representations as to the superfluity of requiring them to undertake all that work again. If this Committee were asked to pass that schedule to-day, it would be obviously impossible to do it . We should require to debate it at length, and to make a great many suggestions in regard to it .

But bhe War Committee would not have sufficient time before Wednesday next to receive the advice of the special officers whom the Attorney-General has been consulting.

353,Waa To Mr Hughes,"It is the suggestiontheir name w ill he legion-who , throughout the Commonwealth, will be assisting in any way to instruct the people how to fill in the forms? It is perfectly proper to draw a line of demarcation between these two clauses. The contents of the schedules will be quite confidential. A person will fill in his form and post it , and nobody will see it unless the person furnishing it asks for assistance in filling it in . The words "" of secrecy"" may be omitted without danger. Amendment agreed to. Clause, as amended, agreed to. Clauses 10 to 13 agreed to. Clause 14 (Punishment of offences). This clause provides for a fine not exceeding Â£ 5 0 , or imprisonment not exceeding three months, or both, or, for an in dictable offence, a fine not exceeding Â£ 5 0 0 , or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both. In connection with the decennial census a person filling in the forms is given every assistance. A collector leaves the forms at the various houses; the householders are assisted in filling in the particulars, and if they fail to give in formation they are fined. TJnder this B ill , however, no assistance is to be given to the general public to obtain the papers. The public are expected to secure the papers on their own initiative ; the cards will not be delivered to the houses. I can well believe that throughout the Commonwealth there w ill be hundreds and thousands of people who will know nothing whatever about this B ill or its contents, but they will still be liable under it to the penalties to which I take exception. I ask whether the services of the Post Office could not be availed of, as they will be later to distribute pamphlets dealing with the referenda proposals, to send these schedules to the people throughout the country? members will agree that the taking of a census in the TJnited Kingdom, where 45,000,000 of people reside within an area that could be hidden away in one corner of Queensland, is a very different thing '.from the taking of a census in Australia, where, although I admit millions of people live in the big cities, neighbours in the country may be 50 miles apart. I think that the services of the Post Qffice should be availed of to furnish these schedules to the people; and we -should not ask them, under penalties, to obtain them for themselves. ney-General) [4.42] -It would be a mistake to suppose for a moment that the Post Office Department could carry out this work without so impairing its efficiency for the performance of its ordinary functions as to result in a practical breakdown. In connection witli the census, the Government Statistician had 7,000 collectors, whose sole business was to go round with the necessary forms, and they were weeks at the work. The collection of the forms after being filled in was done by this same army of workers. The difliculty will be, not as the honourable member for Capricornia seems to think, in the people getting the forms, but in the filling of them up. It is not for this Parliament, that has passed compulsory electoral registration, to baulk at this proposal. We make a man register as an elector, whether he likes it or not; we make him send his children to school; we make him see that they are vaccinated, and so on. I remind honourable members that the people of this country are now inflamed with the desire to do something, no matter what it is, to help in the stupendous task before the nation. The people, animated by tliis spirit, may be trusted to carry out the duties imposed upon them under this B ill . In existing circumstances we need not despair of people performing duties with enthusiasm that, in normal circumstances, they might ignore. Consider the circumstances. There are at least 100,000 households in Australia, and perhaps not less than 1,000,000 people, intimately concerned in this matter, because their husbands, sons, or brothers are at the front , or about to go to the front. They cannot, and will not, neglect the duties i m posed upon them under this B ill , or treat Honourable them as if they were the ordinary functions of a citizen in normal times. We are here asking them to do something which, if they will not do it , cannot be done at all. I say deliberately that if the people will not do this for themselves, it cannot be done within a reasonable time, and unless it is done quickly it is useless to do it at all.

It must be remembered that tlie penalties set out in this clause are maximum penalties. many cases do not seem to be able to understand this general rule, governing practically There may, therefore, be some misunderstanding; but I these are maximum penalties, there is no reason why a magistrate should fine any one more than Is., or should fine hira at all, for an honest mistake or an innocent oversight. offence under the B ill for which the maximum penalty might be imposed would have to be one in which it was plain that the mind of the citizen went with the offence, and that it was committed with a criminal intent. gentleman have the power to remit a fine ? part of my business every day to remit fines. I think that the penalties provided for in this clause are excessive, and I am fortified in that opinion by what the Attorney-General has said. that in 100,000 households throughout the Commonwealth there are people who are intimately concerned about this matter. That statement is surely inconsistent w it h a proposal to impose a penalty of Â£ 5 0 , or of Â£500, and in default, three to twelve months' im prisonment, with, the provisions of this measure. I remind the Attorney-General that failure to register for electoral purposes is met by a maximum penalty of only Â£ 2 . I believe this clause will be a dead letter, as the penalties proposed are monstrous. fines and imprisonment for offences under this B ill , one would think that the Attorney-General desired to make criminals of the people.

In my view, the War Committee could besfc deal with the matter, but I do not press that. I propose to make a number of amendments inthat schedule now, because I do not desire that the B ill sliould go to another place until we have done the best we can with it. Wheni t is returned from another place, in whatever form the second schedule may then be, the regulations relating to it , together w it h the schedule, will be submitted to the War Committee or to the House.

The great difficulty is not to get men to go to the front, but to equip and maintain in the field those who are willing to serve. I would ask every citizen, "" Are you willing to go to the front, and, if so, what notice would you require, after acceptance, before actually joining the colours ?"" whether a man was married or single, and whether he was childless or had children? time has come when the Government should compel certain men to remain in Australia. As the Defence Department, by using the organization which we are creating, increased its equipment we could, were these questions asked, call up recruits from the classes best fitted to serve. The Minister of Defence would be able to call up the men, have the equipment ready for them, and put them straight into the camp. I think that would be infinitely better than the method we are adopting, and that is why I suggest that these questions should be put in."" There is one other question I wanted to mention in connection with the schedule, and that is in relation to those industries, those particular industries, which I think I referred to at an earlier hour. There should be a' special effort in this census to organize every man who can be utilized in those particular industries; but I do not think this schedule is drafted in such a way as to enable that to be done. It does ask a man what employment he is actually in, and what .other employment he would be willing to engage in ; but there are certain industries for which particularly we require men. Take, for instance, the,textile industry, our Woollen Mills. In Australia there are many men wbo have had experience, perhaps, not in woollen mills, but in textile industries. where looms are employed, and I think their services might be gathered in on this occasion. Then, in regard to the manufacture of shells, I know of two or three cases myself of men in country occupations who have had experience in the arsenals in England. I do not think the details of such employment will be obtained by the census in its present form, and, therefore, it is probable that the services of such men may not be secured. -' What other occupation ""-doe s that. a man has had experience in such particular industries, and, personally, I think a separate schedule to deal with those special industries would have been the best means of obtaining the information. everybody by the notification from the Defence Department that that class of workmen is wanted. are satisfied, I am. I am simply pointing out what I think would be a better way in which to obtain the fullest organization of certain industries. Minister and Treasurer) [5.5] I do not agree with the honourable member for Richmond that the questions as they already stand do not provide for all that is required so far as concerns registration and the discovery of the occupation which a person is best fitted to perform, apart altogether from any work he may be engaged, in at present. The questions 9A and 10 set out the position very clearly, and any intelligent person filling in that return, if he has information of that character to give, will feel called upon to supply it. I have no doubt that if further questions were prescribed the effect would be really to limit the number of persons who fill them in. actual definition, of the occupation. particularizing the nature of employment will undoubtedly be of great value.

What can be the object of taking a census if , when we get it , we do nothing with it? The response has been too good already to demand any coercion, but I am not in favour of going to a great deal of trouble to collect information unless we are able to see what we are going to do with it when we have got it . TheB ill is to have effect only during the war, and the information will soon be out of date unless it is kept up. Most of the information we require we have already. monwealth Land Tax Department can tell us the value of the lands in estates above Â£5,000 in value, and the States can tell us the lower amounts. The Federal Statistical Department and the State Statistical Departments know all about tlie wealth of the country, the incomes of the people, and so on. I asked the Attorney General to let us know what Mr Knibbs thinks about this matter, and what information is desired that he cannot get from his own Department or from the Land Tax Commissioner, or the State Statistical Departments, but the Attorney-General has given me no reply on that point. If something more than we have already got is wanted we should devote ourselves to I take it that that poiut, and not go over the whole gamut, and t r y to get the whole of the information anew, with all the attendant trouble and expense. I would, of course, There would be no advantage in like to have all possible information catalogued, printed, and available, but I do not believe that it is to be of use to us during the war, unless it is to be for the purpose stated by honourable members opposite-to ascertaiu what men within certain ages are available to go to the war, and to make them go if they do not volunteer. ney-General) [5.23] I despair of being able to impress on the minds of honourable members who have lived in au atmosphere utterly remote from that now being breathed by the modern world, any conception of what the B ill is for. It is for the purpose of organizing the nation. It is a belated attempt to do that which, had it been done long ago by England and by us, would have made this war absolutely impossible.

It means the bleeding of the bestresources of the nation in men and money, aud a disorganization of commerce aud industry which we cannot tolerate. We must put our house in order. ThisB ill is to enable us to do it . Its purpose is not to send certain men to the front. Its purpose is to find out what numbers of men we have to do the things which have to be done. So many men have to be engaged in the primary industries. We cannot carry on the war unless we can sell our primary products. Cut off as we are, and must be, from those financial resources upon which Australia has depended for over 100 years, we must now depend, for the first time, on what we grow and make ourselves. Just as a man confronted witli tremendous obligations determines to utilize and develop his resources to the uttermost, so must this nation. And the first step towards this great work is to take stock. This is a national stocktaking, and the purpose for which we utilize the information must necessarily depend upon the circumstances of the case. TheB ill is not for the purpose of conscription for service either in Australia or abroad. In no circumstances would I agree to send men oufc of this country to fight against their w ill . If the day ever comes when men will not fight when their country is at deathgrips, it will be because the country is rotten to tlie core, and not worth fighting for. If the enemy comes here it will not be a question of conscription at all, for every one, young and old, must take what comes to his hand, and die, if need be, in the attempt to defend the country. for. ister reminds me, we have already provided in the DefenceA c t for compulsory service for Home Defence.

Nothing was further from my mind than fche idea of raising any controversy regarding conscription in the suggestions I made as to the direct question as to service being asked. May I repeat, as the Attorney-General has pointed out over and over again, that this Bill is fco organize fche people ? Surely, when we are going to spend a large sum of money, as we are in this work, we should secure the greatest,amount of organization possible. How can we get better organization than by finding out exactly the men who are prepared to go to the front? Thousands and thousands of affirmative answers may be expected fco fchafc question.
