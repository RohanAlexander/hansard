Mr Speaker summoned the House of Representatives to meet on Tuesday, 7th August, 1962, at 3 p.m. Tuesday, 7th August, 1962. took the chair at 3 p.m., and read prayers. with deep regret, the death on 21st July of the honourable member for Batman, Alan Charles Bird, Esq. I have to inform the House that I issued a writ on 31st July for the election of a member to serve for the electoral division of Batman in the State of Victoria in place of the deceased gentlean operation, as honourable members know, man. The dates in connection with the election were fixed as follows:-Dat e of nomination, Wednesday, 15th August, 1962; date of polling, Saturday, 1st September, 1962; date of return of writ, on or before Saturday, 6th October, 1962.

E. Bury, the Honourable D. E. Fairbairn has been appointed Minister for Air. Mr Fairbairn will represent the Minister for National Development in the House, except for war service homes matters which will continue to be the responsibility of the Minister for Social Services. Again, before we go further, I should like to say to the House that this week, at any rate, it will not be possible for my colleague, the Minister for Defence( Mr Townley), to be present. He has undergone and should not return to his duties in this House prematurely. I am happy to say that he is making very good progress. All honourable members will share with me, also, a great regret at the illness of the Leader of the Opposition, who has undergone an operation. I must say that he had not, up to that time, been looking physically very well, and apparently it turned out that he needed surgical treatment. I spoke to him on the telephone at his hospital yesterday. I am happy to report that I found him in very good",7,Setup

He was very bright, but, as I gathered, it will not be possible for him to leave hospital under a total period of a fortfamily, and I feel sure that I speak for all night, and thereafter there will be some period of convalescence. I am sure that all honourable members will agree with me in hoping that his recovery will be sufficient and complete, so that he may make in September the journey overseas to which he has been looking forward so much. BIRD, M.P. Minister) Mr Speaker, you have already referred to the death of our late friend, Mr Bird, the member for Batman, and a sitting member of this House at the time of his death. His death came after a long illness, which, as we all know, he bore with great courage and fortitude. That death removed from us a man whom, I think, we all hold personally in the greatest respect and who, 1 know, enjoyed the weH-earned admiration of members on both sides of this House. He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1949, and was re-elected at each contest thereafter. It is a very poignant comment to recall that he made what we know now, and what we suspected at the time, was an extraordinarily difficult journey in order to be sworn in as a member of this present Parliament in March of this year. His health was then failing. He knew it and we knew it, but he came bravely. He was a member of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works from June, 1951, until October, 1958. He was a member of the Printing Committee from February, 1959, until November, 1961, and a Temporary Chairman of Committees from August, 1954, until November, 1955. The mere cataloguing of Mr Bird's official appointments cannot convey the full measure of the devotion he brought to his parliamentary duties. He was a good member, assiduously attentive to his duties as a member of this Parliament. He was a man of great integrity and political resourcefulness, yet he had a natural simplicity that everybody liked and admired. Mr Bird worked hard in the interests of those he represented here, and held steadfastly throughout his life to his political beliefs. We feel sad about' his loss; all of us do. We grieve for his honourable members when I offer to his widow the deep sympathy of this House. Mr Speaker, I move That this House expresses its deep regret at the death of Alan Charles Bird, a member of this House for the Division of Batman, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in its bereavement. sition supports the motion and thanks the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) for the terms in which he moved it. Alan Bird was reared with a strong sense of religious and civic obligation. He devoted his life to the pursuit of the ideals with which he was reared. He gave a lifetime of service to his community and to the Australian Labour Party. Mr Bird was elected to the Northcote City Council in 1930, when in his midtwenties, and he was a member of that council for the rest of his life. He was elected Mayor on two occasions-in 1939 and in 1958. He was chairman of various committees and particularly of the Public Works Committee of the Northcote City Council. He was elected to the chairmanship of that committee in 1951-the same year in which he was elected to the Public Works Committee of this Parliament. Alan Bird thus had had a long and intense training in elected offices and had enjoyed the support of his community for many years before he came to this Parliament. In this Parliament, we all realized his dedication, his diligence and his decency. Even where members did not support the principles or the policies he espoused, they respected him for the integrity with which he pursued them, and for the manner in which he expressed them. He was respected and liked by every man in this place throughout the years of his membership. We knew how wide were his interests. In particular, he became an expert in three fields. He realized the responsibility which rests on an industrialized country like Australia to share in aid to under-developed countries. He realized the responsibility which rests on the National Parliament under a federal system such as Australia's to make adequate provision for housing and roads. He",11,Batman Electoral Division

However, he leaves ber who was deeply respected on both sides behind him, as evidenced by the remarks of the political frontier.

These are the matters that remain in our minds to-day as we friendly, cheerful mana man of character extend our sympathy to Mr Bird's widow and decency. Those are the qualities that and place in the annals of the Parliament we will always remember.

During all those years he gained, as he earned, the admiration of all those with whom he came in contact. In recent years he was very ill. During his illness, his wife had a very exacting joh in taking care of him. Just as she was an work, so during his later years she gave him the most tender of care in what was indeed a very exacting illness. It may be truly said of Alan Bird that he never turned his back on a struggle. He always fought cleanly and put his best foot forward. He never doubted that the clouds would break. He never dreamed, though right were Alan Bird was a thorough gentleman. He was a clean and fair fighter. He was a memory of his position, wealth and power.

I pay a tribute to Alan Bird's outstanding contributions to the debates in this Parliament. He was always ready to take part in any debate. A Whip gets to know very well the members of his party. Alan Bird was always ready when required. His speeches were always thoroughly prepared. He never did anything in a half-hearted way. His speeches were an example to all of us. He always spoke with conviction, earnestness and sincerity. It was always pleasing and informative to listen to him when he took part in a debate. His work displayed intense concentration, deep sincerity and outstanding conscientiousness. Prime Minister has said, throughout his illness he displayed wonderful courage and fortitude. I sympathize with his wife in the ordeal that she has gone through in the last few months. To Alan Bird's sorrowing wife, mother, brothers and sisters we extend our sincerest sympathy.

At the Coronation of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth in 1953, he was a member of the Australian parliamentary delegation. He was also a member of the Australian delegation to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference in 1959. Earlier, I referred to Albert Reid's entering parliamentary life. It is very interesting to recall that he also began his life of public service in local government affairs, though he went into them at the age of 21. Albert Reid was in the first Australian Imperial Force and was on the first convoy to sail from Australia. He had a very As the distinguished military career that was marked with the award of the Military Cross, which, as the honourable member for Chisholm( Sir Wilfrid Kent Hughes) will recall, was won by the late senator when he led the 4th Light Horse Regiment, which he then commanded, in the famous cavalry charge at Beersheba. Our late colleague returned to service in the Second World War, when he served with the rank of lieutenant-colonel in the Eastern Command. That, Sir, is a brief and perhaps almost not be taken as perfunctory-of a notable career of public service. We shall remember Albert Reid for those distinguished services.

This is really meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in its bereavement. a bit of Australian history, because we Opposition associates itself with this motion. Our colleagues in the other place have always acknowledged and proclaimed that Albert Reid was as upright in his conduct as he was in his bearing. He was one of a handful of men who in the 1920's made the Australian Country Party a redoubtable force in politics in the New South Wales Parliament and the Australian Parliament. Among them were Sir Earle Page, who died last year; Sir Michael Bruxner, who retired this year; and the honourable member for New England( Mr Drummond), who has announced that he will retire at the next federal elections. Albert Reid was of their number and of their character. The influence of these men was felt and has had an enduring effect on the party with which their party is associated and on the party to which it is opposed. Sir, we mourn with his relatives. He gave distinguished service in two wars and in municipal, State and Federal politics. We are all his debtors. Trade) I desire to associate myself and my colleagues of the Australian Country Party with the motion that has been moved by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and so eloquently supported by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Whitlam). The late Senator Albert Reid was indeed a very distinguished member of the Australian Country Party. He served this country in peace and in war during his lifetime. He evinced an interest in public matters very early in life, and as quite a young man he became a meniber of the Farmers and Settlers Association of New South Wales. As the Prime Minister mentioned, he became active in local government when he was as young as 21. When war broke out in 1914, he was one of the first to enlist in the Australian Imperial Force.

Albert Reid, as a captain, led his squadron in that dramatic event with such courage and distinction that he was awarded the Military Cross for his participation. Upon his return to civilian life in Australia he renewed his association with the Country Party and in 1927, he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales as the member for Young. He served the party there with such distinction that in the 1930's he became Minister for Agriculture in the Government of New South Wales, an office which he discharged with distinction. He re-enlisted in the Second World War and after serving for a period as Deputy Director of Recruiting in the State of New South Wales, he spent two years in the Australian Imperial Force. In 1949 he was elected to the Senate as a Country Party member and, as the Prime Minister reminded us, after a period of service as a Temporary Chairman of Committees he became the Chairman of Committees of the Senate, an office which he upheld with dignity. In that capacity he earned both for himself and for the chamber the respect that derives from occupancy of an office with dignity and distinction. I have never heard any one say that he acted other than with complete impartiality in that high office. Certainly he acted at all times with great devotion to the Country Party, and he will always remain in our minds as a figure of consequence, of character and distinction in the annals of the Country Party. I extend, with others, sympathy to Lis widow, Mrs. Reid, whom many of us-and our wives-know . We will miss her visits to Canberra.

11,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister forMr Speaker, I wish to associate myself with the tributes which have been paid to the late Senator Albert David Reid, man of the Parliamentary Joint Committee and also with the message of condolence to the members of his family. Albert Reid and I became members of the Parliament of New South Wales many years ago. We were colleagues in the Country Party and I served with him in two ministries in the life of one parliament. He was one of the finest type of Australian citizen and certainly one of the finest type of parliamentary representative with whom I have had the honour and pleasure to be associated. As Minister for Agriculture in New South Wales he made a marked contribution to the thinking upon the conservation of water and had the proposals he made been carried into effect instead of being delayed by the onset of war, they would have assisted materially in the development great qualities of the back country and of of rural New South Wales and would have added to the wealth of this country.

He was a member of the Standing Committee on Broadcasting, chairon War Expenditure and chairman of the Board of Management of the Australian War Memorial. I have given just a very brief summary of his parliamentary activities and experience. He also had a long and interesting history of activity in union affairs. He devoted a great deal of his energies to those affairs, particularly in his earlier days. He was one of the pioneers of the Australian Workers Union, and I think I am right in saying that he held the No. 1 membership ticket in that union until he died. He was a foundation member of the Western Australian branch of the union, which was established in 1908. He was State Secretary from 1936 to 1940 and Federal President from 1942 to 1948. This was all very proper, because if ever a man exhibited in himself what we regard as the people who work there, it was Victor Johnson. I cannot imagine a better man to be president of that great and famous union. I cannot imagine a better man from Western Australia, and from the interior of Western Australia.

15,Mr Mcewen (Murray,"Minister forJames. For members of the Australian Country Party, it is sad to speak of the passing of George Bowden. He had been a leading figure in the Australian Country Party organization in Victoria. For three years he was chief president of the Victorian organization before becoming the Country Party member for Gippsland in this House. He represented that constituency with distinction for eighteen years. As has been said, Mr Bowden's qualities were accorded recognition by the House when he was made Chairman of Committees, and in that position the force of his quiet strength of character evidenced itself. He sustained the kind of discipline that is seen in a democratic parliament without any semblance of the iron fist and certainly without any suggestion at any time of partiality in the exercise of his office. He was respected in this place. George Bowden served the Australian Country Party well at the organization level and in this Parliament, and he will always be remembered and respected as a distinguished parliamentary member of that party. Mr Bowden was a member of the First Bowden, but otherwise I shall confine my Australian Imperial Force, and he served remarks to my former Western Australian in some of the most bitter fighting in colleague, Victor Johnson. When I was France as a captain with the 24th Battalion. first elected to this place, Mr Johnson was He was wounded three times and finally the senior Western Australian member.

So we recall George Bowden as a man held all five seats for Western Australia within every meaning of the word, and as a in this place. Mr Johnson went out of colleague liked by his team mates and by his way to show me very great kindness in his political opponents alike. He was a man helping me to find my feet here and for respected by all and his passing is regretted that I shall always remember him with by all.

We liked and respected Victor Johnson, and I record the regret of myself and my colleagues at his passing. Rowland James was a member of this House when I first entered it in 1934. He was a very active and vigorous member who left no one in any doubt about his complete understanding of the problems of the men who worked in the coal-mines and the women and children who lived in the coal mining areas. In Mr James, human qualities were complete. He fought vigorously and well and, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said, he fought effectively for all he believed in with a special concentration on the community of the coal-fields. Rowley James had a full life. It was a life of distinguished service to his party, his community and the Parliament. I express the sympathy of the Australian Country Party to the relatives of each of our three former colleagues. like to identify myself with what has been said about Rowland James and George When I first met him, I thought Victor Johnson was the most radiantly happy man",18,Deaths Of Former Members
16,Mr Beazley (Fremantle),"I shouldsee directly the effect of his decisions as had been his experience when he was a union organizer. He was a man whose formal schooling came late in life, and that gave him a very great deal of sympathy for people who were inarticulate. As a union organizer, he frequently had to deal with people who did not know their rights. They lived in remote areas and some of them were Australians of aboriginal race. He, as a union organizer, was their advocate and a man whose duty it was to explain their rights and to enforce their rights. His other concern was that the particular industry with which he had to deal-the gold-mining industry-ha d been a great source of ill health to very many men in Western Australian history, and zeal for the battle for legislation, and the enforcement of legislation, which would compensate the men for miners' phthisis burned in his heart for many years. He was, therefore, a man whose whole training was to assist people who had difficulty in assistI am sure that the fact that so many people ing themselves. As Minister for the Interior, Mr Johnson did an extraordinarily conscientious job. As I have said, he was the doyen of the Western Australian members at the time when a Labour government was in office and those of his colleagues in Western Australia who were associated with him when the Chifley Government was in office will remember him with gratitude. like to associate myself with the remarks that have been made. I join with previous speakers in expressing my regret at the passing of Mr Bowden and Mr James. In particular, I pay tribute to Vic Johnson, who was a man who battled throughout his life to ensure that the people he represented at various times received justice and fair play. Unfortunately, at the time of his passing I was in a rather isolated area in the north of Western Australia and I was unable to attend his funeral and pay my respects. However, I was very pleased to learn that a large number of people followed Vic to his last resting place. This showed without a doubt that he was held in high regard as a very worthy citizen. Of course, those who attended his funeral were only a small proportion of the people who would have liked to have paid their respects to him. Vic Johnson was known throughout the length and breadth of Western Australia, particularly in the north and north-westin what we term the back country-wher e he spent most of his early years in the pastoral industry as a shearer. He was known in those early years as a top-class shearei. Many honourable members may not be aware that Vic suffered a very severe shock shortly before his demise. I refer to the ultimely death of his son, Merv. Merv and Vic were very closely attached and I am sure that Merv's death played a vital part in the final collapse of Vic. I join with other honourable members in expressing my sincere sympathy to Mrs. Johnson and the remainder of the family at the passing of both Vic and Merv. The loss of a husband and father and a son and brother in such a short time is a very severe blow for any family to receive. However, attended Vic's funeral and expressed their regrets to his family softened the blow. As the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and other honourable members have said, Vic Johnson played an important part in the formation of the Australian Workers Union in Western Australia. To a very large extent, he laid the foundation on which the union is so firmly placed at this time. It has been said that Vic held the No. 1 ticket in the union. He took out the very first ticket to be taken out in the Western Australian branch of the union and continued to hold that ticket with considerable pride for some 50 years. I had the pleasure and privilege of travelling with Vic Johnson throughout his electorate. He was well and favourably received wherever he went. WhereverI went in his electorate, I always met several people who were old mates of his and who held him in very high regard. Vic was a jolly good mate to be with in the bush. He would keep the party not only amused but also interested with the stories he told of his early days as a shearer, of his experiences as an organizer for the union and of his life as a member of the Parliament. I did not have the pleasure of seeing Vic",19,Deaths Of Former Members

I remember once in the Workers Club in Boulder, when we were having a drink, a chap selling sweep tickets said to Vic, "" What is your name? "" Vic put down his glass, put his hand on the other man's shoulder, as he always did, and said: "" Young fellow, you have not travelled very far. If you had, you would have seen my name on every gum tree at every bend in the road."" I join with others in expressing my deep regret at the passing of Vic Johnson and extend my sympathy to members of his family. associate myself with the remarks of other honourable members regarding the deaths of former members of the Parliament. I first entered the Parliament as the successor of Colonel Bowden and I was gratified when many members from both sides of the House approached me and asked after his heal'.h. This showed some of the esteem in which he was held in this place. Throughout the electorate of Gippsland many people inquired after his health right up to the time of his passing. He was held in very high esteem. He served the Australian Country Party well, he served the electorate of Gippsland well and he served the Parliament well. He was noted for his sense of humour. I remember an ocasion during a meeting of the Australian Country Party in Gippsland some years ago when my father, in making a speech, referred to the fact that the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Authority was taking water from the upper reaches of the Snowy River. He said, "" They are even taking our water "". Colonel Bowden, who was sitting alongside him, said, ""What; without an anaesthetic! "" This was typical of the man. Frequently he could get himself out of some bother with a lit'.le quick quip. Colonel Bowden was held in the highest esteem by the people of Gippsland, and I would like to asociate myself with the expressions of sympathy to his family. myself with the expressions of condolence at the passing of the late George Bowden, Vic. Johnson and others whom we remember on this occasion. I am deeply moved by the expressions of sympathy at the passing of my late dad. He represented the electorate of Hunter for many years. The welfare of the people of the electorate was always uppermost in his mind. I now have the honour of representing the electorate and I will strive to serve the people I represent with the same tenacity, sincerity and honesty of purpose as my dad did. He was an ordinary man. His philosophy of life was, never try to be something that you are not. He bore malice to none. He believed in charity for all. I know that our family will obtain great satisfaction from the kind words uttered in the chamber to-day by the Prime Minister, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and other honourable members. associated with these remarks, and I should like particularly to say a few words about the late George Bowden. I met George Bowden a few days after my election to the Parliament on 9th February, 1946. For ten years I travelled by train with him to Canberra. We used to share a sleeping compartment. When you travel with a man under those circumstances you get to know him very well. Our friendship remained right up until his death. I had the privilege of visiting George Bowden at his home and when he was a patient in Heidelberg Hospital. George Bowden was a man who stood for those principles that have made the British people great-principle s without which we cannot long endure. His sister, Mrs. Murphy, tended him with great care, and I pay a particular tribute to her. George Bowden was a man of great faith and confidence. He was a popular speaker at ANZAC Day ceremonies and at other functions. I was impressed by his recollection of something that he saw in ANZAC Cove at a spot where the cliff jutted out. He told me that as he walked round the corner of the cliff he saw a rough cross marking the resting place of a soldier. On that cross was a placard bearing the wordsHalt, soldier, ere you pass me by.

When I visited him recently he said, ""Give messages to all my friends in the House of Representatives and the Senate"". That meant everybody, because everybody was friendly with him. He said, "" I will be back to see them soon"". He kept his confidence and faith. It must be some consolation to his sorrowing relatives -to Mrs. Murphy especially-to know, as I know, that when George Bowden passed to the great beyond he was prepared to meet his Maker.

24,Mr Harold Holt (Higgins,"Trea balance of payments. The spokesmen forchief instrument of policy, has been carefully shaped to do that. As to continuance of expansion the course is, surely, plain enough. We must give the immediate situation all necessary support and, when I have explained the position, it will, 1 think, be clear that the Budget does that. But we must not concentrate the whole of our attention on the immediate future. We have to look to the period beyond and establish conditions and put action in train that will encourage and promote and provide a sound basis for continued expansion. Especially by the Budget provisions for development-for projects, large and small, that will open up new and great resources as well as enlarge and modernize the existing facilities of our economy-w e will leave no doubts as to our intentions in that direction. We must enlarge the sources of Our export income if we are to generate employment opportunities in our rural, mining, manufacturing and other industries on the scale necessary to match the growth in our work force. There is still too little recognition of the link between export income and our objective of full employment. Without an adequate export income, we cannot have created for us the job opportunities which a growing workforce will need. I come now to our supposed pre-occupation with a future boom and the risk of our reversing current policies. Naturally we do not want another boom like that of 1960. Not many do. It would, of course, be denying a great deal of experience to say that another boom could not occur-man y things can cause a boom and they can crop up suddenly. But we see nothing in the present situation, external or internal, that will necessarily lead to a boom; on the contrary, we see no reason why, given forethought, responsible management and cooperation between government and business, expansion should hot continue at a good strong pace, absorbing resources as they become available without running into a condition of excess demand which is the real essence of a boom. We are not ruled by fear of a boom; but and here already our policies have won when I am told, as I am from time to time, for us an important advantage. We know that we are preoccupied with stability. 1 that, while costs in countries abroad, readily admit that charge-jus t as I reject especially the countries of Western Europe the implications that our critics read into it. and Japan, have been rising fast, our costs To me, stability means three things, all have been largely stable. If our industries, related to and dependent on one anothersteady growth, a balance between current supply and demand and stable costs and prices. At that, it is one of the great objects of economic policy. We have pursued it consistently through thick and thin and, despite all the doubts and jeers and recriminations, we have achieved it. By most tests, this country is in a position of great strength to-day. Production and sales are improving in most branches of industry and trade and in all States. Externally, our position is as good as we have known it for very many years. Capital is flowing in. Money for investment and for current spending is abundant. Employment, though not as high as we would like to see it, is certainly high by the standards that prevail in many countries. Prices and costs are stable and the pay envelope has held its purchasing power in a year of better values. There have been widespread gains in managerial efficiency and competition is now keen in many sectors of business. The public is getting the benefit of reduced prices in many important lines, and this has particular merit for young people setting up homes. The housewife has welcomed the wider choice and better value offering to her. It would be easy enough to wreck all this by some ill-judged stroke-som e action that caused a sudden upsurge of demand or a sweeping addition to costs in industry. It could be eroded, too, by the edging up of prices and costs over a widening field until a rising spiral began again. It could be dissipated in some renewed outbreak of speculation. Those are the kinds of things the Government does not want to see happen, and the great majority of people does not want to see them happen either. From the external stand-point, with trade competition sharpening and likely to sharpen further, and the unknown possibilities of the Common Market ahead of us, it is critically important that they should not happen. Costs are vital both to our exporting industries and to the industries which compete with imports in our home market; or any of them, have difficult days to come, I can think of no better way of safeguarding them than this; and it is for hard, practical reasons such as these, and not from any morbid fear of past events repeating themselves, that we emphasize the need for stability and plan and work for it. THE BUDGETARY SITUATION. I shall now state, in terms of estimated payments of such benefits to pensioners by expenditures and receipts, the financial nearly £1,000,000.

THE NATIONAL WELFARE FUND. Payments from the National Welfare Budget if I indicate that, in 1949-50, payFund are estimated to be £387,574,000, an ments from the National Welfare Fund increase of £22,383,000 over expenditure were equivalent to some 47.7 per cent, of last year. Age, invalid and widows' pensions are expected to rise by over £13,000,000. This figure reflects both the increased number of beneficiaries and the full year effect of the substantial increases in benefits made in our last Budget. Payments of pharmaceutical benefits under the general scheme are expected to rise by rather more than £5,000,000 and Since certain parts of the hospital benefits agreements with the States will expire in the near future, the Minister for Health Although expenditure on unemployment ruary, expenditure on this item is estimated to be about £3,000,000 less this year than in 1961-62. This is because we expect unemployment to be reduced further in the According to its practice, the Governyear-whic h is more than a four-fold increase. It may illustrate how largely such payments have come to share in our revenue from income tax and social services contribution paid by individuals. The comparable figure for 1961-62 was 68 per cent, and it is estimated to reach 72 per cent, in the current year. A most welcome feature of the past year has been that, in each quarter thereof, the consumer price index recorded a small fall. Taking into account this experience, the wide-ranging increases in benefits in 196162 and the budgetary situation now confronting it, the Government has decided not to vary the current scales of benefit. Further details of the National Welfare Fund estimates are contained in Statement No. 4. WAR AND REPATRIATION EXPENDITURE. War and Repatriation expenditure in 1962-63 is estimated to be £110,701,000, which is £6,363,000 greater than expenditure last year. Like National Welfare Fund expenditures, it embodies both a greater number of beneficiaries and the substantial increases in rates of benefit made in our last £5,437,000, an increase of £215,000 over Budget. For reasons similar to those I have just £14,120,000, an increase of £1,320,000 stated in relation to National Welfare Fund over expenditure in 1961-62. Here again benefits, the Government has decided not there has been a transfer to Capital Works to alter the current scales of repatriation and Services from ordinary services, the benefits in 1962-63. This item also makes amount in this case being £78,000. a relatively large call on our budget resources. If estimated expenditure on war and service pensions and allowances, repatriation hospitals and other repatriation benefits is added to National Welfare Fund vices in the Territories is estimated at payments, total expenditures of these kinds £35,207,000, which is £4,879,000 more would be equal to 91 per cent, of our than the amount expended last year. I ask estimated revenue from income tax on the committee to make particular note of individuals in this financial year. Other special appropriations, including expenditure in the Northern Territory is certain bounty and subsidy and price expected to rise by £1,482,000. Honourable stabilization payments, are expected to members opposite would do well to comamount to £36,744,000 in 1962-63, or pare the massive provision being made in £4,332,000 less than in 1961-62.

Departmental expenditure in 1962-63 is estimated to be £148,041,000, an increase of £8,637,000 over expenditure in 1961-62. The estimate includes £91,111,000 for the running costs of Commonwealth departments and authorities, an increase of £4,653,000 on expenditure last year, and £56,930,000 for other expenditures under the control of departments. Details are given in Statement No. 3. A sum of £106,459,000 is set down for ordinary services of the Post Office. Expenditure was £114,772,000 in 1961-62, but £13,000,000 is being charged this year to Capital Works and Services on account of certain items of a capital nature previously charged to ordinary services of the Post Office. On a comparable basis, Post Office expenditure would show an increase over last year of £4,687,000. Current expenditures by the Commonwealth Railways are estimated at last year, and current expenditures by the Broadcasting and Television Services at Expenditure in 1962-63 on ordinary serthis increase. The grant to the Papua and New Guinea Administration will be increased by £2,700,000 to £20,000,000, and provided from Consolidated Territory-wit h the provision which they Payments to or for the States are expected this year to reach a total of £422,575,000, which is £26,013,000 greater than comparable payments in 1961-62. Financial assistance grants are tentatively estimated to be £305,290,000, an increase of £13,150,000 over last year. Commonwealth Aid Roads grants will be £54,000,000, which is £4,000,000 more than in 1961-62. Again, it is interesting to recall, in passing, that less than £9,000,000 was provided for this purpose in the year in which we took office. Assistance for universities will rise by £1,733,000 to £15,894,000.

An amount of £24,150,000 is proposed for expenditure this year by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority. Last year the authority spent £16,010,000. The increase of £8,140,000 is attributable in the main to larger contract payments on the major works comprising the Murray1 power project, which is scheduled for commissioning in 1966. Some £13,100,000 of the total will be charged to Loan Fund, where it will be met from proceeds of the International Bank loan negotiated early in 1962. 1 Estimated capital expenditure of £62,643,000 by the Post Office represents an increase of £15,704,000 on expenditure last year. As already mentioned, £13,000,000 of this increase arises from an accounting transfer. Provision of £4,175,000 is being made for expansion of television and broadcasting services, compared with £2,847,000 last year.

ThisI thought necessary to provide a firm basis for confidence, and to remove any remaining fears that growth might falter and lose impetus. As I see it, this is not a matter for budgetary measures alone. It involves the whole range of economic policy measures and, amongst them, I have always given high importance to the immigration programme. The assurance of a continued strong growth of population has become the foundation of forward planning for innumerable enterprises and authorities and, for that reason as well as for many others, the Government has long considered it imperative that immigration should continue at the highest possible level consistent the Loan Council to a borrowing prowilh our capacity to absorb more people. Accordingly the immigration target for 1962-63 remains at the unchanged level of 125,000 permanent and long-term arrivals. The programme will be matched to the needs of the economy and to the best interests of the individual. Hence recruiting will concentrate on skilled and semiskilled workers and their dependants and on re-uniting the families of migrants already here. It is also, I contend, the particular role ments, and is part of the borrowing proof our developmental activities to furnish gramme for State works and housing to the economy, so far as governmental action which I have just referred. With part of can do so, with a basic assurance of conthis money the States will build houses and tinuity in growth. By that means we reach flats, some for rental, the majority for sale forward into the months and years ahead, on very favorable terms to home-seekers, making certain not only that there will be and the remainder they will advance to a large and increasing measure of activity building societies. The Commonwealth and demand but also that the basic facilities will also be providing £35,000,000 for will be there when other forms of enterprise, war service homes, £5,900,000 for housing and especially private enterprise, require in the Australian Capital Territory and the them.

Over the past eleven years we have in this way provided the States with no less than £800,000,000 to support their general developmental activities. Incidentally, although it makes no direct call on our own resources, we agreed at gramme of £105,155,000 for State semi governmental authorities, and we also took the initiative in removing the overall limit on borrowings by authorities which individually seek £100,000 or less in this financial year. I may also say, in passing, that this year the Commonwealth will provide directly and indirectly over £91,000,000 for housing. Of this, £45,900,000 will take the form of advances to the States under the Commonwealth and State Housing AgreeNorthern Territory, £3,000,000 for homes However, the more characteristic form aid for roads, which has been going on for many years. In recent years, however, In this new phase, however, we have the Commonwealth, aim to further particular purposes.

Thus, in Queensland, we are providing making provision for payment to the State on a repayable advance basis two-thirds of this year of the remaining amount of the finance for the great Mount Isa railway £1,432,000. project, the construction of which, I am told, is making splendid progress.

I am now pleased to be able to announce that, following discussion with the Queensland Government, we are including in the Budget this year an amount of £1,750,000 to assist in financing the first stages of a scheme to open up and develop to full production a vast area of the rich brigalow lands in the Fitzroy Basin of Central Queensland. We are satisfied, after investigation, that these brigalow lands offer magnificent possibilities for increasing the outAustralia for financing the purchase of put of beef for export. A detailed agreement is being worked out with the Queensland Government and in due course legislation will be brought before Parliament. In Western Australia the huge project to Under the existing scheme for development in the north-west of Western Australia, whereby the Commonwealth undertook to find £5,000,000 over a five year period commencing with 1958-59, we are Last year we made an extra grant of further grant of £700,000 to the State for Further, after discussions with the GoTaken with our developmental activities in the Northern Territory-w e are allocating Australia as a whole. For the improvement of coal loading facilities at certain ports in New South Wales we are providing £685,000 in this financial year, compared with expenditure last year of £284,000. There will, in addition, be a grant of £415,000 for that purpose from the Coal Industry Fund of the Joint Coal Board. The grant from that source last year was £172,000. Under the agreement reached with South twelve diesel-electric locomotives and 100 wagons to transport ore on the Broken Hill-Port Pirie railway, we have included an amount of £1,300,000 in our 1962-63 Estimates.

Together, such conadvances to be provided from the Loan cessions are estimated to cost revenue Fund in respect of the Mount Isa railway £75,000,000 in the current financial year, project. Bringing together the main expenditure groups, we have the following picture of estimated commitments in the financial year 1962-63:Expenditure ordinarily charged to Consolidated Revenue Fund .. 1,725,815,000 business undertakings, of which £7,200,000 State works and housing programmes Other Loan Fund expenditure .. Redemptions . . 2,091,760,000 The total receipts of the Consolidated Revenue Fund this year are estimated to be £1,665,432,000, which is an increase of only £23,890,000 on actual receipts in 1961-62. Within this total, revenue from all forms of taxation is estimated at £1,418,000,000, an increase of £9,426,000 on revenue obtained from the same sources last year. This would be approximately the same as our total taxation revenue in 1960-61. In making these estimates we have additional revenue is estimated to be allowed for very considerable increases in £175,000 in a full year and £131,000 in employment, earnings, imports and sales of 1962-63. Miscellaneous revenue, which goods subject to sales tax and excise; but includes the above charges, is estimated to two important factors will be operating this increase by about £4,900,000 in the current year to keep any increase in revenue over financial year, mainly because of increased last year down to small proportions. One receipts from the proceeds of electricity is the fall during 1961-62, compared with sales by the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electhe previous year, in incomes that will be tric Authority. whereas in 1961-62 their cost amounted to only £38,000,000. We are reckoning on increases of about £10,800,000 in collections from customs duties, £10,400,000 from excise duties, £6,200,000 from sales tax and £3,000,000 £ from pay-roll tax. An increase of about £9,000,000 is expected in revenue from .. .. .. 250,000,000 is from the Post Office, £400,000 from 9,945,000 Commonwealth Railways and £1,400,000 .. .. 106,000,000 from broadcasting and television services. In accordance with the policy announced in 1960 of working progressively towards full recovery of the cost of air navigation facilities, there will be an increase of 10 per cent, in air navigation charges for airline operators and also certain increases in the charges payable for private, aerial work and charter aircraft. Details will be announced by the Minister for Civil Aviation (Senator Paltridge). The additional revenue is estimated to be £177,000 in a full year and £89,000 in 1962-63. It has also been decided to increase Commonwealth rates of charges for lighthouse services from ls. to ls. 3d. per net registered ton from 1st October, 1962. The LOAN RAISINGS. To estimate public loan raisings is always a difficult matter, because the result can be affected by rapid changes of conditions in the course of the year that cannot possibly be foreseen at the start. Last year the total, including State domestic raisings, was f243,041,000, but that was altogether exceptional-easil y a record for any peacetime year. Our loans had good support from most quarters but what made the principal difference was the very heavy subscriptions of the trading banks. Their liquid funds rose greatly and were largely invested in Government securities, which were obtained partly by subscriptions to Commonwealth loans and partly by purchases elsewhere. While in the current year it is likely, as far as we can foresee, that the position of the trading banks will be fairly liquid, it is improbable that they will have as much to invest in Government securities as in 1961-62. Apart from that, however, we see no present reason why the level of subscriptions from other sources should fall away, and we will also be drawing upon the proceeds of the loan negotiated early in 1962 with the International Bank for the Snowy Mountains Scheme. Taking these considerations into account, we feel justified in adopting for Budget purposes a figure of £215,000,000 for public loan raisings in 1962-63. It may be worth pointing out that this would be the same as the amount raised in 1958-59, which was previously the record peace-time year and one in which there were also heavy subscriptions from the trading banks as well as a large total of overseas borrowings. tion are set out in detail in Statement Apart from revenue and the proceeds ment No. 5. of public loans, we expect to have available from the National Debt Sinking Fund about £80,000,000-approximatel y £3,000,000 more than last year-for redemption of maturing securities and other similar expenditures, and perhaps a expected to have on our economic situanet amount of £13,000,000 from other tion through the financial year. Trust Funds. Altogether, therefore, receipts from the level of activity we desire to see. On revenue, public loan raisings and the other estimates we have, there may be a net sources just mentioned are estimated this year to total £1,973,432,000. If, as estimated, total expenditure this year is £2,091,760,000, there will be a deficiency of £118,328,000. This would compare with the actual deficiency of £27,010,000 in 1961-62. As I have said, the main reasons for this increase in the deficiency are to be found in the large increase in the Commonwealth's total expenditure commitments and in the negligible rise in our total receipts. On the basis of our estimates, total expenditures in 1962-63 are expected to rise by over £100,000,000. Total receipts, however, are expected to increase by less than £10,000,000. It is proposed that £51,000,000 be appropriated from the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve against the possibility that loan raisings will, by that amount, fall short of the total funds required for the State works and housing programme. It is also envisaged that defence expenditure to an amount of £98,283,000 will be charged to Loan Fund and that, so far as redemptions of debt exceed the amount available in the National Debt Sinking Fund to meet them, they will be met from the resources of the Loan Consolidation and In-estment Reserve, cash being raised as required against investments of that reserve. Legislation to authorize such borrowings as may be necessary to meet the deficiency will later be submitted to Parliament. The estimates of our overall Budget posiNo. 2 attached to the Budget speech. Further details of estimated loan transactions in 1962-63 are contained in StateHaving outlined the Budget, I now take up the question of the effect it can be I said earlier that, although expansion had made good headway in 1961-62, it still had some way to go before reaching addition of about 85,000 people to the work-force during the year. Some of these may find occupations on their own; but the majority will be seeking wage or salary jobs. There is also a certain number of people who do not depend on continuous employment but who will take a job if one that suits them comes on offer. Besides these additional workers, there are the unemployed; I have already said that we regard the total of these as being still too high. To cope with this quite formidable task of absorbing labour, it is clear that there has to be a substantial and continuing rise in the demand for labour-directly , as on building jobs or in transport and the service greater than in 1959-60. The State trades or, indirectly, through the demand for goods back along the lines of production. Spending by the public on consumer goods and services is, of course, by far the largest element in total demand. Normally, it comprises about 60 per cent, of domestic expenditure and, for that reason, it has the largest potential influence on productive activity and demand for labour. Recognizing this, the Government reduced sales tax on household equipment in the Budget last year and, in February, we provided the rebate of ls. in the £1 on individual income tax. Since then, there has been a fairly strong rise in the total of consumer spending. Provisional statistics of retail sales for the recent June quarter show an increase of 3.6 per cent, over the June quarter of 1961, and, as there has been some fall in prices since then, the quantity of goods sold has increased by more than that. There should be a lot more to support consumer spending from now on. With employment rising and more overtime being worked, spending in the shops ought to increase further. During the next few months, moreover, there will be a big outflow of tax refunds-estimate d to total more than £90,000,000 this year-whic h always helps to boost sales, and these should more than offset, for the time being, the drop back in the rebate on pay-asyou-earn instalments from the temporary level of 3s. in the £1 to ls. in the £1 from 1st July. Besides these income factors there is, without doubt, a big accumulation of potential spending power. Savings bank deposits increased during 1961-62 by no less than £157,000,000. Meanwhile, people have until recently continued to reduce their debts on hire purchase and similar contracts, and this has put them in a position to do more buying on credit as and when they are disposed to do so. By and large, therefore, the rise in consumer spending ought to be well sustained. Public authority expenditure is the next largest source of demand for goods and services. In 1961-62 it was 8.4 per cent, greater than in 1960-61 and 16.1 per cent, governments will have available from Commonwealth sources about £34,000,000 more than in 1961-62, and their own revenues will increase this year. Since, on the figures I have given earlier, our Commonwealth expenditures-ne t of provision for the States-wil l also rise considerably, it is quite clear that public authorities as a whole will be making substantially increased contributions to demand in 1962-63. Other large classes of expenditure have also been rising. Dwelling commencements in the June quarter are estimated at 21,238, an increase of 4.4 per cent, over commencements in the March quarter and 10.7 per cent, more than in the June quarter of 1961. The value on completion of non-residential buildings commenced in the March quarter of 1962 was 15.7 per cent, greater than in the March quarter of 1961, and the indications are that the upward trend has continued since then. Registrations of new motor vehicles in the six months to June totalled 145,575, an increase of 26.3 per cent, over registrations in the first six months of 1961 and of 1.6 per cent, over registrations in the first six months of 1960. Registrations in May and June of this year exceeded those in the corresponding months of 1961 by 40.5 per cent, and those in the corresponding months of 1960 by 7.1 per cent. Some doubts have been expressed about the trend in private capital expenditure. In respect of building construction and motor vehicles, there seems little reason for concern and these, after all, comprise about two-thirds of what is described as private fixed investment. It seems reasonable also to expect that expenditure on plant and equipment will respond to the investment allowance available since February and to the prospects of expanding production and sales. I think I have said enough to show that recent trends in most of the chief branches of spending have been headed upwards. They are likely to continue that way. Looking at the financial side of things, it certainly seems that ample finance should be available to support such trendsI have already mentioned the great increase in savings bank deposits. It is also common knowledge that the hire-purchase companies are well supplied with funds to finance an increase in credit buying. The trading banks are abnormally liquid for this time of the year and, through 1961-62, their commitments for future lending increased very greatly. From f1,579,000,000 in July, 1961, the total of their outstanding overdraft limits rose to a record level of £1,741,000,000 in July last. In 1961-62 actual advances outstanding fell quite heavily, though largely for seasonal reasons, until the later months, when they began to rise again. Although this movement was also partly seasonal, there are grounds for thinking that it portends a continuing rise. As the huge net outflow of cash from the Government occurs, mainly during the next few months, the liquidity of the banking system and the public will certainly increase and, taking the financial outlook as a whole, it is a fair inference that the forces line and second-line reserves totalling over making for expansion are not likely to be checked by any dearth of money for investment or community spending. So much, then, for demand prospects. carry on, in certain directions with added What is to be said about production and emphasis, the full range of stimulatory the supply of goods generally? Output has measures adopted during 1961-62. This been rising in most branches of manufacinvolves budgeting for a deficit, in the turing-strongl y in some-and there is no accounting sense, of £118,328,000. Essenevident reason why this should not go on. tially, as I have said, we are doing this to Demand is on the increase, labour and ensure that expansion shall not falter. Permaterials are available, industry has wide haps I may first offer a few comments on access to supplies from abroad, a good the general effect such a budget can be many firms are said to have some margin expected to have on the trend of demand. of spare plant capacity. All this should help towards a steady growth of industrial output. In the rural field, seasonal conditions have so far been favorable in most areas. The wool clip is estimated to be slightly larger than last year, when it was a record, and very large plantings of wheat have been reported. A big sugar crop is in sight. There may be some increase in production of beef and it seems possible also that production of mutton and lamb will be maintained at the high level of last year. At this stage prospects seem generally fair in most of the other rural industries. Externally, a good many uncertainties overhang world production and trade in 1962-63 and there could be some falling back from the very high point our exports reached last year. On the other hand, imports are certain to increase considerably as industrial activity and demand rise here. There will, however, be some off-setting factors. Capital inflow has continued to be fairly strong, and we will be drawing quite heavily on the International Bank loan arranged for the Snowy Mountains scheme last year. By now, too, it is probable that most, if not all, the import credits taken out in 1960-61 have been repaid. In point of overseas reserves, our position is very strong. At the end of June our balances of gold and foreign exchange stood at £561,000,000 and, as we have repaid the £78,000,000 drawn from the International Monetary Fund in 1961, our drawing rights with that institution have been restored to their full amount of £212,000,000. All told, we started the year with first£770,000,000. It is, then, in a promising context such as this that the Government has decided to Our 1961-62 Budget was a lot more expansionary than the cash result on an accounting basis made it seem. On that result, there was a deficiency of £27,010,000, which was financed by treasury-bills and a reduction of cash balances with the Reserve Bank. But, in economic terms, the impact was a great deal larger than that-mainl y for the reason that a very considerable amount of government spending wasfinancedby the proceeds of loan subscriptions from trading bank sources, from money market dealers and possibly from other sources which could not be said to represent a subtraction from funds which would otherwise have been used to finance private spending. On the same grounds, the economic impact of this Budget will be greater than the estimated accounting deficit of £118,328,000 might indicate. This is because the estimated loan raisings included in total receipts allow for some trading bank and similar subscriptions to loans, even though not on the same scale as last year. I should also point out that the expansionary effect will be fairly heavily concentrated in the next six to eight months, which is normally the period during which the outflow of cash from the Government greatly exceeds the inflow. For that reason, the Budget can be assumed to provide the greatest stimulus to demand through a time in which it is likely to be most needed. Let me refer next to the character of some of the measures we are carrying forward into this year. They were all carefully designed originally to stimulate particular sectors of demand, and they will undoubtedly continue to do that in the current year. The large reductions in sales tax-firs t on household equipment and next on motor vehicles and parts-were meant to boost public spending on those classes of products, and the rebate on individual income tax rates was intended to encourage spending over the whole range of consumption goods. The investment allowance, on the other hand, aims to encourage investment in manufacturing equipmenta class of expenditure which was thought to have been lagging. It is very likely that the effect of that allow-and now being continued. To be sure, as ance would not have shown up much in tbe months between February and June, but it is likely to be more in evidence from now on. In all, these and the other concessions made in 1961-62 are estimated to cost revenue some £75,000,000 in 1962-63, and virtually all of this will represent additional funds in the hands of taxpayers. Along with these measures goes the special interest-free grant to the States for employment-giving activities, now to be continued in 1962-63 at an increased figure of £12,500,000. I cite these facts to show that not only will the Budget give a large aggregate stimulus to demand in the current year but that, in large part, the stimulus will be channelled to those sectors where it is likely to do most in promoting expansion and increasing employment. It has been put to us by a number of people that, besides carrying on the 1961-62 measures, the Government should introduce some new measures to stimulate the economy, preferably in the shape of further tax reductions. We gave a lot of thought to these possibilities but, on our assessment of how the economy is moving and of the encouragement it is likely to get from the increased stimulus in the Budget we propose, they did not appear to be justified. In fact, we concluded that they could lead to difficulties which might be serious, if not immediately, then at some time not too far ahead. On the one hand, they could be the means to provoke a rise in spending greater than expansion will require. On the other hand, they would almost certainly create major budgetary problems at some time in the future. For it has to be kept in mind that, in our efforts to promote expansion, we have called upon our budgetary resources very freely. Taking the rise in expenditure last year with the projected rise for this year, our total expenditure will have risen over two years by no less than £263,000,000. Meanwhile tax concessions have made deep inroads into our sources of revenue. As I have already shown, the estimated deficit for this year is, in part, due to the short-fall of revenue on account of reduced incomes in 1961-62, but to a greater extent, it is the product of tax reductions made last year and additional expenditure undertaken last year employment and incomes improve, revenues will improve; but if only because of our large standing commitments, expenditures are bound to rise also. To give a further major tax reduction at this stage would make it practically certain that the Budget a year or so hence would be carrying a large builtin deficit-this , quite probably, at a time of high incomes and expenditure. There would then be the choice of either carrying such a deficit, with the risk of inflation£110,000,000. The comparable figure for ary consequences, or else of taking action to bridge an insupportably large gap. On the latter possibility, I may be allowed to remark that my colleagues and I have less liking than most people for policies of stop and go. It could perhaps be that the significance of what we are doing in carrying forward all the special expansionary measures of last year may not everywhere be fully appreciated and it may be useful if I draw the picture together -bot h in an aggregate sense and in careAsI have said, the tax concessions of 196162-the sales tax reductions on household equipment and motor vehicles, the rebate on individual income tax and the investment allowance-ar e estimated to cost revenue £75,000,000 this year as against £38,000,000 last year. And there is a point I might make here about the investment allowance. Because tax collections in 196263 will be affected only by what manufacturers save through the investment allowance on account of plant installed during the last five months of 1961-62, the cost to revenue this year will be only a portion of the full year cost-abou t £6,000,000 according to the estimate and this is the figure included in the £75,000,000 total. But it can hardly be doubted that the stimulus to expenditure on factory plant in 1962-63 will be much greater than this £6,000,000 figure suggests because manufacturers will have in prospect a tax saving in 1963-64 through the allowance being available on all kinds of eligible plant they install throughout this year. I recall that in February we estimated the full year cost of revenue of the investment allowance to be something of the order of £17,500,000 and that was regarded as a conservative figure. Of the special measures involving expenis, predominantly and in the truest sense, diture there is the grant of £12,500,000 to forward-looking and constructive. tbe States for employment-giving activities and there is the large increase in expenditure this year-fro m £9,800,000 to £26,800,000 -o n the special development activities and projects I described earlier. Summed up, the expansionary action of last year, which is to be continued and amplified through 1962-63 will cost the Budget-and in so doing put into the hands of the community-somethin g above 1961-62 was about half that. IfI am told that much of the stimulus in 1961-62 was concentrated in the last five months of the year, I must recall my earlier point that a great part of the stimulus from this Budget will be concentrated in the first six to eight months of 1962-63, the period in which it is likely to have the most useful results. In fact, then, we are providing the economy with a considerable extra stimulus fully-chosen specific ways. We are doing this at a time when the general level of activity is undeniably on the rise, as indeed it has been for a good many months past. Wider though its field becomes, year after year, it is still, in our conception, a key role of the Commonwealth in the economic sphere to provide an environment favourable to private enterprise and all who depend on it for employment and share generally in its activities and the fruits of its efficient production. This is a matter, first of all, of establishing a strong foundation for the economy. Beyond all reasonable doubt we have done that. It is a matter, secondly, of removing any needless impediments to enterprise. Not since the Second World War began have there been so few restraints on Australian enterprise as there are to-day. It is a matter, finally, of using the powers and resources of the Commonwealth, within their limits, to encourage enterprise and to open up sound opportunities for it. In that direction this Commonwealth Budget contains an unparalleled range and variety of measures to promote development in all the main regions of the continent. It pays due regard to the need for care that any responsible Government must observe, and yet its approach to our national economic problem I commend it to the committee. PART A -SUMMAR Y OF BUDGET RESULTS, 1961-62. In the financial year 1961-62 the total expenditures of the Commonwealth Government exceeded its total receipts by £27,010,000. When the 1961-62 Budget was introduced it was estimated that there would be an overall deficiency of £16,471,000; in February, 1962, a series of measures designed to increase employment and business confidence was introduced, the estimated direct cost of which, in that year, approximated £53,000,000. The final Budget result was also affected by exceptionally high subscriptions to public loans in Australia during 1961-62. The comparison between the overall Budget results for 1961-62 and the preceding financial year is as follows:ExpendituresConsolidated Revenue Fund(<i) Defence Services charged to Loan Fund State works and housing programmes Less State domestic raisings War Service Land Settlement Mount Isa railway project . .

Expenditure ordinarily charged to the Consolidated Revenue Fund, including an amount of £23,641,000 of expenditure on Defence Services charged to Loan Fund but excluding the payment to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve, totalled £1,643,028,000 in 1961-62, which was £147,310,000 greater than in 1960-61. Receipts of the Consolidated Revenue Fund totalled £1,641,542,000 or £3,263,000 more than in 1960-61. After charging £23,641,000 of defence expenditure to Loan Fund, the amount available for payment to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve was £22,155,000.

As State domestic raisings in 1961-62 amounted to £2,880,000, the amount to be met from loan raisings by the Commonwealth was £244,620,000. Cash proceeds during the year from loans raised in Australia and overseas totalled £240,214,000, compared with £140,291,000 in 1960-61, an increase of £99,923,000. The amount of Commonwealth assistance required to finance State works and housing programmes was therefore £4,406,000. Redemptions of matured securities, repayments of loans from the International Bank, market repurchases and other expenditures from the National Debt Sinking Fund totalled £94,598,000 in 1961-62 compared with £101,251,000 in 1960-61. The income of the National Debt Sinking Fund in 1961-62 was £76,651,000, compared with £73,853,000 in the precedingfinancialyear. During the year agreement was reached with the Queensland Government on the basis on which the Commonwealth would provide advances to Queensland for the rehabilitation of the Mount Isa railway line. Initial advances to the State from Loan Fund during the year totalled £3,750,000. ReceiptsPayments to the States for War Service Land Settlement amounted to £1,577,000 in 1961-62.

Taxation revenue fell short of the estimates by £57,477,000 offset by an increase in other revenue of £1,822,000. Customs revenue was £2,655,000 less than the Budget estimate, refecting a lower level of imports than had been expected. Excise collections were £577,000 greater than the estimate. Clearances of tobacco, cigarettes, spirits and diesel fuel were lower than anticipated but were more than offset by higher clearances of petrol and beer. Sales tax collections were less than the Budget estimate by £11,982,000, partly due to the reduction in rates of tax on motor vehicles, spare parts salary payments being lower than expected. and accessories which became effective as from 7th February, 1962, and partly to the fact that sales of taxable goods during the first half of the year were lower than had been estimated.

Total expenditures of the Commonwealth Government in 1962-63 are estimated at £2,087,760,000, or £100,187,000 greater than in 1961-62. Receipts of the Consolidated Revenue Fund and Trust Fund and proceeds of loan raisings are estimated to total £1,969,432,000, leaving a deficiency of £118,328,000. In 1962-63, total expenditures of the Commonwealth are estimated to rise by £100,187,000 but an increase of only £8,869,000 is expected in total receipts, compared with actual increases in total receipts of £120,136,000 in 1961-62 and £150,036,000 in 1960-61. The main reasons for the estimated increase of £100,187,000 in total expenditures in 1962-63 are(a) Expenditure on social service payments from the National Welfare Fund and on War and Repatriation Services is estimated to increase by £28,745,000 in 1962-63. (fi) Payments to or for the States, payments to the States from the Loan Fund and the State works and housing programmes which the Commonweallh has undertaken to support are estimated to increase in 1962-63 by £33,131,000. (c) The total amount of redemptions of securities maturing in 1962-63 and other repurchases, repayments, &c, to be met in 1962-63 is expected to be £11,402,000 greater than in 1961-62. The main factors accounting for the comparatively small estimated increase of £8,869,000 in total receipts in 1962-63 are(a) Receipts of the Consolidated Revenue Fund are estimated to be £1,665,432,000, or £23,890,000 more than in 1961-62.

(fi) Receipts of £16,000,000 are anticipated by way of initial drawings on the International Bank loan for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme. However, proceeds of public loans (other than State domestic raisings), which increased substantially in 196162 mainly because of the highly liquid monetary situation, are expected to decline by £45,214,000 and are estimated at £195,000,000 for 1962-63. (c) The income of the National Debt Sinking Fund is expected to be £3,349,000 greater than in 1961-62 and other Trust Fund balances are expected to increase by £10,844,000 more than in 1961-62. In 1961-62, expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, excluding the transfer payment to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve, was £1,619,387,000. In addition, £23,641,000 of expenditure on Defence Services was met from the Loan Fund, so that total expenditure ordinarily met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund was £1,643,028,000. The comparable figure for 1962-63 is estimated at £1,725,815,000, of which £13,100,000 of expenditure on the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme is expected to be charged to the Loan Fund. It is proposed to charge an amount of £98,283,000 of expenditure on Defence Services to the Loan Fund in 1962-63 so that, excluding the payment to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve, expenditure charged to the Consolidated Revenue Fund is estimated to total £1,614,432,000 in 1962-63. On this basis, it is estimated that the Consolidated Revenue Fund will be balanced after the payment of £51,000,000 to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve, whence this amount will be available to assist in financing State works and housing programmes. The approved Loan Council borrowing programme for State works and housing for 1962-63 is £250,000,000, or £2,500,000 greater than the finally approved programme for 1961-62. Pending a review of the position at the end cf the first half of the financial year, the Commonwealth is making advances on the basis of an annual programme of £250,000,000. For purposes of estimating the Commonwealth's financial requirements it has been assumed that the borrowing programme will in fact be £250,000,000 and that the gap between this amount, less the amount of State domestic raisings, and Commonwealth loan proceeds available towards the programme will be filled by Commonwealth assistance from its own resources. As State domestic raisings arc estimated to amount to £4,000,000 in 1962-63, the amount which would have to be met from Commonwealth loan raisings and Commonwealth assistance is estimated to be £246,000,000. In 1962-63, loan proceeds (excluding State domestic raisings and receipts from the International Bank loan for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme) are expected to amount to £195,000,000. Loan finance will again be required in 1962-63 to finance payments to the States for War Service Land Settlement. The amount so required is estimated to be £1,750,000, compared with £1,577,000 in 1951-62. Advances to Queensland for the Mount Isa railway project are estimated to be £8,195,000 in 1962-63 compared with £3,750,000 in 1961-62.

Redemptions of matured securities, repayments of loans from the International Bank, market repurchases, &c, are expected to total £106,000,000 in 1962-63. The income of the Nalional Debt Sinking Fund is estimated to be £80,000,000, which would fall short of the estimate of redemptions, repurchases, fc, by £26,000,000. In 1961-52 the income cf the National Debt Sinking Fund was £76,651.000, and in order to finance the total of £94.598,000 of redemptions, repurchases, &c, the Sinking Fund supplemented this income by drawing on its balances. Receipts from the International Bank loan for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme are estimated to total £16,000,000 in 1962-63. It is estimated lhat £13,100,000 of expenditure on the Scheme will be charged to the Loan Fund in 1962-63. The difference between receipts and expenditures from Loan Fund is expected to arise from differences in timing between expenditures on the Scheme and drawings against the loan. In 1961-62 there was a net increase of £2,156,000 in other Trust Fund balances, which supplemented the funds available from loan proceeds and the income of the National Debt Sinking Fund in meeting commitments outside the Consolidated Revenue Fund. In 1962-63 it is estimated that £13,000,000 will be available from this source. The foregoing figures are brought together in the table below, which compares the prospective overall Budget result of the Commonwealth in 1962-63 with the actual result in 1961-62.

If loan raisings available for this programme are £195,600,000, a further £51,000,000 will be required to complete the programme. It is expected that this amount will be Receiptsprovided from a Special Loan subscribed from the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve.

Excise colleclions in 1962-63 are expected to total £276,000,000 compared wilh £265,607,000 in 1961-62. The estimated increase of £10,393,000 is expected to result mainly from increased clearances of beer, cigarettes ancl locally produced petrol in 1962-63. Some increase in Excise collections from other dutiable goods, with the exception of tobacco, is also expected. In 196162, Excise colleclions rose by £8,195,000. ITEM N O. 3 -SALE S TAX. Sales Tax collections are estimated to total £155,000,000 in 1962-63, which would be £6,182,000 greater than in 1961-62. Collections in 1961-62 were £24,198,000 lower than in 1960-61. The increase in the sales of taxable goods, and in particular of passenger motor vehicles, in the later months of 1961-62 is expected to continue during 1962-63. However, the increase in sales tax collections in 1962-63 on this account will be greatly reduced by the full year effects of the reductions in rates of tax on household and domestic equipment which were made in the 1961-62 Budget and on motor vehicles, spare parts and accessories from 7th February, 1962, as part of tbe measures announced at that time. ITEM It is estimated that collections of Income Tax from individuals in 1962-63 will be £538,000,000, or approximately the same as in 1961-62. In 1961-62, in spite of the introduction as part of the February, 1962, measures of the 5 per cent, rebate of personal income tax which applied to the whole of the income of that financial year, Income Tax collections from individuals rose by £18,601,000. Net"" pay-as-you-earn"" collections in 1962-63 are expected to exceed those of 1961-62 by £24,500,000 as a result of higher wage and salary levels and an anticipated rise in employment. It is estimated that overall there was some decline in the 1961-62 incomes of taxpayers with income other than salary and wages, who are subject to provisional tax. Assessments based on these incomes will be issued in 1962-63. In addition, the 5 per cent, rebate of tax will apply to provisional tax collected on account of 1962-63 incomes as well as to tax assessed on 1961-62 incomes. As tax assessed but not collected at 1st July, 1962 was lower than the corresponding figure at 1st July, 1961, collections from this source in 1962-63 will be lower than in 1961-62. Collections, other than "" pay-as-you-earn"", are expected therefore to be £23,800,000 less than in 196162. It is estimated that Tncome Tax collections from companies in 1962-63 will be £262,000,000 which would be £20,688,000 less than in 1961-62. Collections in 1961-62 showed little change from the level of 1960-61. The decline expected in 1962-63 collections mainly reflects the fact that company incomes in 1961-62 (subject to assessment in 196263) are estimated to have been lower than in the preceding year. Collections of tax on 1961-62 company incomes will also be reduced as a result of the investment allowance which came into effect from 7th February, 1962. In addition, collections in 1961-62 would have been lower had there not been a higher rate of collection on assessments compared with 1960-61. Although this higher rate should be maintained, no corresponding benefit lo revenue on this account can be expected in 1962-63. Dividend (Withholding) Tax, which came into operation as from 1st July. 1960 in respect of certain dividends paid by Australian companies lo non-residents, is expected to yield £7,000,000 in 1962-63, a decline of £1,116,000 compared with collections in 1961-62. Dividends subject to Withholding Tax in 1962-63 are not expected to reach the high levels obtaining in 1961-62. Colleclions in 1961-62 were £2,157,000 greater than in 1960-61. It is estimated that total Income Tax collections in 1962-63 will be £807,000,000, or £21,150,000 less than in 1961-62. ITEM No. 5 -PAY-ROL L TAX. Pay-roll Tax collections in 1961-62, totalling £60,972,000, were slightly less than 1960-61 collections because of rebates of Pay-roll Tax paid to NO. 4 -INCOM E TAX. exporters under the export incentive system which was introduced as from 1st July, 1961. After allowing for an increase in these rebates in 196263, and also for the higher level of employment and wage and salary payments expected in the current year, it is estimated that Pay-roll Tax collections will total £64,000,000, or £3,028,000 more than in 1961-62. Estimated collections in 1962-63 of Estate Duty and Gift Duty at £17,000,000 and £3,000,000, respectively, are expected to be little changed from 1961-62. ITEM NO. 8 -BUSINES S UNDERTAKINGS REVENUE. The operating revenue of Commonwealth Railways is expected to increase by £398,000 in 1962-63 with increasing traffic on the Trans-Australian and Central Australian Railways. Small decreases are expected on the North Australia and Seat of Governmem Railways, in the latter case due to the incidence of receipts and not to a decrease in earning rate. Post Office receipts are estimated to increase by £7,186,000 to a total of £147,000,000 in 1962-63, due to the growth in postal, telephone and telegraphic traffic. Broadcasting and Television revenue is estimated at £13,800,000, or £1,447,000 greater than last year, mainly because of an expected increase in the number of television viewers' licences. ITEM N O. 9 -TERRITORIE S REVENUE. Territories revenue in 1962-63 is estimated to be £6,551,000, compared with £5,996,000 last nnanciai year. The estimated increase of £555,000 comprises £76,000 in the Northern Territory, and £479,000 in the Australian Capital Territory. The increased revenue in the Australian Capital Territory relates primarily to rental returns from a larger number of Government-owned dwellings, increased sales of such dwellings, and an increased level of repayments of housing advances.

A continuing decline in receipts from the disposal of surplus stores and materials is also expected. Interior -Revenu e in 1962-63 is estimated to be £559,000 below the amount collected in 1961-62 because of lower receipts expected from sales of property. Civil Aviation -In 1961-62, there were certain receipts which are not expected to recur in 196263. These included £551,000 as repayment of an advance and interest by Qantas Empire Airways Ltd., £633,000 as a dividend from Qantas and £51,000 as a final dividend from Tasman Empire Airways Ltd. In 1962-63, the payment in the nature of a dividend by the Australian National Airlines Commission is expected to increase by £35,000. Air navigation charges are expected to increase by £116,000; £89,000 of this amount is expected to result from the proposed increases in the rates of charges which are estimated to yield £177,000 in a full year. Primary Industry -It is estimated that revenue will be £309,000 greater in 1962-63 than in 1961-62, with increased collections expected from the cattle slaughter levy, the wool use promotion levy and the dairy produce levy.

War Service Homes-Interest -The estimated increase of £689,000 in 1962-63 compared with 1961-62 reflects the larger total amount of advances outstanding under the War Service Homes scheme. General Trust Fund-Interest -The estimated decline of £354,000 in 1962-63 compared with 1961-62 anticipates a reduction in the holding of Commonwealth Inscribed Stock by the General Trust Fund. Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority The interest and depreciation components of the proceeds from electricity sales are payable to Consolidated Revenue.

Defence expenditure in 1962-63 is estimated to be £210,000,000 which is £6,922,000 greater than actual expenditure in 1961-62. The main items contributing to the variations shown in the above table are:Defence-The increase of £1,111,000 is mainly for the purchase of equipment and the provision of staff for the Electronic Data Processing Centre. Navy -Expenditur e in 1962-63 is estimated to be £1,146,000 in excess of the expenditure in 1961-62. This is due, in the main, to increases of £902,000 in the provision for the purchase and construction of ships, £2,484,000 in respect of the purchase of aircraft and £552,000 for defence research and development, partly offset by estimated at £2,200,000 from accumulated proceeds of sale of uranium oxide produced since in 1954-55 at Rum Jungle under an agreement with the Combined Development Agency. Of this amount, £1,294,000 represents repayment of Commonwealth advances to the project, the balance being profit on operations. In 1961-62 the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission repaid £500,000 from advances received, but no corresponding payment is expected in 1962-63. Actual Estimated Increase. Expenditure 1961-62.

Army -It is estimated that Army expenditure will be £2,142,000 in excess of that for 1961-62, because of increases in expenditure of £895,000 for pay, maintenance and general services mainly resulting from an increase in the strength of the Permanent Forces, £1,119,000 on the maintenance of arms and equipment and £346,000 on new buildings and works. Expenditure for maintenance of the forces overseas is expected to decline by £264,000 and expenditure on the purchase of new equipment by £204,000. Air -Items contributing to the increase of £1,161,000 are increases of £252,000 on administrative expenses, £756,000 on the purchase of equipment and stores and £284,000 on maintenance of buildings and works; there is an estimated reduction of £298,000 on the purchase of aircraft. Supply -The increase of £1,156,000 is mainly due to increased provision of £1,121,000 for research projects, £522,000 for machinery and plant and £822,000 for the purchase of motor vehicles and equipment which hitherto had been charged to a Trust Account. These increases are partly offset by a reduction in the Australian contribution to the Joint United Kingdom Australia Weapons Research Project of £1,500,000. ITEM NO. 12 -PAYMEN T The National Welfare Fund Act 1952 provides that the payment from Consolidated Revenue to the National Welfare Fund each year should be equal to the actual expenditure from the Fund in that year.

Sinking Fund contributions in 1962-63 are estimated to total £27,472,000, compared wilh £25,109,000 in the previous financial year. The estimated increase of £2,363,000 reflects the normal rate of accumulation in these contributions. Interest payments on debt repayable overseas are estimated to increase by £404,000 in 1962-63 as a result of the additional loans floated in the United States and the Netherlands during 1961-62. The estimated decrease of £3,012,000 in interest payments on debt repayable in Australia reflects an estimated decline of £2,100,000 in accrued S.E.A.T.O -Economic Assistance -Furthe r assistance to the value of £1,000,000 to S.E.A.T.O. and Protocol States is proposed for 1962-63. This is an increase of £423,000 on the expenditure in 1961-62.

Loan redemption and conversion expenses in 1962-63 are estimated to be £440,000 less than in 1961-62. No expenses will be incurred by the Commonweallh in respect of debt maturing overseas during 1962-63. Moreover, the amount of debt maturing in Auslralia in respect of which the Commonwealth is responsible for redemption and conversion expenses will be considerably less than in 1961-62.

Public Service Pensions and Retiring Allowances-The estimated increase of £1,179,000 in expenditure in 1962-63 reflects the normal growth in Commonwealth contributions to the Superannuation Fund and the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Fund. Primary Industry Research and Sales Promotion-Expenditur e in 1962-63 is estimated to increase by £302,000 principally because payments under the Wool Use Promotion Act and the Cattle and Beef Research Act will reflect the anticipated increases in receipts from the wool use promotion levy and thc cattle slaughter levy. See Item No. 10-Miscellaneou s Revenue. An increased Commonwealth contribution for cattle and beef research is also expected. Bounties -Includes those items shown in previous years under the head Bounties and Subsidies, with the exception of the Butter and Cheese Bounties, the Flax Fibre Bounty and payments to the Wheat Prices Stabilization Fund. Comments on all these items are set out in an addendum to this Statement. International Bank Subscription -T n August, 1957, Australia agreed to release the then outstanding balance of £15,910,000 of its 18 per cent, capital subscription to the Bank for use in its lending operations in member countries. The agreement provided for this amount to be released over five years in roughly equal annual instalments. The last instalment of £2,801,000 was made available in 1961-62. International Monetary Fund -Expenditur e of £721,000 in 1961-62 related to an obligation incurred by Australia under the Fund Articles of Agreement to increase the gold portion of its subscription to the Fund. No corresponding provision is made for expenditure in 1962-63.

The estimated expenditure of £700,000 in 1962-63 represents the cash payment of £113,000 plus the amount of demand securities which it is estimated that the International Development Association will cash in 1962-63. Expenditure for this purpose in 1961-62 was £113,000, or £587,000 less than the estimate for 1962-63. Colombo Plan-Indus Basin Development Fund -Becaus e of a temporary slowing down in the rate of disbursements by the Fund, expenditure in 1962-63 is estimated to be £1,000,000, or £358,000 less than expenditure in 1961-62. Stevedoring Industry -The Stevedoring Industry Act 1954-1961 requires the payment to the Stevedoring Industry Authority of amounts equal to revenue raised under the Stevedoring Industry Charge Act 1947-1962. Expenditure in 1962-63 is expected to be £1,064,000 more than in 1961-62 because of an increase in the rate of charge effective from 1st April, 1962. See Item No. 10Miscellaneous Revenue. Wheat Prices Stabilization Fund -Unde r the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act 1958-1960, growers are guaranteed a return based on "" cost of production"" in respect of up to 100 million bushels of wheat exported from each of the five wheat crops for the seasons 1958-59 to 1962-63. If the average export price for a crop exceeds the guaranteed return, growers are required to contribute to the Wheat Prices Stabilization Fund. When the average export price for a crop falls below the guaranteed return, the deficit is made up by drawing upon the Wheat Prices Stabilization Fund, and, if that Fund is exhausted, by payment from Consolidated Revenue. In 1961-62 payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund amounting to £11,906,000 were made in respect of the 1959-60 and 1960-61 crops. In 1962-63 it is expected that a payment of £7,500,000 will be necessary to make ITEM No. 15 -DEPARTMENTA L EXPENDITURE. Estimated Expenditure 1962-63, Compa.red With Actual Expenditure 1961-62.

New expenditures to be incurred in 1962-63 include the visit of the King and Queen of Thailand, the visit of the Duke of Edinburgh to open the Commonwealth Games in Perth, and the 1963 Royal visit, provisions for which total £240,000. Reductions in estimated expenditure include £160,000 in respect of the Commonwealth Games; £193,000 in respect of cyclone relief in Western Australia and £50,000 in respect of bushfire relief in Victoria. External Affairs -The estimated decrease in expenditure of £620,000 in 1962-63 is the net product of an expected increase of £343,000 in running costs and an estimated decrease of £963,000 in expenditure on other services. The estimated increase in running costs is expected from increases in expenditures of £186,000 for salaries of additional staff and for increases in overseas allowances; of £57,000 in respect of the full year costs of posts opened during the year in . Tanganyika and Korea; and of £62,000 in the expenses of the Antarctic Division. The cost of the Colombo Plan Consultative Committee Meeting, to be held in Melbourne during the year, is estimated at £60,000. The estimated decline in expenditure on other services is due primarily to the estimated savings of £1,722,000 in respect ofUnited Nations Forces. As a result of alternative financing arrangements, no contributions will be made in 1962-63 towards either ihe United Nations Force for the Congo or the United Nations Emergency Force, to which Australia contributed £1,576,000 and £146,000 respectively, in 1961-62. On the other hand, provision is made under other services for increases of £801,000 for expen-' diture under the Colombo Plan and £58,000 under other bilateral aid programmes. Treasury -Lowe r running costs account for £346,000 of the estimated decrease of £383,000 in expenditure in 1962-63. The running costs of the Statistician's Branch are expected to fall by £645,000 in 1962-63, chiefly because of the higher than normal expenditure incurred in 1961-62 in connection with the population census. This saving is expected to be partly offset by an increase of £262,000 in running costs of the Taxation Branch, of which £197,000 is for additional salary costs. Attorney-General's -Increased expenditure of £287,000 expected in 1962-63 is almost entirely in respect of an estimated increase in running costs. Of this increase, £198,000 is attributable to additional salary expenditure, including reclassifications of Legal Officers and the filling of vacancies. Administrative expenses are expected to rise by £89,000, due mainly to the initial printing and other costs associated wilh the administration of the Matrimonial Causes Act and to accessions to the staff of the Patents Office. Inierior -The estimated increase in expenditure of £119,000 reflects a corresponding estimated increase in running costs. Increases in expenditure total £433,000, of which £172,000 relates to office accommodation, services and rent and £146,000 to expenditure by ihe Meteorological Bureau. On the other hand, expenditure by the Electoral Branch is expected to be £314,000 less than in 1961-62, when the Federal Election was held. Works -Expenditur e is estimated to increase by £476,000 in 1962-63 as a result of expected increases in running costs. Before allowing for recoveries, which are expected to be £452,000 greater than in 1961-62, the running costs of the Depanment are expected to rise by £928,000 in 1962-63. The gross increase in running costs includes £300,000 for filling new and vacant positions, £80,000 for a special staff inlake in Papua-New Guinea, and an increase of £212,000 for fees to private architects. In addition, the repairs and maintenance provision is £90,000 more than last year's expenditure. Civil Aviation -It is estimated that expenditure will increase by £647,000 in 1962-63, of which £607,000 reflects an expected increase in running costs. The main components of this increase are £408,000 for maintenance and operation of aerodromes and airways facilities, £119,000 for administrative wages and salaries, and £73,000 for rent and meteorological services. Customs and Excise -The estimated increase of £184,000 in 1962-63 is expected to arise from an increase of £177,000 in running costs of which £139,000 is expected to' be required to meet the cost of new ' staff positions and the filling of existing vacancies. Health -Of an estimated increase in expenditure of £950,000 in 1962-63, £298,000 is the' result of an expected increase in running costs. An additional £165,000-is required for salaries, a substantial part of which relates to the filling of existing vacant positions associated with the National Health Scheme. Administrative expenses under the Scheme are also expected to increase by £82,000. Expenditure on other services is estimated to be £652,000 greater than in 1961-62, of which £636,000 arises from the transfer to annual appropriation of certain items of expenditure previously met from the National Welfare Fund. Trade -Of the estimated increase in expenditure of £425.000 in 1962-63, £266,000 represents an estimated net increase in running costs, mainly because of expected increases of £98,000 in the cost of staff in Australia and £191,000 in expenditure on the Trade Commissioner Service. Expenditure on other services is expected to be £159,000 greater than in 1961-62. The additional grant to the Australian National Travel Association accounts for £61,000 of this increase while the subsidy to the South American Shipping Service accounts for an increase of £75,000. Primary Industry -Increased expenditure on other services accounts for most of the additional expenditure of £292,000 expected under this item in 1962-63. It is proposed to contribute £205,000 towards the cost of purchase of premises by the Australian Wheat Board and to grant £149,000 to New South Wales and Queensland for recharging cattle dips. Payments of bounties on butter and cheese are expected to tota] £13,500,000 in 1962-63, the same amount as in 1961-62. Further details of these bounties are given in the addendum to this Statement. Social Services -The estimated decrease in expenditure of £325,000 in 1962-63 is the net result of an estimated increase in running costs of £146,000 and a decrease in expenditure on other services of £471,000 arising from an estimated decrease of £473.000 in payments in respeci of ihe building of homes for the aged. Shipping and Transport -It is estimated that expenditure in 1962-63 will be £372,000 more than in 1961-62. Running costs are expected to increase by £92,000, while costs of other services are expected to rise by £280,000, mainly because of an increase of £246,000 in expenditure on assistance to the shipbuilding industry. Immigration -Of the estimated increase in expenditure of £901,000 in 1962-63, £860,000 is in respect of other services. This increase reflects expected increases in expenditure of £986,000 on Assisted Migration and £91,000 on migration publicity, and decreases in expenditure of £98,000 on the accommodation and maintenance of migrant families, £83,000 on non-recurring shipping expenses, and £79,000 on education in the English language. Labour and National Service -The estimated increase of £179,000 in expenditure in 1962-63 is wholly in respect of higher running costs and for the most part reflects the full year cost of additional staff appointed during 1961-62 as well es additional expenditure, estimated at £72,000, to be incurred in holding the Sth Asian Regional ITEM Estimated Expenditure 1962-63, Compared With Actual Expenditure 1961-62.

War and Service Pensions and Allowances Of the estimated increase of £4,985,000 in war and service pension payments, £4,190,000 is attributable to expected increases in the number of pensioners and in the rates of pension following re-assessments of incapacity; the balance of the estimated increase reflects the full year effect of amendments made to the legislation in 1961. Hospitals and Other Institutions -It is estimated that operating expenses of Repatriation hospitals, out-patients clinics, artificial limb factories and ANZAC hostels will rise by £376,000 in 1962-63. Of this increase, £122,000 is attributable to the full-year cost of additional staff appointed during 1961-62 and the cost of filling a small number of approved vacant positions in 1962-63. The cost of the first stage of a five year ward reequipment programme is estimated to be £110,000; and increases in other operating expenses largely associated with increased numbers of in-patients are expected to total £144,000. Conference of the International Labour Organization in Australia during 1962-63. National Development -It is estimated that expenditure in 1962-63 will be £3,492,000 greater than in 1961-62.

Of the balance, amounting to £505,000, £155,000 is due to an anticipated increase in the number of visits by local medical officers and a rise in certain medical fees and £295,000 is attributable mainly to increased expenditure on travelling, sustenance and other expenses associated with the increased numbers receiving medical and related treatment. An additional provision of £91,000 is also made for the Soldiers' Children Education Scheme. Reconstruction and Rehabilitation -Expenditur e in 1962-63 is estimated to be £439,000 less than in 1961-62, mainly because of an expected decline in the amount of the Commonwealth's contribution towards certain capital losses incurred under the War Service Land Settlement Scheme.

Post Office -The apparent decrease in estimated expenditure by the Post Office in 1962-63 results from the transfer of expenditure to the Capital Works and Services Vote of £13,000,000 on items of a capital nature, previously provided under Ordinary Services Vote. If this transfer had not been made, the estimated increase in expenditure would be £4,687,000. Of this amount, expenditure on stores and materials is expected to increase by £2,192,000, mainly be:ause of a new basis for the purchase of motor vehicles which were formerly handled through a Trust Account. £1,500,000 is required to meet the cost for a full year of increases in salaries, wages and allowances during 196162, and additional staff to be recruited in 196263.

Financial Assistance Grants -Unde r the provisions of the States Grams Act 1959 the financial assistance grant payable to each State in 1962-63 is to be determined by adjusting the grant paid to that State in 1961-62 in accordance with a formula based on estimated movements in the population of that State between 1st July, 1961, and 1st July, 1962, and the percentage increase Papua and New Guinea -The estimated expenditure of £20.201,000 in 1962-63 relates almost entirely to the grant of £20,000,000 by the Commonwealth to the Administration of the Territory to meet the difference between proposed expenditure and local revenue in the Territory, it is estimated that expenditure by the Administration will increase by approximately £4,000,000 in 1962-63. of which £2,700,000 will be met from an increase in the grant by the Commonwealth. This will permit the recruitment of additional staff and increased expenditure on capital works and services, particularly for housing, schools, hospitals, roads, bridges, wharves and electricity generation and reticulation.

The States Grants Act 1962 provided that the grant deemed to be payable to Victoria in 1961-62 for this purpose is £72,730,000. Revised preliminary estimates made by the Commonwealth Statistician indicate that the financial assistance grants payable to the States in 1962-63 under the States Grants Acts 1959 and 1962 will total £305,290,000, or £13,150,000 more than the grants paid under those Acts in 1961-62. The final determination of the grant payable to each State will be made by the Statistician as the necessary data become available later in the year, and in any case, as required by the legislation, not later than 31st December, 1962. Special Grants -The Commonwealth Grants Commission has recommended special grants for the claimant States totalling £11,251,000 in 1962-63, compared with £11,231,000 in 1961-62. Of this total amount recommended for payment in 1962-63, the Commission has recommended that Western Australia be paid £6,210,000, compared with £6,156,000 in 1961-62, and Tasmania £5,041,000, compared with £5,075,000 in 1961-62. Additional Assistance Grants -As one of the measures announced by the Commonwealth in February, 1962, to stimulate employment, an additional assistance grant was provided to the States on a repayable basis under the authority of the States Grants (Additional Assistance) Act 1962 for expenditure on employment-giving activities, mainly in the works field, in the remaining months of 196-1-62. At the Loan Council meeting and Premiers' Conference in June, 1962, the Commonwealth offered to make available to the States in 1962-63 a similar grant of £12,500,000 to be expended by the States at their discretion on employment-giving activities.

The Sinking Fund contributions made by the Commonwealth in respect of State debts existing at 30th June, 1927, and incurred since that date, vary according to the nature and extent of borrowings by the States and are paid direct to the National Debt Sinking Fund. The estimated increase of £506,000 in these contributions in 1962-63 reflects the growth in State debt. Commonwealth Aid Roads Grants -The Commonwealth Aid Roads Act 1959 provides for the payment of a total amount of £54,000,000 to the Slates in 1962-63, £46,000,000 as a basic grant and £8,000,000 as matching assistance. In 1961-62 roads grants to the States totalled £50,000,000 of which £44,000,000 represented basic grants and £6,000,000 matching assistance. The amount payable to a State as matching assistance in 1962-63 is subject to adjustment if it is subsequently found that the State has not qualified in full for the matching assistance paid to it in 1961-62.

As a result of the operation of this legislation, payments to the States for universities are expected to increase from £14,161,000 in 1961-62 to £15,894,000 in 1962-63. Tuberculosis Capital Expenditure -Unde r the Tuberculosis Act 1948 the Commonwealth provides assistance to the States in reimbursement of their capital expenditures on buildings, furnishings, equipment and plant for the diagnosis, treatment and control of tuberculosis. It is estimated that expenditure in 1962-63 will be £400,000, which is the amount it is expected the States will claim during the year. Expenditure in 1961-62 was £387,000. Mental Institutions-Contribution s to Capital Expenditure -The States Grants (Mental Institutions) Act 1955 provides for Commonwealth grants of up ta £10,000,000 to the States for the building and equipping of mental hospitals, on the basis of £1 from the Commonwealth for each £2 spent by a State. Expenditure by the Comof £10,000,000 monwealth in 1961-62 amounted to £824,000, and nonit is estimated that £1,363,000 will be required for this purpose in 1962-63. Replacement of Derby Jetty-Western Australia -Provision of £300,000 has been made for financial assistance to the State of Western Australia during 1962-63 towards the cost of constructing a new jetty with improved facilities at Derby, in the West Kimberleys region of Western Australia.

Payments to Western Australia during 1961-62 amounted to £1,705,000 bringing the total payments by the Commonwealth in respect of the scheme to £3,568,000. It is expected that the balance of the grant provided under the Act, namely £1,432,000, will be spent in 1962-63. Cattle Roads-Queensland -The Queensland Grant (Beef Cattle Roads) Act 1961 provides for a grant of £5,000,000 to be paid to Queensland over the five-year period commencing 1st July, 1961, for expenditure on approved roads for the transport of beef cattle. In 1961-62 an amount of £650,000 was paid to the State and it is estimated that payments totalling £1,480,000 will be made in 1962-63. In addition, provision has been made for further financial assistance to Queensland in 1962-63, to the extent of £250,000, for bitumen sealing of beef cattle roads.

(6) Includes £13,000,000 previously included in ordinary services. See Item 17. (c) Includes £78,000 previously included in ordinary services. See Item 17. Total expenditure on Capital Works and Services is expected to be £180,977,000 in 1962-63. As £13,100,000 of expenditure on the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority is expected to be charged to Loan Fund in accordance with tlie Loan (International Bank for Reconstruction gad Development) Act 1962, £167,877,000 of the (intimated expenditure on Capital Works and Services is expected to be charged to the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1962-63. Estimated total expenditure on Capital Works and Services charged to the Consolidated Revenue Fund and the Loan Fund would represent an increase of £19,385,000 over comparable expenditure in 196162. However, £13,078,000 of this increase arises from changes in accounting procedures referred to in footnotes to this table and to the table in Item No. 17, Business Undertakings, so that the estimated increase excluding these changes would be £6,307,000. Reasons for variations in the estimates in respect of some items shown in the table compared with actual expenditure in 1961-62 are:External Affairs -It is estimated that expenditure will decline by £1,752,000 in 1962-63 because expenditure in 1961-62 included Australia's subscription of £1,785,000 to the United Nations Bond issue. Treasury-Capita l for Commonwealth Development Bank -In 1961-62 payments totalling £10,000,000 were made for additional capital of the Commonwealth Development Bank. No provision is made in this year's estimates for payments to the Bank for this purpose. Treasury-Othe r 196263, which is estimated to increase by £380,000, includes £600,000 to cover advance payments for plant and equipment for the National Mint and an increase from £51,000 to £180,000 in the requirement for plant and equipActual Estimated + Increase.

The provision for 1962-63 works and acquisitions programmes is £379,000 less than actual expenditure last year, mainly because of reduced expenditure on the new Government Printing Office. Interior -Of the estimated decrease of £1,027,000, it is expected that £761,000 will arise from a decline in expenditure on Commonwealth offices and other buildings outside the Australian Capital Territory, because of a substantially reduced provision for Stage1 of the Commonwealth Offices, Sydney, and the completion of Commonwealth Offices, Brisbane. The provision for acquisitions is £424,000 less than in 1961-62 when £425,000 was spent acquiring a site for Stages2 and 3 of Commonwealth Offices, Sydney. An additional £123,000 has been provided for the purchase of plant and equipment for thc Bureau of Meteorology. Civil Aviation-Works, Sites and Buildings Estimated expenditure in 1962-63 of £2,992,000 consists of £2,353,000 for the works programme, which is £42,000 more than was spent in 1961-62, and £639,000 for the acquisition of sites and buildings, an increase of £188,000 over expenditure in 1961-62. It is estimated that £463,000 will be required this year for the acquisition of land at Tullamarine and at the Brisbane and Perth Airports. Civil Aviation-Technica l Equipment -The estimated increase of £448,000 in expenditure in 1962-63 on technical equipment includes provision for expenditure on a special additional programme, estimated to cost £3,000,000, for the installation over the next three years of surveillance Items Expenditure in radaT at Sydney, Adelaide, Melbourne and Brisbane aerodromes and for the modification and expansion of the existing navigational aid system. Civil Aviation-Capita l for Qantas and T.A.A In 1961-62, Qantas Empire Airways Ltd. received £1,650,000 as additional capital, part of which was used to repay an advance made by the Commonwealth in 1960-61. No provision has been made for additional capital for either Qantas or the Australian National Airlines Commission (T.A.A.) in 1962-63. Health-The main reason for the decrease of £217,000 in estimated expenditure for 1962-63 is that no provision for new projects for the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories has been made in this year's works programme. Shipping and Transport-Railway Projects Under the Railway Standardization (New South Wales and Victoria) Agreement Act 1958, the Commonwealth agreed to provide financial assistance for the construction of a standard gauge railway between Albury and Melbourne. This line was officially opened for traffic in April, 1962, and expenditure by the Commonwealth to 30th June, 1962 totalled £14,485,000, of which £4,000,000 was in 1961-62; no provision has been made for expenditure in 1962-63. Under the Railway Agreement (Western Australia) Act 1961, the Commonwealth is to provide financial assistance to Western Australia for the construction tion of Australia's contribution towards the cost of a standard gauge railway from Kwinana to Kalgoorlie and to iron ore deposits at Koolyanobbing and for the purchase of rolling stock for the railway. The first payments by the Commonweallh will be required in 1962-63 and an amount of £4,300,000 is provided for this purpose. Under the Railway Equipment Agreement (South Australia) Act 1961, the Commonwealth agreed to provide financial assistance of up to £1,325,000 for Ihe purchase of 12 locomotives and 100 wagons for the Port Pirie-Broken Hill railway. It is estimated that £1,300,000 will be required for this purpose in 1962-63. National Hydro-Electric Authority -Expenditur e by the Authority in 1962-63 is estimated at £24,150,000, compared with actual expenditure of £16,010,000 in 1961-62. The big increase is due to increased activity on the part of contractors constructing major works on the Snowy-Murray seciion of the Scheme. The Murray1 power project is scheduled to be commisisoned early in 1966. It is estimated that £13,100,000 out of the total expenditure of £24,150,000 wil be financed from drawings during 1962-63 of the loan of $100 million being made to the Commonwealth by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in respect of the Murray1 power project. National Energy Commission -Expenditur e in 1962-63 is expected to be £186,000 less than in 1961-62. The provision for buildings and works in 1962-63 is £350,000 compared with £531,000 in 1961-62, and the provision for scientific plant and equipment is £20,000 less than in 1961-62. Expenditure on Rum Jungle plant, at £80,000, is £16,000 higher than in 1961-62. National Development-Othe r Items -Increased expenditure of £118,000 includes the cost of equipment to be used in the search for oil. Commonwealth Railways -The estimated increase of £604,000 in 1962-63 is attributable mainly to expenditure on new diesel electric locomotives under construction, the proposed purchase of additional passenger and goods roiling stock and improvements to the permanent way. Post OfficeA large part of the increase reflects the inclusion of certain items of a capital nature, amounting to £13,000,000, previously provided under the ordinary services votes. The estimated increase excluding this change in accounting procedures is, therefore, £2,704,000. The continued demand for telephone services will require additional expenditure in 1962-63, while the provision for television relay facilities is increased from £414,000 in 1961-62 to £900,000 in 1962-63. Estimated expenditure on the works programme for the Post Oflice is expected to be £1,874,000 greater than actual expenditure last year, because of a substantially increased provision for thc Sydney and Brisbane Mail Exchange buildings. £200,000 has been provided for micro-wave repeating stations for stage 4 of the regional television development programme. Overseas Telecommunications Commission-The provision of £3,500,000 in 1962-63 represents porof the trans-Pacific telephone cable project. Broadcasting and Television -The increase of £1,328,000 in estimated expenditure during 1962-63 is mainly attributable to the provisions for buildings, services and equipment for television transmission in provincial and country areas. (£78,000 of Ihe increase arises from an accounting change; this amount would previously have been charged to other services.) Northern Territory -The 1962-63 provision for the Northern Territory is £1,072,000 greater than expenditure in 1961-62. This figure includes increases of £634,000 for the beef cattle roads Development-Snowy Mountains programme, £106,000 for the provision of health services, and £182,000 for plant and equipment for the Northern Territory Administration. Advances to the Northern Territory Housing Commission for rental housing are estimated to cost £132,000 more this year than in 1961-62. Estimated expenditure on loans to primary producers for waler development is £68,000 more than expenditure last year, while the provision for loans for residential accommodation for school children is £102,000 more than last year's expenditure. Australian Capital Territory -Expenditur e in 1962-63 is estimated to be £2,425,000 greater than expenditure in 1961-62. This increase includes additional amounts of £1,150,000 in the provision Development-Australia n Atomic for the National Capital Development Commission's programme, including the new National Mint building; £500,000 for the Department of Health (Canberra Hospital development); £250,000 for additional capital for Canberra brickworks in respect of plant to increase annual output; and £325,000 for loans for housing. The provision of £1,000,000 for advances to building societies is unchanged from last year. ITEM No. 21 -LOA N CONSOLIDATION AND In 1961-62 an amount of £22,155,000 was paid from Consolidated Revenue to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve, whicb also received interest on investments amounting to £12,283,000. Provision has been made in the Estimates for the payment of £31,000,000 from Consolidated Revenue to the Reserve in 1962-63 whence it can be used, as necessary, to assist in meeting commitments in respect of the State works and housing programmes.

(c) Included in Other Special Appropriations. Butter and Cheese Bounties -The Dairying Industry Act 1962 provides for the payment of bounties on butter and cheese produced during the five year period ending 30th June, 1967. Separate provisions are being made for these bounties in 1962-63-estimate d expenditure of £12,250,000 for butter and £1,250,000 for cheese, giving a total of £13,500,000, or the same amount as was expended under the dairy products bounty in 1961-62. Cellulose Acetate Flake Bounty -The Cellulose Acetate Flake Bounty Act 1956-1961 authorizes payment of a bounty of 7d. per lb., subject to an annual limit of £90,000, on cellulose acetate Sake produced in Australia and sold for use in the local manufacture of rayon yarn up to 30th June, 1964. Increased sales of cellulose acetate flake are expected in 1962-63. Copper Bounty -Unde r the Copper Bounty Act 1958-1960 a bounty of up to £35 per ton is payable under certain conditions on copper produced and sold for domestic consumption up to 31st December, 1963. The lower estimate of expenditure for 1962-63 reflects expected small reductions in bountiable production and in the average rate of bounty payable. The items which were previously shown under the head, Bounties and Subsidies, are now included under Other Special Appropriations and Departmental Expenditure. For information purposes these items are brought together in this Addendum and the estimates for 1962-63 ""are compared with actual expenditures for 1961-62. Actual Estimated + increase.

The rate of bounty is designed to give growers an average return of 14d. per lb. The 1962-63 estimate of bounty payments is £310,000, which is slightly below expenditure in 1961-62. Gold Mining Industry Assistance -The Gold Mining Industry Assistance Act 1954-1962 provides for payment of a subsidy, under certain conditions, on gold produced up to 30th June, 1965. It is proposed to introduce legislation to provide for the payment, under certain conditions, of a development allowance to mines not receiving subsidy. Increased expenditure expected in 1962-63 arises from the proposed development allowance and from a higher level of final payments in respect of the previous year's production than was the case in 1961-62. Pyrites Bounty -Unde r the Pyrites Bounty Act 1960, a bounty is payable, subject to certain conditions, on locally produced iron pyrites delivered up to 30th June, 1965, for use in the manufacture in Australia of sulphuric acid. Bounty is payable on the sulphur content of the pyrites and the rate of bounty varies with the landed cost of imported crude brimstone. Expenditure in 1962-63 is expected to be less than in 1961-62 because of a fall in the use of local pyrites and in the rate of bounty. Rayon Yarn Bounty -The Rayon Yarn Bounty Act 1954-1962 provides for the payment of a bounty of 9d. per lb., subject to an annual limit of £130,000, on continuous filament acetate rayon yarn produced and sold in Australia up to 30th June, 1965. The expected increase in expenditure in 1962-63 is attributable partly to a higher rate of bounty on rayon yarn sold after 2nd May, 1962 and partly to an expected increase in sales. Sulphate of Ammonia Bounty -The Sulphate of Ammonia Bounty Act 1962 provides for the payment of a bounty of £2 per ton, subject to an annual limit of £225,000, on sulphate of ammonia produced and sold in Australia as fertilizer for a three year period from 1st April, 1962. No payments were made in 1961-62. It is expected that expenditure in 1962-63 will amount of £190,000. Processed Milk Products Bounty -The Processed Milk Products Bounty Act 1962 authorizes the appropriation of up to £350,000 for payment of bounty on certain processed milk products exported between 1st July, 1962 and 30th June, 1963. Expenditure in 1962-63 is expected to amount to £250,000. Sulphuric Acid Bounty -The Sulphuric Acid Bounty Act 1954-1960 and Regulations thereunder provide for payment of bounty, subject to certain conditions, on sulphuric acid produced from iron pyrites of Australian origin and sold for use, or used in manufacture, in Australia.

Tractor Bounty -The Tractor Bounty Act 19391959 provides for payment of bounty on the production of wheel-type tractors for use in the Commonwealth or a Territory up to 30th June, 1966. The rates of bounty vary with the horsepower of the units and the percentage of Australian content. The higher estimate in 196263 is attributable to an expected increase in production of tractors qualifying for bounty and to the expected settlement of some claims for bounty in respect of 1961-62 which were not finalized in that year. Wheat Prices Stabilization Fund -Unde r the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act 1958-1960, growers are guaranteed a return based on "" cost of production "" in respect of up to 100 million bushels of wheat exported from each of the five wheat crops for the seasons 1958-59 to 1962-63. If the average export price for a crop exceeds the guaranteed return, growers are required to contribute to the Wheat Prices Stabilization Fund. When the average export price for a crop falls below the guaranteed return, the deficit is made up by drawing upon the Wheat Prices Stabilization Fund, and, if that Fund is exhausted, by payment from Consolidated Revenue. In 1961-62, payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund amounting to £11,906,000 were made in respect of the 195960 and 1960-61 crops. In 1962-63 it is expected that a payment of £7,500,000 will be necessary to make up to the guaranteed return on the 1961-62 crop. Actual Estimated + Increase. 1961-62. 1962-63.

Accordingly, as expenditure from the Fund in 1962-63 is estimated to increase by £22,383,000, a corresponding increase is expected in the moneys received by the Fund from Consolidated Revenue. After taking account also Of an estimated increase of £23,000 in interest received from the investment of the balance in the Fund, total receipts of the National Welfare Fund in 1962-63 are estimated at £389,634,000, Or £22,405,000 more than in 1961-62. It is estimated that expenditure from the National Welfare Fund will rise by £22,383,000 to £387,574,000 in 1962-63. This increase reflects the growth in the number of beneficiaries together with the full year effect of the 1961-62 increases in age, invalid and widows' pensions, tuberculosis allowances and unemployment and sickness benents. Comments on particular items of expenditure, Where the estimate for 1962-63 varies substantially from actual expenditure in 1961-62, are set out below:Age and Invalid Pensions -It is estimated that in 1962-63 there will be an increase of £11,755,000 in expenditure on age and invalid pensions. Of this, £9,900,000 is due to the increased number of pensioners and the balance to the full-year effect of the 1961 amending legislation. Widows' Pensions -Expenditur e on widows' pensions is expected to increase by £1,305,000 in 1962-63 because of the full-year effect of the 1961 amending legislation and the increased number of pensioners. Child Endowment -It is estimated that expenditure on child endowment will he £1,922,000 greater than in 1961-62 owing to the increase in the number of endowed children.

Expenditure in 1961-62 was £12,637,000 on unemployment benefit and £3,268,000 on sickness and special benefits. Hospital Benefits -Expenditur e on hospital benefits is expected to increase by £1,921,000 in 1962-63, mainly because of greater bed occupancy as more beds become available, the continued growth in the membership of hospital insurance organizations, and more people qualifying for the higher rate of "" additional hospital benefit"". Pharmaceutical Benefits -It is estimated that the outlay on pharmaceutical benefits in 1962-63 will be £5,128,000 more than in 1961-62. The factors primarily responsible are greater utilization of the benefits under the scheme, the higher cost of drugs and additions to the list of approved drugs. Pharmaceutical Benefits for Pensioners -The factors mentioned in respect of the previous item -Pharmaceutica l Benefits-ar e also expected to result in an increase in expenditure of £974,000 under this item in 1962-63. Medical Benefits -The cost of medical benefits is estimated to rise by £983,000 in 1962-63. fhe increase is largely attributable to increasing membership of medical benefit organizations and a rise in the average yearly number of services per member qualifying for Commonwealth benefit. Medical Benefits for Pensioners -It is anticipated that in 1962-63 the cost of this service will rise by £798,000 of which £399,000 is for increased fees for medical practitioners participating under the scheme. The balance of the increase relates principally to an increase in the number of pensioners eligible for the service. Milk for School Children -Expenditur e in 1962-63 is estimated to increase by £163,000 on expenditure in 1961-62. The increase is due mainly to the larger numbers of schools and children participating in the scheme. Tuberculosis Benefits -The cost of this item is estimated to increase by £474,000 in 1962-63, the main reason for the increase being increased maintenance costs of State tuberculosis institutions.

At its meetings in June, 1962, the Loan Council approved a governmental borrowing programme for State works and housing of £250;000,000 in 1962-63. The Loan Council also approved a borrowing programme of £105,155,000 for State semi-government and local authorities with proCommonwealth-ForHousing(o). . StatesNew South Wales.

The resolution approving the above-mentioned programme of £25,000,000 was supported by the Commonwealth on the understanding that the State Governments would f u l f i l certain conditions designed to promote governmental loan raisings in 1962-63. For its part, the Commonwealth undertook(i) to make available the Australian currency equivalent of any new money loans it might be able to raise overseas for general purposes; grammes in excess of £100,000 in 1962-63, and a programme of £1,595,000 for Commonwealth authorities in the Territories. In addition, the Loan Council decided that no overall limit should be placed on borrowings by authorities for which the State Governments approve programmes of not more than £100,000 in 1962-63.

Allowing for £4,000,000 which it is estimated will be raised in 1962-63 by way of State domestic raisings, the amount to be met from loan raisings by the Commonwealth would be £246,000,000. As loan raisings by the Commonwealth in Australia and overseas available for application to State works and housing programmes are estimated to total £195,000,000 in 1962-63, it is estimated that the Commonwealth will have to make available £51,000,000 from its own resources by way of South Australia Western Australia . Tasmania Total The increase in estimated expenditure for 196263 is mainly due to the provision for the comprehensive drainage scheme at Loxton, South Australia. At present the decrease evident in development costs is being largely offset by an increasing demand for advances from settlers. In Western Australia, however, it is expected that repayments to the Commonwealth of advances made to settlers wili be greater than the demand for advances in 1962-63. At the June, 1960 meeting of the Loan Council approval was given for an additional Commonwealth borrowing of £20,000,000 to finance advances to Queensland to assist in the rehabilitation of the Mount Isa-Townsville-Collinsville railway line. Borrowings of that amount during the year were credited to Loan Pund to finance advances to Queensland in future years. During 1961-62 the Commonwealth was called upon to make advances totalling £3,750,000 to Queensland for the Mount Isa railway project. It is estimated that £8,195,000 will be advanced to Queensland for the project in 1962-63. It is proposed that expenditure on Defence Services to the extent of £98,283,000 will be charged to the Loan Fund in 1962-63. 1962-63. Al 30th June, 1962, Commonwealth Inscribed Stock and Bonds maturing in Australia in 1962-63 totalled £475,530,000. Details are as follows:assistance to these programmes in the financial year. It is expected that this assistance will be make monthly advances to the provided through a special loan subscribed from the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve.

WAR SERVICE LAND SETTLEMENT, 1962-63. It is estimated that payments to the States for War Service Land Settlement, which will again be financed from loan moneys in 1962-63, will amount to £1,750,000, compared with £1,577,000 in 196162.

Stock issued in 1952 and due to mature on 15th September, 1962. These securities, which were all the responsibility of the New South Wales Government, have been refinanced to the extent of £Stg.lO,000,000 by means of a cash and conversion loan which closed on 20th July, 1962. In addition to redemptions of the above mentioned maturing securities and of securities which matured in earlier years, redemptions of War Savings Certificates and Savings Certificates will have to be financed in 1962-63. There will also be repayments of £8,283,000 (US.$18,553,000) to the Internationa] Bank and further amounts will be required to meet the cost of market repurchases, &c, in Australia and overseas. The total of such expenditures in 1962-63 is estimated at £106,000,000. It is estimated that the income of the National Debt Sinking Fund in 1962-63 will be £80,000,000, which will be available towards financing the expenditures referred to above. I move That the first item in the Estimates under Divithe financial assistance grants paid to the sion No. 101-The Senate-namely , "" Salaries and allowances £34,400"", be agreed to. Progress reported. The following papers were presented:The Budget 1962-63-Papers presented by the Right Honourable Harold Holt, M.P., for the information of honourable members on the occasion of the Budget of 1962-63. National Income and Expenditure 1961-62. Commonwealth Payments to or for the Slates. Ordered to be printed. Message recommending appropriation reported. In committee (Consideration of Administrator's message): Motion (by Mr Harold Holt) agreed toThat it is expedient that an appropriation of revenue be made for the purposes of a bill for an act to grant and apply out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund sums for the purpose of Additional Financial Assistance to the States. Resolution reported. Standing Orders suspended; resolution adopted. OrderedThat Mr Harold Holt and Mr Menzies do prepare and bring in a bill to carry out the foregoing resolution. Bill presented by Mr Harold Holt, and read a first time. Second Reading. Treasurer) [9.25] I move That the bill be now read a second time. The purpose of this bill is to authorize payment to the States of grants totalling £12,500,000 in this financial year. At the Premiers' Conference held in conjunction with the recent Loan Council meeting the Commonwealth indicated that, in addition to supporting the borrowing programme for £250,000,000 adopted by the Loan Council for 1962-63, it would be willing to make available a special non-repayable interestfree grant of £12,500,000 to the States for expenditure on employment-giving activities. These amounts are additional to States under the States Grants Acts 1959 and 1962. It will be recalled that the Commonwealth paid to the States in 1961-62 a non-repayable grant of £10,000,000 which was intended to provide finance for employment-giving activities, mainly in the works field. In making the present offer of further assistance in 1962-63 the Commonwealth was influenced by the fact that there still exists a need to promote job opportunities. We expect this grant to have a beneficial impact on the employment position. The Commonwealth was also influenced by this fact in suggesting a form of distribution of the total grant between States which proved acceptable to all States. The amounts to be paid to each State are shown in the schedule to the bill, and are as follows:£ New South Wales .. . . . 3,044,000 Victoria .. .. . . 2,442,000 Queensland .. .. .. 3,640,000 South Australia .. .. 1,312,000 Western Australia .. .. 894,000 Tasmania .. .. . . 1,168,000 In arriving at this distribution the Commonwealth had in mind the employment situation in Queensland in particular, but considered that in Tasmania also there was some cause for special consideration on this account. Both these States, therefore, are to receive larger amounts than would have been the case had the total grant been distributed solely in the same proportions as the works and housing programmes. I may mention that some State Premiers indicated at the conference that their budgetary problems were likely to be more difficult in 1962-63 than they were last year. As a result the Commonwealth, while emphasizing that the overall purpose of the grants was to stimulate employment, made it clear that in pursuing that general objective the States were at the same time free to utilize any part of the grants which they saw fit in order to assist their budgets in State works and housing of the present year. In view of the purpose of the grants the Government is anxious that the States should be able to commence to draw upon them as soon as possible. I would, therefore, in commending the bill to honourable",22,Budget 1962 63

I want to direct attention to a matter which has been brought to my notice within the past few days regarding a Government departmentthe Commonwealth Department of Works. At present over 1,000 persons are employed in that department in New South Wales. I have been assuredI have no reason to doubt the accuracy of my information because I know the source of it is authentic Commonwealth Department of Works in New South Wales is to be reduced by 20 per cent. Over 200 employees are to be dismissed. That is the intention of this Government which talks about stimulating I am able to inform the House that disdepartment but instructions have been until Parliament goes into recess again in a few weeks. If the Minister for Works( Mr Freeth) is able to do soI feel he would be rather afraid to do so-le t him deny that these dismissal notices have been prepared over 200 employees representing 20 per cent, of the department's work force in New South Wales. This is scandalous. Among those to be dismissed are building tradesmen and a number of engineers who have had ten years' service, and in some instances longer service, with the department. This state of affairs is even more scandalous when we remember that the policy which, according to this evening's announcement, stimulate industry and employment. One interesting point to note is that unemployment continues to exist in this country. Although the number of registered unemployed is given as 93,000-odd any reasonable member of the community who cares to examine the situation will know that the registered.

26,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [9.30],"Thispursue its policy of increasing the number of immigrants from overseas, if it can get them. To pursue this policy will cause injury to Australian workers, to the people who already live in Australia and to those who the Government is inducing by false representations to take up settlement here. The Department of Immigration has been showing a propaganda film overseas entitled, ""The Way We Live"". In this propaganda film, to which attention recently significance for many thousands of citizens has been directed, the department depicts what it terms the typical English migrant family. The film shows how after twelve months in Australia the family has saved enough to buy a building block at French's Forest in Sydney and how after another twelve months the family has built its own home. The final scene in the film shows the family sailing on Sydney Harbour in its directions to the electoral commissions in own yacht. That is the kind of propaganda which the Government is disseminating overseas in an endeavour to induce these unfortunate people to come to Australia in the belief that they will secure homes and employment. The Government talks about the number of people coming into Australia. Why does it not tell us the other side of the story-the number of people leaving Australia whenever they have the opportunity to do so? Many thousands more would return to the countries from which they came if they had the money for their fare, but they have been stranded here and are without work and without hope. The Government should be setting an example. Surely there is enough work in the Commonwealth crying out to be done. Surely the Government can employ the ment, church and public organizations as number of men already engaged in the well as from individuals. 1 repeat that 1 Department of Works.

II bring this matter before the Parliament wait now with some degree of interest to in the hope that honourable members will hear whatever explanation the Minister has remember my remarks when the matter is to offer. briefly I wish to direct the attention of the House to the fact that the proposed plan for the rearrangement of electoral boundaries in Victoria, which now is being exhibited in post offices, provides for the abolition of the Division of Isaacs. I have no need to remind the House that that division perpetuates the name of a great Australian and that it has a general as well as a particular in Australia. Many people think that the Government lays down the altered electoral boundaries and deletes names from the electoral map, as is proposed to be done in this instance. Of course, that is not the case, as all honourable members very well know. The Commonwealth Electoral Act gives no specific relation to names, so it is conceivable that such important matters as historical names can be overlooked quite easily by the commissioners. The electoral commissioners have given notice of their intention to delete the name of Isaacs. I believe that this would be a very grave mistake. The name of Isaacs is of historical importance because it perpetuates the name of Sir Isaac Isaacs who was one of the fathers of federation and one of the most-respected judges to sit on the High Court bench. Later he became Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia and finally was appointed Governor General of Australia. Perhaps he was best known in the latter capacity, particularly to the young people of this generation. I have received many leiters of protest against the proposal to delete the name of Isaacs.

33,Mr Pollard (Lalor) [9.42],"Mrmigrants have to slay in it for up to two years. During thc recent by-election campaign in the State electorate of Broadmeadows in Victoria, I visited the Broadmeadows hostel. This was not by any moans my first visit to this hostel. 1 found therea family with five young children, the eld -st being about eight or nine years of age, and another child being due to arrive at any time. I was told that many applications had been made to the housing authorities without success. I referred the case to a member of the Victorian Parliament and at last, after two long years, this family with five young children, housed in such unsatisfactory conditions, succeeded in getting a Victorian Housing Commission flat. These hostels are insanitary places. Thc lavatory blocks are far removed from the sleeping quarters and there is not adequate privacy. Inevitably, all sorts of disturbances occur in these hostels. Some feeble attempt has been made to pave the passage ways between the huts. The occupants live in plain hearing of their neighbours, with only a flimsy dividing wall between. The rooms are small and would not comply with any reasonable housing standards anywhere in Australia. Yet nothing is done about the situation. The present Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), who formerly was in charge of these matters when he held another portfolio, visited the migrant hostels at Williamstown and Broadmeadows some years ago, but did nothing. The Minister for Labour and National Service responsible for these migrant hostels, has visited these places, and he, too, has done nothing about them. The hostels are now a seething mass of discontent. Ministers visit these places to see what they are like. They make whatever inquiries they wish and they are taken to see the quarters where children are cared for, the recreation rooms and the dining rooms. Ministers are shown all the show places in these hostels, if these premises can be called show places. They are merely the best one can get in these hostels. Still the unsatisfactory state of affairs continues. There is no reason why the Commonwealth Government, if it intends to continue our present immigration policy -as I hope it will do if migrants are given decent conditions in which to live-shoul d not forthwith take measures to provide first-class accommodation suitable for families and providing adequate privacy for them to live decently with a proper environment for the children. Above all things, there should be adequate protection against disease, crime and the other hazards that occur in these places. I know that the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Downer) does his best. But, indirectly, he is partly responsible for the present shocking state of affairs. These unfortunate migrants who live in hostels really have no voice to speak for them. But the particularly regrettable thing is the psychology adopted by those who say, "" If we make the migrants more comfortable in the hostels, we shall never get rid of them."" Statements to that effect have been made in documents in my possession which have come from Commonwealth Hostels Limited and the Minister for Labour and National Service. Similar statements have been made in conversation by members of the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council, too. It is all very well for some one to go to a hostel and say, "" This is all right, it is only temporary "". Families have been in these places for four years and longer, and these shocking conditions are still allowed to continue. Yet the Government and its supporters wonder why British, Dutch, German and other migrants are returning to their homelands. There is a continual alarming drift. When a visitor to a hostel goes among the inmates and asks how they are getting on, they say, "" If we had the money to go home, we would go tomorrow "". I have heard that said time and again. That is frequently the response that one receives. There is another aspect of the matter. Let us suppose that the immigration programme petered out. If the accommodation in these hostels wen decent and adequate, it could in that event be used to house old people in decent surroundings by providing them with suitable flats. The existing situation is horrifying in the extreme. Hepatitis is an ever-present danger in these hostels.

36,Mr Cairns (Yarra) [9.52],"This hasFirst, I shall refer to West New Guinea and Indonesia. A great many people in this country feel a considerable amount of uncertainty and insecurity as a result of events that are happening to the north of Australia. Indonesia is very substantially upon a military basis. It has been acquiring arms from the United States of America, the Soviet Union and elsewhere in the world, so that its arms are far in advance of done? Is it going to be possible for the those possessed by this country. I do not suggest that the way to meet this is by means of arms, but I think the Australian Government has completely abdicated from its responsibility in relation to the settleIndonesia and Australia would undertake ment of the West New Guinea issue. We have been told that all we need to do for the peace and security of the Commonwealth of Australia is to rely upon our powerful friends. Our powerful friend in this case-presumabl y the United States of America-ha s arranged a settlement of the West New Guinea issue without any reference whatever to us. If the United States is going to permit the expansion of other Asian countries, or of any other country in Asia, in the way lhat the expansion into West New Guinea is being facilitated, it is pretty clear that reliance upon our powerful friends is not satisfactory. Australia must have a say in the settlement of questions of this kind. What is the policy of the Government in relation to Indonesia and West New Guinea? We have, if we are lucky, an opportunity as members of the Opposition to ask Ministers approximately one question a week. We have the opportunity now and again to make a speech in relation to a statement that a Minister makes, but we have no real opportunity to test the Government or explore its attitude on important matters of this kind. I should like to know whether the Government intends to tell us, in the next three weeks of the sittings of this Parthe Government holds on this vital quesliament, anything about this question concerning Indonesia and West New Guinea. It seems to me that it is quite impossible to rely upon powerful friends to make some kind of settlement in South-East Asia or in Asia which may be in the interests of the Commonwealth of Australia, because the interests of our powerful friends do not always happen to coincide with our interests. I suggest that it is quite impossible to rely upon settlement of a question of this kind by the use of military force. Something else is necessary. Has the Government any plans to approach Indonesia, with a view to attempting to secure some kind of agreement whereby territorial stability in this area might be maintained by agreement between Australia and Indonesia? Has consideration been given to this matter, and if not, why has that not been Government to see its way clear to approach Indonesia in an endeavour to secure some kind of agreement for a reduction of arms, or an agreement whereby to refrain from obtaining nuclear weapons? If the Government finds it impossible to reply to the Secretary-General of the United Nations to specify any condition on which it might refrain from obtaining nuclear weapons, let us ask the Government whether it is prepared to approach a country like Indonesia and say to it, "" Provided you undertake not to obtain nuclear weapons, we will do the same"". country is endangered by people who, like the honourable member opposite, can talk fight but are not capable of fighting. We have had enough of this empty, aggressive talk which leads to nothing but the continued insecurity of this country. Has the Government anything to propose for the stabilization of relations to the north of Australia, or is it prepared to allow those relations to continue to deteriorate, as it has in the last few years? That has been the record of the Government. In the few moments that are left to me I want to refer to the European Economic Community. We are not sure what views tion. Very little has been said. One Minister in this country has lost his head and seventeen Ministers in the United Kingdom have lost their heads. What are the causes of disagreement that have led to this particular upheaval? What is the attitude of the Government on this question?

38,Mr Cairns,"The security of thisOn the other hand, the Minister for Trade gaining position and that the former Minisand telling honourable members what he ter for Air has undercut our bargaining position. I want to know from the Minister for Trade what our bargaining position is worth. If the Minister and the Prime Minister fail to obtain access to Europe for Australian exports at the levels of the past, and if we fail to obtain our export opportunities, what does the Government propose to do? The Prime Minister will be making a statement on this question in a couple of days' time. I want to see in that statement some indication of what the Government proposes to do if Australia loses these export opportunities. I do not want the right honourable gentleman to go to the Prime Ministers' Conference in London in October, free to do anything or nothing as he might choose. I should like him, without delay, to put before this Parliament a statement of what he proposes to do if our export opportunities in Europe are lost. Does he propose to take any particular action at that Prime Ministers' Conference, or does he propose to do anything or nothing as he might happen to choose? Far too often in recent years in this country we have found the Government deciding its policy in secret somewhere-o r some one deciding for it because one can never be sure just who is making the decisions. The Liberal Government never puts its policy before this House and never informs the people of Australia of its intentions. Instead, we learn from a press release in some foreign newspaper that certain things have been done. This must not happen in relation to the European Common Market. I want to know whether in this session of Parliament the Government will underliament. On that occasion only after pertake to state what it considers will be the sistent representations by members on this likely outcome of the present negotiations side of the House did the Minister authorize between the British representatives and the the cancellation of the dismissals. representatives of The Six.

It is the function of the Opposition to see that on this important matter the Government is not permitted to continue to treat the people of Australia in the negative and non-commital manner in which it has treated them in the past three or four months. It is the responsibility of the House to see that the Government does not do this.

One wonders, after hearing the Budget speech to-night, and bearing in mind the Government's avoidance of the Batman by-election, how it can possibly persist in such an attitude. I hope that the Minister for Works( Mr Freeth) will not avoid the challenge issued by my colleague, the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) to-night. It happens that similar but quite independent messages have been circulated to other members of this chamber, including myself, and I ask the Minister to tell honourable members tonight whether it is a fact that his department intends to dismiss up to 20 per cent, of its current employees. I understand that this percentage has been mentioned. I recall a similar situation arising about two or three years ago, shortly after I entered this ParI hope the Minister will not stalk out of",74,Adjournment

41,Mr Speaker,Order! The honor,75,Adjournment
42,Mr Reynolds (Barton) [10.2],"Th ecorrectly, it engineered a similar procedure on the former occasion. The average length of service of the employees concerned-the y include builders, cabinet makers and other skilled tradesmen-is about eight years, but, of course, many of them have served with the department for a much longer time. They have specialized skills. It would be a dastardly act to dismiss these employees at this time of their lives and to throw them on a labour market that is already so over-saturated that unemployment is widespread. As middle-aged men their chances of getting jobs outside the Public Service would be extremely restricted, especially as the building industry is probably one of the most depressed. Even the Department of Trade's own survey states that the building industry is one of the worse affected by the present lack of confidence of investors in Australian industry. I hope the Minister will not avoid this issue. If he cannot give an answer to-night, he should at least tell honourable members that he is unable to do so. If he can deny categorically that these dismissals are contemplated, he will give much solace to the employees in his department. There are 2,000 employees and they do not know which 200 will be dismissed. Certainly the overseers of his department would not like the job of arbitrarily selecting the 20 per cent, of employees to be dismissed. The Minister should act responsibly to-night, and he should answer the questions that have been raised by my colleague, the honourable member for East Sydney. I have been informed that the typical tactics of the department have been to bring forward at rhe one time a whole host of jobs to be done. The department then declares that it has not enough employees to do all the jobs, and some of them are handed out to private tender. Apparently this bas been the practice for some time. It is most regrettable that the department, wherever possible, has taken work from public servants who chose such employment for their careers, and handed it out by tender. As a result the department finds that it has too many employees for the work on hand. It then issues a purely arbitrary order of this sort to get rid of 20 per cent, of its employees on the ground that they are redundant. That is a terrible situation at a time of these applications. War service homes like this. The Minister has a serious question to answer and I trust that he will answer it to-night. The other matter that concerns me has relation to war service homes. I and many other honourable members, including even Government supporters and Ministers, have received representations from a host of people who have app'ied for war service homes loans and have had their applications rejected outright. I refer especially to people who are seeking additional accommodation. We acknowledge that last year the Government increased the borrowing limit from £2,750 to £3,500, but I have a notion that more than 10,000 applications for loans have been made since then, and that the vast majority of them have been rejected. When the Government increased the limit of borrowing, it apparently did not foresee that all these applications would pour in, for it made no additional allocation of money to the War Service Homes Division. No provision has been made in the current Budget for an increased allocation, despite the fact that a host of applications for loans have been submitted to the War Service Homes Division. There is now a delay of five, six or seven weeks before an application is considered. Honourable members may not have a chance to debate the Budget provision for war service homes for another six or eight weeks, so I take this opportunity to ask the Government to give urgent consideration to this matter. I can only speak from hearsay, but I understand that a series of ministerial directions has been issued restricting the eligibility of applicants for additional finance and that money is being made available only to people who have an urgent need for extra bedroom accommodation. No assistance is being given to improve kitchens or laundries, or to effect other alterations that are urgently needed by growing families. For instance, no provision is made for families in which there are two boys, one aged perhaps five or six years and the other perhaps sixteen or seventeen years, sharing the one room and needing separate study facilities. AH these things have been wiped out arbitrarily, and I believe that the very strict restrictions being imposed by the Minister are responsible for the rejection of the vast majority are solely the concern of the Commonwealth Government. This is not a case in which it can be claimed that the States are not pulling their weight or that the building trade is depressed because the States are not doing their job properly, ln this instance, the responsibility rests solely with the Commonwealth Government, and that Government is shirking not only its responsibility to the economy of the nation and to the employers and employees in the building industry; it is shirking, above all, its responsibility to the returned servicemen of this country who look for a better deal from a government that has prided itself so often on what it does for the ex-serviceman. moment ago we heard an honourable member ask the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Downer) whether he would answer certain questions. It is my intention now to ask members of the Opposition to answer one or two questions. FirstI want to know whether the Opposition was sincere in the statement that was made recently member must address the Chair. Speaker, I ask members of the Opposition whether a statement that appeared in the press recently that the Labour Party would not allow its members to take part in future peace rallies was sincere. important that vve have an answer to that question. My main reason for speaking on this subject to-night is that probably twelve months ago in this HouseI referred to the fact that there were two or three different sections in the Australian Labour Party. One section, which I mentioned as going in what I thought to be the right direction, comprised some of the younger members of the party who were realizing more than were the older members of the party that so-called peace rallies were only covering up for the Communists. Are the older members of the Australian Labour Party now taking the advice of the younger men? Are they realizing that these rallies are organized by the Communists? I certainly hope that the recent press statement that members of the Australian Labour Party must not take part in these peace rallies was sincere. The statement was to the effect that if they do take part in them, they will have to leave the Labour movement. that that report is correct? whether it is correct, for the simple reason that I am relying only on the press statement. As I have only the press statement to go on, it is only right that, as a member of this Parliament, I should ask members of the Australian Labour Party to confirm or deny that statement. the country. Tbat is your job. ber for Lalor( Mr Pollard) is very vocal. He says, "" Look after affairs in the country "". That is the very thing I am doing, because these matters affect not only the country areas but the whole Australian economy and national outlook. My question should be answered. When I first entered this Parliament the Opposition was almost as many as those on the Government side, and the Opposition is now saying that it will soon be in office. Therefore, it is more important than ever that we know It is very just where the Opposition stands on this vital question. In yesterday's Melbourne "" Sun"" there is an article headed"" Rival Factions Brawl at Peace Rally"". Fancy a brawl at a peace rally! In the article is included this statementThe Q.L.P. Youth Organization secretary. Miss M. Andrews, had a bruised neck to-night after a Peace Committee supporter had held her in a stranglehold during one of the fights.

51,Mr Turnbull,"I did not say it was.I am not asking my question in an effort to gain some paltry political advantage. As a general rule I do not speak about Communists or peace rallies in this House, and every honourable member knows that. Some honourable members have a reputation for speaking on such subjects every time they rise. 1 do not have that reputation, and every honourable member of the Opposition knows it. I mention the matter to-night because it is of vital importance to the future of this country. I have always stated in this House that I do not believe in peace at any price. that we believe in peace at any price? interjection I wanted. All the evidence I have is the report that appeared in the Melbourne "" Sun "". I am now asking for a statement on it by some responsible member of the Opposition. Perhaps one of the members of the Labour Party's shadow cabinet could answer my question. It is of no use asking what guarantee 1 have that the press statement is correct. I have no guarantee that it is correct, but I do have a right to ask whether it is correct. Therefore, I put the question again: Is it a fact that the Australian Labour Party executive has said that no member of the Australian Labour Party Can take part in peace rallies, and that if any member takes part in a peace rally he must leave the party? Is that true or false? [10.17] -The point with which I wish to deal relates to one thing which the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) included amongst the many to which he referred when outlining what he said the Government was doing to provide employment in this country. I refer to his statement that there was no alteration in the horse-power a special grant was made to South Australia for the purchase of twelve dieselelectric locomotives. I now take the opportunity of asking the Treasurer, as the responsible Minister, and the Minister for matter that was brought to the notice of the Minister for Trade twelve months ago in connection with this subject has ever been considered on the level on which it should be considered. On 1st September, 1961, I wrote to the Minister for Trade about the importation of traction motors from Great Britain in preference to having these elements of Australia's railway requirements constructed in this country by Australian artisans. On that occasion I pointed out to the Minister for Trade that as a result of the policy being pursued by the Government the provision of the type of traction motor equipment necessary for the efficient operation of diesel-electric trains in this country was getting into the grip of the parent company of Australian Electrical Industries Proprietary Limited in Great Britain. The Minister for Trade replied stating that he was referring the matter to the Minister for Customs and Excise (Senator Henty). In his reply, dated 13th September, 1961, after referring to my question, the Minister for Trade saidThese duties would be levied on all imports of direct current traction motors unless the prospective importer or user established that suitably equivalent traction motors of Australian manufacture were not reasonably available. That is the very point I raised with the Minister. With the possibility of Great Britain entering the European Common Market and the likelihood of the manufacturing industries of Great Britain being hogtied as a result, I raise again the question of tbe advisability of this Government looking at the whole question of what is being done in connection with the importation from England of equipment that should rightly be manufactured in Australia. A.E.I, in Australia had, until this change of programme on the part of the parent company in Great Britain, built in this country 700 traction motors for diesel electric train operation. The local company provided all the first equipment, but then the parent company in Great Britain decided to change the pattern of the motors. I understand but only a change of pattern of the diesel electric motor being produced by the parent company in Great Britain. That was done first of all to meet the requirements of the English railways. Then the organization decided to send a trial shipment of the same type of motor to Australia.",77,Adjournment

57,"Trade ( Mr Mcewen), Whether Or Not A","The company in Australia, realizing the importance of what was happening, sought an assurance from the parent company in Great Britain that the Australian company would be re-tooled to provide the more modern equipment then being produced in Great Britain. But the parent company in Great Britain has not provided the blueprints for re-tooling the Australian manufactured article in this country, and consequently the order for all the 400 motors required by the New South Wales Government has been lost to the A.E.I, organization in that State because its factory has not been re-tooled. It has lost the whole of the contract for the diesel electric motors. This is the very thing I brought to the notice of the Minister for Trade( Mr equipment needed for Australian railways McEwen) in September last year, and more recently to the notice of the Minister for Customs and Excise (Senator Henty); but nothing has been done about it. By the end of this year the company that constructed the,first 700 diesel electric traction motors for railway operation in Australia will virtually be closed down because the English parent company has not re-tooled the Australian factory but is supplying the articles from the English factory. Now, I understand they are being imported free of duty, because the new model that is being introduced is not capable of being produced with the machinery available in Australian factories. Mr Speaker, if that line is to be followed by every company in Great Britain that has contacts in Australian industry-particularly when Great Britain goes into the Common Market-thi s country is going to see shop after shop close down. A.E.I, employed not less than 250 artisans on the construction of the motors for diesel electric traction, and that employment has already gone. I ask the Government whether, when it made available these funds for the South Australian Railways Commission, it understood that the order for the motors to be bought out of the funds provided by this Parliament would go to the parent company in England. I understand that the motors will be imported into this country free of duty because of the failure of the parent company to re-tool its Australian subsidiary. What a silly position we are getting into. Are we, as a National Parliament, providing funds for railway administration, on a State level, to import motors and drive out of employment our own Australian artisans who, up till now, have been employed on this work? The worse feature of the lot will be that we will finally reach the stage where, because our Australian industry is not re-tooled to meet the requirements of modern advances in diesel electric traction motors, the cost of repairs to this equipment will be increased three-fold. I ask the Minister for Trade and the Minister for Customs and Excise whether they are undertaking the inquiry I have asked for on this question in order to preserve for Australian workmen their right to produce in this country the type ot and the diesel electric traction motors that they produced until this change of policy was made by the parent company in Great Britain. the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), I , too, am a little concerned about the possibility of communism getting a hold in this country. But does the honourable member realize that communism marches on an empty belly? Does he realize that there are certain difficulties and hardships placed on the unemployed in this country? Does he realize also that possibly the migrants who have left this country have done so because of the injustices handed out to them when they have been unemployed? During the last fourteen weeks I have received numerous inquiries from people as to why their unemployment benefit had been stopped. I refer to people in the Tabulam district. Their names are Michael Walker, Basil Robinson, George Walker, Bert Walker, George Long and Marjorie Marsh. All these people-the y have been trying to get work but have been unable to obtain it -hav e received a note saying that as they are not seeking work their unemployment benefit would be terminated. I took the opportunity of asking the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton) whether he had given directions to his department to stop any person who had been on unemployment relief for a certain period of time from receiving further assistance. Among other things he had this to sayI might add that the Commonwealth Employment Service does not cancel the registration of",78,Adjournment
58,Mr Mcguren (Cowper) [10.24],"Lik epersons who have sought its assistance to obtain employment unless those persons are placed in employment by it, or, having obtained employment by their own efforts they no longer need assistance in this direction. I wish to give the lie to that statement, because it is not true. It is a different story when these people apply for unemployment benefit. I wish to cite the case of a man who applied for unemployment benefits. He is a returned digger from the last war. He spent three and a half years working on the Burma railway as a prisoner of war and then returned to Australia. He applied for unemployment benefit and received it for some time. Then an arbitrary note came to light one day saying that, as from a certain date, he would receive no further benefit. No explanation was given. I immediately tried to ascertain on his behalf why this had happened and received a letter from the administrator of social services in New South Wales to this effect: First, this man lived in a shack under rather primitive conditions; secondly, his clothes were such that people were unlikely to employ himI suppose he was expected to wear striped pants when he went to get a job; thirdly, he was a single man but did not seem to be making very much effort to obtain employment outside the district in which he lived. The facts are that this man had worked on the railways and had left that employment, for his own good reasons, some eighteen months before and had become a professional fisherman. His boat was not a particularly good one and needed repairs; and he had to beach it. During that time he thought he had better get a job to obtain the money with which to do the work on the boat. He applied to the employment office for work and also applied for social service benefits. The officer who investigated his case found that his pants were not striped, and so he could not qualify for social service benefits. That is what happened in regard to that man. Another instance is of a man 67 years of age who is receiving a pension. His wife was 58 years of age and was not eligible for a pension, so she applied to the employment office for work and also applied for social service benefits. She was offered a job some sixteen miles from Casino, but there was no daily transport and she had no way of getting to and from the job, which meant that she would have to live away from home and away from her husband, who was not in good health. She therefore refused the job, and consequently she was refused social service benefits. Another case involves a girl, who is an epileptic and lives in the same district. She is 80 per cent, fit, according to the doctors. She received social service benefits for some time, but then the authorities said she was not looking for work, although they had no job which she could perform. Who would want to employ a person in her state of health? The point is that she was refused assistance. She is 21 years of age. In that instance I made representations and after some considerable time the benefit was restored, but only from a date subsequent to it being discontinued, not retrospectively. The honourable membei for Mallee is very concerned about communism. As I said before, so am I. This is the type of thing on which communism breeds. This is the type of thing that we have to fight against. This Government must face up to its responsibility for the 100,000 people who are unemployed to-day, instead of handing out the star chamber type of justice that has been handed out to the people I have mentioned. I could give the names of about 20 other people who have made application for social service benefits and, for no reason at all, have been denied them. I have their names and addresses before me now, but I think I should save them the embarrassment of having their names quoted in this House. The names are here for the Minister for Social Services to see at any time he would like to see them. I do not know whether this method has been adopted in order that we might have better-looking employment figures. I am pretty certain that what is happening in the Cowper electorate is also happening in other electorates throughout Australia. It is about time the people received social justice, not the summary type of justice that has been handed out to most of the people whose cases I have investigated. On future occasions in this House we will hear a lot about the treatment of the native peoples of New Guinea and other places. Quite a few of the people to whom I am referring are of aboriginal blood. I can assure you, Mr Speaker, that the Government has nothing to be proud of in the situation that I have outlined here to-night. Speaker, the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull) asked a direct question about peace. I shall be very pleased to reply to him, so far as I am concerned as a member of the Australian Labour Party. BeforeI do that, I should like to say that I regret very much the partisan attitude that he takes to peace. As an ex-serviceman, as a man who was in Changi and went through the miseries of war, he should remember that peace is indivisible. He must know in his heart that to talk in terms of who belongs to a peace movement and who does not belong to a peace movement is wretchedly wrong. 'question? for peace in the world, you must measure in his political thoughts or anything else. up to the demands made on you in relation His trouble is that he has not grown up to achieving peace. We will not achieve since the war. He does not realize that peace by playing miserable, low-grade party this is an entirely new world. You do not politics in relation to what constitutes a give any answer to the question of how peace group and what does not. that. answer. Will you take it? The position that if we as democrats have missed the is that throughout the world people with bus, that is because some one else gave no political associations and people of the us the lead. The honourable member for Liberal Party, the Labour Party and other Mallee should remember that. All he was parties, are banded together in a humanistic trying to do to-night was to score a cheap group because they want to remove for all victory over the Labour Party and make time the threat of war from this world. It a cheap gibe. ill befits an ex-serviceman who has been through the miseries of war1 pay tribute papers that we on this side are not allowed to the sacrifices of the honourable member to go to a peace meeting. That is entirely for Mallee-to make a miserable political wrong. We intend to hold a gigantic peace gibe about what is happening in regard to a meeting on 9th September. The honorpeace society. If the honourable member able member for Mallee and all other memwants a complete answer to his question, let bers of the Government parties, if they him come to the Sydney Town Hall on 9th have any desire for peace and if they want September, when Labour will launch its to alter their miserable policy on foreign great peace campaign. The hall will be affairs, should be the first people to come crowded with people-no t only Labourites along. That is all I have to say. To -wh o have an instinct for peace. They people who get up in this House and try will be able to give him his answer. There to separate the inseparable, I say that is nothing party-political about this. No there are no divisions in peace. If you aro party in this House can halt the march of a pacifist, if you believe in peace and if peace, because the people believe in it. you believe that the world should be free The honourable member supports a wanof war, it does not matter to what party ing government. After what we heard you belong. It is a poor thing for an to-night, it will not be in power in this ex-soldier to stand up and say, "" I see that that the Government has entirely neglected. By the kindness of the Minister for Territories ( Mr Hasluck) I have been allowed to say a few words on this matter, and I shall not trespass on his generosity by making a long speech. It seems to me that we miss the whole point if we gibe at each other and ask, "" What part of the peace movement do you belong to?"" Peace is like Christianity. Peace is like humanity. Peace is like charity. It is indivisible. You cannot cut it up into Country Party segments, Labour Party segments, Liberal Party segments and Communist Party segments. You have to approach it in the spirit in which it was created. If there is a cobblestone march, we will invite the honourable member for Mallee to achieve peace in our time-for which the United Nations and all decent people say "" Yah, yah, Communist"" when there asked for an is a peace meeting.

63,Mr Haylen,"Youyou are going to be banned"". Nobody is going to ban me, and nobody is going to ban any other Australian who wants to see peace in our time. I suggest that the honourable member for Mallee do a bit of thinking in the still watches of the night, and when we have a meeting he should join us. Because he is a man who has made sacrifices, he should consider those matters. Political advantages are out in regard to peace. The peace movement is bigger than any party in the world. The peace movement represents a humanitarian desire to do away with the agonies of the dropping of atom bombs and the agonies of fall-out from atomic testing. It is not a question of where you get your votes, but of where you get your means of survival. Motion (by Mr Hasluck) agreed toTliat the question be now put.

Is he able to give an assurance that Commonis being used for the special purposes concerned, wealth motor cars have not been, and are not being, used (a) by Ministers' wives and others to (i) do their shopping, (ii) visit hairdressers, (iii) take children to and from school and (iv) take children on outings to the beach and elsewhere when unaccompanied by their parents, and (b) by Ministers, top-ranking public servants and others to take them short distances to attend social functions where the cars and their drivers are kept waiting for hours to make the return journey? able member's questions are as follows:These questions resemble very closely questions which have been put previously by the honourable member, and as he well knows, answered previously by me or my colleagues. The arrangements which govern the use of cars by Ministers and by other members of Parliament are the same, expect in one respect which I will mention, as those which applied at the time of the Labour Administration, of which the honourable member for East Sydney was a member. The difference is that there are some new provisions, not previously existing, in favour of some Opposition officeholders. In relation to questions 1, 2, 3, 4 and 7, I remind the honourable member that by letter of 5th February, 1962, dealing with a question asked on notice by the honourable member, the following the reply was given by me:"" Cars are provided for Ministers, Party Leaders, the various parliamentary office bearers and senators and members generally under conditions which are set out broadly in the report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Salaries and Allowances of Members of the Commonwealth Parliament, 1959. Cars are also provided on casual or full-time hire on the demand of the permanent heads of the various Commonwealth Departments and the Chief Executives of instrumentalities, or the officers authorized by them to order vehicles for official purposes. Buses are used generally for the transport of personnel in migrant camps, Commonwealth projects in remote areas, the Armed Services and, of course, for the public transport system in Canberra and Darwin "". I now add for the further information of the honourable member that it is recorded in the report of the Committee of Inquiry mentioned above (paragraph 101) that the Prime Minister, cxPrime Ministers (while members of Parliament), Ministers, the President, the Speaker, and the Leader of the Opposition and their wives are entitled to unrestricted travel facilities, including by official motor car transport. Commonwealth motor vehicles are made available in accordance wilh the provisions mentioned above and for the purposes authorized by those provisions. As to questions 5 and 6, I refer the honourable member to the remarks of my colleague, then the Minister for the Interior, recorded in Hansard of 10th October, 1957. As indicated by the Minister, some CommonweaUh motor cars used for special purposes are fitted with ordinary number plates. Such vehicles are registered and recorded under a Commonwealth number. But while it the Commonwealth number plates are carried inside the car and not displayed. When the",81,Adjournment

The provisions governing the use of Commonwealth motor vehicles do not extend to former members of Parliament. Parliamentary Allowances.

While some amounts are identifiable, others are not, because no detailed dissection is kept as between ministerial offices and departments. In the case of my own department, expenditure on postage, telegrams and telephone services over the past five years has been-1956-57 , £14,495; 1957-58, £16,093; 1958-59, £17,893; 1959-60, £18,513; 1960-61, £17,004. This provision covers the expenditure of the Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate and Deputy Leaders of the Opposition (home telephones only) and the Prime Minister's Department. Employment of Tradesmen and Apprentices by Commonwealth Government. Mr Jones asked the Prime Minister, upon noticeHow many (a) tradesmen and (b) apprentices are employed by the Commonwealth Government as permanent or casual employees in the following occupations:-Electrica l mechanic, electrical fitter, fitter-turner, boilermaker, carpenter and joiner, bricklayer, plumber, painter, sheet metal worker, moulder, blacksmith, shipwright, motor mechanic, plasterer, printer? able member's question is as follows:The information sought by the honourable member is not available and a great deal of time, expense and effort would be required to obtain it.

If so, what was the number sold, and what price was received in respect of each sale? 3. To whom were the rifles sold? 4. Was any restriction or limitation placed on the subsequent disposal or use of these rifles by the purchaser? If so, what are the details? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. The total number of surplus .303 rifles sold was 135,548. It is not the policy of my department to make available details of prices paid by purchasers of surplus goods which may be subsequently offered for re-sale and I regret that in the present instance it is not desirable to depart from this principle. It can be said, however, that the rifles were sold by public tender and the prices realized represent the best prices obtainable. 3. The above mentioned surplus rifles were sold as follows:(a) to approximately 80 authorized dealers throughout Australia 37,447 (b) To Brican Trading Company Limited, London, for export to Canada .. .. 82,344 (c) To the Australian Counci] of Rifle Associations .. .. 15,757 135,548 4. No restrictions or limitations are placed by my department upon the subsequent disposal or use of these rifles by the purchasers. Authorized dealers in firearms who wish to resell them within Australia must necessarily observe the provisions of State laws and regulations. Firearms can be exported only with the approval of the Department of Customs and Excise which ensures that they are consigned only to approved destinations. Australian Forces in Malaya.

The Adelaide airport at West Beach is of relatively recent development and the opportunity has been taken to provide an attractive access lo the aerodrome building area over what was previously swamp land. The costs will decline as the area becomes established and routine maintenance is all that is required. War Service Homes.
