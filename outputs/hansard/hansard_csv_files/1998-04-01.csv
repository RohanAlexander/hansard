(2) There are 2 types of roll-over: 1. a replacement-asset roll-over allows you to defer a capital gain or loss from one CGT event until a later CGT event happens where a CGT asset is replaced with another one; 2. a same-asset roll-over allows you to disregard a capital gain or loss from a CGT event where the same CGT asset is involved.

The reduction is worked out under subsection (3). (2) These conditions must be satisfied: (a) there must be a roll-over under this Subdivision for at least one 'COT asset (the CGT rollover asset) being'disposed of by the subsidiary to the holding company in the course of the liquidation of the subsidiary; (b) the subsidiary must have acquired each COT roll-over asset on or after 20 September 1985; (c) the disposals must either: (i) be part of the liquidator'S final distribution in the course of the liquidation; or (ii) have occurred within 18 months of the dissolution of the subsidiary if they are part of an interim distribution in the course of the liquidation; . (d) the holding company must have beneficially owned all of the shares in the subsidiary for the whole period from the time of the disposal, or the first disposal, of a COT roll-over asset until the cancellation of the shares; (e) the market value of the COT roll-over asset or assets must comprise at least part of the -capital proceeds for the cancellation of the shares in the subsidiary that are beneficially owned by the holding company; (f) one or more of the shares that were cancelled (the post-CGT shares) must have been acquired by the holding company on or after 20 September 1985. (3) The reduction of the 'capital gain or 'capitalloss is worked out in this way. Method statement Step 1. Work out (disregarding this section) the sum of the -capital gains and the sum of the -capital losses the holding company would make on the cancellation of its shares in the subsidiary. Step 2. Work out (disregarding this Subdivision) the sum of the 'capital gains and the sum of the -capital losses the subsidiary would make on the' disposal of its COT roll-over assets to the holding company in the course of the liquidation assuming the -capital proceeds were the assets' market values at the time. of the disposal. Step 3. If, after subtracting the sum of the 'capitallosses from the sum of the 'capital gains, there is: (a) an overall capital gain from Step1 and an overall capital gain from Step 2; or (b) an overall capital loss from Step1 and an overall capital loss from Step 2; then continue. Otherwise there is no adjustment. Step 4. Express the number of post-COT shares as a fraction of the total number of shares the holding company owned in the subsidiary. Step 5. Multiply the overall -capital gain or -capital loss from Step2 by the fraction from Step 4. Step 6. Reduce the overall 'capital gain or 'capitalloss from Step1 by the amount from Step 5. The result is the' capital gain or -capital loss the holding company makes from the cancellation of its shares in the subsidiary.

(2) If: (a) the Corporation owned a CGT asset at the end of 30 June 1991 (the changeover time); and (b) the asset's market value at that time was less than what would have been, for the purposes of Part IlIA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the asset's reduced cost base for the Corporation if the Corporation had disposed of it at that time; then, for the purposes of working out whether the Corporation makes a capital loss from a later CGT event that happens in relation to the asset, Parts 3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 apply as if the Corporation: (c) had disposed of the asset at the changeover time for an amount equal to that reduced cost base; and (d) had immediately re-acquired it for an amount equal to its market value at the changeover time. (3) A capital gain or capital loss is disregarded if it arises from a CGT event that happens in relation to a CGT asset of the Corporation and: (a) the Commonweal,th acquired the asset before 20 September 1985; or (b) the Commonwealth and not the Corporation is entitled to the capital proceeds from the event. (4) An expression has the same meaning in this section as in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, except so far as the contrary intention appears in this Act. Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 545 Section3 (at the end of the definition of asset) Add: ; and (e) a CGT asset within the meaning of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. 546 Subsection 15(3) Omit all the words after"" acquired the asset for"", substitute"" an amount equal to what would have been the asset's cost base to the transferring corporation for the purposes of working out under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 whether the transferring corporation made a capital gain from the transfer"". 547 Sections 18 and 19 Repeal the sections, substitute: 18 Additional roll-over relief There is a roll-over under Subdivision 126-B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (which normally applies only to transfers between companies in the same wholly-owned group) if: (a) the trigger event is a transfer to which this Act applies; and (b) the requirements of that Subdivision are met, disregarding: (i) subsection 126-50(1) of that Act (about the originating and recipient companies being members of the same wholly-owned group); and (ii) subsection 126-50(5) of that Act (about the residency status of the originating and recipient companies and the asset's connection to Australia); and (iii) section 126-55 (about the originating and recipient companies choosing to obtain the rollover). This is in addition to that Subdivision's effect apart from this section. 19 For the receiving corporation, asset has necessary connection with Australia Parts 3-1 and 3-3 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 apply to an asset acquired by the receiving corporation as a result of a transfer as if the asset had, while it is an asset of the receiving corporation, the necessary connection with Australia. 548 Before subsection 20(1) Insert: (IA) In addition to its effect apart from this section, the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 also has the effect it would have if sections 170-110 to 170-145 (which are about transferring net capital losses within wholly-owned company groups) of that Act were replaced by the provisions in Schedule2 to this Act (which are a modified version of the rules in those sections). (lB) Subsection (1) does not enable a net capital loss to be transferred in the 1998-99 year of income or a later year of income. Note: The heading to section 20 is replaced by the heading ""Transfer of net capital loss"". 549 At the end of the Act Add: Schedule 2--Net capital losses and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 Effect of transferring a net capital loss 170-110 When a corporation can transfer a net capital loss (1) A transferring corporation within the meaning of the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 (the loss company) can transfer an amount of its 'net capital loss for an income year of the loss company (the capital loss year) to a receiving corporation within the meaning of that Act (the gain company) if the conditions in this Subdivision are met. (2) The amount transferred can be the whole or part of the 'net capital loss. Note: A PDF cannot transfer a net capital loss, except one for a period before it became a PDF: see section 195-30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. (3) However, the 'loss company cannot transfer so much of the 'net capital loss as the loss company has applied, or can apply, in working out its 'net capital gain or 'net capital loss for an income year before the one in which the amount is transferred. 170-115 Who can apply transferred loss (1) If an amount of a 'net capital loss is transferred, the gain company can apply the amount in working out its 'net capital gain for the income year of the gain company for which the amount is transferred or for a later income year. The income year for which the gain company applies the amount is called the application year. Note: A company's net capital gain or net capital loss for an income year is usually worked out under section 102-5. (2) The loss company can no longer apply the transferred amount and is taken not to have made the 'net capital loss to the extent of that amount. 170-120 Gain company is taken to have made transferred loss (1) If an amount of a 'net capital loss is transferred, the amount is taken to be a 'net capital loss of the gain company for the capital loss year. (2) However, if the capital loss year is the same as the application year, the amount is taken to be a -capital loss of the gain company for the application year. 170-125 Tax treatment of consideration for transferred tax loss (1) If the loss company receives consideration from the gain company for the transferred amount: (a) the consideration is neither assessable income nor exempt income of the loss company; and (b) the loss company does not make a 'capital gain because of receiving the consideration. Note: However, the consideration may affect how section 170-175 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the loss company. (2) If the gain company gives consideration to the loss company for the transferred amount: (a) the gain company cannot deduct the consideration; and (b) the gain company does not make a 'capital loss because of giving the consideration. Note: However, the consideration may affect how section 170-175 modifies the cost base of direct and indirect interests in the gain company. Conditions for transfer 170-128 Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 must apply to asset transfer from loss company to gain company If it were assumed that: (a) an asset (within the meaning of the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993) had been transferred by the loss company to the gain company on the last day of a particular income year of the loss company (the notional transfer year); and (b) the requirements of paragraphs 7(6)(a) and (b) of that Act were satisfied in relation to that transfer; then it must be the case that that Act would have applied to that transfer. 170-132 The loss year The 'loss year must be either: (a) the income year in which the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 commenced; or (b) an earlier income year. 170-133 The transfer year (1) The 'transfer year must either: (a) end at the end of the 'notional transfer year; or (b) correspond tthe income year of the 'loss company that next follows the 'notional transfer year. (2) Also, the 'transfer year must be one of the 5 income years after the income year in which the Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 commenced. 170-135 The loss company (1) It must be the case that the loss company was not required to calculate the 'net capital loss: (a) under section 165-114 (because of a change in ownership or control); or 'I (b) under section 175-75 (because of an injected capital gain or loss). (2) Also, it must be the case that neither Subdivision 165-CA nor Subdivision 175-CA would have prevented the loss company from applying the 'net capital loss in working out its 'net capital gain for the application year if it had made enough capital gains in that year. Note 1: Subdivision 165-CA deals with the consequences of changing ownership or control of a company. Subdivision 175-CA deals with using a company's net capital losses to avoid income tax. Note 2: A company's net capital gain or net capital loss for an income year is usually worked out under section 102-5. 170-140 The gain company (1) If the capital loss year and the application year are not the same, the gain company must not be prevented by Subdivision 165-CA or 175-CA from applying the transferred amount in working out its 'net capital gain for the application year. Note 1: Subdivision 165-CA deals with the consequences of changing ownership or control of a company. Subdivision 175-CA deals with using a company's net capital losses to avoid income tax. Note 2: A company's net capital gain or net capital loss for an income year is usually worked out under section 102-5. (2) If the capital loss year and the application year are the same, it must be the case that the gain company was not required to calculate its own 'net capital gain or 'net capital loss for the application year: (a) under Subdivision 165-CB (because qf a change in ownership or control); or (b) under section 175-75 (because of an injected capital gain or loss). Note: In deciding whether paragraph (b) applies, remember that the transferred amount is taken to be a capital loss of the gain company for the application year (because of subsection 170120(2». 170-145 Maximum amount that can be transferred Loss company can only transfer what it cannot use itself (1) The amount transferred cannot exceed the amount of the loss company's 'net capital loss that, apart from the transfer, the loss company would carry forward to the next income year after the application year. Note: If the capital loss year and the application year are the same, the loss company would carry forward the whole of the net capital loss, because section 102-5 does not allow a net capital loss to be applied in the income year in which it was made. Example: In the application year the loss company has: a net capital loss from an earlier income year of $25,000; and other capital losses totalling $10,000; and capital gains totalling $20,000; Of the $25,000 loss, the loss company can transfer to the gain company no more than: $25,000-($20,000-$10,000) = $15,000 Transferred loss must not exceed total cost bases of equity and debt ,interests in the loss company held by companies in the same wholly-owned group . (2) The amount transferred also cannot exceed the total of the respective' cost bases at the end of the application year (excluding indexation) of: (a) each 'share in the loss company that is held at the end of the application year by a company that: (i) was a member of the same 'wholly-owned group as the loss company throughout the application year (disregarding a period when either was not 'in existence); and (ii) ""acquired the share on or after 20 September 1985; and (b) each debt that the loss company owes at the end of the application year, for money it ""borrowed, to a company that: (i) was a member of the same 'wholly-owned group' as the loss company throughout the application year (disregarding a period when either was not 'in existence); and (ii) -acquired the debt on or after 20 September 1985. (3) No amount can be transferred if there is no such share or debt. (4) Subsections (2) and (3) do not apply if the gain company is a ""100% subsidiary of the loss company throughout the application year (disregarding a period when either was not ""in existence). 550 Application The amendment made by item 546 applies to a transfer in the 1998-99 income year or a later income year.

Note: The heading to section 18 is altered by omitting ""section 63A"" and substituting ""bad debt provisions"" . Financial Corporations (Transfer of Assets and Liabilities) Act 1993 22 Subsections 22(2) and (3) Repeal the subsections, I'ubstitute: Modification of tests for receiving corporation to deduct bad debt (2) In relation to a transfer of a debt, Subdivisions 165-C, 166-C and 175-C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 have effect as if the debt had been incurred at the time of the transfer. Note: Those Subdivisions are about companies deducting bad debts. Easing of restrictions on transferring corporation (3) If: (a) this Act applies to one or more transfers of assets by the transferring corporation to the receiving corporation; and (b) an entity incurs a debt to the transferring corporation in a year of income (the debt year); and (c) the debt year is the income year in which this section (as originally enacted) commenced or an earlier income year; and (d) Subdivision 165-C or 175-C, or both, of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 prevent the transferring corporation from deducting an amount for the debt for an income year (the deduction year); and (e) the transferring corporation did not, at any time in the deduction year, derive income from: (i) a business of a kind that it did not carry on; or (ii) a transaction of a kind that it had not entered into in the course of its business operations; before the transfer, or the earliest of the transfers, occurred; neither Subdivision 165-C nor 175-C of that Act prevents the transferring corporation from deducting that amount. Note: Subdivision 165-C of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 is about the conditions that a company needs to satisfy before it can deduct a bad debt. Subdivision 175-C of that Act is about the Commissioner preventing a company from getting certain tax benefits through its unused bad debts. 23 Subsection 22(4) Repeal the subsection, substitute: Limit on deductions for partly written-off debt (4) If this Act applies to the transfer of a debt that has been partly written off, the maximum that the receiving corporation can deduct for the debt for one or more years of income under section 8-1 or 25-35 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 is worked out using the formula: Amount of the debt-Unrecouped deductions where: unrecouped deductions means the total of the amounts· that the transferring corporation has deducted or can deduct for any year of income under: (a) section 8-1 or 25-35 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; or (b) section 51 or 63 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936; reduced by the total of any amounts included in its assessable income in respect of the debt under: (c) Subdivision 20-A of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997; or (d) subsection 63(3) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. 24 Application The amendment made by item 23 applies to assessments for the 1997-98 year of income and later years of income.

Tax Law Improvement Bill (No.2) 1997 is to revisit some of the principles which underpin the tax law improvement project, also known as TLIP. When the former Labor government established TLIP on 1 July 1994, it empowered it with the authority to simplify income tax law by restructuring and rewriting the 1936 Income Tax Assessment Act to make it easier to comprehend. I remind members of this mandate because, when one looks through the many hundreds of pages of submissions made to the TLIP team on this bill by those who actively have to work with the tax act on a daily basis, one could be forgiven for forgetting that the rewrite is supposed to facilitate simplification. It is hard to imagine how, in this instance, the consultation process could have been better frustrated or the drafting more poorly executed. The fact that the government produced a 79page supplementary explanatory memorandum filled to the brim with amendments only 36 hours before the bill was first scheduled for debate is indicative of the chaotic manner in which it has been handled. The consensus in the tax industry seems to be that the structural changes that the rewrite will bring about are to be welcomed. Further, the concept of the capital tax event,so-called, has garnered a reasonable level of support amongst legal and financial advisers. However, the two leading concerns of tax professionals about this bill are very significant. They are focused both on the failure of the legislation to adequately deal with known technical errors and on the pruning back of the time available for the completion and review of the rewrite. These matters give rise to a series of related consequences, including a continuation of the lack of certainty in the tax acts and an increase in the number of interpretations which clearly favour the revenue at the expense of the taxpayer. I intend to comment on each of these in some detail. In their combined submission to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in 1996, the Taxation Institute of Australia (TIA), the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Australia (ICAA), and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants (ASCPA), who will be referred to hereon in as 'the bodies', proposed more than 230 separate recommendations for the correction of technical defects in the current law. TLIP may never have intended to address big 'P' policy issues in the rewrite, but its brief certainly extended to addressing the known practical problems in the original act.

431,Mr Rocher (Cqrtin) (10.02 A.m.),"Perhaps a good starting point in commenting on theWednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2291 these technical defects are a source of irritation to taxpayers and their advisers. When combined, they give rise to taxation on unrealised gains and dissuade business investment and development. In speaking on the second instalment of legislation toresult from the tax law improvement project, I said that it was necessary that the terms of reference of TLIP should be extended to include a review of policy. My stated position then was that there should be no easing of pressure on this parliament to implement substantive changes to the policy and administration of tax legislation, and I remain committed to that position. As one submission to the rewrite project made clear, despite government comment to the contrary, there are many examples of policy changes contained within the capital gains tax rewrite. These appear to be selective and confirm that the government and the TLIP team 'cannot seek to hide behind the cloak of the TLIP's limited terms of reference to pretend that it was unable to make small 'p' or even large 'P' policy changes to the current law'. The fact that neither the TLIP team nor the government, both of which received a copy of the bodies' submission, has bothered to give a considered response to the authors by January 1998 is an absolute disgrace. It is also lamentable that the government has failed to address in its amendments the JCPAA recommendation that the TLIP team should respond formally to any submissions from stakeholders by the time future instalments of the rewrite are tabled in parliament. That said, it is pleasing to note that the coalition has finally come to its senses in a small way by choosing to adopt all of the JCPAA's recommendations on technical correction to the capital gains tax regime in its amendments to the bill. However, it should not be forgotten that the government and the Australian Taxation Office, the ATO, had full knowledge of these deficiencies but failed to act on them until the dying hours before this debate was to take place. Before its about-face, the TLIP team, which not coincidentally is dominated by representatives from the ATO, were all too prepared to ignore their own summary of identifiable technical deficiencies. The summary comprised some 157 issues relating specifically to the CGT. As the bodies made clear in their submission to TLIP, the process of identifying and agreeing to unintended consequences is a long and tiresome one. If the outcome of this process fails to produce improved law, then it is for naught. Also, as I understand it, the government's amendments 90 not address the full range of concerns of the peak taxation bodies. Before issuing the supplementary explanatory memorandum, the combined government and TLIP forces had incorporated in the rewrite only 10 per cent of the recommendations by the bodies. Clearly, their amendments will improve on that figure, but they do not go far enough. To read that our leading tax experts regard this rewrite as a lost opportunity in which bad law is simply re-expressed should be of concern to all in this place and elsewhere. The government's 11th hour backdown on some of these technical amendments goes only part of the way to making the most of the opportunity presented by the rewrite. That these concerned experts perceived this bill to be the benchmark, or litmus test, against which the remainder of the rewrite will be judged must have left them feeling rather ambivalent about the worthiness of TLIP. 2292 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 This bill was introduced into the parliament on 22 November 1997 in an incomplete state, owing to the absence of technical corrections and to transitional and consequential provisions. It was not until some five weeks later, on 8 January 1998, that interested parties received information on these latter provisions. But that did not mark the end of the waiting game, because it was only last week-or perhaps the week before-that the government produced its own amendments to the bill, a tentative sign that it is perhaps finally taking some of the advice offered to it by the stakeholders. At best the staggered release of information makes it difficult to give a considered response to the rewritten legislation; at worse it subverts the whole consultation process. As Mr Robert Bryant, Executive Director of the Corporate Tax Association, suggested: . It is grossly inadequate to have delivered to us flawed and incomplete legislation that has the potential to produce disadvantageous outcomes or not be a faithful replication of what has been there before. The big losers in all of this are the corporate and PAYE taxpayers. Clearly it is not just a lack of wanting, on the part of the TLIP team, to address the technical defects in the capital gains tax regime. The lack of time made available to it for the completion and review of the legislation helped ensure that the rewrite was riddled with written errors. Countless examples of technical errors which are present in the 1936 act and which have been faithfully replicated in the TLIP rewrite have been revealed by representatives of the tax community. In addition to these are instances where the signposting in the rewritten legislation is clearly substandard, where there are gaps in the new alphanumeric system and where misprints have been detected. As I have noted elsewhere, if these anomalies are not immediately corrected we can all expect to spend valuable parliamentary time debating a future technical amendments bill to overcome avoidable shortcomings in what is supposed to be a new and improved act. In commenting on the last instalment of the TLIP rewrite, the then Joint Committee of Public Accounts stated that the process 'may be suffering in the rush to have legislation introduced into the parliament'. The chairman of that former committee, the honourable member for Fairfax( Mr Somlyay), went on to note that 'the committee had not had the time to review the bill as comprehensively as it would have liked' and recommended that the government should 'schedule sufficient time for ... review of the next tranche of legislation'. This is the next tranche. That report was tabled in parliament in March 1997. In the foreword to report No. 356 of March 1998, the present chairman of the JCPAA, the honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Charles), outlined his concern that neither the committee nor the tax professionals had confidence in their ability to review the bill because: The time allowed . . . to respond to exposure drafts of the legislation has been truncated . . . A familiar story. The chairman aho cautioned that there was 'evidence of undue haste in preparing the bill because it was incomplete when introduced'. Here we are some 1,2 months and another TLIP instalment later, and there appears to have been no change in the management of either the rewrite Qr the review process. Worse still is the fact that the recommendation by the JCPAA which dealt specifically with this aspect of timing has not been picked up by the government in its subsequent amendments to the bill before us. Recommendation 4 of report No. 356 outlined the committee's position that all of the proposed TLIP legislation' and associated consequential and transitional provisions should be Wednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2293 introduced into the parliament together, and the committee given adequate time for a thorough review. The failure of the government to address this issue, which has been raised not only by the stakeholders but also by its own committee, is lamentable. It is with real trepidation that I note the perception of many in the tax community that the rewrite has ensured that theATO's authority has been consolidated in the new rules at the expense of the taxpayer. Mr Duncan Baxter, partner with Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, noted in evidence to the JCPAA on 29 January this year: The current legislationthat is, the 1936 tax actcontains a number of areas in which the law is unclear and on which the ATO has formed a particular view which is generally favourable to the revenue and on which taxpayers and our advisers have formed a different view .... We certainly see examples of the ATOview being legislated into the new rules. Mr William Glass, president of the Corporate Tax Association, also lent his weight to this argument when he gave evidence that: Either wittingly or unwittingly, there has been seen to be a certain Taxation Office bias in some of the decision making on certain key issues. The suggestion that the rewrite has failed to clarify those areas of current CGT law which are subject to legal challenge is also shared by the TIA, the ASCPA and the ICCA. In their joint submission, they state their belief that: The TLIP team has indicated that it will take a neutral stance to these issues. The evidence is otherwise. The TLIP team has favoured in a number of instances the ATO position. One example used by the bodies to illustrate that is the failure of the TLIP team to deal with the issue of double taxation in circumstances where damages may be recovered in relation to the injury to or loss of property. While limited change has been sought in this bill, the bodies argue that further amendments are necessary to settle, once and for all, the issue of this double tax effect. It is their stated opinion that: The rewrite does not seek to make clear by explicit provision that double tax cannot arise in relation to essentially the one event that occurs in relation to the same asset. As I noted earlier, unlike those responsible for the drafting of the new legislation, these people are responsible for offering advice on tax law on a daily basis. They are telling anyone in this place who cares to listen that this bill is not to be as effective as it could be. Apparently, as at 1 July, 1997, the ATO had identified around 900 rulings and determinations which required amendment as a direct consequence of the rewrite of the 1936 tax act. Instead of making the necessary corrections-which, admittedly, would be a formidable taskthe ATO has opted to issue a new ruling, a final ruling, which has never been released in draft form and which seeks to ratify existing rulings and determinations affected by the rewrite but where there is no intended change in the law. So there is just one ruling, the wording of which is still unknown. As the bodies make very clear: The problem with this approach is that it will leave taxpayers at large, as time goes by, not knowing whether the ATO has in fact made a public statement about the relevant public or private ruling affecting them. 2294 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 The decision to issue this final ruling tips the scales further in favour of the ATO, because the burden that will be imposed on a taxpayer trying to ascertain whether a statement disputing a particular ruling has been made will be considerable. If a taxpayer fails to apply for a new ruling to clarify the existing ruling, the bodies say: There is the very real possibility that taxpayers' private rulings may be overtaken at some stage in the future without them being aware of the fact. In one of the most damning remarks in their entire 200-page submission, the bodies suggest that this is tantamount to: The ATO ... encroaching on the legislative power of parliament in stating that its view creates law. I have recently commented in this place that parliament should be loath to bolster the powers of the tax commissioner, and the treatment of rulings and determinations in this instance confirms my position on that particular point. I challenge the government to try to explain how it is that the concept of this final ruling, which will lead to greater unpredictability in the tax acts, is consistent with the simplification process. Another irony of the rewrite is that it is actually increasing the complexity of the tax act, because professionals are now obliged to refer to both the 1936 act-the original act-as well as the rewritten 1997 act in order to meet the needs of their clients. On page 9 of the coalition's explanatory memorandum, it states that the accumulated impact of the many small improvements in the bill will bring about a noticeable reduction in compliance costs for those using CGT law. But the evidence suggests otherwise. In his brief to the JCPAA, Mr William Glass noted that the cost of researching TLIP affected issues and swapping between the two tax acts has steadily increased by around 30 per cent since the commencement of TLIP. He also expressed the frustration at the valuable time that has been swallowed up in the process, indicating that it was becoming increasingly difficult to provide an immediate response on an issue. Surely, even the government would concede that this establishes a good case for warehousing of this and earlier instalments, until the rewrite is complete. In closing, I remind the House that my support for the efforts being made by the TLIP team has always been qualified. I see little in either the management, or the rewrite, of this bill that persuades me to change my mind. If the rewrite is to amount to anything of substance, the government and the TLIP team must commit themselves to a more rapid, but considered, review of tax legislation. highlights what is an obvious fact and that is that the tax laws in this country have long since passed their use-by date. When we have a tax law improvement bill of 600 pages and an explanatory memorandum accompanying it of substantial proportionsfor Curtin indicates, it is obvious to all of us, and should he obvious to everybody who is in a position to take notice, that the system is simply not working. I am very attracted to a proposal that has been floated by Mr John McRobert called the easy tax two per cent tax. Easy tax is a flat tax on every exchange of ownership of goods and/or services involving monetary considerations. It is a simple, visible and predictable charge for the use of money and facilitating trade and commerce for the exchange of goods and services.",244,Representatives Main Committee

434,Mr Tony Smith,"And the explanatory memorandum for the amendments, as the memberWednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2295 It does not apply to money deposited or withdrawn from a bank. This falls outside the definition. The two per cent tax of the gross monetary value of the exchange of ownership of goods, services and labour would replace personal and company income tax, wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, fringe benefits tax, capital gains tax, withholding tax and provisional taxes. In so doing, it would restore full employment and create a prosperous nation, paving the way for future reforms in relation to tariff and excise matters. The member for Werriwa( Mr Latham), in his as yet unreleased book, has shown some realism in relation to the tax system with his leaning towards a replacement of the income tax system by a tax on consumption, a tax that would basically move towards taxing those who consume most. Those who consume most, generally speaking, are those who are better able to pay tax, and frequently they are those who are not paying tax at the present time because of the tax arrangements they have made. There is a massive industry out there devoted to avoiding tax. There is a massive industry out there which is, reluctantly, subsidised by decent and honourable taxpayers who have to cope with the nightmare of the Income Tax Assessment Act and all of its amendments. The current taxation system is far too complex. The cost of compliance is a massive waste of Australian resources and an unnecessary burden on all taxpayers, and in particular, small businesses. No-one can fully understand the taxation laws; they are too confusing. In my electorate I constantly have members of the accounting profession contact me when a further amendment is made to the tax act. They find that the current tax act is already virtually unmanageable and they simply do not understand it. If they do not understand it, how are they going to explain it to their clients? Of course, added to that is the fact that they do have to somehow understand it; they do have to somehow struggle with it. That leads to the fact that the extra cost to their clients, and ultimately to the community as a whole, will often defeat the purpose of the tax itself. It is just one burden piled on another. In my view, complex and punitive taxation is a major obstacle for all businesses, small and large, and it does cause attention to be diverted from good, sound management. How can you tax profit when you do not have a definition of what profit is? That is the whole probletn with this area. How can you insist on an income tax system continuing on as it has been since about 1915? At that time, ordinary workers would not be paying that level of tax because of their income, but they are now suffering from bracket creep. I recall that, when I was working as an apprentice at the Evans Deakin shipyard, if I worked overtime I was immediately pushed into a higher tax bracket. That was a great disincentive to work longer. That .has not changed under the current system. In fact, it has got worse. A small businessman in my electorate said to me recently that his 1998 take-home pay was no different from what it was in the mid-1980s. When people in small business say that to me, there is a real problem. It is a problem that we must recognise. We can be lulled into thinking that because certain areas in the business sector are doing well other business Sectors are doing well also. There are some sectors in business that are doing well and have improved considerably-and let us hope that continues-but there are other sectors that are being left behind. 2296 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 The small businessman who came to see me last Friday was a motor vehicle repairer. He had 14 people working for him in the mid-1980s but he now has two, including one of his sons. As I said before, his take-home pay has not changed. In fact, it has gone backwards in real terms because of the cost of living increases over that period. He is working 60 and 70 hours a week. The anguish was etched all over his face, and we cannot ignore that. These people are the real battlers out there. What he is saying to me in relation to the tax system and other matters is that those people in the middle group in society are not really being helped by the taxation system. He is saying that the system is crushing them. Therefore, we have to look for innovative ways to deal with what has become a major problem, a modem problem. We cannot keep applying the old system to a modem problem. I think we all accept that the taxation system must be looked at in a serious way, must be dealt with. This measure attempts to improve the understanding of the system but, in my view, the system itself is beyond understanding. As I said, it speaks for itself with the volume of the material that we have to consider. Australia is in a serious situation; a simpler tax system will allow our businesses to be more efficient and productive, and will provide an equal tax charge for goods and services traded over the Internet, for example, as for those traded over the counter. ' The flat tax of two per cent of receipts of income and sales could be phased in over a three year period. Obviously there will be transitional problems in some areas, but those always happen when one is moving to a new system. This is a reality of life; we cannot change the tax system overnight and expect everything to just fit straight into place. Over a three-year period, using a tax pool arrangement to install new gross wages equal to tp.ke home pay plus two per cent would effectively slash the cost of employment, while increasing the purchasing power of the after tax dollar. I emphasise that slashing the cost of employment will increase the ability of employers to employ more people, and that is what we need to do. Easy tax is quite different from a VAT or a GST. It is simpler. In the fully implemented system, there are no deductions, no thresholds, no demarcations, no deeming, no accruals, no pre-payments, no repayments, no exemptions and no nonsense. The net effect is to lower the taxes on employment, drop the cost of employment and increase the demand for employment. Australia has 13 million employable people with only eight million deemed to be employed. So the unemployment statistics just do not add up. After the implementation of a two per cent easy tax, it is obvious that over time other taxes will be discarded as the economy improves. The two per cent tax has the. advantage of being visible. This is one of the things that, I think, we struggle with in the community now-certainly, the people of Australia struggle with the fact that so many of these taxes are hidden. People say, 'We don't have a GST now' when in fact we do in so many areas. This particular idea, in terms of reforming the tax system, will mean there is a visible tax which will show on the sales of goods, services and property-that is, every receipt will show a two per cent surcharge on the listed selling price. It will be a constant reminder of the cost of government, and people need to be reminded of those sorts of things. I think it is part of the accountability of government to the people. The simplification will activate a strong motivational multiplier effect in our economy and this will drive job creation. For small transactions, such as those less than $100, the tax may be added to or deducted from the sale price at the seller's option. The tax on receipts will be due for payment by the end of the month following the month in which the taxable transaction takes place. Annual Wednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2297 financial statements will be lodged within six months after the close of the financial year, together with a statement of cash flow and reconciliation to the annual financial statements. Importers will be responsible for payment of the receipts tax on imported goods and services, those being taxed at two per cent of the purchase value. Internal sales of these imported goods and services will again be taxed at two per cent on sale. Exports will attract the two per cent tax on sale under the normal terms. There will be legal definitions and ATO rulings for different types of taxable transactions but these will be simple. Payment of interest and dividends will be taxed at two per cent for both Australians and foreign investors, with taxation at source for overseas remittances. Deposits and withdrawals from bank accounts will not be taxed, as they are not sales. A delay in the payment of the two per cent tax by the party responsible will incur a penalty tax at the rate of two per cent per month on the tax outstanding but with increasing penalty rates after six months after the end of the financial year. There may be extenuating circumstances but those sorts of details would need to be worked out over time and, frequently, on a case by case basis. The quality of life for the citizens of Australia, in my view, would be improved by this proposal. There would be a massive increase in job opportunities, better job satisfaction and an incentive to work harder. There would be a great influx of people with the entrepreneurial infusion, if you like, of wanting to work harder and get on with their dreams of achieving a reasonable standard of living and, at the same time, being rewarded for effort and not taxed out of existence. Prompted by the concept, I am advised that a unique and powerful computer model of the Australian economy has been developed by Unisearch Research Pty Ltd, at the Queensland University of Technology, to show the relevant impact of all types of taxation on all sectors of commerce and industry. The model was based on 1988 to 1991 figures and reconciled On the national accounts. It was then upgraded to cover the period 1992 to 1995 using the latest complete set of ABS statistics. Indications are that a low rate of tax on receipts has predictable stability and would be difficult to increase once entrenched. In summary, as I have indicated, this particular system of taxation would be simple, and would be much easier to enforce. Indeed, effectively, instead of the complex tax returns that we are now filling out, this would be a one-page tax return. It would be simple and efficient. It would encourage accountants to get into development planning and estimate planning instead of being bogged down on the negative side of taxation-the finding of one's way through and wading one's way through the hopelessly complex taxation legislation, the Income Tax Assessment Act and related acts. I think, in the circumstances, we have to consider a new way of viewing these things. We have to look very far-sightedly because we have been wrapped up and tied up in knots by a system which is doing everything to discourage people from investing, working hard and providing more employment. Really, we cannot have a situation where we have five million people basically twiddling their thumbs, because they could be capably and adequately employed with a system that would encourage employment. In the particular circumstances of this measure, without saying anything other than that the system we have is fracturing and has fractured, I do enCO).lrage those in a position to do something about it to look at these measures and to speak with people like the tax reform group in Queensland headed by John McRobert. Let us hear an argument about it. Let us hear someone say, 'That would not work because ... .' I am yet to hear any significant argument against but, obviously, there are areas that have to be considered. Let us look at these things 2298 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 because, at the end of the day, the system will eventually crack under the strain of the weighty legislation with which we are dealing. referred, in his discussion of taxation issues, to the problem of the taxation treatment of overtime. I have to say, from a personal point of view, that I think it would be much better if employers, rather than encouraging workers to work overtime, in fact took on new employees. My own view is that a situation where some workers, as in the example he gave, are working 60 or 70 hours a week, while others are completely without work and unemployed, is not in fact a good piece of social policy. That would be my own view of that matter. The member for Dickson did ask for discussion and debate about his alternative tax model. I guess it will be interesting to see if the Treasurer ( Mr Costello) affords him the same courtesy as he affords, for example, the member for Werriwa( Mr Latham) when he comes up with policy proposals. I guess time will tell in relation to that. The Tax Law Improvement Bill (No.2) 1997 continues the tax law improvement project process of rewriting the income tax legislation. This TLIP process was instituted by Labor to address the constant and reasonable criticism that the income tax legislation had become too long and too complex. It is important to realise the underlying reason for the constant increase in the complexity of income tax legislation. It is guite simply a function of the increasing complexity of business and the constant practice of tax avoidance. The law has been constantly updated to attempt to ensure that all taxpayers can continue to contribute a fair share of income tax. Unfortunately, no matter how many loopholes are identified and closed, there are always new avenues being developed and new anomalies which need to be addressed. The TLIP process is one method by which this issue is being addressed. Due to the sheer scale of the task-as others have pointed out, the legislation covers many thousands of pagesit is not feasible to rewrite the 1936 legislation in its entirety in one fell swoop. Accordingly, the TLIP process has proceeded on the basis of redrafting discrete portions of the legislation. This, in itself, does raise problems. However, as it is not possible to achieve the task in one package, there is really no option but to continue on a staged basis. The bill is the third instalment of the rewrite legislation. The major areas covered in the rewrite are capital gains tax, company bad debts, intellectual property, and environmental expenditure, including environmental impact statements. These are all important areas of business taxation and, hopefully, the redrafted provisions will improve the ease with which business interprets, and complies with, these areas of the law. As well as rewriting the law, the legislation takes the opportunity to effect minor policy changes to make the law clearer and simpler. This is not an attempt to significantly change the policy governing these areas; rather, the objective is limited to replacing impractical rules with ones that are easier to comply with, simplifying the rules that are retained, deleting the unnecessary ones, removing anomalies and clarifying ambiguities as much as possible. Without commenting on any particular examples, this approach seems reasonable to the opposition, and we are not opposed to this general course of action. Consistent with the practice of the prior TLIP bills, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has examined the bill and reported earlier this month, in Report No. 356. The report canvasses the usual range of concerns raised in the TLIP process, such as that there has been",248,Representatives Main Commitiee
435,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (10.39 A.m.),"The member for Dickson( Mr Tony Smith)Wednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2299 inadequate time for proper consideration by industry of the ramifications of the new wording; that the commencement date for the new provisions should be delayed beyond the 1 July proposal; and that therefore there should be a no detriment rule introduced, so that taxpayers can choose either the existing law or the new law. While there is some substance to these concerns, the problem is that, if the parliament were to agree to the no detriment rules, the whole rewriting process would be effectively rendered worthless. There would be the impossible situation of two parallel sets of income tax law operating, with taxpayers being able to choose the particular wording from either the old legislation or the new legislation-whichever suits them. Obviously that would encourage aggressive tax planning activity, especially.by those with considerable means, and that would inevitably result in lower revenue collections than would otherwise be the case. Clearly, that would be an undesirable and an unfair outcome, and, accordingly, Labor will not support such a proposition: That said, we are concerned about a number of the specific issues that were brought to the attention of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit by various witnesses. There are various situations where the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit is concerned about the potential for double taxation, including those provisions mentioned in recommendations 6 and 9 of the report. In addition, recommendation 8 touches on the very complex issue of the taxation of compensation payments received where an asset is destroyed. The joint committee makes the sensible point that, if a ruling on the operation of the provisions is 355 paragraphs long, then there must be a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the operation of the provisions, and this uncertainty should be addressed. There were many other technical issues highlighted by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit report, and I indicate now that the opposition will support the government amendments that will be moved later in the debate to address the issues raised in the report. Simplification of tax law is clearly no easy matter. We have thousands of pages of tax law. We endeavour to condense them to fewer thousands of pages of tax law. The problem is of course that some bright sparks-and there are certainly plenty in the taxation advice industrywill want to say that these words now mean different things from what the previous words meant. We can expect some new litigation and testing of the meaning of the words that are passed by the parliament. It is a difficult area in which to achieve simplicity. That leads some people to say that we could achieve greater simplicity of the taxation system, for example, through the introduction of a goods and services tax. If you believe that, you will believe anything. The present situation for small businesses, for example, is that some 75,000 of them are collectors for the wholesale sales tax system. If a goods and services tax were to be introduced, more like one million small businesses would become collectors of the goods and services tax. That comes to us from the government, which proposes that red tape for small business ought to be reduced by 50 per cent. We have a situation where we could be looking forward to new computer systems, new cash registers, calculations being required which previously were not required and a whole series of transactions, particularly in the services field, which were not previously subject to or part of the taxation net, becoming part of the taxation net. This would mean all kinds of servicesvisits to the theatre, visits to the footy, haircuts, all sorts of things-becoming part of the taxation net, and the system accordingly would become more complex. Certainly, from the 2300 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 opposition point of view, we reject the notion that that would provide for a simpler taxation system. As I indicated at the outset, we are supporting the government's bill and believe that this is part of an appropriate process of taxation law improvement. We look forward to its continuation. Kelvin Thomson) for most, if not all, of his comments on the Tax Law Improvement Bill (No. 2) 1997. I had the privilege of participating in the 2lh days of public hearings in a round table format with some of Australia's top tax accountants and tax l\lwyers, together with the officials from the department, the TLIP group-including the three private sector consultants on the TLIP group-and the private sector consultative committee. It was for me a real learning experience. I went to the first day of those hearings expecting, quite frankly, to be bored out of my mind. In fact, I found the whole process invigorating. I enjoyed it. The debate was not acrimonious; it was harmonious, but people put their points of view strongly. By the time we had finished the 2lh days, the committee was satisfied that it had a grasp of the major issues and some specific policy changes requested by the private sector, and that it had a grasp of the overall importance of the legislation and of the processes that had been followed. Accordingly, the committee made its report. As noted by the Parliamentary Secretary (Cabinet) to the Prime Minister( Mr Miles) in his second reading speech, this bill is the third instalment in a total rewrite of the 1936 tax act as amended from time to time. I have no difficulty in remembering that year, as I joined this earth at that time. I do not know what that has to do with the bill; I just thought I would throw it in. it. The new look tax act is in plain English and is intended to be more easily understood by those who use it regularly-taxation accountants and lawyers. The government is to be congratulated on undertaking this mammoth task of simplifying and restructuring the tax act to make it clearer for the practitioners required to use it in their daily business. I also acknowledge the excellent work done by the TLIP group, and the private sector representatives advising them, in producing this legislation. The key aim of this simpler and clearer format is to reduce compliance costs to taxpayers. That has to be a primary objective. The Tax Law Improvement Bill (No.2) 1997 is of particular interest to small business because it contains the rewritten rules about capital gains and losses and their treatment by the tax office with regard to capital gains tax. I am delighted the government has amended the original bill as a direct result of the recommendations made by the Joint Committee of Public. Accounts and Audit in its report No. 356, tabled in parliament on 12 March 1998. The government has accepted all of the committee's recommendations for technical changes. The government has also made changes to the explanatory memorandum along the lines recommended by the committee. Of some continued concern, however, is the fact that the number of issues to be discussed remains limited to about 12 a year. I am particularly pleased to note the government's adoption of recommendation 3-to delay introduction of proposed",252,Representatives Main Committee

438,Mr Charles,"That is absolutely true: I may have been here before, but I do not recallWednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2301 subdivision 118-F and divisions 123 and 138 pending review by the JCPAA. That was a particular part of our recommendations. The member for Wills talked about the private sector asking for either a no-detriment clause to be put into the bill for a period of some two years or both the 1936 act and the rewritten act to operate in parallel for some period of time. The committee, on balance, while it understood the private sector concerns-as the member for Wills has rightly pointed out--came down on the side of workability for tax agents and tax lawyers in the field in view of the difficulty that we would impose on them by having two parallel acts running at the same time and them having to go through both acts on a particular issue, pick the one that they thought suited them best and then try to use that as their justification for their approach with their client to the tax office. We thought, on balance, that that would lead to an impossible situation. We are pleased that the government has accepted our recommendation, that the bill will go ahead as amended and that further amendments will be made in order to pick up subdivision 118-F and divisions 123 and 138 after the JCPAA has had the opportunity to review those sections both with TLIP and with the private sector consultant. The bill describes division 138-'Dealings between companies under common ownership'as being: ... designed to overcome timing advantages that bring forward capital losses and defer capital gains that can arise when value is shifted between companies under common ownership. It says: Value shifts can occur when one company (the originating company): · transfers a CGT asset to another company (the recipient); or · creates a CGT asset in the recipient (for example, by creating contractual rights or granting an option); for less than its market value. This will reduce the market value of the shares in the originating company and increase the market value of shares in the recipient company. These issues are of vital importance to business and it is essential that proper consideration of the full implications of the rewrite be undertaken by JCPAA. At this stage it has not been possible to scrutinise this division at committee level. Proposed division 123 deals with rollover relief on the disposal of assets of small businesses and proposed subdivision 118-F with exemption for disposals of small business retirements assets. Both these issues were the fulfilment of election promises to the small business community. Both of these rewrites will be subject to further review by the joint committee to ensure proper scrutiny and the identification of any unintended consequences that may arise. The bill includes some enhancements in the rewritten rules to clarify previously complicated, uncertain or ambiguous convoluted terminology. For example: Division 104 lists all the events that may result in a capital gain or capital loss. It also specifies for each kind of event: · how to calculate the amount of any gain or loss; · the time of the event, which in tum determines when the gain or loss is made; and · cases in which gains are losses or disregarded for CGT purposes. The term 'CGT event' is a new term that spells out in plain English when a capital gain or loss occurs. This area has been particularly complex in the past, with no clear definition about the timing of a capital gain or a capital loss. It also includes the important issue of deeming 2302 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 whether or not a gain or loss has occurred. If for no reason other than this, it is important for the bill to pass into legislation so that it can be enacted before 1 July 1998. The new division 108 covers the three categories of assets that may be liable to capital gains .and losses. They are: capital gains tax assets, collectables and personal use assets. The bill ciarifies the circumstances under which a CGT liability arises. The definitions of what comprise these categories are clear and concise and should make it easier for taxpayers to determine their CGT accessible property. A change of significant value to some home owners is the new provision that allows a person to continue to apply the main residence exemption to the disposal of vacant land where the dwelling that was on it is accidentally destroyed. . The old act denied an individual a CGT exemption on the sale of vacant land if the main residence was destroyed by, say, a bushfire. For a range of reasons, the people who lose their homes through fire may not wish to rebuild on the same site. Under the new law, section 118160, they will be able to apply the main residence exemption rules to the disposal of the vacated land as if the residence was not destroyed. This is a genuine benefit for those whose homes are devastated in a bushfire and who cannot face the prospect of rebuilding or living in the same spot again. This is good legislation. It is good because it simplifies very complex law to make it easier for practitioners on the ground to advise their clients. It is not intended that a layman be able to read every section of the new act and necessarily come to grips with it or understand it. It is, however, intended to put in plain concise English all those tax laws which will enable the professional to treat them properly. capital gains tax is very complicated. I must admit that I have a personal view that, if we could simplify capital gains tax, and if we could reduce the rates of capital gains tax, I would be pleased. It would be good for business, for jobs and for the country. It is a very difficult issue. I am sure we will come to grips with it as we further address the important issue of taxation reform. I move: That further proceedings on this bill be conducted in the House. Question resolved in the affirmative. Second Reading Debate resumed from 12 March, on motion by Mr Miles: That the bill be now read a second time. Bill 1998 is the government's substantive response to the recommendations of the inquiry of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues into the child support scheme. It proposes a number of changes. It proposes, firstly, to introduce a minimum child support liability for all non-custodial parents of $260 per annum, and secondly, to include net rental property losses-that is, negative gearing types of losses and exempt foreign income-in the taxable income for child support purposes.",254,Representatives Main Committee

441,Mr Kelvin Thomson (Wills) (10.58 A.m.),"The Child Support Legislation AmendmentWednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2303 It proposes to introduce case management to assist parents at risk of family violence, to end the collection of child support or, indeed, to recommence the collection of child support as appropriate. It proposes to increase the exempt income of the child support payers by 10 per cent. For 1997-98, the exempt amount would be $9,907 for single payers and $16,525 plus additional amounts for each child for payers with natural or adopted children in their care . It also proposes to lower what is referred to as the 'payee's disregarded income' from $37,424 to $29,598 by using a figure known as the 'all employees average total weekly earnings' rather than full-time adult weekly earnings. It needs to be pointed out at once that this reduction will be offset by the halving of the rate at which child support is reduced from the present dollar for dollar reduction in child support once you are over that income limit to 50c in the dollar. So that will offset the lowering of the payee's disregarded income. Payees may seek reassessment if they incur high child-care costs exceeding five per cent of their income. The bill also seeks to revise the child support scheme objectives to recognise that both parents are responsible for the support of their children. It seeks to allow parents, by agreement, to undertake private collection of child support at any time, and it talks about using the most current taxable income information available in the child support assessment. However, I would want to suggest to the committee that simply using the previous tax year, rather than the one before, does not really resolve the problems that we have where people are required to make estimates of their income, or are SUbjected to the indexation factors, and if it turns out that their income is less than they have estimated, but that estimate is less than 15 per cent, in fact, they cannot recover the amounts that they pay in child support. It also seeks to introduce an internal review mechanism for objection to decisions made by the Child Support Agency. It proposes to deem a stepchild to be a relevant dependent child where the court has made a relevant order under the Family Law Act. It also proposes to continue child support liability until the end of the school year when you have got a child who is undergoing full-time secondary education and that person turns 18 during that school year. The proposal is that the liability would continue to the end of the school year. It makes a series of other administrative changes which are, I think, of less significance. It has to be said that the child support legislation has been controversial and was the subject of an extensive inquiry by a committee of the parliament, the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. I have a copy of their report which goes to approximately 700 pages. That committee received 6,197 submissions which, I understand, is the largest number ever received by any parliamentary committee, and a hotline organised by the joint select committee generated 150,000 calls in some two days of operation. So there is a very substantial degree of community interest and community concern in relation to this issue. This is also borne out by the fact that the 1995-96 Commonwealth Ombudsman's report notes that the Child Support Agency accounted for some 16 per cent of all the complaints to the Ombudsman's office. I understand that the Child Support Agency receives in excess of 4,000 letters a day and, in terms of more recent information which I obtained from the Child Support Agency, from 1 July 1997 to 30 November 1997 it received 17,516 applications for departure from the standard formula. So there is no doubt that the Child Support Agency has generated a lot of community comment and, indeed, community concern. When the child support review was conducted by the joint select committee, it concluded that the development of the child support scheme was a qualified success. It pointed out that 2304 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 it had been successful in sheeting home to parents responsibility for looking after their children, and making it clear that it was not acceptable to have children and then to walk away from that responsibility to look after them until they attained the age of majority. It ought to be said that some members of the government have been highly critical of the child support scheme. Indeed, I think that it is fair to say that it was used in some places as a campaigning weapon against Labor. But, if we look at the legislation before us, the government has essentially acknowledged the success of the child support scheme by only tinkering at the margins. I have made a few calculations about the impact of the child support scheme changes being proposed by this bill and I think that you will find they indicate that the changes are very small indeed, and very much at the margin. For example, if we. look at a non-custodial parent who has a child support liability or obligation for two children, if their income is presently $80,000 or more, they pay 24 per cent of that income in child support to look after those two children. Under the government's changes, allowing for rounding, they will still pay 24 per cent of their income in looking after those two children. If we move to $70,000 per year, they presently pay 24 per cent of their income in looking after two children. Under the government's model, that will move to 23 per cent, and so on down the line. If your income is presently $60,000 you have to pay 23 per cent of your income in child support. If you have two children to look after, you will still have to pay 23 per cent of your income. If your income is $50,000, the amount you have to pay will remain at 22 per cent under the government's model. If your income is $40,000, current payments of 21 per cent will move to 20 per cent, allowing for rounding in these matters. The same sorts of situations apply if you factor in looking after one child, looking after five childr-n, and so on. The impact of increasing the exempt income amount by 10 per cent to 110 per cent of the pension rate will be very much at the margin. Indeed, if you look at the government's examples as set out in the explanatory memorandum, this point is made clear as well. On page 14 of the explanatory memorandum there are calculations for a hypothetical couple, Peter and Francine, who have three children and have separated. In this hypothetical example, Peter's taxable income is $42,000 and Francine's taxable income is $14,000. The current child support annual rate is $11,163, but under the government's proposed change it will be $10,795, a very small change indeed and even smaller if you look more closely at the calculations and see that there are different inflation factors from one year to the next. Similarly, the government's proposed changes regarding a carer's disregarded income amount will also have a negligible effect. In the government's example concerning the impact of reducing the disregarded income amount, but offsetting that with a move from dollar for dollar reduction to SOc in the dollar reduction, they give the hypothetical example of Peter with $42,000 and Francine, on this occasion, with $48,000. Under the present arrangements, Peter has to pay Francine $7,686. However, under the changed arrangements brought in by the government's legislation, Peter will have to pay Francine $7,663, which is $23 per annum less. I do not think that will cause Peter to be breaking out the champagne, quite frankly. Indeed, that is the pattern of the changes. They are differences absolutely at the margin. That is one reason why they have not attracted a great deal of public comment, either concern from custodial parents or support and applause from non-custodial parents. I guess this amounts to inherent recognition from the government of the scheme's value. Wednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 2305 We now have a situation where the government has fallen in behind the child support scheme, leaving those who have been critical of it in an interesting position. I note on the speakers list there are a number of government speakers who I recall have been quite critical in the past of the child support scheme, so I will be interested to see what their approach is in the debate in relation to this issue. The opposition has a number of amendments which we propose to move during the committee stage of this debate. l hope that the government will see its way clear to support these amendments, or at the very least provide us with an appropriate explanation as to why it would not be prepared to support those amendments. Indeed, if the government is not prepared to support those amendments then I hope that some of those government MPs who have taken an interest in child support issues will see their way clear to support them themselves. For our part, good public policy is always an unfinished business. Just because the child support scheme is a pioneering, trailblazing scheme it does not mean that it is perfect and does not mean that it will not require tinkering or adjustment in the future. On the contrary, it is all the more probable that pioneering and trailblazing legislation will require tinkering and adjustment in the future. We are happy that the government has examined this issue and happy that it has come forward with a number of changes for the parliament to consider. As I said, we have put forward 11 number of amendments which we believe pick up issues arising out of the report from the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues that have not been appropriately dealt with so far. Those proposed amendments concern, firstly, direct payments in the child's interest. They follow recommendations 67 and 68 of the joint select committee and would allow the Child Support Registrar the discretion to credit certain non-agency payments as child support when in the registrar's opinion-let me emphasise that-these payments are in the interests of the child, subject to a 25 per cent limit on the amount of child support which the payer is obliged to pay before the custodial parent's consent is required. As those who have followed this debate and have seen the recommendations of the joint select committee will be aware, this is designed to give non-custodial parents a more realistic opportunity of participating in the raising of their children. I think that is an important and worthwhile objective and always to be seen as part of this scheme; we want to have noncustodial parents involved in the raising of their children. It also endeavours to address, in part, the concerns of non-custodial parents about the lack of accountability for how child support is spent. Some of the evidence that the joint select committee received from payers in this area is somewhat hysterical; some of it proposing that there ought to be accountability for every single dollar. That is not something which, as a matter of public policy, ought to be supported. It would be extremely intrusive into the life of the custodial parent and it would also be very costly and cumbersome to administer. In coming up with the recommendation, I think the joint select committee did go some way towards addressing those concerns. We are, therefore, proposing to move this as an amendment. We are also looking at trying to ensure that changes in income are properly reflected in child support liabilities. At present, the non-custodial parents who suffer a reduction in their income cannot recover any payments that they make unless that reduction exceeds 15 per cent. Recommendations 125 to 127 of the joint select committee provide for a much more up-to-date assessment of income and thereby largely address this problem. The government has made 2306 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 some changes, both in this legislation and previously, which are intended to help address this problem but, as far as we can tell, it still remains a serious issue for people making estimates of their income. Let us say that a person is employed as a part-time cleaner; that they have a part-time cleaning contract. If the contract comes. up for renewal and they miss out on the contract, their income is therefore reduced but their child support is paid on that earlier basis and they are not entitled to recover the overpayments. This strikes us as a problem that could be better addressed. Therefore, we are proposing that recommendations 125 to 127 of the joint select committee be put forward to address this. We think there ought to be a financial penalty on anyone who deliberately or recklessly provides false or misleading information. We do not want to encourage dishonesty in this area and this is something that the joint select committee also recommended at 128 and 129. We also propose to put forward some amendments which will attack child support avoidance which continues to be a problem. Joint select committee recommendation 142 is designed to help repair the child support income base by identifying parents who receive business or investment income and the extent to which those parents minimise their child support liabilities in that way. Joint select committee recommendations 143 and 144 propose that fringe benefits should be added to the existing child support income base for both parents and we should require both parents to provide full details of all fringe benefits received from an employer. We also put forward proposals for changes to the modelling of the scheme. Joint select committee recommendation 162 proposes that we include the impact of the relative disposable income of custodial parents and non-custodial parents of the value of fringe benefits provided by all levels of governments to parents who are social security recipients. We also propose that that assessment be conducted by a body independent of the Department of Social Security. Finally, we will be putting forward an amendment concerning the issue of subsequent family repartnering following joint select committee proposal 139 that a non-custodial parent's subsequent family formula self-support component be increased so that the relativity between the single and married rate of pension is reflected in the basic and subsequent self-support component. These are things that I propose to speak to in more detail during the committee debate, but I do believe that this amendment would go some way towards addressing what is an increasing concern that the children of subsequent relationships are being treated as less valuable than the children of a first relationship. As I said before, the child support legislation is pioneering legislation and its impact is beginning ,to be measured and understood. I obtained recently from the Child Support Agency a very interesting paper from Allan Shephard of the Child Support Agency's Research and Policy Unit. The paper was prepared in September 1997 and compares Australia's with other child support schemes. It ought to be noted that there are very few legislatively based child support schemes around the world and this comparison focuses on Australia, the United States, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. Canada has recently introduced a child support scheme with legislative backing, but it is too recent for there to be relevant data available. It is interesting to note that if you look at the collection as compared with case load and convert it to Australian dollars as the researcher has done, you see that in the United States the average Australian dollar collection per case is $816; in New Zealand it is $1,111; in the United Kingdom it is $1,302 per annum; in Australia it is $2,368 per annum. In terms of where we are in Australia, we are a long way ahead of the world and there is no question that this is Wednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2307 the best place in the world by far to be a custodial parent and nothing in the government's legislation in my view will change any of that, with the changes being very much at the margin. I do want to make some comments about the issue of the relationship between child support and matrimonial property which is an area of some concern which was identified by the joint select committee in its report. Indeed it devotes a whole chapter to the issue of the relationship between child support payments and matrimonial property and expresses some concern in the report that a non-custodial parent might agree to a property settlement which includes provision for the custodial parent and children to remain in the family home and then discover at a later date that the non-custodial parent is responsible for a substantial child support liability which arguably includes a component for housing. The committee received submissions to it which referred to this phenomenon as double-dipping. It is interesting to note that the Family Court's submission stated that anecdotal reports from the legal profession indicated that the child support formula and the scheme in general have had little, if any, impact on levels of property adjustment. Michael Watt, from the Law Council, stated: ... there is undoubtedly a lag in the recognition by the judicial and legal culture of the structural change which the Child Support Assessment Act has brought into the whole process. The Chief Justice of the Family Court stated: I do not think that there is any discefl1ible effect on the level of property settlements as a result of this legislation. This is an issue which I took up with one of the judges of the Family Court, Justice Mushin, when I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. In terms of property settlements, he stated that, in his view, child support is a maintenance thing, that the need to house children-those capital sorts of thingsare not part of what child support is about. It is certainly my understanding-and if you talk to those responsible for the child support scheme about the formula, the 18 per cent, 27 per cent, 32 per cent and so on, it is also their understanding-that child support is intended to cover accommodation for children. So it seems to me that we do have a problem in relation to double-dipping. I suggest, however, that the way in which property settlements are conducted is most properly addressed back at the Family Court. Rather than being an appropriate topic for review in this legislation, they are something which the child support scheme itself should be able to address. Child support arouses very strong passions, and it is seen as evidence that there is a gender war taking place in our society. The member for Werriwa( Mr Latham), who has spoken on this issue before, was absolutely right when, in previous debate in this place concerning child support, he called for us to stop looking at this issue through the prism of gender. . We find this exhortation very hard because at present, in over 90 per cent of cases of separation or divorce, it is the woman who ends up with the children and becomes the custodial parent, and therefore in over 90 per cent of cases it.is the man who is the noncustodial parent and liable to pay child support. I personally think that, in the long run, the best way to get the heat out of this area and to lower its emotional temperature would be for us to move to a situation where fathers have custody of children in something approaching 50 per cent of cases rather than in the less than 10 per cent at present. 2308 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 Whether the reason why they do not have custody in 50 per cent of cases at present is that they do not seek it or that the Family Court tends to award custody to mothers is something that I do not know a great deal about. In any event, it is well beyond the scope of the legislation which we are considering to attempt to address such an issue. But if, as a society, we did move towards a situation where post separation a lot more fathers were directly responsible for the care of their children, then I think we would have a calmer public debate. We might see the calls for change to the formula subside or, if they continued, we might be in a better situation to be able to deal with them. One of the things that troubles me about the present operation of child support is that it does not make any practical distinction between cases where men are happy to father children and then move on, taking no responsibility for the welfare of those children-those whom President Clinton has rightly condemned as 'deadbeat dads'-and the cases where a father is only too happy to continue raising the children, often cases where he did not initiate the marital split in the first place but is prevented from raising the children by a Family Court decision. In these cases of unsuccessful attempts to win custody, the child support scheme seems to the father concerned to add insult to injury. I hope that in the future we will be able to move forward to a situation where there is less hardship and misery all round. There is no question in my mind that the breakdown of a marriage, or of any relationship involving children, is a terrible thing. It leaves emotional scars on both parents and on the children. We try, as a parliament, to do justice in each of these situations as best we can to each of the parties and to help them through these difficult circumstances. I hope that the government's bill represents a further step in the development of a fair and just social policy. As I indicated at the outset, we will be supporting it. We will also be moving amendments on which we will have a debate in the committee stage and taking up issues there which we hope will improve it further. in Townsville and is a small step in the right direction. I am also interested to hear of the amendments that the opposition have proposed. day, but certainly some of them seem attractive. I am surprised, and perhaps many of the members here today would be too, that perhaps the legislative changes need to go significantly further down the track in order to address some of the root and core problems of the Child Support Agency. I think many members feel very deeply about this. Certainly in our electorate offices there is widespread contact with both sides of the equation indicating the kinds of issues that are continually there. Child support is a difficult issue. It is a dreadfully complex and terribly emotional issue and, by the very nature of family breakdown, is often quite adversarial. The fundamental problems of the Child Support Agency are felt right throughout Australian society: rich or poor, black or white, north or south. You name a section of the community and somewhere you will find family breakdown and people with problems associated with child support.

They may be fathers who have not seen their sons or daughters for months, if not years, because they have shifted towns or states. Laurie Chalker was something of a regular in my electorate office, discussing the need for fundamental family law reform and Child Support Agency reform, up until the beginning of this year. Sadly, his problems overwhelmed him, driving him, like many others, to take his own life. All of my staff in my electorate office were touched personally by his passing. We never really got to know Laurie personally. By that I mean we did not know what sort of a family man he was, where he grew up and so on. What we did get to find out was that he was passionate about reforming the system and the sorts of things we have in this legislation today, which in his eyes and in the eyes of many thousands of other people throughout Queensland and Australia seem far from fair and equitable. He was passionate about reform and what it meant specifically for non-custodial fathers. It was not difficult to understand from where his frustration developed over time. Shortly before he died, Laurie Chalker had a visiting schedule determined by the Family Court so that he could see his child. Laurie was in Townsville but his child was in Cloncurry, some 700 kilometres west of Townsville. Laurie had to arrange for and pay, without assistance from anyone, transport to and from Cloncurry, accommodation, meals and so on. When he was there, he had to arrange and pay for qualified and approved supervision on all of the visits. To his frustration, often that may not have been available on the weekend when he was able to go. Each of his visits was for 'a certain day of the month and, if the supervisor was not available, well then it was a case of bad luck. I am sure Laurie knew many more sole mums and dads much worse off than he was. I support this bill as it is a step in the right direction. But, in the overall scheme of things, it is only a small step and we certainly need to try harder and harder. The fundamental principle behind these reforms, as the second reading speech of this bill states, is: ... parents are primarily responsible for the financial support of their children. I certainly support that. I have no doubt that reform of the Child Support Agency must go further. I am pleased that the government has recognised this and I look forward to participating and contributing to those necessary further changes. Amendment Bill, I certainly support the view that reform needs to go further. I have already spoken in this place about the failure of the Labor government to pick up the recommendations of the report, so I do not want to traverse that again. If this is a small step, there are many people that are going to feel completely let down by these changes. They are wimpy. They do not go far enough. They certainly are not fair or equitable. The thing that I find the most difficult to comprehend is that in the committee it was not just my view-in fact, I credit the President of the Senate, Senator Reid, with saying this-that we have brought down a balanced package of recommendations and that government should not cherry-pick their way through it. But successive governments have attempted to do just that. I almost feel, 3Y2 years after bringing down the report, and now seeing this passage of measures going through, that we ought to consign the report to history. It will always stand a good test of time, in terms of a base document. But I really feel that we now probably need to move on and take a more different approach. I notice that the government, having set up one backbench committee on child support, has this week announced the formation of a second",262,Representatives Main Committee
445,Mr Price (Chifley) (11.30 A.m.),"In the debate on the Child Support Legislation2310 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 backbench committee on child support. However, the chairman, the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony), will not be participating in this debate. It does not augur well. The first thing I want to say is regarding the modelling of changes. The committee developed a package of changes to the formula. Before we agreed on that, we asked the Department of Social Security to model these and proposed other changes. That took six months and a technical upgrade of their computer. I say to government members that, if you are so proud of the changes that you have made, where is the modelling information? We have the explanatory memorandum to the bill. There is in it absolutely no modelling of these changes. There are examples of the impact, but no modelling. Why is there none? One of our amendments picks up the recommendation that DSS should not have a monopoly on. the modelling. Why, I ask government members, have you picked 10 per cent? Why not 15 per cent? Why not 7.5 per cent, for that matter? What is your argument for picking 10 per cent? There is no argument. It is like this: 'We have got 10 per cent. Thou shalt have 10 per cent.' I am not saying 20 per cent is immutable. I am not saying that lowering the disregarded income level that we recommended is immutable. We picked the pension cut-off point to avoid double whammies of poverty traps. There was another argument. For example, the Family Court did not say that it should go down to the $29,598 that you are recommending. The Family Court said to us, 'In the interests of fairness in terms of parents' capacity to pay, it should go down to $15,000.' We did not agree with that. We set the pension cut-off point-recognising that, in the formula of changes proposed by the committee 3Y2 years ago, that was seen as the minimum necessary to restore some equity and fairness. What is it about this new level that has prompted you to change it? Please tell us. I may agree with you or I may disagree with you, but there is absolutely nothing of it in the explanatory memorandum. If there are people who really do think that this is a wonderful bill, that we are at last seeing some changes-I could use an expletive but you are in the chair, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I would not. This is nothing more than a revenue raising measure. Do government members know how much money this is going to raise? Between $47.2 million and $26.2 millionstraight into consolidated revenue. Mrs Gash-Rubbish! section of the explanatory memorandum. goes through it is expected, depending on which figure you use-and I agree that there are two figures in the explanatory memorandum-that consolidated revenue is going to be better off by between $47.297 million and $26.2 million. My simple point to government members would be: would this not be better being applied to families or applied to children? I am not particularly fussed what you choose, but would it not be better going to the families that are affected by this legislation rather than being pocketed by the government? That is partly why I am so disappointed. I think people who have looked to this government to introduce reform are going to be surprised, even shocked, that the reform package nets the government money. 1 can tell honourable members how it is done. I know they are very upset about it all. It is done through",263,Representatives Main Committee

447,Mr Billson,"It is when the partners, though",264,Representatives Main Committee
448,Mr Price,"-I am sorry, it is all accounted for. I am just making the point that if this billWednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2311 a means that I fully support: by allowing the registrar to decide that good payers should not be part of the scheme. That is a principle in the report. No-one can afford to have the Child Support Agency growing and growing every year as it has since its existence. I suppose I need to put forward the usual disclaimers. I am proud of the child support scheme. It was a good scheme. I do not think we have looked hard enough at it or tried to refine and reform it sufficiently. That is my only quibble about it. But am I in favour of abolishing the child support scheme? Certainly not. But this is one of the measures to try to contain the growth and to develop the principle that the best relationships are mutually arrived at between the two parties. There is something not said in terms of shifting people out of the scheme, and I would be grateful to learn what is proposed here. I assume that the registrar is going to have to develop guidelines for traceable payments, so that, in the event that the arrangements break down, people can revert to the Child Support Agency. I am probably saying something very unpopular amongst a lot of the people that meet me, when I say that I feel very sorry for the Child Support Agency. Why do I say that? I have always said that you can never refine the administration of the scheme to such a perfect point as to think you have solved the problem, until you tackle the hard policy areas. Again the Child Support Agency has been left with the burden of administering some flawed policy areas. I do not think I have said exactly what increasing the exempted income means for the paying parent-this 10 per cent. Lest we rush away with the thought that this is going to have a fabulous impact on the living standards of these paying parents, let me say that, if a paying parent has one child, this 10 per cent is going to mean a difference of an extra 46c per day. Even the weekly amount of $3.25 per week is not going to pay for a packet of cigarettes-at best, half a packet of cigarettes. For the parent who is paying for two children, this 10 per cent increase is going to mean that, in their disposable income, they are going to have $4.80 per week or 68c per day. It is true this is better than nothing-absolutely-and I support it on that basis. But let us not run around saying that we have addressed the concerns of the paying parent. I do not think we have. I reiterate that the 20 per cent in the report was seen as a minimum necessary, not a maximum. In fact, we had modelled up to an extra 60 per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker, I told you that this nets revenue to the government. If they had gone to the 20 per cent that would have cost an extra $10 million. They could have well afforded it. It has, in additional family payments, impact on the caring parent, which I acknowledge. However, it would have cost, in additional family payments, an extra $10 million a year. It is pretty miserable to be pocketing this money and not looking to do more for those that are directly affected. This bill imposes a minimum payment, something that I certainly support and that was part of the recommendation. But, again, this was predicated against a more balanced treatment of all the other recommendations. Perhaps the government members have not thought about this, but when you are giving 46c or 68c a day-for paying parents with one or two children-this minimum payment is going to affect 31 per cent of the Child Support Agency's clientele. Those are 3Y2-year-old figures. What really disappoints me is the lack of explanation. It is very hard to have an argument when people do not offer you their reasoning. I regret that, in anything that I have read about 2312 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 these measures, no reasoning is offered for the approach. It is like: 'Well, pick it out.' Is it still 31 per cent? I guess we have to leave it to the experts, but I was surprised at the $2 million that it was said it was going to cost to administer. Not that I thought that was an overstatement-I am not in a position to query it. But I was surprised that it was relatively so low, given the huge number of new assessments that we are going to be making. With great respect to government members, I would want to feel very confident that this is a very meaningful package, with such large numbers of people now no longer having a nil assessment and having a minimum assessment. Please do not accuse me of duplicity on this-I want to make it very clear that I support the recommendation; I did in the committee, I do now-but I think it is the lack of balance in other measures that is going to leave you very vulnerable. If you are looking at the package as a whole, please do not say that this package errs on the side of the paying parent. It certainly does not. In fact, I think it is the other way around. I have always been concerned about the fact that this is a scheme about ordinary citizens, ordinary PAYE citizens; that, in fact, it is not a universal scheme. Why is that so? Because it is basically based on the test of what is taxable income. We all know that professionals, small businesses and people with family trusts have a legitimate way of minimising their income. There are 1.9 million taxpayers-perhaps there are later figures; I would be very grateful for those-who can legally minimise their incomes. Under this scheme, a worker or a battler in my electorate on PAYE taxation is not going to be able to evade or minimise it. But a small businessman-if he has a family trust like most of the cabinet-or a professional can legally avoid his responsibilities. Normally, you would say, 'So what!' but this highlights the fact that there is a whole raft of people, predominantly women and children, who are getting nothing out of the scheme. They know that their former partner has assets-which may have been legally transferred-and income that he is living off. But their former partner is paying minimal' child support. This proposal picks up the issue of negatively geared property. I am not against that. We asked the registrar, Michael Carmody, to look at this situation and to do a study. This was one of our recommendations and I understand that the study has been done. I thank him for that. It is disappointing that there is nothing in here. Why haven't we published the study? Why haven't we had a statement about what the outcomes and the conclusions are? We are agreeing about the ramps involved in the taxation system. The government has said nothing about how it is being abused in relation to Australian children. We recommended draconian measures in the report, and I apologise for harking back to it. Some people have been critical that we did this but it was done with a sense of trying to compel voluntary compliance-that is that group of people that I was talking about. We gave the registrar sufficient powers so that he could deem income and property not to be transferred. This was pretty draconian stuff; this is still not being picked up. If you have a system like the child support scheme where some people can avoid their responsibilities legally and get away with it but others are, if you like, trapped or compelled into it, it undermines the whole credibility of the scheme. I only have a couple minutes and I want to go through more of the changes. I agree that it is the first right of the registrar to alter an assessment, to fix up mistakes. I support his ability to vary an assessment on the belief of understatement. Wednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITIEE 2313 I reiterate the point that I started with. We are now running out of steam with these recommendations for those people who have been seeking to refine and improve the child support scheme. Society moves on. I never thought it would take so long. Certainly, I do not believe that you can set things into cement with a scheme like this. After this bill goes through, we will have to forget whatever was recommended in terms of formula changes. It is a tired old argument and I think we are getting to the point where we need a fresh approach. Last, but not least, I want to make the point again that the member for Wills( Mr Kelvin Thomson) made: you cannot fix child support without looking at family law. You will make no headway with domestic violence if you do not look at child support and family law. We must try not to bite these off as separate packages, but to have them a basis for moving forward. More than anything else, avoiding courts and tribunals, and what have you, is a solution, not to cover up something, but on the basis of being able to be in there doing preventative things at the earliest possible-ime-(Time expired) member for Chifley( Mr Price). He was far more genuine and gracious in his comments near the end and I would encourage him to continue to take a fairly positive and productive outlook in this very difficult area. I have to take exception with almost all he said before he became gracious near the end of his speech. It is a bit hard to hear the opposition members arguing about the lack of reasoning and modelling, and the like, making consideration of these things very difficult. At least you have got what is before us to be considered. We would love to see what your amendments say. We have not seen those at all. Let us have a little bit of consistency in all of this. . The other thing that needs to be commented upon is the effort of the member for Chifley at having a go at the government about the lack of pace with which it has implemented the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. I need not remind him that he was singularly unsuccessful in persuading his own colleagues about the virtue of many of these changes. I know that has been difficult and I would certainlywas singularly unsuccessful in having a lot of these amendments and suggestions implemented. They are complicated, and we empathise with the difficulties that you faced-without putting too much of a fine point on it. We understand many of those. I am pleased to have been able to make a contribution to the child support subcommittee that the coalition government formed to bring forward a number of proposals. As has been said repeatedly, and particularly for the members opposite, a good number of us view these as instalments. I certainly do not think that this is the last word on the subject. There are many unresolved issues and a lot of work in progress, but this is, nonetheless, a constructive and positive step forward and we could all have a discussion about how big that step is. I certainly welcome these proposed changes to the child support arrangements, based on a very simple and central recognition that both parents are responsible for supporting their children. I have had the good fortune of becoming a father in recent times and I think that helps to sharpen one's appreciation of the simple fact that both parents have a very considerable responsibility for the child-and I will talk about those issues as I go through my contribution.",264,Representatives Main Committee

451,Mr Billson,"That is right, and I take the interjection that he does acknowledge that he2314 MAIN COMMfITEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 There is no area in the federal government's responsibility that generates as much contact with my office. We see frustrated, angry and disenchanted people, both payers and payees. Even parents, cousins, nieces, nephews, brothers, sisters-and everybody else-come to talk to us about this particular area. People on both sides of the issues, if you could put it that way, come forward with concerns. I must say though that I do not see the satisfied people. I do not know precisely what it is that makes those people satisfied, but there seems to be a good number of them who feel that the child support system is ably assisting them to fulfil their responsibilities to the child; and, as the other parent also has responsibilities, the system seems to work for them. So there is some good in the Child Support Agency arrangements because they appear to have a number of,satisfied customers who, for whatever reason, do not beat a path to my door. I think that people genuinely want to make a reasonable contribution to the raising of their children from earlier relationships as long as they feel that it is fair. I think that some of the discussion we will be having today, and certainly some of the issues contained in this package of measures, seek to make sure that people do appreciate that there is a genuine effort at fairness. That effort at fairness and an effort to have the system more responsive to the individual circumstances of the parents are things that we should encourage and welcome. The changes aim to make the child support system fairer to ensure more regular financial support for the children. They recognise that the government should not intrude where the arrangements are working and-here is another common ground I think we share with the member for Chifley-if we can avoid having a government agency involved, that is an admirable objective. These changes go some way toward supporting that. The introduction next July of a minimum assessment for child support payments of $5 per week sends a much needed and warranted signal that both parents have the primary responsibility for the care of their children. Let us think about what the options are. If the parents are not providing for the children, we all are: the taxpayer provides. I have great affection for a great number of taxpayers in my electorate of Dunkley, but in terms of their family arrangements, I cannot take any responsibility for that. So, it is entirely appropriate that we do all we can to make sure that those parents who brought these little people into the world understand clearly that they have a responsibility to those children and that it is not satisfactory to simply abdicate that responsibility and pass it on to the taxpayer. The minimum payment will be welcomed and will not cause low income parents to lose access to family payment income support. The income that is excluded from calculations of child support for paying parents to support themselves is to be increased by 10 per cent to just under $10,000 for single payers and $16,500 for payers caring for other children. The amount of income the parent receiving child support can earn before payments reduce will drop in July from about $37,500 to $29,600. To ensure fairness, the rate at which child support payments reduce at a payee's level of income above this disregard level will halve, and a reassessment will be available where child-care costs are too high. Paying parents with second families claiming family payment and child-care assistance will be allowed to deduct half of any child support payments paid from the household income figure used to assess eligibility for these benefits. This has been a major gripe for parents who enter into new relationships after separation or divorce. Allowing this concession will help take away some of the concerns of child support parents. Wednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2315 I welcome the government's encouragement of divorced and separated parents to make private arrangements to transfer child support payments, as 40 per cent of child support agency clients already do quite successfully. The government also wants to ensure maximum privacy for Child Support Agency clients by introducing proposals such as dropping the names and dates of birth from assessment notices. There is a host of other administrative changes which I believe will simplify the arrangements, provide for much needed review mechanisms, improve privacy, and make the scheme more friendly to people's needs. As I said earlier, this is not the end of it. There is more work in progress. I would like to pick up on some of the comments the member for Chifley made. I believe very strongly that there is a need to strengthen the appreciation of the interplay between the Family Court and the Child Support Agency. That is tentatively done in this bill where the Child Support Agency registrar can suspend payment where there is a question still to be resolved before the Family Court. But that is just the start of it; we need to go a whole lot further. Section 79(4)(g) of the Family Law Act 1975 requires the courts to take account of child support payments when determining property settlements. But what we are looking for is an equally strong statement that the reverse should apply as well, where the Child Support Agency needs to take a fuller account of what the Family Court has been doing with its decisions and its judgments. Payments that clearly benefit the child's upbringing, such as mortgage payments, vehicle payments, paying off credit cards and the like, which are done by the parent without the primary care responsibility, are often viewed as choices. by the Child Support Agency. That is, the agency tells these people that, notwithstanding the fact that those payments are important, that they benefit the child, because they are not prescribed in the arrangements that we are working under, they represent a choice. Therefore, they are not taken into account when determining what level of child support liability needs to be met. I would have thought that the Child Support Agency would be and should be encouraging these sorts of contributions. I will give you an example, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have a number of constituents in my electorate who through their feeling about the way their relationship dissolved and their deep love for their child have said, 'Stay in the family home. I will keep paying the mortgage payments'. Why do they say this? They do that because the child can stay in a familiar environment. They can still be amongst their friends, they can go to the same schools, and they can basically have their life auninterrupted as they possibly can, notwithstanding the difficulty that surrounds a marriage dissolution. Having made all those decisions and having made all of those, I think, worthwhile contributions to the raising of the child, the Child Support Agency said, 'No, that's a choice. You've made a choice to make those payments. On top of those payments, on top of those substantial contributions to the child's well-being and development, we want you to pay Child Support Agency payments.' I have had one case where one of my constituents has been left with not much more than about $40 a week in their pocket. That is a very difficult assignment to deal with. I am hopeful that the measures in here that are more accommodating of fonnula departure claims and reviews will be helpful. This is certainly an area that needs to be looked at. That leads me to the next point dealing with the packaging of property settlement and Child Support Agency decisions at the time a relationship is dissolved. 2316 MAIN COMMITIEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 If we are going to the Family Court, and the Family Court to its credit has financial counsellors who try to work with both parties to come up with a property settlement that is responsive to their circumstances and the like, why can't we include the Child Support Agency in that discussion so that people know the full deal that they are signing up to? As it stands, these property settlements are negotiated often in isolation from the Child Support Agency formulas and responsibilities. So you get through that fairly difficult time and feel that you have come out with an arrangement that everybody can live with, only to find that there is another layer of assessment, another layer of contribution being expected of you from the Child Support Agency. I have been to the Family Court a few times, out of curiosity and concern about what had been said to me by constituents; I thought it sounded funny so I decided that I would go and spend some time in the Family Court to see how things actually go. I have asked the Fa:nily Court why the child support arrangements were not included. The Family Court officer said that they worked to fulfil their obligations under the Family Law Act. That is fair enough. But, in terms of the client, in terms of the families involved, it is not enough. It might be legally quite accurate and quite responsible but it ignores such a large percentage of the picture. I went to the Child Support Agency and said, 'What can we do about this? Can we encourage the Family Court to take a more holistic view?' They said, 'We've provided the software. They've got all the material they need to model these things but they just don't do it.' Surely we can get these things together. It is the same people that are involved, the same circumstances that are being considered but, above all, it is the same child or children, and it is their longer-term care and development needs that are at the heart of this whole issue. The packaging question goes further. I know of a client of the Child Support Agency who has had to pay back money because of the Child Support Agency's interpretation of an incoherent order from the Family Court. No-one could make any sense of it. Everyone thought they knew what it meant but, when it was considered by the Child Support Agency, this constituent in the electorate of Dunkley had to pay back thousands of dollars because someone in the CSA had a different view of a Family Court order that no-one could follow in the first place. Surely, working closer together is the answer. Parenting arrangements, property settlement and child support, in my view, are three legs of the same stool: all need to function together in the interests of the child. As I was saying, as a recent parent, Steven Biddulph's book is compulsory reading. Biddulph keeps saying that each parent has an important role at varying ages of the child's life and right throughout the child's development. Fine. However, if you are denied that opportunity as a parent, unreasonably, then one of the legs of the stool is compromised. I believe there is then a case to have a look at the other legs of the stool. Where there are consistent contraventions of parenting orders, without cause, perhaps we could look at the child support financial liability being discounted. Maybe the reverse should apply: if you are ignoring your financial responsibilities, perhaps the leg of the stool that says you have certain entitlements to access and contribute to your child's development and personal life should be wound back in some respects. I am not on about forfeiting rights for people needlessly but somewhere along the line, if people are not fulfilling their responsibilities, some forfeiture should take place that reminds them that they are part of a three-legged contribution in the raising of the child. I am certainly not advocating state sanctioned impoverishment but in my view the development of new tools Wednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2317 is essential to ensure that there is improved accountability of the parents and the fulfilment of all their obligations to the child. The Australian Law Reform Commission in report No. 73 titled 'For the sake of the kids' said that enforcement of orders, of contact orders in particular, is basically a criminal procedure. I raised this issue with a Family Court justice, whose name I will not mention, and the indignant reaction I got from that person was, 'What do you want me to do-lock the parents up?' No. I do not. I am saying that we need to provide new tools. Just giving me an answer like that does not solve the problem. It does not go away. The proposition I am hopeful we can consider more-certain1y through government channels because we have got more work to do on this-is to look at new tools to make sure that those accountabilities are fulfilled. The accountability issues go further, though. For the payees, there has been some concern raised in a very few cases about the way the funding that is provided is applied. The last thing I want to see is the Child Support Agency or the government policing parental roles, but where there is evidence of child support payments being consistently applied to purposes other than the raising of the child, whether it be gambling, alcohol or substance abuse, whatever the case may be, surely there is an argument to enable the payer to make direct payments, maybe not with the agreement of the other parent, for costs that go to the very heart of the care of the child. You could discount those payments and have that reflected in the child support liability. Surely that is a productive and constructive way of making sure that the child's interests are paramount in these arrangements. There are also the payers themselves.· I concur with some of the views of the member for Chifley about how easy it is to minimise your income. We are trying to do something about that through tax reform and the like so all are paying their fair share of taxes. But where you have got an income based formula and you have got opportunities for people to artificially lower that income, the kids miss out again. Perhaps having a look at the actual means testing arrangements used for the Austudy youth allowance might be one way of determining a more realistic level of income. I am just putting that forward as a suggestion. I am encouraged again that in this package, the registrar has powers to vary assessments where they feel that the information they are getting just simply is not right. But the accountability goes further; it goes to the Child Support Agency as well. Through my inquiries and a considerable amount of time put into this subject, it is clear to me that you can forum shop in the Child Support Agency. The discretions that are available within the Child Support Agency are exercised differently at different locations throughout the country. This is unsatisfactory and I would support the introduction of statements of principles or something like that that apply across the board in the Child Support Agency so that when these new discretions-and even the old discretions-are being used at least they are consistent. At least you will know that there will be consistent treatment of those issues before the Child Support Agency. But again, in this package, the strengthening of internal review options should help in some direction in a case by case basis. Finally, Mr Deputy Speaker, I want to talk about what I call the 'stuff it' option. That option is where people just say, 'This is all too much. I'm off.' The kids miss out; everyone misses out. That option is too attractive to too many people in my view. I think if we looked at ways of considering the means available to both parents, then we would get a bit more of that 2318 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 fairness view in there that would make this 'stuff it' option less attractive. If we had some way of encouraging payers to earn extra income in the interests not only of the child to a degree, but also to themselves and then make sure, if they are taking on second and third jobs, they actually get some benefit from it, then that again reduces the attractiveness of the 'stuff it' option. I also think there is an argument that the proposition contained in this package which allows people to take 50 per cent of their child support payments off their income for the purposes of calculating family payment and child care assistance eligibility for a second family should be extended more widely. I have people coming into my office who are making their child support payments which if deducted from their income would make them eligible for rent as-istance, would make them eligible for concession cards and would make them eligible for a whole range of things. What is happening is they are denied those arrangements which are supposed to maintain a base standard of living purely because they are paying the Child Support Agency. It is very hard to explain to somebody who hardly has money to rub together to pay their rent that their circumstances are not warranting rent assistance when someone whose disposable income is far greater can qualify for it. I am saying perhaps the child support payments should come out of that disposable income calculation for the purposes of looking at those areas. In closing, I was troubled a little bit by many of the things the member for Wills( Mr Kelvin Thomson) was saying, opening his contribution by saying we should not make these things political and then proceeding to talk for 15 minutes at a political level. It gives you an idea of where my frustration comes from. This issue about a gender war troubles me greatly. This is my little guy in this photo. At the end of the day, this is what this is about. I will not table this photo because you will all be very envious of him. But this is about the little people. There is an argument that says this is all about the gender war. It is not for me. This is a war for the kids. We are all here for the kids, in my view. Questioning proportions of residential care given to males and females and then arguing-as the member for Wills did-that that somehow points to an error in the system, ignores the fact that at certain stages in kids' lives they need each parent in a different way. Right now, I cannot provide for that child's needs as well as my wife can. When that child becomes a young man and is learning to deal with his maleness, my wife cannot provide what I can provide at that time. Kids need both of us. We need the system to support that. (Time expired) for Dunkley( Mr Billson), is quite right: at the end of the day, this is about the little people. That is exactly the problem because this legislation was compiled by intellectual pygmies. The legislation is a disaster. If people get up in. this place and say they support the legislation, it is a complete cop-out. Nobody, in my view, should be able to avoid paying for the upkeep of their children. In my experience, the great bulk of people want to contribute to the upkeep of their children. But what this Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998 does is divide families and it makes the wives and children of second families second-class citizens in Australia. One of the great joys of being an independent is that the Labor Party and the Liberal Party have immediately conspired to keep me off committees, which for the most part are a waste of time; a way of keeping backbenchers occupied.

452,Mr Campbell (Kalgoorlie) (12.10 P.m.),":-The preVious speaker, the honourable memberWednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2319 like to have been on because I think I could have made a contribution. This is a social evil in Australia. It is causing chaos particularly in my electorate and throughout Australia. You see here-and I think the member for Chifley( Mr Price) made this comment-that you cannot consider this legislation without looking at family law in total. What is the reason for family law? The Family Law Court is the fastest growing, most corrupt court in Australia and it should be swept away if we are going to do anything constructive. It should be returned to the states to start with. It should be in the district court with appeals to the Supreme Court. There is a case that the Child Support Agency could still function. I have heard people here say the Child Support Agency has its hands tied. It cannot take factors into consideration-for instance, if people put their assets in trust. That is not true. The Family Court has the power to assume an income-up to $97,000 a year, I believe it is-and they use this quite wantonly in cases. I see this day by day in my electorate. The other day I had a 53-year-old man whose crime was to work all the overtime he could because he thought it was to the benefit of his family. He came home one day to find the family gone. His wife had never said to him, 'I' d rather have you home; this is no life.' He was making money because he thought that they would be able to retire to the city. Now he is reduced to riding a bicycle in Tom Price at 53 years of age. What justice is that? We see in this child support allowance-and they say it to me all the time-'My hands are bound.' It is not true. There is a lot of discretion there and they do not use it. In relation to zone allowances and people working in remote areas, often the custodial parent goes to remote areas because he can earn more money. Zone allowances are to take account of the high costs in those areas, yet we tax them. We say, 'This is part of your income.' We say, 'Second jobs.' Arnan is struggling. He has an income that was his income when he was married. He goes out and gets a second job because he is married again or living in another relationship, and we make that part of his income. Overtime is part of the income. There is simply no way forward for him. Mr Tony Smith-He will never get ahead. had people in my electorate simply take that too hard option and retire. They will go from $75,000 a year as a train driver on Hamersley Iron to the dole in Adelaide because they are better off on the dole. That is what the effect of this legislation is. It is a mess. It is a mess because, right from the start, it was introduced by people not with goodwill but a vehement hate of males. Mrs Gash-Oh, come on! explanation: it could be just stupidity. It could be that, and I am prepared to concede that. There is one group of women who do suffer as custodial parents: in my view and in my experience, this group is business women. I have a case that I am very involved with at the moment, where a woman brought all the money and all the assets to the marriage. She ended up with all the kids and the husband ended up with all the assets. Nine years later, she is being pursued for perjury in the Family Court, when she has nothing and he has all the assets. What a nonsense, using public money for this! In the Family Court, everybody lies.

I am drawing that to your attention: we must be a little careful when we are referring to the Family Court or any other court. land. The judges are not beyond criticism, nor should they be. For them to hide behind that standing order is, in my view, long out of date. Let us take another example of the anomaly. A custodial parent can be earning $37,424 per year without contributing lc to the upkeep of the child. That is far more than the non-custodial parent is left with. He will be left with-as the honourable member for Dunkley( Mr Billson) said-$40 per week. We are going to reduce that in this bill-big deal!-to $29,598 to take account of child-care arrangements. It was always in there to take account of child-care arrangements. It was always within its scope to take account of that, but it never was. If the parent has got child-care responsibilities, back it goes now to $37,424. Of course, it may not be known to some of the honourable members and it may not be known to the Family Court, but there are two people who are responsible for the procreation of children. As a custodial parent, the mother has to accept some responsibility. I think it is absurd to give that very large exemption there. But is this addressed in this act? No; these amendments go simply nowhere. I can tell members that there is nothing, rio other single issue, that generates as much angst and animosity in my electorate as this single one does. It constitutes a very large proportion of my office business. But are you addressing it? No, you are not addressing it. This bill goes nowhere. If we had a tribunal situation to which we could actually refer people, without going to that confounded Family Court, we could keep the lawyers out of it and we might have a better chance. It is at least worth a try. But the fact is the Family Court is growing and growing. To what purpose?

Why can't we have a situation where people are encouraged in a tribunal format to discuss these things equitably between themselves? It does not happen. What happens, though, is that the court can come down very hard on the custodial parent and there is no room to move, no room to manoeuvre at all. The law is the law. It is the embodiment of everything that is excellent, as the honourable member would know. But when it comes to the custodial parent, they can ignore orders of the court with absolute impunity, and they do. They can up and move interstate, imposing an enormous additional cost on the non-custodial parent, and nothing is done about it. Judges will say, as the previous speaker said, 'What do you want me to do, gaol them?' If necessary, yes. Why should only one side be subject to the law?

469,Mr Campbell,"I am happy to do that. It is quite clear. I am surprised the honourable2322 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 having any say. In some cases, as I know from my experience of cases that come before my office, the money is often spent to keep the new boyfriend; it is spent on clothes. It is not spent on the children. It is nonsense to suggest that a three-year-old child needs the same income as a 15-year-old child. There should be a way in which this money can be postponed. It would give, in that case, the non-custodial parent the chance in life. The greater income then comes when the child needs that income. Or at least there should be a mandatory requirement to put some of it away for those later costs that are going to be incurred. What happens inevitably is that, when those costs arise, the non-custodial parent is once again hit to meet those costs-and many of those do, if they can, because they have a regard for their children. These things will not be addressed in this act, and they are certainly not addressed by the Family Court. I know that, when people go before this court, statements are made by the custodial parent. There is some view that custodial parents are somehow pure, and no attempt is made to check statements made by them. It is just not done. It is considered not right, apparently. So they lie and they get away with it, and then the good judge tells me that there is no perjury in his courts. What a nonsense. I believe that this act, basically, goes nowhere. I am sure the committee laboured mightily but they brought forward, at the very best, a very small egg, and it is a dud one at that. I believe that we have to go to a situation where we have some tribunal arrangement, something very similar to the French model. We ought to be keeping those lawyers at bay as much as we possibly can, and we ought to be taking a much broader look at this whole thing. I can tell you now that this is not a male/female issue; it is the second wives, of second marriages, and the children of second marriages that we, in this parliament, are turning into second-class citizens. There is no justice in that. Of course there is no justice. BeforeI was so rudely interrupted, I was going to make the point: why do we have to provide protection to judges in the Family Court? We do not provide it elsewhere. We have to provide protection to judges in the Family Court because the people know there is no justice-that is why. I believe that this act goes a very small way, a negligible distance. I suppose we should be grateful for crumbs. But what we really need is a complete revamp, a complete overhaul, and a sweeping away of the Family Court and returning it to courts where justice can be seen to be done. to take part in today's debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bi111998, which will provide greater equality in the treatment of this very emotive and often difficult matter. As it is an emotional issue, there has been a lot of angst on behalf of both custodial and noncustodial parents in my electorate of Gilmore, and it has been apparent for a long time that changes had to be made. Some of these have been addressed by this government, as the previous Labor government thought it was all too hard. Bear that in mind. I can give members of the Main Committee a quick example of why the current legislation is not working. However, I am sure they all have plenty of their own cases where parents, and in particular children, are facing unnecessary extra financial and emotional burdens because of the unworkable nature of the current system. In Gilmore we have a number of non-custodial parents. It is a fact that they are mostly fathers, though this should not become an issue of gender because that serves only to cloud further a very muddy debate. But there are many noncustodial parents who are struggling to support two families under the current system.",275,Representatives Main Committee
470,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (12.25 P.m.),"As a member of the child support subcommittee I riseWednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2323 We have grown men who have been forced to return home to the support of their parents in order to be able to continue to meet child support payments. We have non-custodial parents who are better off on welfare because they cannot meet the obligations set down by the Child Support Agency. In one particular case in Gilmore there is a gentleman who has had to resort to living in a tent in order to continue paying for the upkeep of his children, who live with their mother, even though he never sees them and rarely has other contact. By the same token, the need for strong child support laws and their enforcement is undeniable. I have cases of custodial parents who cannot afford to clothe their children, while the non-custodial parent is living comfortably but refuses to pay their share in the raising of their children, which is still a joint responsibility of parents. And we have nori-custodial parents who, far from being forced to apply for income support, do so in order to avoid paying their share of child support for their children. It is a system which lays as much guilt on children as it does on each parent. Having gone through it myself, I can honestly say that no party is ever free from blame in the fallout from divorce. However, there are some things which can be done to make it easier for children and for their parents to fulfil their obligations and responsibilities to each other and their former families. By introducing changes to the child support scheme this government has made steps, albeit small steps, in the right direction. For example, removing the obligation of the Child Support Agency to become involved has been a vital issue. There are cases in my electorate of Gilmore, as there would be throughout Australia, where the parents have come to a mutually agreeable arrangement on the issue of child support, yet the agency has determined a different figure and demands to be involved. This demand had the support of the original legislation and it came with an ultimatum from the Department of Social Security that unless the Child Support Agency's agreement was met, the custodial parent would lose their income support. Where is the logic in that? Removing the Child Support Agency from all agreements, unless they are required to become involved, is a major step in ensuring the best outcome for both parents and, subsequently but more importantly, for the children. However the Child Support Agency should not be made out to be the big bad ogre in all of this, for the support I and my staff have received from agency officers has been tremendous. We have come to an arrangement whereby, every month, agency staff travel from their base in Wollongong to my electorate office in Nowra to hold private interviews with parents who have concerns over child support agreements. The feedback I am getting so far has been very positive. We have managed to resolve most cases just by arranging face-to-face meetings between parties and the agency. These interviews will continue for as long as necessary, even following the positive changes introduced by this government. While the House is well aware of the changes which we introduced, I would like to quickly refer to the specific reforms which have made the most difference to the lives of many people in my Gilmore electorate. The change to the family payment income test for payers with second families will increase assistance for non-custodial parents with second families. This measure sees non-custodial parents with second families able to claim 50 per cent of any child support they pay as a deduction from the household income which is used for determining the family's entitlement to family payment and child-care assistance. This measure is fair to all 2324 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 parties as it ensures that custodial parents do not lose access to financial support for their children and non-custodial parents receive extra support for their second families. Another measure was to introduce a minimum child support liability measure for all players, including those on income support at $260 per year or $5 per week, which, in the past legislation, was not introduced. This will fulfil the recommendation-of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues which looked into child support-that there should be minimum payment and the principle that some contribution towards the cost of raising a child is an obligation of all parents, even those who do not have the day-to-day demands of the child as part of their routines and their budgets. One of the major reforms introduced by this government is one which I, as a former representative of the New South Wales Domestic Violence Advisory Council, totally support and that is to ensure consistency in the treatment of family violence cases. Before1 January this year, there was no mechanism to assist parents at risk of family violence to commence or continue collecting child support from their violent spouse. Imagine for a moment that you are at risk from a violent partner. Imagine the pain, humiliation and fear which is part of your everyday family life. When you finally gather the courage to make the move away from this intolerable and unacceptable position, you find yourself in the further untenable, unenviable situation of having to face your-partner for funding for the upkeep of your children. This is a totally humiliating experience, to say the least, and it is certainly one which many custodial parents choose not to go through and, therefore, they are left without the financial support for the upkeep of their children which is their right under the law. Now they have the support of the agency case managers to go through such demanding obstacles and they can continue with their lives with as few financial difficulties as possible. That is a move which has been a long time coming and one which I certainly applaud. However, as I stated at the outset, these changes are just three of the 18 introduced by this government and they are just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what is required for greater support and equality in the child support scheme for all parents and their children. I am constantly reminded by letters and phone calls from constituents of Gilmore that the changes have not yet gone far enough. The fact that this government has recognised the need for change and done something about it is always commended by my residents who are affected by child support or who know of someone who is, whether it be their son who they are continuing to support as he faces financial difficulties or their daughter who cannot find enough money to feed and clothe herself and her children. But-and there is always a 'but' at the end of their sentences-more needs to be done. This is something that we have recognised, with further reforms being debated in the subcommittee on child support. We have presented submissions to the relevant ministers, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman) and the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp), outlining details of what must be done, and yes, they are listening. These changes include the need to reassess the amount of child support which is paid by a non-custodial parent to their former partner. At present, the means test for such arrangements is unfair and there are a number of proposals for reforming this issue, particularly in relation to overtime pay and changes in income following the time after the marriage is dissolved. Why is it that non-custodial parents who spend their time doing overtime to better provide for their second families must be forced to pay some of that money to the first family, when it was not something that they had access to at the time of their marriage? Who pays when Wednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2325 the child is with the non-custodial parent for a length of time? This alone often causes financial strain and when added to the cost of the visit-sometimes to another state and over which noncustodial parents have no control-the burden is and can be enormous. This is one of the major 'buts' which my constituents bring to me and it is one which needs to be addressed. There is scope for addressing it in the next round of reforms which this government will introduce. The changes which came into effect on 1 January were the second stage of a three-stage process which has been evolving over the two years that we have been in government. Understandably, in such an emotive issue, there must be a balance to achieve a fair outcome for all parties. To do so requires wide consultation with comm.unity groups and representative organisations, as well as with the agency itself, to determine the most appropriate changes to make and the most effective ways of implementing them. I welcome the chance to provide input to this debate from the people of Gilmore, and I will continue to work with the child support subcommittee for a fairer outcome for all parents and, more importantly, for their children. . to enter this debate on the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998. It is a very difficult time in the lives of so many people when they and their children are unfortunate enough to experience separation or divorce. No-one would argue with the fact that the child support scheme, as it stands, desperately needs overhauling. It is an unfair and inadequate system of assessing and collecting support for children whose parents are separated and/or divorced. The children of the nation ought to be the responsibility of all citizens, but primarily they are the responsibility of both parents. When, through no fault on the part of the children, the parents' relationship breaks down, the children should not be made the pawns. In an ideal world, both parents should continue to support the children financially, emotionally and in providing role models, but in most cases separation and divorce is not an amicable arrangement. The usual arrangement, depending on the age of the child or on the ages of the children, is that one parent is given custody, with the other being given access. However, in too many instances the custodial parent uses child support as a bargaining tool. We need to establish a fair and just procedure for collecting child support that is based on the needs of the child or children and on the capacity of both parents to pay. It seems so simple, but in reality it is far from that. The matter of child support affects so many of our citizens and causes much anger, angst, heartache and suffering. Something like 40 per cent of marriages in this nation end up in divorce, many involving children. A number of constituents have come to me for help with a wide range of personal examples that point to the inadequacies of the child support scheme. There is no doubt that some custodial parents understate their income. Creative accounting for some self-employed persons can vary the income received, albeit legally, by conceding the income in several ways, not the least of which is by family trusts. On the other hand, there are many examples of a custodial parent denying access to the other parent whether or not child support is paid in that instance. Contributions should be assessed on net income, not on gross income, and overtime should not come into the equation. Another area of concern raised by a constituent recently is losses from investment properties that should be considered in the assessment of child support liability. If the non-custodial",276,Representatives Main Committee
471,Mr Zammit (Lowe) (12.35 P.m.),"Mr Deputy Speaker, thank you for the opportunity2326 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 April 1998 parent were to realise a capital gain from selling the same property, the agency would include profits realised in the assessment. It is grossly unfair. Other aspects which require addressing include the question of the formula, which I believe is too rigid. Individual assessments should be carried out which look at the needs of the child and the capacity of parents to pay. There needs to be a link between maintenance and support payments and access. If the custodial parent denies access for no valid reason, that parent should have to show cause as to why the child support maintenance payment should not be terminated. We owe it to the thousands who are affected by child support to provide real change which removes the biases and offers genuine and long-lasting solutions which are fair and just. I hasten to add that I am not being critical of the agency which collects child support. They are doing the best they can with a complex and emotionally charged issue. However, there is no doubt that the agency can increase its vigilance and diligence in investigating individual cases. As is the case with other underresourced government departments, there is no doubt that the agency is overworked and understaffed. The system needs overhauling in order to give equity and fairness to the parties concerned and, primarily, to safeguard the welfare of the children. The way child support operates at the moment pushes people into finding ways and means of avoiding the payment. If the system is not fair and not seen to be fair, why bother working? It is not flexible enough, in my view, to accommodate changes which are occurring in many cases within a short period of time in the working life of the parties involved. Some of the people who have come to see me on the matter of child support are almost suicidal and in some cases they are undergoing psychiatric counselling because the system is stacked against them. How does all this impact on the children? Very negatively, I would suggest. The bill before the House underscores the fundamental principle that parents are primarily responsible for the financial support of their children, and the government, through these measures, would not intrude unnecessarily into people's lives. I support some of the changes which have been proposed to the child support scheme which will address some of the concerns expressed by my constituents, such as the inclusion of net rental property losses and exempt foreign income into taxable income for child support purposes. The exempt income amount will be increased by 10 per cent, recognising the cost of employment faced by payers. Payers with second families will now be able to claim 50 per cent of any child support paid as a deduction from the household income used for determining the family's entitlement to family payment and child-care assistance. The objectives of the scheme will be revised to recognise that both parents are responsible for the support of their children. Whilst many of these recommendations come into effect on 1 July 1998, regrettably some will have to wait until 1 July 1999. We must stop tinkering at the edges and provide real solutions by implementing the recommendations made by the joint select committee. The proposals need to take into account the level of disregard of the income for custodial parents, that is, the amount the custodial parent can earn before any reductions in the noncustodial parent's child support payments. The government is encouraging parents to escape from the clutches of the Child Support Agency and deal with child support matters themselves, Wednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2327 and that is a very important initiative. This is a very smart move, since estimates suggest that the money recovered by the agency is less than half the costs of administering the system. The review system needs overhauling, and the need for introducing a less costly system of appeals is absolutely vital. Not a great deal more can be said about this. This is only a start. It is a step in the right'direction and a lot more needs to be done. I would urge the government to move with haste in bringing these changes into effect so as to lessen the pain, suffering and anguish so many people feel at a particularly vulnerable period of their lives. conditional-support for the Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1998. I was here earlier when the member for Wills( Mr Kelvin Thomson) made a suggestion that the government was supporting the Labor Party's child support formula, et cetera, and he made this observation on the basis that we were only 'tinkering with the edges'. I suggest to you that the whole system is haemorrhaging. To suggest that we are fully supportive of it, quite frankly, is a nonsense. The problem, of course, is dollars and cents. It does cost a lot of money to deal with these issues and, unfortunately, given the position that we were left in, it is going to take some time to replenish the coffers to be able to give back to this the proper balance that is required. Having said that, the measures that are contained in this bill have been designed to introduce some flexibility into the child support scheme and reduce unnecessary bureaucratic intervention. As I said earlier, the measures certainly do not go far enough. They are just the first wave of reforms by this government-reforms that are becoming increasingly urgent, I might point out, as more families are drawn into the child support scheme at a tragically rapid rate. My support for these reforms, as I have stated at all levels of debate on this issue, is given on the condition that a second wave of reform will follow very close behind, bringing fairer and more workable solutions to the enormous inequities in the child support scheme that is currently operating. A level of the problems out there could be demonstrated recently with the 60 Minutes program on problems within the child support system. It was reported at that time that it was one of the largest volumes of mail that they have received for any program. It shows that there are a lot of people out there sharing these concerns. Since my election to the seat of Leichhardt in 1996, a significantly large and increasing number of constituent grievances received in my office have been associated with the child support scheme and the Child Support Agency. Problems relate to both the legislation governing child support and its administration. Grievances are received from both child support paying and child support receiving parents. What most constituents complain about is the manner in which the system is administered and the problems subsequently caused by the shortcomings of this administration. It is a fact that many child support paying parents are living from hand to mouth. For them, life is mere existence. The enormous problems and obstacles child support parents face need to be recognised. Recent statistics provided by the Child Support Agency reveal that there are 7,587 child support payers and 4,920 child support payees in my electorate of Leichhardt. So the child support scheme invades the everyday lives of many thousands of my constituents and their families. This bill will actively encourage parents to move away from the Child Support Agency into private collection agreements. This is designed to encourage parents to take greater",279,Representatives Main Committee
472,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt) (12.42 P.m.),"I rise today to offer my conditional-and I stress2328 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 1 Apri11998 responsibility for their child support arrangements. It will remove the bureaucracy from the lives of the payers, many of whom have contacted me and said they were completely disgusted that after many years of faithfully meeting their child support liability, they suddenly found their wages had been garnisheed and their tax refunds seized without any prior warning. I should point out that you cannot entirely blame the bureaucracy for this. It is a very emotional issue. The first piece of advice that I give to anybody who comes into my office with a problem relating to these issues is that if they really want to get a fair and equitable solution, no matter how much they dislike their ex-partner they should sit down and talk to them. I advise that because anything that they can agree on is going to be infinitely better than anything that is going to be dictated to them by bureaucrats and by those who really do not have a real understanding of the situation. Unfortunately, there are very few who are able to do that, and as a consequence it is almost like a war zone out there. For the first time ever there will be a minimum liability, an annual liability of $260 which has been applied to reinforce the principle that parents of the child have a primary duty to maintain that child and to share the costs of supporting that child. It will also be collected from recipients of social security benefits or pensions, and that is a great initiative. Irrespective of the amount of money, it is one way at least of acknowledging that there is some responsibility there, whatever the circumstance. Under this bill the exempt income applicable to child support payers will be increased by 10 per cent to $9,907 for single payers and to $16,525 for payers caring for other children, plus additional amounts for each child for payers with natural or adopted children in their care. This bill also introduces some flexibility by taking into account the paying parent's legal duty to maintain a stepchild. Payers with second families will now be able to claim 50 per cent of the child support payments as a deduction from household income used to determine eligibility for family payment and child-care assistance. Payers with second families have long been the poor relation of the child support scheme. Their child support liability often leaves them almost destitute and forces them to leave work to go on the dole because of the unfairness of the payments demanded of them. An example brought to my office related to a constituent who had accrued a debt of $30,000. He was making payments directly to his ex-wife but the Child Support Agency had no details of these payments and his ex-wife denied receiving payments for child support. The Child Support Agency immediately garnisheed his wage and presented him with a bill for arrears of child support backdated to the date of his settlement in the Family Court. There were a number of reviews, the last one resulting in the advice that the review officer was unable to form a clear view as to what had happened in the past years. Therefore, the review officer declined to make any decision and my constituent's debt still stands. He is remarried now and he is currently taking home one-third of his wages: one-third goes to child support payments, one-third to tax and one-third is left over to cover his daily expenses. As a result, his wife works 12 to 14 hours a day to help cover expenses. To add further stress to the situation, he has not seen his children for over two years. 'you would agree that this situation is far from conducive to a secure and happy marriage. There is no possibility of this couple considering having a family of their own at this stage as they simply cannot afford it. This bill will enable' child support assessments to be calculated using the most current taxable income available to each parent. Assessments are currently calculated according to a Wednesday, 1 April 1998 MAIN COMMITTEE 2329 formula which uses taxable income from two years prior. Re-assessment based on income can only be requested where income drops by 15 per cent from that used for the initial assessment. Concern is frequently expressed about the accuracy of this assessment process. Measures contained in this bill should allow more accurate and timely assessment of the capacity of parents to pay child support. This bill will introduce significant reform in the area of objection and appeal rights. A range of decisions, which are now only reviewable by the Family Court, will be subject to an internal review mechanism. It is hoped that this will improve perceptions of fairness, equity and the accountability of the Child Support Agency. Many instances are brought to my attention by paying parents where they have waited sometimes for months to have a review completed, then they receive notice that the review decision has gone against them. To add insult to injury, they then learn a decision can only be reviewed in the Family Court. This is often a last straw with limited access to legal aid and income already stretched to the limit with child support payments. They have no possibility of affording legal representation so they just accept the decision. It is just another body blow. When I rose today I stressed that my support for the bill was conditional on further urgent reform to the child support scheme. The enormous distress and frustration suffered by parents when the system fails to work for them, and creates other difficulties as a result, does nothing for the betterment of the children involved and ultimately does a great disservice to the community in general. The child support paying parent has little relief under the current scheme. The fact is that these parents, too, need to set up a home, rebuild and stabilise their lives. The government must address ongoing reforms in the following areas. Most of my constituents agree that some other type of formula is needed to arrive at a reasonable amount payable for child supportA division having been called in the House of RepresentativesCommittee for today.
