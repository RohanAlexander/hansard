I refer to an aged care facility in Cessnock known as Allandale. Allandale has traditionally been one of Cessnock’s major employers and a source of apprenticeships and all sorts of training in the electorate. It was established in 1962 and has operated as an aged care facility for most of that time. For all of that time it has been owned and operated by the New South Wales state government. The CEO of the Hunter Area Health Service, Professor Katherine McGrath, is determined that that should not be the case any longer and is determined to privatise Allandale. I do not take an ideological approach to privatisation. In fact, I think privatisation should always be considered on a case by case basis. If governments can make out a case for privatisation, so be it, particularly in circumstances where a huge injection of capital is required to keep the facility viable or competitive. Professor Katherine McGrath has not made out a case for privatising Allandale, and I am very concerned about the implications of privatisation for residents of the facility and their families. In particular, for those who work at the facility, I think employment numbers will decline significantly. I do not think there is anything in it for the Cessnock community. Professor Katherine McGrath says that the privatisation of Allandale is about enhancing the standard of care at Allandale and, indeed, attracting a greater amount of Commonwealth funding. As you would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the early nineties the Commonwealth agreed to take over all funding responsibilities for aged care because of concerns regarding inconsistencies in standards of care across the country. It was also agreed that the Commonwealth would not pay the capital component of bed funding for those homes that were operated by the state government. In other words, the New South Wales government has a lesser ability than a private provider to attract Commonwealth funds. Professor Katherine McGrath’s plan to privatise Allandale is no more than an exercise in shifting costs from the New South Wales government to the Commonwealth. It is about saving her budget $3.5 million each year. Professor McGrath says that if she can make savings of $3.5 million in relation to Allandale each year, that represents more money that she has available to put into acute care. I say that if Katherine McGrath has identified shortfalls in acute care funding she should take her case to the government and secure additional funding. She should not be seeking, at the expense of the local community, to embark upon a cost shifting exercise by privatising Allandale.

The conference was held at the Palazzo Montecittorio, in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate of the Republic. It was a conference of parliamentarians of Italian origin who had been elected to parliaments in foreign countries where Italian communities are based.

It was a wonderful privilege to be able to stand in the Italian parliament on the first day of the conference and speak on parliamentarians and globalisation and how we as nations can work together, particularly on economic, cultural and other issues, to ensure that a network and dialogue can be established that will help all parliaments where members of Italian origin are based. It is quite interesting that most of the migration occurred from the southern parts of Italy. A number of the delegates at the conference were from the southern parts of Italy, including the region where my family came from originally-Calabria and Sicily. They fled Italy in times of great economic turmoil and disadvantage. Now Italy is the fifth largest and one of the strongest economies in the world. The second day of the conference was also a very important highlight. I think the member for Bowman made a very good contribution about establishing a database that could be used by members of parliament from around the world for networking purposes and for helping each other in our very different aspects of life. I commend the member for Prospect for her great contribution on that day too. The conference left me with many glimpses of life overseas. It was a relatively short time, but it gave me a great understanding of what a wonderful country we are based in. When you hear the Colombian members of parliament speaking about the fear they have of passing legislation because the drug lords will kill them, you realise that we, as members of the Australian parliament, have wonderful privileges. We have democracy, we have freedom and we have the ability to speak about any subject without fearing for our lives. (Time expired) Canberra Electorate: Art Exhibition Ms ELLIS (Canberra) (9.46 a.m.)-One of the privileges of our jobs as federal members is to have the opportunity to be out in our electorates and to see the wonderful level of community that occurs within our own electorates. I had that experience again last Saturday when I was asked to open a particular art exhibition. The special part of this art exhibition was the participants. The art exhibition was called A Good Red and could in fact have been interpreted in many ways-maybe that we were showing paintings of bottles of red wine. That was not the case. The art exhibition was held at the Tuggeranong Community Arts Centre in the southern part of my electorate-one of the most well-used community facilities one could ever wish to visit. I take this opportunity to commend everyone concerned-Evol McLeod and her whole team at the Tuggeranong Community Arts Centre-for the wonderful and vibrant use that the centre is experiencing through members of the community. Let me get back to the art exhibition. Katherine Alexander is a local arts teacher who has made it her task to involve as many people in the community as possible in art. On Saturday there were 35 artists exhibiting over 70 works of art at the Tuggeranong Community Arts Centre. The uniqueness of it was that none of these 35 people believed that they were artists. This was the first time that any one of them had had a piece of their work hung in a public place. In many cases, the piece of work hung was the first thing they had ever done. These art classes have all been under the auspices of Katherine Alexander and two of our local colleges that have assisted her in running these art classes. The thrill for me was to see the 200 or 300 people there all connected in some way with these 35 artists and the joy they got out of seeing the achievement these 35 people had reached by actually going to an art class, learning something about expressing themselves, actually exposing themselves by putting their efforts into a piece of art and then being convinced that they should display it publicly for other people to see.

As federal members of the parliament, we sometimes need to reground ourselves by going to a function like this and actually connecting with the efforts that individuals put into their own development within our community. I say to Katherine Alexander and to every one of those 35 artists-I believe they are artists; these people are very good; I could not draw a circle if you paid me-that they deserve encouragement and congratulations. I also congratulate the Tuggeranong Community Arts Centre for putting on the display. Australian Labor Party: Queensland Administration) (9.49 a.m.)-We have been mesmerised, shocked, horrified, maybe even transfixed, as has the Australian community, by the continuing revelations of institutionalised electoral corruption, false enrolment and voter fraud being disclosed through the proceedings of the Shepherdson inquiry in Queensland. All of us believe that this is appalling, that it is entirely out of order and that it contributes to the sense of disillusionment with the political process felt by many in the Australian community. All of us read the Courier-Mail assiduously each day, and I want to refer to an article in ‘The bottom line’ edited by Brian Williams on 28 November. Under the headline ‘Probe goes on’ it says: We hear yet another federal politician is being investigated whose electorate is far removed from the Gold Coast address on their driver’s licence. We do not know who was actually being referred to in ‘The bottom line’ article but I am led to believe that, for some time, the member for Dickson has owned residential property on the Gold Coast, which is more than an hour and a half’s drive from her electorate. With this latest allegation and the payments by the member for Lilley, allegedly to purchase Democrat preferences, at a time when the member for Dickson was the Leader of the Democrats, I am sure that there are a few questions that need to be asked of, and answered by, the honourable member for Dickson. I must say I was also interested to hear that the campaign was launched for the member for Springwood, Grant Musgrove MLA, who yesterday admitted to witnessing four false enrolment forms, by the honourable member for Dickson. So the member for Dickson launched Grant Musgrove’s campaign for the seat of Springwood, which he won by a very small margin, and no doubt the member for Springwood has admitted that he has been a party to voter fraud and to false enrolment. The member for Dickson really ought to explain whether she was aware at the time she launched that campaign that the member for Springwood was indeed participating in such nefarious activities. Premier Beattie is the one constant throughout all this. He has been the state secretary, a backbencher, a minister, the Labor leader and now he is the Premier of Queensland, yet he is the one who is professing that he knows nothing. The Premier of Queensland is either dishonest or he is stupid. The simple fact of the matter is that he is the constant, he knows what is happening and he ought to come clean.

476,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance andThursday, 30 November 2000 MAIN COMMITTEE 23203 enjoyed my 12 months of getting to know the Cassey family much better. Heather, Ray, Joanne, Stuart and Jack have been kind in letting me into their family circle and in helping me develop a better understanding of the difficulties that they face. Stuart, who has an acquired brain injury, has many challenges that he needs to face for the rest of his life. Yesterday, Stuart celebrated his 17th birthday. An average young Australian male would be celebrating getting ready to leave school, getting his driver’s licence and perhaps going on to university. Sadly, these are not the exciting adventures that Stuart is looking forward to. He will be going back to Corpus Christie College next year, but he is going to need the ongoing support of his family and the community for the rest of his life. One of the groups that has offered support to the Cassey family and others is a group called Teen Spirit. Stuart’s mum, Heather, has played a key role in the development of this group. Their major goal is to provide school holiday activities for children with disabilities, because these kids cannot go to the movies by themselves or take on activities without supervision. The group has been fundraising and seeking ways of making sure that their kids have good school holidays the way the rest of the community does. In the previous 12 months they have had success in getting some funding, but unfortunately it soon runs out. It is one of the issues that we need to have a good look at to make sure that groups like Teen Spirit, which have a really important role-they do good work-get the support they need. One of the successes of groups like Teen Spirit is letting children with disabilities not only make friendships outside the schools or the areas they attend but also develop friendships with children who do not have a disability. You see all the children forming friendships, and children who do not have a disability develop a greater understanding and sympathy for the problems that these young people are experiencing. I congratulate Heather for the great work she has done and wish Stuart a happy 17th birthday-one day late. I am sure that all members will enjoy this program. (Time expired) McPherson Electorate: Paralympics inspiring sporting events ever staged-the 11th Paralympic Games. As a parliamentarian for the Paralympics, I was proud to support this pinnacle event and witness the way in which the human spirit is able to triumph over physical adversity in an awe-inspiring spectacle. I have also taken an interest in the Paralympic Games on a more personal level in my electorate. I have already spoken in this place of the Gold Coast’s local swimming champion Shane Walsh and the challenges he overcame to make it to the Paralympic Games. I am proud to be able to report that Shane Walsh delivered the goods for his community and his country. Shane was a member of the Australian men’s 4 x 100 metres relay team that scooped silver at the games. He was also placed fifth in the 50-metres freestyle and seventh in the 100-metres freestyle. I met up with Shane shortly after he returned from the games and naturally he is thrilled at his medal win. Although Shane deserves every ounce of credit for the countless hours he spent training at the Bond University pool, he is the first to admit that no-one can achieve such a feat alone. So, on behalf of Shane Walsh and myself, I would like to put on the parliamentary record our immense gratitude and respect for the residents, businesses and community organisations that believed in Shane’s dream and helped him achieve it. The first donor to come on board to help out our home-grown hero was local developer Nifsan Gold Seal Homes. I would particularly like to thank the general manager, Ian McLean, and the quality control manager, Ken Philips, for donating the price of an airfare to Sydney so that Shane was able to have a loved one there to support him.

Motion (by Mrs May) proposed: That the House do now adjourn. Christmas those two words mean? Christmas is the single most celebrated and happy feast day of all the Christian churches. Whether Catholic, Protestant or Orthodox, all Christian faiths recognise the ultimate significance and joy that is in the very word ‘Christmas’. The origin of the date of 25 December is unknown, but it is by tradition attributed to an adaptation of the old pagan Festival of Light. Some think of Christmas as presents, Christmas trees, Santa Claus, mistletoe, yule logs, wassail bowls and a roast turkey dinner on Christmas Day. The use of a Christmas tree is of relatively recent origin-first appearing in Strasbourg, France, in the 17th century. The celebration of the coming of Santa Claus is actually a tradition introduced by Dutch settlers in the United States who knew him as Sinterklaas, although his feast day is actually 6 December. St Nicholas was born in Patara around AD 280 in Asia Minor and became Bishop of Myra, now Demre, in Turkey. He attended the first council of Nicea in 325 AD. These traditions are all diversions from the ultimate purpose of Christmas and why it is celebrated. For the two billion Christians around the world, Christmas is about the birth of Jesus Christ. It is timely to recite the relevant truths contained in just one of the four gospels that corroborate the testimony that is the very basis of the feast day of Christmas. I cite the gospel of St Luke, chapter 2, verses 8 to 13, which describes the account of that momentous event of the birth of Jesus Christ. It says: And in that region (of Bethlehem) there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were filled with fear. And the angel said to them, “Be not afraid; for behold, I bring you tidings of a great joy which will come to all the people; for to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign for you; you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger”.

Bible historian Jules Lebreton notes in his text The Life and Teaching of Jesus Christ that, using certain milestone dates such as the death of Herod, being 4 BC, the baptism of John, the date of the enrolment by Quirinius, the Governor of Syria, et cetera, we can estimate the most likely actual birthday of Jesus Christ to be 12 March, 4 BC. But the feast day of Christmas transcends mere empirical analysis. Contemporary society seeks to reduce the celebration to an eclectic festivity of consumerism, encroachment and hijacking by other festivals and events, and an outright denial of the truth that is Christmas-the celebration of Jesus Christ, Saviour of the World. The truth in the gospels is a testimony of Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God. It is solely for this reason that Christmas is Christmas. The gospels are not chronologies; they are oral traditions put to writing long after the events they describe. They lack factual details. Some seek to discard them for this very reason. Subsequent documents in history attempt to destroy the very meaning and existence not only of Christmas but of the pre-eminent position of Christ himself. If there is a reason why the testimony is to be believed, then it is to be found in the humility of the scene. This is not the story of a great king performing fantastic deeds and miraculous works. What the nativity of Jesus is about, as Bible historian Jules Lebreton further notes in his text: We do not find, in the (Gospel) pages, those puerile and fantastic fantasies that show that the imagination has been at work ... From his birth on, we find the same surroundings of poverty and humility-a hired stable, a handful of straw, swaddling clothes ... It is not this kind of magnificence that would have been imagined by the mind of a man. In concluding this reflection on Christmas, I can find no other words that best describe the true meaning of Christmas than those of the great theologian Saint Augustine in his famous Sermon on the nativity: Hear what you already know; reflect upon what you have heard; love what you believe; proclaim what you love.

484,Been Sent By Mail To Mr Mcclelland.,"Australian Capital Territory 02 00 Northern Territory 02 04 (2) In urban areas, data is obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics to calculate the total number of weddings likely to occur in the area each year and the number likely to be performed by civil marriage celebrants. The crude rate of marriages per 1000 head of population is 6.0 overall in Australia but this varies from 4.6 in the NT to 6.4 in NSW and Queensland. In 1999, community based civil marriage celebrants performed 43.6% of all marriages in Australia though the percentage varied from 41.4% in Victoria to 51.8% in Tasmania. Where possible, this data is compared with the actual number of weddings reported by existing celebrants in the area. The workload guide for a civil marriage celebrant living in an urban area is 100 weddings per year if the celebrant has other employment and 200 weddings if the celebrant has no other employment. In rural areas, celebrant workload is less relevant for assessing need than it is in urban areas because total demand is usually low. Factors considered in deciding if more celebrants are required in a rural area include the need to provide communities with access to a choice of celebrants, the need to provide back-up for existing celebrants, distance to an alternative celebrant, difficulties travelling because of terrain and whether the people living in the area see themselves as a distinct community. (3) (a) There are 60 authorised civil marriage celebrants currently classified as authorised primarily to meet special needs of groups within the community. (4) There are 1676 authorised civil marriage celebrants. Formal courses for celebrants have only recently become available in Australia and so far there have been 17 graduates but of these only 5 are civil marriage celebrants. (5) My Department received 10 complaints against civil marriage celebrants in the year 1999 – 2000. (6) My Department seeks to take a mediatory approach when it receives complaints. I am advised that in all cases the celebrants were formally invited to respond in writing to the complaints. In eight cases the celebrant either gave satisfactory responses or made reasonable efforts to rectify the cause of the complaint. Two cases have not yet been finalised. (7) Civil marriage celebrant associations are not formally recognised by the Government. There are currently 14 celebrant associations. The executive members of these associations reported the approximate membership figures listed below.

(8) The current review of the civil marriage celebrant program is the most extensive and thorough review undertaken since the Marriage Act 1961 (the Act) came into force. It has involved a careful examination of every aspect of the civil marriage celebrant program including the continued relevance of parts of the Act and a survey of the views of all stakeholders. There are a number of problems with the present system. First, as a general rule, no new celebrants can be appointed where statistics reveal that there are sufficient numbers of existing celebrants. This is particularly the case in metropolitan areas where a large number of celebrants reside. Second, while celebrants are appointed on the basis of regional need, there is no requirement for those celebrants to remain in those regions. Celebrants occasionally change their residence resulting in a skewing of areas of need. Finally, there is a large degree of discrepancy in the standard of celebrants’ services. A large number of celebrants was appointed by the Labor Government rapidly in 1994 and early 1995, when limited standards were applied to applications. Currently, the only statutory requirement is that a celebrant be a “fit and proper” person to perform the role. The review is addressing all these issues and is expected to be finalised in 2001. Goods and Services Tax: Prime Minister’s Portfolio (Question No. 1763) Mr Hatton asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 14 August 2000: (1) Is the Minister’s Department and agencies within the Minister’s portfolio compliant in respect of the Goods and Services Tax. (2) What action did the Minister’s Department and agencies within the Minister’s portfolio take to ensure that they were GST ready by 1 July 2000. (3) Is the Minister able to guarantee that no agency within the Minister’s portfolio will suffer negative impacts on its budget or services due to the GST; if not, or if the guarantee was subsequently proved incorrect, would the Minister be prepared to resign. I am advised by my department and portfolio agencies as follows: (1) In June 2000, the chief executives of all agencies within my portfolio were asked to provide me, or the relevant Ministers Assisting, with written confirmation that they would be able to comply with The New Tax System from 1 July 2000. Such assurances were received from each agency. (2) The following action was undertaken by my department and portfolio agencies to ensure GST compliance by 1 July 2000: Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has successfully managed the introduction of the GST. The following tasks were undertaken: established GST project team, project manager and sponsor responsible for managing the GST implementation; developed project plan;",107,Capital City Elsewhere
487,Mr Howard,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:obtained the Department’s Australian Business Number (ABN) and registered for the GST; adopted Department of Finance and Administration (DOFA) GST project implementation strategies and met audit requirements; reviewed the effect of the removal of Wholesale Sales Tax; provided GST information sessions for staff and circulated information to management and relevant staff explaining the effect of GST; reviewed all contracts that spanned the commencement date; analysed system requirements; implemented GST into Financial Management Information System (FMIS); reviewed reporting requirements to meet accounting and government requirements; and trained relevant staff in new business processes. Australian National Audit Office The Australian National Audit Office (ANAO) has successfully managed the introduction of the GST. In summary, the work undertaken has included: the registration of the ANAO for its ABN and GST; a review of all critical business transactions including contracts and audit engagement letters; the upgrade of financial information systems to be GST compliant; the completion of an internal price review in accordance with agency pricing guidelines and Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) guidelines and the development of appropriate contingency arrangements; analysing the effect of the GST and the removal of Wholesale Sales Tax on the cash flow of the ANAO; and updating the financial reporting within the ANAO to comply with Urgent Issues Group (UIG) Abstract 31 – Accounting for the Goods and Services Tax. Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman In June 2000 the agency’s external auditors completed a review of the agency’s ability to comply with the GST legislation. The review concluded that all reasonable steps had been taken to enable the agency to accurately record GST related transactions and prepare Business Activity Statements in a timely manner. Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor General Actions taken by the Office of the Official Secretary to the Governor General were in keeping with the project implementation strategy recommended by the DOFA against which the Office reported its progress on a regular basis for whole-of-government reporting on GST readiness. Areas of specific focus were: financial system development and testing; development of administrative procedures; supplier awareness; and staff training. Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security The Office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (OIGIS) has successfully managed the introduction of the GST. The following tasks were undertaken: attended GST seminars hosted by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) and the DOFA; liaised with The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (PM&C), its portfolio department, to ensure all procedures were followed; arranged for inclusion on Finance1 system that is managed by PM&C; applied for and received an ABN; and registered for GST and installed necessary software. Office of National Assessments The Office of National Assessments (ONA) has successfully managed the introduction of the GST. The following tasks were undertaken: established GST project team, project manager and sponsor responsible for managing the GST implementation; developed project plan; obtained ONA’s ABN and registered for the GST; addressed mandatory GST implementation questionnaires for DOFA; circulation of information to management and relevant staff explaining the effect of GST; reviewed all contracts that spanned the commencement date; analysed system requirements; implemented GST into ONA’s FMIS; and trained relevant staff in new business processes. Public Service and Merit Protection Commission The Public Service and Merit Protection Commission (PSMPC) undertook a rigorous implementation process, to ensure it was GST ready by 1 July 2000. This included: registering for an ABN and the GST; re-configuration of the Commission’s finance system to manage financial and reporting requirements; analysing the effect of the GST on the Commission’s cash flow; implementing a revised pricing policy to comply with Government pricing policy; and raising staff awareness and amending internal policies and procedures to comply with GST requirements. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) has undertaken a number of major initiatives to ensure a successful transition to the New Tax System for the Commission, Indigenous organisations, businesses and clients. To ensure that the change process was properly managed ATSIC: established a Taxation Reform Implementation Unit; established a Taxation Reform Steering Committee and Reference Group; and engaged a professional consultancy firm to provide assistance and to complete an ATSIC taxation reform implementation plan. The major tasks completed and oversighted by the Taxation Reform Steering Committee and consultancy firm were: all necessary amendments to the Commission’s business practices and financial systems; the provision of training for staff; and development of an ATSIC Tax Manual, tax help desk facility and a dedicated ATSIC tax reform intranet site. A quality assurance review of tax reform conducted by DOFA concluded that ATSIC had satisfactorily implemented all aspects of the New Tax System. clients have the same access to information and assistance offered to the wider community, including the delivery of 92 tax seminars to commission employees. Other major initiatives undertaken were the publication and distribution to potential 2000 –2001 grant recipients of: a Tax Reform Action Plan; a Wall Chart; GST Notes for Remote Community Development Employment Program (CDEP); and GST Notes for Non-Remote CDEPs. In April and May 2000, ATSIC wrote to all potential 2000 –2001 grant recipients reminding them of their obligations under the New Tax System and providing copies of: GST & Business Skills an Action Guide; interactive CD: The GST & Business Skills; and video: The GST & your business, GET STARTED TODAY – an Action Guide, Helping Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people prepare for the introduction of the GST. ATSIC continues to work with the ACCC, GST Start-Up Assistance Office and ATO to ensure that ongoing taxation assistance and support is available to indigenous organisations, businesses and clients. (3) The implementation and ongoing management of tax reform by agencies is the responsibility of their respective Chief Executive Officer or boards of management (as applicable). While the Government will continue to monitor the impact of the implementation of The New Tax System, the reforms are not expected to reduce the level of funding for agencies in this portfolio in real terms. ComSuper: Superannuation Entitlements (Question No. 1978) October 2000: (1) Did ComSuper in the 1970s and 1980s (a) formulate guidelines for Departments to enable them to fully inform resignees of their superannuation entitlements, (b) train personnel staff in agent Departments to ensure consistent application of the guidelines and (c) regularly monitor Departments to ensure adherence to the guidelines; if so, can documentation be provided to prove that it did so. (2) What percentage of resignees eligible to defer did so between (a) 1977 and 1987 when for S2A was in issue, (b) 1988 and 1992 when there was some awareness of the deferred benefits option and (c) 1993 to 2000. (3) Is the percentage referred to in part (2)(a) low compared to the percentage in part (2)(c); if so, is he able to say why. (4) Was Form S2A redesigned; if so, (a) why and (b) was in considered inadequate. (1)(a) Yes. On the introduction of the preservation rights under the Superannuation Act 1922 (the Act) instructions were issued on 27 May 1971 to all Departments and Approved Authorities. These instructions formed the basis of the guidelines for preservation. The Superannuation Manual for personnel areas was updated in January 1972 to reflect the changes to the Act. As a result of the introduction of a new scheme on 1 July 1976 ComSuper provided Departments and authorities with information regarding the administration of the Superannuation Scheme through instructions contained in a Superannuation Manual and in Superannuation circulars. (b) Yes. General information about the courses conducted is contained in the Commissioner for Superannuation annual reports.",108,Capital City Elsewhere

The form was also redesigned to accommodate input data required following the introduction of an automated superannuation benefits payments system. Waterfront: Robot Operated Container Staddle Carriers (Question No. 2091) Mr Murphy asked the Minister for Employment Workplace Relations and Small Business, upon notice, on 30 October 2000: (1) In the lead up to, and during, the waterfront dispute of 1998, is he able to say whether a driverless robot-operated container straddle carrier was being developed by Patricks with the specific purpose of disposing of a significant fraction of the waterside work force. (2) Was prototype machine being tested with a dummy driver’s cabin installed to mislead the workforce at the Patricks dock where the prototype was being trialed. (3) Did a previous model of this machine that had been built in the United Kingdom have serious problems with its control system that led to the machine running out of control and driving around in circles. (4) What would be the possible workplace consequences of a driverless robot-operated straddle carrier loaded with a 24 tonne container running out of control. (5) Is he also able to say whether Patricks, in negotiations with the Maritime Union of Australia in 1998, denied an intention to introduce a driverless straddle carrier; if so, what is stated in the Workplace Relations Act in relations to actions of this kind. (1) to (5) These questions traverse matters which are at issue in proceedings currently in the Federal Court of Australia. In addition, they seek answers to questions about the business of a private company that should be directed to that company and not the government. For both reasons, it would not be appropriate to answer those questions. Botany Bay Foreshores: Restorative Work (Question No. 2092) October 2000: (1) Has his attention been drawn to negotiations involving the Sydney Airport Corporation Limited, the Rockdale City Council, the NSW Department of Land and Water Conservation and the Sydney Ports Corporation with a view to reaching an agreement to fund restorative work in and around the foreshores of Botany Bay as a result of wave action due, in part, to changed wave patterns following the construction of the third runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. (2) Is the Sydney Airport Corporation not prepared to finalise an agreement in respect to the provision of such funding unless and until it receives a release from any further potential liability. (3) Will he examine the matters which are the subject of the negotiation with a view to the removal of any conditions that are impeding a resolution of the matter. (1) I am aware of the negotiations as a result of the honourable Member’s questions and subsequent advice from my department and Sydney Airports Corporation Limited. (2) Sydney Airports Corporation has advised that these matters are the subject of ongoing negotiation with the parties concerned. I am advised that there are a number of matters to be resolved before an agreement can be finalised. (3) No. This is a commercial matter for Sydney Airports Corporation who have an independent Board of directors overseeing its operations. It is not appropriate for me as shareholder to intervene in a specific business matter of this nature. Relationship Counselling: Funding (Question No. 2105) Ms Livermore asked the Minister representing the Minister for Family and Community Services, upon notice, on 1 November 2000: (1) What is the basis for the funding of approved non-government organisations involved in delivering family and relationship counselling under the provisions of the Family Law Act. (2) To what extent is the present allocation of funding based on (a) historical factors, (b) a funding formula or standardised performance-based criteria and (c) decisions made on the basis of services put out to tender.

493,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the following(1) The basis for the funding of approved non-government organisations involved in delivering family and relationship counselling is outlined in Part II, Sections 13A and 13H of the Family Law Act. (2) (a) There are 41 counselling organisations that have been funded on an historical basis. (b) In recent years needs based planning models have been developed for the Family Relationships Services Program to identify areas of need. This involves an estimation of the demand for service, consideration of the current levels of service delivery and mapping of related family, income, legal and support agencies. (c) When funds are available for a specific purpose in the Family Relationships Services Program they are provided through a tender process, in which organisations must meet certain criteria and program approval requirements. Advertising for new services is conducted in areas of high need. (3) Current contracts with organisations finish in 2002. Over the next 6 months the Department of Family and Community Services will review current arrangements in relation to funding mechanisms, and give organisations a year’s notice about proposed new arrangements. (4) An evaluation of marriage and relationship counselling services was conducted in 1996. However, the whole basis of the FRSP was examined in the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry into aspects of family services “To Have& to Hold” published in June 1998. FamNet (Question No. 2121) Services, upon notice, on 2 November 2000: (1) What is the purpose of the FamNet database. (2) When did the Government establish FamNet. (3) From which sources and how is data collected for FamNet. (4) Have there been any difficulties reported with respect to the operation of FamNet; if so, what are those difficulties. (5) Is the Minister or her Department taking any steps to improve the operation of FamNet; if so, (a) what are those steps and (b) how long will it take to complete that process. (6) How are the figures for ‘average cost of intervention’ and ‘average cost of session’ for family and relationship counselling services calculated and what data has her Department relied upon in calculating those figures. (7) Has the quality of that data been affected by difficulties with FamNet. (8) Will the Minister review those figures by means other than through data which is part of the FamNet system in order to more accurately calculate the figures referred to in part (6). following answer to the honourable member’s question: (1) The FAMnet database holds information about the operation of the Family Relationships Services Program (FRSP). It is intended to allow the Department of Family and Community Services and all the organisations that are funded to deliver services under the FRSP to share information about the program and monitor its performance. (2) FAMnet was approved for development in June 1996, when the FRSP was the responsibility of the Attorney-General’s Department. It underwent extensive consultation with the family relationships sector during its development. After a pilot conducted with 10 organisations in mid-1998, FAMnet was fully implemented from July 1999. (3) Most of the data in FAMnet comes directly from organisations funded by the FRSP. The data is collected by organisations and entered into FAMnet using the Internet.",113,Atsic Has Electronically Lodged The July 2000 Business Activity Statement Bas With The Ato Atsic Has Also Undertaken A Vital Role In Ensuring That Indigenous Organisations Businesses And

495,Mr Anthony,"The Minister for Family and Community Services has provided the(4) Some difficulties have been reported with the operation of FAMnet. The principal difficulties have been that data entry has been slow and it has been difficult to obtain some reports from the system. (5) (a) Action has already been taken to improve the performance of FAMnet. In July this year, the database was moved to an improved computer environment. Provider organisations reported experiencing a much-improved response time and faster data entry as a result. The Department is also developing updated data entry and reporting mechanisms to improve both performance and the functionality of the system. (b) The updated data entry and the reporting mechanisms are to be piloted in December 2000, with full implementation early in 2001. (6) Figures for the average cost per session and per customer by service delivery type will be calculated using data derived primarily from FAMnet. (7) The data in FAMnet appears sound and not to have been affected seriously by the above difficulties. However, testing of quality continues. (8) Yes, where a calculation of this sort is required. Monash University: Physics Faculty (Question No. 2123) Mr Danby asked the Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, upon notice, on 2 November 2000: (1) In the week preceeding the week of ""Science meets Parliament"" was the Monash University Physics Faculty closed. (2) How does the closure of the Monash University Physics Faculty accord with the Government’s commitment to science and higher education. (1) The Monash University Physics Faculty did not close but was merged with the Department of Materials Engineering to form the new School of Physics Materials Science and Engineering. (2) As indicated above, the Monash University Physics Faculty did not close. The Government has taken a number of initiatives to promote science in higher education. A notable example is the Science Lectureships Initiative. This programme provides funding of $25 million over the period 2000-2002 for 28 projects, a number of which involve the promotion of science through creating stronger links between university programs and schools. Macedonia: Embassy in Australia (Question No. 2124) Mr Jenkins asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 2 November 2000: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 2000 (Hansard, 4 September 1997, page 7972 attached below), does the Government plan to change the non-resident accreditation basis of diplomatic relations between Australia and Macedonia. (2) What are the preconditions for the establishment of a residential embassy by Macedonia in Australia. (3) Have the preconditions changed since his last answer. (4) What is the current status of Australia’s diplomatic representation to Macedonia. (1) The Australian Government has no plans at present to change the basis of its non-resident accreditation to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM).
