2,Mr Laird Smith,"There seems toaccommodation provided for t i e men on board ship, and that an improvement of that accommodation would tend to bring about an early settlement of tbe trouble. Will the Acting Prime Minister state whether that is so? intimated to me that he proposed to mate this inquiry, and I have since been examining the records. I find that on the last occasion that I met the representatives of the Federated Seamen's Union in conference, prior to their going back for the second time to the compulsory conference under the President of the Arbitration Oourt, the general secretary of the union, Mr Wklsh, as shown in the records of the conference, made this statement with regard to the accommodation for the men on board ship-> With regard to one of the most important matters, that dealing with accommodation, Admiral Clarkson has promised to seo that our wishes are carried out. He has gone so far as to ask me tor a list of all snips requiring alterations, and the extent of such alterations, and when he becomes possessed of full information on the subject he will see what can be done, so that we can look upon the accommodation question as practically settled. That statement was made by Mr Walsh, and t find that, later on in the conference, T saidI think you should narrow down the main issues, reducing them to four. 1 think that possibly, in view of the promise that Admiral Clarkson has given you, the accommodation question might be set aside. The general secretary, Mr Walsh, retion to laying on the table of the Library pliedWe realize that is practically settled. I therefore say to my honourable friend High Court by one of the fifth class that the seamen, and those speaking in officers interested in the matter, and I their behalf, do not put, up that issue as understand that the decision of the Court one for settlement at all, and that I rehas been overridden, so that the matter is gard it as being, in the language of the one of urgency.

We did not put it to the country, and we do not feel as if we should embody it in our propositions without a referendum to the people.

The subject caused a good deal of debate up to five or six years ago. Nothing was done in the matter, except debate, until 1908. Then came the Act.

77,Mr Jowett (Grampians) [3.5],"I nand, in compliance with, his request for sympathy and assistance, I have devoted very considerable time and attention to its study. I have the highest possible admiration for this work of literature and art, and I have no doubt that already it is wending its way to every capital city in every civilized country in the world, where, I feel sure, by all postal authorities, statisticians, philosoissued by the Postmaster-General, the phers, and statesmen it will be as much appreciated as it is in this House and by myself in particular. Representing, as I do, a country district, and coming into very close contact witb country residents, I naturally turn, in the first place, to see what statements of facts are given in the report in regard to country mails and telephones. speak in no terms of sarcasm when I refer to this report as a most valuable"" document. Personally, I have the greatest possible admiration for the the work the Postmaster-General has done in the Department during his years of office. I consider him the best Postmaster-General that Australia has ever had, though there may be those who differ from me in that regard. Postmaster-General the honourable member bas ever known. have known, and all I can say is that I never want to know another. I have carefully read nearly the whole of the eighty pages of the report in my search for information regarding what has been done in the past, and what is likely to be done in the future regarding country mails and telephones. I should here like to apply a little quotation which, poetical as it is, will appeal to the literary mind and instinct of my friend the Postmaster-General. member that Prince Henry, when he saw the bill that had been rendered to Palstaff, in which 5s. 8d. was charged for the excellent wine called sack, and one halfpenny for bread, exclaimedO, monstrous! but one half-penny worth of bread to this intolerable deal of sack! Sack, I understand, was a most excellent wine; indeed, it was regarded by some as the wine of life. In our country districts, however, the residents are not looking for the "" w in e"" which has made the postal buildings in the great cities so conspicuous, but for a very Uttle"" bread,"" in the shape of country mails and telephones, to enable them to live in comfort. What do we find? Out of 80 pages of most beautiful literature in the report only matter devoted to country mail services and post-offices covers eleven lines, including the following:It is asserted that money .is being saved by cutting down country mail services-suo h i6, however, not so. That is simply a question of assertion. In 1017-18 we spent £11,526 more on such services than in the previous year. It is true I that in some cases reductions resulted, due to abnormal increases and the difficulty of securing satisfactory tenders. As we are not told how much money was spent in tlie previous year, or whether in that year the expenditure was higher or lower than in the year before, the statement that £11,500 more was. spent on country mail services is of no value as a guide in the discussion of this matter. If money has not been saved by cutting down the only cpuntry mail services, why, in the name of heaven, have they been cut down ? That is the problem to which this House might expect the Postmaster-General to give some attention. waste. greater waste, which I ask the honourable gentleman, in common with the heads of all the other great public Departments, both Pederal and State, to stop; that is, the waste of population, and waste of human energy brought about by the continual dragging of people from country He will redistricts to the cities. partment do that? closes the honourable, member will have plenty of information on that point.

83,Mr Jowett,"Before this debateI have in. my possession some figures issued by Mr Knibbs, at the request of the honourable member foT Calare( Mr will find it necessary OT advisable, to leave Pigott), giving the population for the last ten years in each of the States, and showing the proportions living in the cities and suburbs, as compared with the numbers living outside the cities. Ten years ago the metropolitan population of Victoria was 573,255, as against 703,767, living outside the metropolis. The balance was about 130,000 in favour of people living in country districts. In 191S, the latest figures which Mr Knibbs was able to supply to my friend, the metropolitan population had increased to 723,500, while the number living in country districts was only 707,258, showing that there were 16,000 more people in Melbourne than in the country districts of Victoria. In South Australia, ten years ago, the metropolitan population was 1S4,393, as against 208,504 for country districts. In 1918, the metropolitan population had increased to 235,751, as against.209,957 for country districts. I do not lay upon the Postal administration the whole of the blame for this tendency to drag the people from country districts, but it is the duty of every man who desires to see his country great to endeavour to stop every ieak through which the population may drift from country districts into the great cities. There are many serious influences at work which bring about this result; but if there is one thing above all others which induces people who have a clioice in tlie matter to leave country districts and live in the cities, it is the feeling of discontent that men, and women even more so, have at the isolation of country life. A great deal of this feeling of isolation is due to the fact that people are unable to secure adequate telephone facilities, by means of which they can communicate on business or social matters with their friends at any time, and that they are unable to get regular and frequent mail services. Any step taken to cut down postal facilities to which people are accustomed has one result, and that is to make them discontented with country life. or later wives will persuade their husbands, or for some reason or another men the country and live in one of the cities. The absence of reasonable mail and telephone facilities in country districts is largely responsible for the drift of population towards our principalities. I do not wish to weary the House with figures, but I have shown what is the actual position in this respect in two of the most important States of the Commonwealth. Por some years, there has been evidence of a drift of population from the rural districts to our principal towns and cities, and that drift has increased considerably during the war period. The Postmaster-General asserts that no saving is effected by cutting down country mail services. If that is so, why are they reduced? The report published by the honourable gentleman is a magnificent production. It deals with the General Post Oflices in Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, and the other State capitals, and makes special reference to the provision of a diningroom for employees at the General Post Office in this city. All these parts of the report have my warm approval. One part of the report is headed "" Palse Economy,"" and I naturally expe-.ted to find under that heading some explanation of the action of the Department in cutting down country mail services. I have looked in vain, however, for any such explanation, and I propose to give the House a few instances of what -has been done by the Department in the way of reducing the postal and telephone facilities of the people. The honourable member for Calare( Mr Pigott) yesterday received a letter from a resident of Springfield, Mount McDonald, New South Wales, which he has handed to me, and from which I make the following quotations :I am enclosing herewith a notice received yesterday from the local .Postmaster, notifying the intended curtailment of office hours. You will note that it provides for only four hours each day, excepting Wednesday, and thc four hours so out up that one engaged in ordinary farming and grazing pursuits would have considerable difficulty in striking the post-office Sooner within the working hours. That complaint is general throughout the rural districts. Country telephone offices are nearly always closed at 8 p.m., and a l l day on Sundays, when they might be more generally used by farmers and others, and their valuo is therefore considerably reduced. Nothing is saved by closing these offices try post-office means to the people w it h in every evening and on Sundays. so that I think this practice on the munication with outside centres, it is the part of the Department might well come daily meeting place for all in the disunder the heading of ""false economy.""'

JONES, Hon. I think I have quoted sufficient grievances to satisfy honourable members that we must have a radical alteration in the administration of the Postal Department. Johnson) The honourable member's time has expired. This is a very belated attempt by the honourable member to draw attention to the difficulties experienced by people who are living in country districts in getting adequate postal facilities. These grievances have not arisen suddenly. The disabilities of country people in this respect throughout the war have been tremendous, but we have heard nothing from the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) during the last few years; he has been a docile and dumb supporter of the Government. I wonder to what extent the present ardour of the honourable gentleman is due to the fact that the Victorian farmers are beginning to assert themselves, as they should have done long ago. What the honourable member has said this I have been trying for some afternoon is in distinct contradiction of the resolution which he and his fellow members of the National Caucus unanimously carried, expressing hearty approval of the admirable manner in which the Government were administering the affairs of the country. gratulate ithe honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) on having brougbt this matter before the House.

It is high time that some of the trunk lines were completed. trunk line between Cowra and Blayney which is used also by the smaller centres. I have been delayed for two or three hours at Blayney until all the messages on the trunk line have gone through. If the Department would erect separate lines to deal with local business, a very desirable expedition would result. admire the Postmaster-General for doing his best to economize. Up to a certain point he has done very well, but he seems to think that the purpose of the Postal Department is to make big profits and pay them into the Treasury. If he can make his Department pay, he may rest satisfied; there is no need to make profits at the expense of the country people. I find that in the year ended 30th June, 1917, the Department was run at a net loss of £117,146. 1918 it showed a profit of £564,527. That profit wiped out the previous deficit of £117,000, and left a net profit for the two years of £387,381, after paying interest on capital. Analyzing the profit, I find that £168,896 was made by the postal branch, and £121,844 by the telephone branch. including the small country systems which are being curtailed, showed a profit of £77,276. employees in small country offices.' I know that often they have to do the telephone work in conjunction with their other duties. But if they are underpaid, increase their salaries out of the profit of £564,000. According to the Postmaster General's report, there are 7,144 allowance offices. If the Minister were to give to each officer in charge, of those establishments an average increase of £10 per annum it would mean an increase in expenditure of £71,440. more than covered by the profit made by the small local exchanges. I remind honMr Pigott. orable members that when the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Spence) was Postmaster-General, he informed the House that the Postal Department was being run at a loss of £500j000, the whole of which was incurred in the cities. In order to recover that loss, the present Postmaster-General( Mr There is a Webster) has increased the telephone charges in country districts. Having regard to the fact that the country offices were paying, any increase in charges should have taken place in the big centres in which the loss was being incurred. Por twenty-six. years I have lived in Blayney, a town in New South Wales, I with a population of about 2,000 persons, and I know the disabilities that country folk experience. These people are ""being charged increased rates in order to make the Postal Department pay. It does pay; the deficit has been wiped out. We do not desire that the Department shall be operated for the purpose of making big profits. Por a number of years provision has been made on the Estimates for improvements to be effected at certain country In post-offices. I know that the war interfered with the work, and for that reason we did not worry the Postmaster-General. At Cowra the post-office is so small that the officials are cramped, and in summertime are almost baked by the heat. An amount for the improvement of that office has been on the Estimates for years, and' Telephone exchanges, I urge the Government to proceed with that work. Many country offices are in the same condition, and I am determined I am not disposed to sweat to compel the Government to do something to relieve the postal and telephonic disabilities of country districts. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) is to be commended for having brought this matter before the House. The time of Parliament is not wasted in making a plea for greater consideration for the people resident in country districts. To some extent, the Postmaster-Gelneral( Mr Webster) has That would be done well in making the Postal Department self-supporting. I have always urged that every business Department of Government should be made self-support-",32,Adjournment Formal Country Postal And Telephone Facilities

In malny cases the postal delivery has been suspended. That has happened to a number of districts in my electorate. One .district had enjoyed a postal delivery at least thirty years, and although there has been no diminution in population, the Department suddenly discontinued the delivery. I do not think the Postmaster-General is justified in cutting off the facilities in the country in order to economize; in any case,, the actual economy resulting from the stoppage of the mail delivery is not very great. As the honourable member for Calare( Mr am sure that he only needs to be apPigott) has pointed out, the last report of the Department showed a good surplus of revenue over expenditure, and, therefore; it does not seem necessary to restrict postal facilities to the extent that the Minister has done. The Postmaster General might consider whether he is justified in cutting off the mail deliveries in districts that have enjoyed that convenience for upwards of twenty y.ears. If we were justified in having a delivery for all those years, there can be no reason for curtailing the facilities in that direction now. There has been a great difficulty during the war im obtaining the material for telephones, and probably there is great difficulty to-day; but the fact remains that the telephone services in country districts are not all that could be desired. Many things done by the Department in connection with telephones do not meet witb the approval of country residents. It has been pointed out by other speakers that diaring certain hours if is impossible to get the use of some telephones. ""We, as a Parliament, must realize that the people in country districts are remote from centres of population, and practically isolated. They are the pioneers of In rhe country, and everything should be done to give them every possible facility to bring them into closer touch with the larger centres of population. Nothing is more needed in country districts than Very many telephone connection, particularly in cases of sickness. Residents may have to send miles for a doctor, -and there may be a difficulty in getting the use of a telephone just when it is required. We should endeavour to make the telephones available at all times, so that in cases of sickness people can summon a doctor at once. If that is done, the doctor can often, with his car, be on the spot before a messenger would have reached him. I give the Postmaster-General credit for economizing, but this is_ one of those matters where he has, perhaps, overdone it, or gone a little further than he intended. He does 'not realize the difficulties under which country people are labouring in consequence of his policy of economy. Representing a country district as he does, I pealed to to look into this matter and see if anything can be done in justice to these people. Another question arising out of thc policy of economy is the treatment of the officials in the post-offices. Many postal officials have complained to rae of late years that they are overburdened with work and cannot stand the strain much longer. . I am assured that many men in the postal service .aire on the verge of a breakdown owing to their close application to their work. We do not want that sort of thing. We only want men to do what is fair. If we consider the legislation we have passed in this chamber during the last seven or eight years, we must realize the great amount of additional work that has been cast on the postal officials. The payments for old-age, invalid, and war pensions, and military pay -have -to be made by the postal officials, in addition to the work which they formerly did. It is evident, therefore, that a big extra burden has been placed on them. Whilst we ought to economize, and I give the Postmaster General credit for what he has done in that direction, do not let us go to the other extreme of practically sweating our employees. 1 wish also to bring und'er the notice of the Minister the position of those conducting semi-official post-offices. I doubt whether they get the remuneration, -to which they are entitled. A certain scale of payment was fixed for them, which may have been raised slightly lately, but in most cases the amount of remuneration always appeared to me inadequate for the work performed. In view of the increased cost of living, which means a good deal to these, people, something should be done to liberalize their allowances. They ought to have a fair increase of salary commensurate with the increase in the cost of living. It is not fair to expect our publie servants, who give their time in the public interest, to maintain their positions on the salaries which obtained when living was 30 or 40 per cent, cheaper than it is to-day. I urge, the Postmaster-General to take all these matters into consideration with a view to doing justice, as I know he will endeavour to do, to country residents and postal officials. am pleased to have the opportunity of speaking on this motion, although it came somewhat as a. surprise to me to find the business of the House taken oujfc of the hands of the Government by one who took such a keen delight in expressing his appreciation of the Government. However, the opportunity' is a good one to say several things that ought to be said. Watt) a little while ago whether, when the Budget was being considered, he would favourably consider the placing of a sum on the Estimates for the purpose of giving better facilities to the people in the country. I think that is the attitude we ought to take up. Apparently, fche policy of the Government is that the Postal Department must pay; but any one who takes an interest in Australia must realize that there is an obligation on this Parliament to provide facilities for the people who are pioneering the back country. In no other country in the world would Parliament neglect to grant those facilities; but, from the first day the present Postmaster General( Mr Webster) stepped into that office, so far as the back country in my electorate is concerned, we have had nothing but trouble. I cannot understand, I do not know whether to call it the assurance, or the audacity, or the senility, with which the Postmaster-General sent a circular letter to me telling me that Western Australia is a country with no complaints. true, because for the past four years I have been doing nothing else but bring complaints before the honourable member. I wish to show the House something of the honourable member's administration. It is the duty of the Government to try to ameliorate the conditions of the pioneers. I have instances of the way the Department has treated men who are 40, 50, or even 100 miles out in the bush. In one instance, the State spent £250,000 in constructing a railway, roads, and water supply to open up a new territory. It would have cost the Postmaster General £5,500 to give those people a telephone. He refused it. If an accident or sickness occurs, they have to send from 50 to 100 miles for a doctor. If a breakdown in, the machinery takes place, days must elapse before they can send to the city to obtain new parts. Wo have had trains running on that line once a day; but the Postmaster-General refused to have mails carried on it until the State offered to carry them for I asked the Treasurer ( Mr nothing. I received this telegram: Premier Western Australia agrees carry local mails to and from stations between Wongan Hills and Mullewa free for time being, pending preparation new agreement.

I have had letter after letter with regard to mail services. stance the people were told by circular letter that if they subscribed £S odd each per annum they would have a monthly mail service. In another little country district where there was a deficiency of £40 a year on their service, they were told that if they contributed £20 a year they could have the service continued. surplus!' plus, surely that sort of thing is not necessary. The honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) pointed out the trend of population to the big cities. It is inimical to the best interests of the country to have the people crowding into the cities. It is the wealth produced in the back country that keeps the cities going, and we all feel that some concession should be made to the man who goes out back; but he does not get it . All the consideration is for the man in the city. The position is quite different in regard, to places which get one or two mails a day. Surely the people I am speaking of should be allowed to have a fortnightly or monthly mail without all these obstacles being placed in their way. To show the desire of the Department to drag every little thing they can out of those who go into the bush, let me give the case of a man on a station about 60 miles south of Port Headland, and near the Port Headland-Marble Bar line. The Department have to carry the mails on that railway and pay the freight. This man had his private bag. There was no post-office near, and he would have to send in> every week meet the .train to get his mail. He, naturally and fairly, pays £1 Is. a year to have a private mail bag, but the Department charges him £3 3s. also for the freightage on his mail, although it carries the mail further along to the next place without any' extra charge. People in the cities get their mails without paying freight on them, but this man, who has to send 14 or 15 miles to pick up his bag. and return with it in time to catch the train on its return journey, not only pays £1 Is. a year for his bag, but is charged In one in£3 3s. extra for freightage. There have been many instances of th© same nature brought under my notice. taxation. unfair taxation. The Government subsidizes a mail-boat to carry mails around the coast, but immediately a man goes into the interior aud begins to produce some wealth, he is asked to pay a special tax. The l j d . stamp should carry a letter to any part of this country. If there is to be a distinct and determined policy on the part of the Government that the Postal Department shall pay, then it is the duty of this Parliament to insist that a. special vote be granted to the Minister for the purpose of providing for non-paying services. I have spoken to many honourable members on the Opposition side on the subject, and the great majority of them would strongly support a vote of that kind. When I discussed the matter with the Minister, he poohpoohed the idea. States in connection with railways. The honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) says that all these services should pay; but I do not agree with him. How can new country be opened up by means of a railway line if the line is expected to pay at once? In the early stages of a railway, where development is proceeding slowly, the line will not pay. What pays is the addition to the general wealth of the community.

Monaro) [ 4 . 5 ] to hear what the Postmaster-General( Mr Webster) has to say. I totally disagree w it h the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton) that the Post and Telegraph Department should be a paying concern. It is not intended to be a big business Department, but to extend the benefits of civilization to the people in the back-blocks. Peoplei n the cities complain df they do not get three deliveries a day, but every week of my life there are brought under my notice intimations from the Department that services in the country are to be cut down. Between Araluen and Moruya, for instance, there has been a daily service for the last fifty years, but now it is proposed to be cut down to three times a week; and this is not an isolated case, for my experience is that of every country member. foolish policy to wring money out of the people on the outposts of civilization in order to show a departmental surplus. inoney out of people where services do not) pa-yj and where money as lost ? can be wrung out of people by asking them to make contributions of £ 2 or £ 3 , or even as low as £ 1 , towards the cost of the services which otherwise are cut off. I have known the Department pull the telephone wires off posts because the people in the district would not contribute fey way of subsidy. It cannot be charged against the country workers for the Postal Department that they ask exorbitant pay for their services, because it is not unusual for some of them to even do the work for nothing, and many in charge of small offices work for eight or ten hours a week for a remuneration of £ 4 or £ 5 a year. <A man with a small station or farm, who has a telephone uses it mainly to K communicate with his agent in town regarding prices and so for t h , but even in such cases the time during which the telephone may be used has been curtailed, so that there is no communication when the man returns to his home after 5 or 6 o'clock in the evening. Under such circumstances it is no wonder that we have the people coming from the country into the towns, as shown by the figures quoted by the honourable member for Grampians I am waiting anxiously the Department, and I could not afford posts, I caused the wires to be attached to trees and fences, earning for that the title of the "" b u s h telephone""; and every means ought to be adopted to keep these people in the back-blocks in touch with their fellow creatures. Of course, I know that the Department is too big for any one man to manage every detail, but I do. blame the Postmaster-General for not seeing that all these matters are attended to by his officers. Then we have this stupid system of centralizing everything in Melbourne; indeed, if things go on as they are we shall be compelled to come to Melbourne to buy a stamp. Perhaps when we get to our legal home at Canberra we shall secure better administration, even in the matter of postal and telegraphic facilities. It is a ""legal""! can we wring not be in order, but I could prove that we, as a Parliament, are illegally in Melbourne to-day, and presently I may propose, in order to test the question, that we put in our attendance at Canberra. Perhaps the greatest shock that the report of the Postmaster-General gave me was in connection with the big surplus shown. As a matter of fact, there ought to be no surplus; if people pay for facilities the money ought to be used in improving the services, whioh I may say are not as good as they were ten years ago. so expended, the Department might be still self-supporting.",36,Adjournment Formal Country Postal And Telephone Facilities

It is not increased charges, but the volume of business, that earns the revenue. crease. proportion. Thet r u t h of what I am going to say can be found on reference to the case of Canada and other countries when the charge for postage was reduced. I know, of course, that under war conditions there has been difficulty in obtaining material, and I am pleased to congratulate the Postmaster-General on his efforts to meet the position. I responsible, however, for cutting down the services. If this sort of thing goes on, we shall find Australia in the position of some recently discovered country with no inhabitants beyond the fringe of the coast. Honourable members may laugh or sneer, but this ie a serious matter. We know that in the country districts the arrival of the mail is an event bringing, as it does, newspapers, and keeping up aconnexion with the great centres of population. The Postmaster-General is certainly responsible for the insane idea of building up a surplus by means of cutting down conveniences. , During the last five years the services have been reduced, and the charges increased materially, and the latest move is to abolish the lettergrams which were established, I believe, by Mr Agar Wynne, when he was Postmaster-General. system telegrams of forty words for one shilling can be sent during the slack hours of the night, and delivered with the letters next morning, and this is certainly a great convenience. It is the policy of the Department I complain of. I do not blame the Postmaster-Generalf or individual acts, but for not controlling the policy, which appears to me to be to cut down facilities at the expense of the country people especially. In past years, under good conditions, mail contractors' those employed do not get a living wage for carrying the mails. When chaff rose from £ 2 10s. to £ 1 0 a ton, and other fodder in proportion, it was pointed out that the men so employed were deserving of some consideration; but, although for months past I have been in communication with the But the expenses in Department on matters of the kind, nothing is done. It is absurd to tell men who are working for the Government at a loss, perhaps, of £ 2 or £ 3 a week, to look at the great surplus that has been heaped up. The Minister has to consider not so much the people in the cities, as those in isolated places, and where postal officials are very-poorly paid. Of such people he has had more experience, perhaps, than any man in the House, and, therefore, I appeal to him to treat them do hold the honourable member as they ought to be treated, for they aro the real backbone of the country. General) [4.15] I have no objection to raise to the course adopted by the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) in bringing this subject before the House. My life for the past four years has been practically devoted to a maximum of work and ai minimum of talk, so that I have had very little to say in the House on. postal matters. The speeches made to-day, when analyzed, are contradictory in themselves. Honourable members suggest additional facilities, and urge the carrying on of unprofitable services, and yet, at the same time, they desire the Department to be r u n on business lines. So far fro m the posiUnder this tion in postal matters being worse today than it was formerly, there are concessions that never were enjoyed before. In the days referred to by the hoaorable member for Eden-Monaro' ( Mr Austin Chapman), mail services had to pay, or were not granted, whereas to-day the Department bears 50 per cent, of any loss incurred. The same may be said of the telephone branch, and, in some cases, as much as 60 per cent, of tlie loss is borne by the Department. It w ill be seen that the statements made in this connection are not borne out by the services were cut actual facts.",37,Chapman Eden Mr Jowett When I Was I N Charge Of

118,Mr Webster (Gwydir,"PostmasterSome honourable members, as I have said, urge that the Department ought to be so administered as to pay, though the degree to which it should pay has not been indicated. If I were to follow the advice of some honourable members, it would be quite easy for the Department to slip into a deficit of £2,000,000 before we were hardly aware of the fact. It ought to be remembered that the bigger the concessions granted to sections of the people or less there is l e f t to do justice to others and the community generally. My the Department in such a way as to observe the Constitution of Australia; that is to say, I have tried to give uniform concessions to all sections of the people. The 'constituency of the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), who has spoken so emphatically . to-day, has received more concessions than have been received by all the other electorates in Western Australia. so? a fact, and, of course, the honourable member represents a big country electorate. The honourable member for Grampians said a good deal about depopulating country districts, and about the d r if t of people to metropolitan areas, but I greater tendency to bring about that result than the relaxation of the residential clauses in the land laws of the various States. It has permitted men to concentrate blocks, taken up by families, into large holdings, so that agricultural districts are again reverting into the old condition of affairs when the land was held by few individuals, returning little revenue to the Postal Department. Continual re-adjustments must take place in administering the Department. Mining centres, which used to be thriving townships, have vanished, and the mail services which they were given in their prosperous days have had to go also. No honourable member would contend that I should continue, for the benefit of a few' people and for the sake of getting a few shillings in revenue, a mail service which would have to be provided for a township. To do so would mean depriving other localities of equitable treatment. Wherever a large number of men have been employed at a forest saw-mill, postal facilities have been provided. But in time the forest is cut out, and the one or two people who remain as settlers on the cleared land cannot expect the same service as was provided for the saw-milling community. These two cases demonstrate to individuals, the how necessary it is to have constant readjustments. The man who is intrusted with the adpolicy has been to administer ministration of the Postal Department, and is prepared to respond -to every appeal made by honourable members regardless of what it may mean to the future of the Department or to the futur e of Australia, will become popular.

There is no other course open to a Postmaster-General, unless he is prepared to make "" ducks contend that nothing has had a and drakes "" of the policy of his Department. I wish to' put a question to those gentlemen who' are my critics, friendly, I admit. If the position that existed in the years 1913-14 and 1914-15, when there were deficits of over £500,000 each year, had gone on for the four years of war, can they imagine what reductions would have been necessary ? They would have paralyzed the whole of the facilities of the Department. Otherwise a tremendous increase in rates would have been necessary to meet the constantly growing deficit that formerly characterized the balance sheets of the Department. The situation was saved by exercising economy-no t by reducing country services, but by the application of clear and scientific economy in every way, by knocking off waste wherever it was discovered, and by lay-",38,Chapman Som E Down To Bedrock And Very Often

The organization for distribution on declared principles within the States of trophies allotted to the States has not yet, but soon will be, finally determined. 2. Tes. 3. The distribution is to be under principles laid down by the Commonwealth, which havo some regard for the desire of soldiers at the Front, that the trophies captured by the units coming from the respective States should, as far as possible, go to the States from which those units came. The help of the States for detailed allotment to towns, districts, and institutions would bo valuable; but, as stated, arrangements have not yet been made. Home and Territories, upon notice1. Is it correct, as stated in the press on the 1st instant, that the distribution of war trophies is to be made to the State Governments only, such States being charged with the duty of allotting the trophies to various cities and towns? 2. If such is the case, will the Minister direct that all applications already received by him shall be forwarded to the State to which they belong ? 3. At' what date is it intended to distribute the trophies? orable member's questions are as f o l low :1. The precise method of distribution is still under consideration. It is intended, as stated in ray answer to the previous question, that the War Museum Committee shall lay down principles for distribution of such trophies' as are not required for the Commonwealth War Museum in the various towns, districts, and institutions. As soon as these principles are settled and arrangements completed, I shall have pleasure in notifying the honourable member. 2.

When reading the schedule, I was of opinion that a stipendiary magistrate in any State was equivalent to a police magistrate in Victoria. The Acting Attorney General stated, however, that a stipendiary magistrate in South Australia is u magistrate possessing powers equal to those of a County Court Judge in Victoria. Of course, appearance in a County Court is much more expensive than appearance in a Police Court. In Victoria a police magistrate has charge of a certain circuit, and in most towns of any importance mortgagors will be able to readily submit their applications to a police magistrate, who, as a rule, is a person well trained in common law.

In a district like Wimmera, County Courts sit in only a few widely-separated centres, at which it will be expensive and inconvenient for many applicants to attend. Many persons would rather suffer the hardship of having their mortgage called up, and being obliged to make a new arrangement, in open Court, and disclose their whole business.

Bill read a third time. ter for Works and Railways and Acting Attorney-General) [5.3] I move That this Bill he now read a second time. "" It is certain that henceforth the most powerful nation will be, not that which possesses the most extensive territory, nor ihat which has the largest population, but that which is most industrious, most skilful, best educated, most capable of utilizing all the means and forces that science can place at man's disposal, anld which enable him to triumph over matter. The greatest producer amongst nations may become the foremost power of the world."" Those words are taken from a report of a French Commission on technical education, which was issued in 1863. In a recent article in an English magazine those words were quoted as particularly applicable to the present conditions of the United Kingdom. They are equally applicable to the present conditions of Australia. In these post-war days, we are strongly urged to increase the production of the Commonwealth. We are assured that the burden of national debt will press heavily upon us, and that the only way to increase the standard of living and meet our national obligations is to increase our production. t t is in the belief that science can aid in increasing production that this Bill is introduced. National prosperity depends upon two things-ou r possession of natural resources, and ability to use them to the fullest extent. that Australia possesses are well known. There is a wide variety of climate, .and great diversity of soil. Mineral deposits are scattered throughout the continent. Almost any plant useful to man can be grown somewhere in Australia. What we should aim at are the utilization and conservation of our resources to the fullest extent possible, and their preservation from destruction by pests or diseases of any kind. Our capacity to use the natural resources which the Almighty has placed at our disposal depends upon two things-the education of our people to engage in industries, and the possession of knowledge. The highest knowledge should be available, so that we may employ it in connection with all the industries that we 7 establish here. There is an increasing spread of technical education throughout the Commonwealth. The States are more and more taking up the development of agricultural education, and the general policy of Australia, through the States, is to educate and train the students in our schools more and more, and to increase more and more the practical and scientific side of education. But in ad-' dition to that, knowledge in its highest scientific form must be applied in connection with industries. That knowledge must be obtained by means of a properly constituted organization, which will enable the introduction as quickly as possible of the latest inventions and discoveries, the latest information regarding experiments connected with plant life and diseases affecting animals and plants, and the latest processes . in connection with manufactures. The object of this Bill is to establish in Australia an institution which will assist to bring scientific knowledge, information, and experience to bear upon the practical development of production and manufacture. That is, generally speaking, the object of the measure. A glance at the figures showing the production of Australia will indicate what this means to us. In 1916 our production represented a valuo of £270,427,000, made up in this way:Agriculture, £60,207,000; pastoral, The natural resources £S9,940,000; dairy, poultry, and beefarming, £26,949,000; forestry and",47,Thikd Reading

It is our duty, not only to preserve these flocks and herds, but to increase them. by disease. The latest number of the Journal of thc Institute of Science (""nd Industry states that the tick pest alone represented a loss of something like £7,000,000 to the Commonwealth.

Thef r u it f ly has affected various part3 of -Queensland, and put whole orchards out of cultivation. There are pests that affect the plant life of other States. Whatever can be saved by the aid of science w ill add to production, and enable us to bear the burden which we must inevitably face after the war. Almost every civilized country is now organizing some sort of Institute of Science, or increasing its Department of Agriculture, or some other branch of its governmental activities, in order to encourage research and promote the application of science to industry.

Competent Canadian authorities estimate that the work of that Federal Department has returned millions per annum fco the nation in the form of increased prothis applies to duction. It is well In the United Kingdom, for some time, things scientific were not as fully encouraged as they might have been, especially in connection with agriculture. In 1916, the money voted for the British Board of Agriculture amounted only to £341,648 , and for salaries to £146,118 . But on 23rd June, 1919, it was announced in the press that the Imperial Government had established a Bureau of Agriculture, and proposed to spend £2,000,000 on agricultural investigation and research This shows how the British authorities appreciate tbe value of the application of science to industry, and tlie necessity for expending money The upon research and investigation. This subject is not altogether a new one in the Commonwealth of Australia, as those who were in the first Parliamentknow. In the first Federal campaign in 1901, the necessity for the CommonI t is essentially wealth to take some action in this direction was advocated on the public platBy form. In the House of Representatives, on the 28th June, 1901, Sir John Quick movedThat, in the opinion of this House, a National Department of Agriculture and Productive Industries, on the same lines as that of the TJnited States of America, ought to be organized and maintained in connection with the Government of tlie Commonwealth.",48,Institute Of Science An D Industry Bill Second Reading

That proposal later on received the support of the Reid-McLean Government. The Deakin Government, in 1907. prepared a B ill , and a special memorandum was drafted setting out its purposes. This memorandum was issued on 31st May, 1907!

The United States of America institution of the kind has its representatives travelling constantly, and engaging in research work all over the world. That is an in stitution on a very extensive scale, and it may be some years before the Australian institution develops to the same extent. I should like to give a few illustrations supplied to me by MrE . A . V . Richardson, Superintendent of Agriculture in Victoria, to show the practical value of such a scientific institution in enriching the country. During the past twenty years many thousands of varieties of seeds and plants have been introduced into the United States of America, and many of these have resulted in the establishment of industries, the money-earning value of which amounts to many millions per annum. beeu made, by the Office of Seed and Plant Introduction. Among many of the introductions that might be mentioned as of commercial im/portaince are the D u r u m wheats, Swedish barleys, Russian oats, special dry and cold-resisting varieties of lucerne, Sudan grass, grain sorghums. These are now extensively grown in the United States of America, and have added greatly to production. As the agricultural interests of Australia develop, the introduction of new varieties of cereals, forages, and grasses w ill become increasingly authorities estimate that millions of pounds annually have been added to the agricultural production of the country by the breeding of new and improved strains of wlieat, barley, oats, sugar beet, longstaple cotton, flax, potatoes, and forage crops. Plant-breeding investigations have been unusually successful. and insect diseases cause immense damage to f a r m crops, e.g., smut in wheat, Irish blight in potatoes, and various diseases of f r u it trees, and takeall in wheat. In these cases the l if e history of the parasite has been worked out by the plant pathologists, and these diseases can now be effectively controlled; and it is estimated that the benefit reaped by the agricultural industries runs into millions of pounds. The essential point is that the control of these diseases was only possible by the scientific study of the life history of each pest. That is the only way, aud this must be done by trained scientific investigators. Enormous loss occurred in the United States of America, caused by preventable diseases. The losses to the live-stock industry by preventable animal diseases in the United States of America exceeds £28,000,000 annually. The amount lost prior to the establishment of the Bureau of Anima l Industry was estimated at nearly double this sum. D r . Mohler, head of the Bureau of Animal Industry, says that the losses due to cattle tick in 1906 were estimated at £20,000,000. In 1916, the estimated losses were £8,000,000, and 52 per cent, of the tick-infested country has been completely cleared of cattle tick. Similar work has been done in the reThese introductions have pression of hog cholera, tuberculosis, and pleuro-pneumonia. ' In 1907, the losses through hog cholera amounted to £14,000,000. In 1916, the losses were reduced to £5,000,000. The work of the Bureau of Animal Industry has resulted in an annual saving to the live-stock industries of ten to twenty times the money expended by the Bureau. Here, in Australia, the annual losses in live stock through pleuro-pneumonia, contagious abortion, tick and worm nodules in cattle, blowfly, fluke and braxy in sheep, r un into millions per annum. These important. Competent diseases do not recognise State boundaries; and if a better method of control could be evolved, the saving to the livestock industries would be enormous. The Wisconsin Agricultural Experiment Station has been conspicuous by its application of science to the dairy in Fungoid dustry. It is demonstrable that the added wealth of the State of Wisconsin each year, as a result of the activities of the experiment station, is many times the whole appropriation made by Wisconsin for higher education.

Notwithstanding the fact that during the past twenty-five years the progress of settlement in Australia has necessitated the utilizing of immense areas of country much poorer than that which has been hitherto cultivated, we find that not only has the average yield of .wheat per acre been maintained, but that it has actually been considerably increased. Taking the averages over five-year periods, we find that for the past five years the average yield of oats per acre has actually decreased by 10.3 per cent., as compared with the quinquennium 1886 to 1890. The average barley yields have increased only 6.3 per cent., and maize by 3.3 per cent., during the past twenty-five years. But what of wheat? bringing under crop of enormous areas of poor land with a low rainfall, the average yield per acre during the past twenty-five years has actually increased by 33.4 per cent. Now, as wheat is the only crop on which scientific attention has been directed, these facts are certainly very significant. results in wheat have been brought about partly by the increased use of superphosphate, but in no small measure by the work of a Cambridge University graduate, W ill i a m Parrer. Working as a specialist in New South Wales, Farrer fixed a new variety of wheat that was destined to become the most popular variety in Australia, and greatly in creased the yield in the Commonwealth. necessary to tell us the value of research work ? to lay these facts before the House, and the test of their value will be seen in the vote given on the B ill . wish to superimpose this institution on the institutions of the States? matter presently, and I feel sure of the support of a man so deeply imbued as the honourable member is w i th the necessity for agricultural research work. I should now like to give an illustration of what has been done in Australia by Professor Lefroy, a representative of the British Wheat Commission, to show the value of the services of a highly-trained, scientific man in problems of the kind. Owing to the great shortage in shipping to Australia during the war, the immense quantities of wheat lying at the seaboard have been subjected to the ravages of weevil. A t one time it appeared as if the losses that would result from tliis pest would run to several millions sterling. No effective method of dealing w i th weevil in large stacks had been known prior to 1916. Professor Lefroy visited Australia on behalf of the British Government, and devised a practical method of treating grain by sterilizing it at a temperature of 140 degrees for three minutes. This treatment killed all Despite the the weevil and weevil eggs, but d i d not affect the milling qualities of the grain. This treatment is now being effectively applied to the whole of the grain stored at the ports, and has resulted in the saving of large sums of money. May I give another illustration ? This, I am sure, will appeal to the honourable member for The increased Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), because the young man to whom T refer-Dr. Hargreaves-as a native of Ipswich, Queensland, a scholar of the Grammar School there, arid a student of the Melbourne University, who is now engaged in South Australia.

Those are Federal activities. Let us take, first of all, that State but every State? It is here the administrative work of scientific inves* tigation. It is the function of the Quarantine Department to prevent diseases coming into Australia, but Wheni t comes to a question of eradicating an established disease and employing officers to inspect orchards, we have what is essentially a State function. The States have the organization for carrying out that work, and, generally speaking, there is no necessity for the Commonwealth to attempt to carry-out local administrative work. That can effectively be carried out by the various States through the institutions which they have already established. When we deal with educational work, obviously, ias the States have all the educational machinery, such as agricultural colleges, universities, high schools, and even primary schools, where a good deal of foundation work can be done, that also is essentially a State function. But when we come to research and investigation work, which is carried out either' in laboratories, or in the field, or in experimental stations, we have a branch where thei'e is need for co-operation between the Commonwealth and the States. The' States already have experimental stations, so that there is no need for the Commonwealth to unnecessarily duplicate these establishments. There is necessity, however, for the Commonwealth to take Up research work, a sphere of usefulness which is essentially Federal in [425] character. For the moment I am dealing In the Customs Departonly with diseases in plant and animal life. I have already referred to those which are of a national character. They do not affect any one State. They affect all States. In Queensland, the investigators are faced -with the whole series of problems which no one State with harrow resources at its disposal oan hope to deal with effectively. I say this without any reftectidn on the work done by the officers of the States, but their efforts have, so far, not been fully effective, because they are attempting to do work of great magnitude affecting the whole of the States. How can a little community like Tasmania be expected to bear the whole burden of investigating scientific problems that affect not only that the Commonwealth plight to step in to assist .the States, and take over the control of national research work, employing the best brains of the community and doing everything possible to get tlie best results. That is where the work of this Bureau will lie. In 1911, the Scottish Commission visited Australia, and those who were privileged to meet the Commissioners know that they were men of very great experience and marked ability. They were given facilities to examine the agricultural possibilities of Australia, and they visited all the leading institutions of the States. In fact, they had the opportunity of regarding the operations of those institutions from a Federal stand-point, and their report, wihich is too little known to us-, was an invaluable publication. I propose to quote one extract from it> 'because it bears upon our problems. It is like looking at them from an outside point of view. It is an independent judgment of what we are doing here, and .of what we ought to do. This is what they said-Keseiirchi -In comparison with research work carried out in Scotland, where the subject has not received the attention which it deserves, the extensive arrangements which are made, and encouragements which are giveA to experiment and investigation in Australia, are gratifying and surprising.

219,Mr Groom,"There is also Federalthe directors of experiment stations, and, indeed, in all connected with the work of development. It appeared to us, however, that a -considerable amount of overlapping was going on, that in general there was a want of co-ordination and co-operation, that the policy of allowing each State to attempt to attack the solution of each agricultural problem by itself was not the most economical. There are many problems which are common to the whole of Australia, or to the greater part of it, and it would appear that time and money would be saved by placing some of the work of research in the hands of a Federal Department. For example, every State is afflicted with various stock diseases. In Queensland, thlere is "" tick fever "" ; and in another, "" dry bible""; in another, there is ""coast disease""; and so on. A strong and well-equipped Federal Department would seem more likely to cope with such diseases than the weaker and less well-equipped States Departments. prickly pear, again, is not a State monopoly, but may, through time, spread over most of the country; and here again is an argument for Federal control, which would not absorb or limit the energies of the State Departments, but concern itself with a broader and a wider field. plaint in regard to overlapping would only be intensified. point out the necessity for co-operation and co-ordination.

It should be our object to help in every way the secondary as well as the primary industries of Australia.

As. a matter of fact, the site for a building is selected before the reference is made; and although the Committee may find it most unsuitable, it has power to do nothing more than draw attention to the fact. When the Committee does this, the Government pr the Department may pay no heed to the expression of opinion, on the ground that there is power to report only on the actual work referred. As an illustration of this, we have the case of a previous Public Works Committee which in quired into the proposal to erect a telephone exchange in SydneyI t was found that tlie site was so unsuitable, indeed ridiculous, that proper entrances could not be provided for either employees or goods. condemned the site; but it had already been selected by the Department, and the work went on. show that the case submitted by the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) cannot be substantiated. Th^n there is the question of whether employees for the Note Printing Offices could be obtained at Canberra; and this furnishes a reason why we should support the amendment of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton). The amendment, if carried, w ill give the Committee power to inquire whether, adjacent to Canberra, housing accommodation can be obtained; and whether, at Queanbeyan, there ""ar§ people in sufficient numbers ready and willing to take work in the establishment. Canberra, we have always been able to employ the necessary labour. this case; and if there is any 'lingering doubt on the point, the Public Works Committee ought to be given power to o into every phase of the matter, and nd out exactly what the capabilities of Canberra are. However, there is involved a. much bigger question. Is this Parliament going to keep the compact that was made with New South Wales at the initiation of Federation ? New South Wales, iiji common with other States, entered Federation on clearly defined lines as laid down in the Constitution, which provides, amongst other things, that the Capital shall be in .the mother State, b u t not within 100 miles of Sydney. This Parliament has decided on Canberra as the Federal Territory, and the people of New South Wales expect these definite undertakings to be carried out. Every building of a purely Commonwealth character erected anywhere but at Canberra is only another obstacle to the establishment of the Seat of Government at the Federal Capital. In the case of Canada, Ottawa was chosen in 1858, and seven years later, in 1865, the Dominion Parliament was meeting there. No suggestion was made that that compact should not be honoured; and if that could be done in Canada, why cannot we keep f a it h with Very properly, the Committee New South Wales? A f t e r nearly twenty years of Federation, we seem as far from the establishment of a Federal Capital as when we began; indeed further, because These facts clearly obstacles f>re always being put in the way. Ex-Judge Heydon, who stands very high in New South Wales as a constitutional autliority, the other day, at a public function in Sydney, expressed the opinion that, constitutionally, this Parliament should be sitting at.Canberra to-day; and, speaking as a layman,. I take it that if the point were tested, we should be told that our meeting in Melbourne is illegal. There is another phase that should be seriously considered. Other States entered into Federation on the f a it h of certain promises. promised a north-south railway when she joined the Federation. tions should not be dealt with in a And so it will be in narrow spirit; and any compact made should, if anything, err on the side of generosity in the fulfilment.

The Minister( Mr. Groom) who has charge of the motion has proposed that the question of erecting a particular building on a particular site shall be referred to the Public Works Committee; and inasmuch as that site, and the building on it , will involve an expenditure of about £50,000, it naturally occurs to those who advocate the Parliament has been sitting in early movement of Parliament to the Federal Capital to wonder whether it is wise to spend so much money in Melbourne on an establishment which may ultimately be determined to be more suitably located in the Federal Capital.

I am sure. the House generally will not approve of such a large expenditure unless it can be shown that the Government have in their minds some means of utilizing the building afterwards, with profit. I suggest that the general question of the building should be referred to the Public Works Committee, and that, in the meantime, premises suitable for the purpose of this particular work should be rented in Melbourne. the land. that they have bought the land without getting the House to approve of referring the question to the Public Works Committee; and I gather that work has already been carried out on the site. in connection with the building to be referred to the Public Works Committee, but a portion of the premises already on the land has been electrically wired for the girls who are at work there. hear that nothing has been done in consite nexion with the building proposed to be referred to the Public Works Committee.

The Government, however, have already acquired the land referred to in the motion. They are carrying out alterations to the building now on it , and they ask the House to approve of an inquiry by the Committee as to the erection of another building which is to form part of one complete scheme. Is that an honest way of dealing with so big a question? The whole thing is so interwoven that it cannot be separated. that the offices ought not to be erected on the site named in the motion, we should be in the unfortunate position of having acquired land for a purpose for which the Committee did not think it suitable. There is also the position that money is being expended on the alteration of the existing building, and that if the scheme as a whole is not gone on with, that expenditure will prove useless.

The proposal made by the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith) shows a reasonable way out, for it would enable buildings to be erected, machinery placed there, and give reasonable conditions of employment. It is an affront to Parliament to decide a great question like this, and then pretend tp ask our consent. I should not have minded if the Government had taken the matter into its own hands and erected a building, thus flouting Parliament altogether, for there would have been something determined and honest in such action. There is no doubt that work has been started, and the Minister must have been badly advised on this point.

446,Mr Fenton (Maribyrnong) [9.9].,"We were at that time confronted with the same difficulty in reference to the site, which had already been purchased by the Government, and the Public Works Committee were to inquire only as to the cost or kind of buildings to be ereected. Por the information of honourable members. I will read an extract or two from that report on the question of the acquisition of landIn connection witli this matter, it is noted that, although the site was acquired on SOth June, 1014, the proposal for the erection of the building was not referred to the Committee 'until 14th December, 1916. Apart from the question of loss of interest on capital, when sites are acquired any considerable time in advance of their use for Commonwealth purposes, it is considered most inadvisable that tlie Committee should run the risk of being in any way influenced in its decision as to the erection of any building by the fact that an expensive site has already been acquired by the Commonwealth for such building. In most cases tliere should be little difficulty is a temporary iron building, used by the in obtaining an option over any site suggested for a building forming the subject of reference to the Committee, and, in any case, the Commonwealth is amply protected by the provision of the Lands Acquisition Act 1906 from any unreasonable demands which might be made in respect of land required for Commonwealth purposes. The following is the opinion to which ' I should like the honourable member for Eden-Monaro listen:In the opinion of the Committee, however, it is quite as important that full inquiries should be made, and Parliament duly informed, of any large expenditure on land, as it is in the case of works, and it is strongly recommended that in the case of any proposal for the acquisition of land for Commonwealth purposes, where the estimated cost of the land would exceed £25,000, or the estimated cost of a site for a building, plus' the cost of the building proposed to be erected thereon, would exceed £25,000, the matter should be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report prior to acquisition there was no right to buy land until the matter had been submitted to Parliament. gation the Committee found that it was necessary to go down about 40 feet in order to make an artificial foundation, and they regarded the site as quite unsuitable; but the Government had paid a big price for it , and the Committee had to keep to the terms of their reference. I disapprove of the Government entering into land purchases in any city in which they already have land suitable for the erection of buildings required. This is a question which has been the subject of investigation by the Public Accounts Committee in recent times. In connection with the housing of public servants in the capital cities, the members of the Committee inspected various sites in various cities, including Melbourne. In this city the Government already possess the Victoria Barracks site, on St. Kilda-road, with a ground space of, I think, 84,000 square feet, a frontage of 135 feet to St. Kilda-road-, and two large frontages of about 450 feet to other streets. The only building on this land Victorian Police as a sort of riding school. There are other areas of land on the General Post Office site and the Customs House site. A t a time when every pound and every shilling counts, I object to the Government "" over-running the constable "" by purchasing sites when they are already possessed of suitable areas. I cannot accept the suggestion from the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith)', ( Mr Chapman) to because I am much adverse to paying rent to landlords when we have land of our own. I ' shall not enter into the question raised in regard to the Federal Capital, for no doubt that will form a lively subject of discussion either in this Parliament or the next. I do not agree with the cry raised by representatives of New South Walesi n their hurry to get to Canberra. I remember that on one occasion when the Public Works Committee recommended a building should be erected on the Pederal area for the purposes of If that is correct, the Small Arms Factory, there was a howl of indignation from almost the whole of the members who are now nearly "" breaking their necks "" to secure buildD u r in g that investiings there.

449,Mr Hector Lamond,"The electorsiquitous features of the framing of the 'Constitution was the insistance by New iSouth Wales that the Capital should be in that State. In the case of the Post-office Stores to which I have already referred, I so. far disagreed with the Government that I , as a member of the Public Works Committee, voted against their erection on the site referred to us, and Senator Keating, tlie honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Sampson), and the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), also members of the Committee, voted in the same way. I took that course because I considered the wrong site had been selected; and I am quite consistent to-night in voting for the .amendment of the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton). If the Government had paid regard to the recommendation of the Publio Works Committee in 1'917, We should not be in our present position, .for both site and buildings would have been referred to the Public ""Works Committee. It is reckless expenditure to spend nearly '£60,000 on a site -for the Note Printing Offices when there is already land available in Melbourne', which is as much entitled to Federali n stitutions of the kind-as'is any portion of New South Wales.

The Government w ill be able to dispose of it without very much fear of loss. Like the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Bruce Smith) , I find myself w i th two attitudes on this question. I shall vote for the amendment of the honourable, member for Hunter( Mr Charlton)., in the hope that it w ill be carried; but I shall vote against the proposal to refer the matter to the Public Works Committee at all.

Yet. twenty years have gone by, and still in this Parliament there is strong passive resistance to the carrying out of a pledge which is actually embodied, in the Constitution.

Are we to keep these offices occupied for all time by the Defence Department? heard of real economy in this regard, and time some use was made of these buildings for other Commonwealth Departments* One can hardly go along any street in Melbourne without finding a block of buildings in which a Commonwealth office is situated. We ought to review our position in regard to the accommodation of many of our activities. At a time when the huge administration in connection with the war is to be curtailed, room might be found for otherDepartments in offices which are to be vacated by the Defence Department. any heed to the honourable member's remarks. way in which to impress Ministers is by the votes of honourable members. While honourable members are prepared to vote year in and year out for more and more expenditure in Melbourne, sending up the land values in this city in every direction at the expense of the Commonwealth, instead of enhancing the value of the Commonwealth land at Canberra, we shall have this sort of thing going on. I shall vote against any proposal to put up a permanent building in Melbourne which will not be needed here when the Seat of Government is removed to Canberra. The proposed building is one which is closely associated with the Treasury. Bureau of Engraving is within easy walk of the Treasury, and is under the direct eye of the Minister controlling the finances of the TJnited States of America. Our offices should be under similar control, and if in two or three years we go to Canberra, thebuilding now proposed to be erected in Melbournewill be worthless unless theOommonwealth can find otheractivities to make use of it: However, we Of course, there are certainhave the right to expect that there will soonbevacant offices in many buildings at present occupied by the Defence Department.

I contend that we should either abolish the Public Works Committee, and place responsibility on the Minister for Works and Railways, or insist that all works should go to the Public Works Committee, with that body absolutely free. It is not free if a Minister has already spent money in putting up offices that are ultimately to form part of the building. It is not-as free to deal with the. merits of the case as the.law requires. The law is that the Minister shall come to the House and explain a proposition, and then it is for the House to refer the matter to the Public Works Committee.

If it has taken evidence which is not given on oath, I hope that it will not present that evidence to the House as ordinary evidence taken on oath. If that is done, it is a very serious thing. The report would mislead Parliament as to the character of the evidence given. However, my point of view is not affected by these things. I shall not give my vote for the erection of any public building, of a permanent character in connection with the Capitali n the temporary seat of government. I object,on the grounds of economy, to the building of new offices in Melbourne while there arc huge, unoccupied buildings all over the city. I object to the purchase of sites in new centres while there are large, unoccupied areas in a central situation, which ought to be made use of by the Commonwealth before going further afield.

But the most extraordinary development to-day is that it appears the Public Works Committee is doing work for which it has no authority.

The Minister( Mr Groom) has denied the statement made by an honourable member that on the site at the present time work is going on that will dovetail in with the scheme which forms the subject of this reference. On the site at the present time men are fitting up an electric plant, knocking holes in the walls of the existing building, and putting in new doorways. Tbere are also some cement and other building material on the job. If the alterations now in progress are ultimately to dovetail in with the work covered by this reference, then the Minister was incorrect.in his statement. that no work is being done in connection Kith this reference. work is going on at the site, and we believe that it will ultimately fit in with the work to be done under this reference. Just as the Public Works Committee, anticipating that this motion would be carried, has commenced its inquiry, so the Department of Works 'and Railways, acting under instructions from some one, is making alterations to the existing buildings, anticipating, apparently, that the erection of these oflices will be recommended by the Committee. These two revelations are, to say the least, astounding. patory work of the Committee will bear f r u it should this reference (be agreed to, but I submit that no more Commonwealth buildings should be erected in Melbourne. made in any other part of Australia for offices that it will be necessary to erect at Canberra. We have to make a start somewhere, and the more we expend on Commonwealth stronger will be the reason for delaying the establishment of the Pederal Capital. I am not concerned with the means adopted to secure the Federal Capital for New South Wales. The means adopted were, to my mind, immoral. They were certainly not such as should have been adopted to determine the site of the capital of a nation. But since it has been decided that the Capital shall be established at Canberra, we should avoid any duplication of Commonwealth buildings. [427] I should like the Minister to inform the House what work is now in progress on the Victoria-parade site, whether that work w ill fit in with the building covered Iby this reference, and why the Public Works Committee was instructed to proceed with the taking of evidence before the matter had been referred to Parliament. have been listening with much interest to the discussion on this question, and it appears to me that honourable members generally must feel, as I do, that we are at a time of immense and unequalled prosperity; that public works are not being denied to any electorate, that we are anticipating enormous surpluses in the future, and that we are living in a sort We know that of fairyland, instead of the position in f r o n t of us really being so obscure financially that land which has been purchased for. post oflices and other public buildings in various electorates has to remain unoccupied because of the grave crisis before us. That is the actual position all over Australia, and yet we find that at the Ibehest of some one, the law is broken, the Constitution is set aside, and the Government suddenly start upon a scheme involving an expenditure of not merely £46,000, but, judging by the plans, something in the neighbourhood I have no doubt that the anticiof £200,000. Indeed, when that estimate is exceeded in the normal course of affairs we shall probably find that the Commonwealth has been committed to an expenditure of £300,000 on the erection of a No provision should be building in Melbourne without any reference of the matter to Parliament. There is a law governing this matter which says that before any work of this buildings here, the kind is undertaken it must be referred to Parliament. That law has been set aside, in fact, if not in the letter, by the Department actually acquiring for a specific purpose a site in Melbourne before Parliament has been asked to decide, through its Committee, whether it is right or not for these oflices to be erected here.

In this case, however, the money required for the acquisition of the land, I understand, was not on the Estimates. not been paid for.

Honourable members may think that in opening my TemarksI . was speaking with some soreness, because of constant refusals to carry out past obligations to my electorate. I come from New South ""Wales, but I regard myself sitting in this House as an Australian; not as a New South Welshman. I am one of those honourable members who have refused to sign a requisition, to the Government to i m mediately establish the Federal Capitali n New South Wales. My reason for refusing to sign that document at present is that, u n t i l the Government have disclosed credit, and. I believe they will be satisfied their Budget-in other words, u n t i l we know how f a r we are from the nnancial precipiceI do not think it is right, or patriotic, or Australian; I do not believe it is New South Welsh, to ask the Commonwealth to run itself right over that precipice in order to carry out a bargain that should have been carried out before the war started. While I hold that view strongly enough to make me, as a representative of New South Wales, refuse to sign that requisition, I view w i th absoformerly occupied as a German club. If lute horror the easy way that the Minister has of starting an expenditure of £200,000 existence ever since the estabi n the capital of Victoria. I resent that. The pracI have treated the Government f a i r l y in abstaining from the New South Wales move, which might have embarrassed them; but I think that they are not treating the Housef a i r l y if they ask it to commit itself to an expenditure of £200,000 on the erection of another public building amongst the administrative offices in Melbourne. I shall vote for the amendment if it goes to a division; and, if it is carried, I shall then vote against the whole reference. That is the only course now open, to us. I most strongly urge the Ministry to come down at the earliest moment with their Budget statement, and let us know where we really A t present, there is are w it h our finances in general. I should like to exchange courtesies, if I might, for a moment or two with the members of that very excellent and esteemed public body, the Public Works Committee. Nothing gave me greater pleasure' than the statement so frankly and readily made by the Chairman of the Public Works Committee ( Mr Gregory) that, in connection with this in quiry, they had been working in an entirely honorary capacity, though we had a heated contradiction almost immediately following fro m the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr. Sampson). I hope my friend the Chairman of the Committee will stand by the opinion that he has pronounced, and will see that, as this inquiry which he and other members of that Committee have taken part in is entirely illegal, it must be equally honorary. Their desire to acquire information does them infinite with that credit, recognising that as in this work they are without the law they must also be without the profits. I rise to.support the amendment. I find, from the plan, that the land concerned has a frontage of about 130 feet by a depth of 247 feet, and that the Government proposal is to occupy less than half the .ground, the other' portion being occupied by the hall the House passes the motion, there will be really nothing for the Works Com-",78,Chapman Wha T Gave The Matter F A I R Consideration

The existing building has four .floors, and is of a very plain character. There is nothing in the elevation to the lane or the street that the Committee -could disagree with. They could decide -at once upon their recommendation. have looked through the quantities, and have come to the conclusion that £44,000 is rather a high price for a building on ground 30 by 100 feet, b u t I assume that the bills of quantities are correct. The motion now before the House appears to be nothing more nor less than an attempt to involve Parliament in heavy expenditure, because if we refer this matter to the Public Works Committee, and that bodj; makes a recommendation, we cannot escape the expenditure. It is time members of this House stood up for their rights, and in regard to this matter decided that the Government shpuld not be allowed to go on with the proposal. This building should be erected at Canberra, where the three -main essentials, electric light and power, water supply, and sewerage are already provided. position of the conditions during the constructional Canal. first undertook that work, obsolete methods, and in an unheathy -climate provided hospitals for sick people. They would never have finished that huge undertaking if the Americanauthorities had not come to their assistance, and they first of all provided for the workmen a water supply, the necessary power, and sewerage to meet all requirements. A i l these essentials are now available at Canberra, and the expenditure incurred can. I believe, be made reproductive, and Teal economy be effected if steps are taken to erect Commonwealth buildings on the Capital site. The place is now habitable, and it is absurd to regard furthe r expenditure there as wasteful. Surely no honourable members will say that the will of the people is not going to be respected. It is no use now finding faul t with those who fixed upon that area as the Capital site. It is too late now to do that. The endeavour of the Government has been to prevent the House having an opportunity to discuss this question. They did not refer to the Committee the question of site; the Committte were given no power to express an opinion on that subject. All the Committee can do if this reference is made is to look at the plans and quantities, and ask ths architects of the Public Works Department for I any assistance that may be needed in working out the probable cost of the building. To an honourable member like myself, who understands building operations, it is easy to see that no wasteful expenditure is proposed. The suggested building is a simple one of four stories, and the sanitary arrangements are to be in accordance with the principles followed by sanitary engineers. . If the House agrees to the motion in its present form, the Committee will sit for a few hours, and in about three or four days will be able to submit their report on the proposal. I deplore the fact admitted by the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, that an inquiry into these buildings was made by the Committee before the referThe ence from Parliament. When the Public at Canberra reminds me Works Committee Act was passed, the intention was that any proposed work period of the Panama should be considered .by Parliament beThe French authorities, who fore any expenditure was incurred. The adopted reason for the institution of the Public Works Committee in New South Wales was that sums of money were placed on the Estimates which did not represent the actual estimated expenditure for proposed works. When Sir Henry Parkes was Premier, a sum of about £750,000 was placed on the Estimates for the proposed Sydney waterworks, and I favoured what I considered, and what the engineers ultimately found to be, a much better scheme. I said to Sir Henry one day, "" Your scheme will cost, on a rough estimate, over £2,000,000."" He replied, in his usual quiet manner, "" Neverm in d ; if I were to tell Parliament what these works will cost, Parliament would never pass them.""' I warn the House that the ultimate cost of the works that are now the subject of this reference will be £95,000. I hope I shall have the opportunity to fight all these proposals until Parliament decides that permanent Commonwealth buildings which are not local in character shall be erected in the Capital Territory. visited the site in Victoria-parade to-day, and inside the hall of the existing building saw an immense quantity . of planks for scaffolding, and 5,000 or 6,000 running feet of 6 x 6 timber. planks are to be used in the work of erecting concrete walls. All the scaffolding is covered up, so that it cannot be seen from the street. that tKe intention is to strengthen the floors in order that they may be able to bear the vibration of machinery. Already, workmen have commenced to cut two doorways into the adjoining building, and they propose to cut other apertures for windows, and to install electric light. The hasty way in which this work is being carried on is causing suspicion. However honourable members may regard the Federal Capital question, the time has come when every member should be made to declare whether he is in favour of the terms of the Constitution being carried out. naked to become a member of the Federal Capital Committee in New South Wales. I declined, and said, "" Y o u are all friends of the National party, which has never done anything but concentrate all expenditure in Melbourne."" that done? members would not retain their membership of this Parliament if it were shifted to Canberra; it would not pay them to travel that distance. They are determined to keep this Parliament in Melbourne as long as they can. There is a powerful influence at work to prevent the spirit of the Constitution being observed, and to the business of the Commonwealth being conducted without interference by the Melbourne press, which today controls the destinies of Australia, to the detriment of our people. It expresses nothing but the narrow provincial view, and represents the same spirit that animated the "" littl e "" Australians who fought against Federation. I ask honourable members to deal with this matter in a national spirit. spirit. Capital shall be in Sydney. talk about decentralization, but they I endeavour to get everything concentrated in the big cities. One of the best moves ever made in the interests of decentralization was the making of a constitutional provision that the Federal Parliament These should be kept away from the Statecapitals. B y transferring the Federal Parliament to Canberra and thus opening up that Territory we would be doing I am informed something practical in the interests of decentralization. Metropolitan land values are too high altogether for the welfare of our people. How can shopkeepers hope to supply cheap food while they are required to pay enormously heavy sums in weekly rentals? ' I am not in favour of the alternative suggestion to remove the note printing establishment to Sydney. That city is expanding altogether too much to-day. It is becoming more and more the capital of Australia. I altogether deprecate the conduct of the Government, and I hope When I was we shall never see the like of it again.

If the project in question were merely a matter of £44,000 the procedure of the Government would not be quite so bad; but the proposition w ill represent an ultimate expenditure involving at least £90,000. As we love Australia, we should see that no expenditure of public money other than is amply justified for the efficient government of the people is permitted.
