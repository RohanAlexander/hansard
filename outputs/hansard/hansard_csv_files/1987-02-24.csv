I believe all of us with which you were elected. yesterday were disappointed that the man who The third point of view and the third essence for the time being, albeit temporarily, is Treasof this debate is that I am concerned, as on urer of the Government did not accede to your another occasion, that it would seem, while this request when requested to do so on successive matter was raised, quite properly, by you at the occasions. Having said that, I do not support the earliest opportunity immediately after prayers, character of the personal remarks made by the the Leader of the House( Mr Young) has read honourable member for O'Connor. But that has to the House from a typewritten motion. Madam no real import in this present debate. Madam Speaker, you need to undertake as part of your Speaker, I suggest to you that if judgment is to responsibilities to ensure that you have heard be passed within a court of law, if judgment is the honourable member's point of view. It is not to be dispensed within the practice and procemine; it is not that of any other member of this dure of any democratic system, it should not be House; it is the point of view of the honourable done in haste; it should not be done by a Minmember for O'Connor. Madam Speaker, he did ister having heard an early announcement and the honest and gentlemanly thing in writing to suddenly rushing out and saying: 'Well, he'll be you. He did the honest and gentlemanly thing, good for seven days'. It should be done after beyond that, in seeking an opportunity to reproper, adequate and dispassionate consideration spond within this Parliament by requesting that of the nature of the offence, having heard whathe be allowed the opportunity to give to this ever remarks might be made by the person in Parliament whatever answer he might have for his cause, and having then, without rancour, whatever statement he has made. bitterness or prejudice, determined what might be a fair response. I think it important, therefore, that the character of the offence be divorced altogether from That third concern, relating to the adjudicathose other two issues. Madam Speaker, I think tion upon this process, goes to the whole fundathat the honourable member's having apologised, mentals of the exercise of the rights of a as his letter to you has done, is also material in democratic system.
