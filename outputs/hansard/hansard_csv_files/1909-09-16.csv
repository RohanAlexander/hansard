35,Mr Watkins,"The question that Itaken into account, in determining the pensions payable to claimants. There is a proviso to that definition which was evidently inserted with a view of encouraging thrift. The definition reads: : Income means any moneys . ceived by any person for his own use or benefit . . . and shall be deemed to include personal earnings, but not any payment(a) By way of benefit from any friendly society registered under any Act, or State Act, or (4) During illness, infirmity, or old-age, from any trade union, provident society, or other society or association. I regard that language as wide enough to include any association of workmen or other people formed with a view to providing benefits in case of old age, accident, or death; but the Attorney-General has decided that the particular association I have in view cannot be brought within the section. in existence in New South Wales, under Act of Parliament, since 1900. Prior to that date, miners and other employees had formed local branches, by means of which the fund was collected and managed; but,'under the present arrangements, contributions are made by the employers and by the Government. The payment by the Government is not a subsidy, but a contribution from a participator in the business, seeing that the State receives large royalties on the coal produced. The fund is contributed, roughly, to the extent of one-half by the men, and one-half by the employers and the Government ; and not only are temporary act cidents provided for, but there are payments to widows, orphans, and other relatives in case of fatal accident, and allowances to men who have been permamently injured while following their employment. The following figures for 1908 will, I think, show that, in every sense of the word, this is a provident fund:Distinct mines subject to the Act during the year Mines subject to the Act, 31st igoS Number of fatal accidents year Number of non-fatal accidents year (a) Fatal Accidents. Widows Fathers Mothers Sisters and guardians ... .Children (i) Non-fatal Accidents.

The Attorney-General merely gave a decision without any reason; and it is to the following effect:The New South Wales Miners' Accident Relief Act igoo provides for certain payments being made to miners meeting with accidents by Committees appointed under the Act. The funds available to meet the payments arise from contributions by the miners, contributions by the mine-owners, and an annual Government subsidy. Roughly, the miners' contribution is one-half of the whole sum contributed, the remainder being made up by the mine-owners' contribuThe fund has been tions and the Government subsidy. In my opinion the payments are not payments from a friendly society, trade union, provident society, or other society or association, and should therefore be treated as income. I have examined the Old-age Pensions Act and I cannot find anything to debar a fund of this description, simply on the ground that it is regulated by Act of Parliament; there is nothing which makes it necessary for a provident fund to be either voluntary or compulsory. Whether the technical reading given to the section by the Attorney-General be correct or not, it was never the intention of Parliament to make such a differentiation as has been made under the regulations. The New South Wales Act was passed with a view to encouraging the employees to make provision for themselves; and, under the decision of the Attorney-General, the contributors to the fund are to have, their pensions reduced simply and solely because they have been thrifty. The administration of old-age pensions, particularly since it has been a Commonwealth concern, shows too great a ... ... ... ... 185 desire to punish people because they have December, been thoughtful enough to endeavour to ... ... 172 make some provision for themselves.

Crouch. asked ? weeks ago; and if I am correct, the contributors to the miners' fund of New South Wales are doubly wronged. The money subscribed by the men themselves, has paid for all benefits and accidents compensation within about £6.ooo; and the position of the men is surely bad enough when we have regard to the calling which they follow. Surely the position of employees, whether in the leaden hell, shall I say, of Broken Hill, or the coal mines of New South Wales, in which so many accidents occur every year, is bad and hard enough, with their intermittent employment and the necessity of keeping up their contributions to this fund, without their being robbed under an Act which was intended to benefit them, owing to the way in which it is being administered. I shall be glad to hear the Attorney-General give reasons for this decision. If the Government accept the Attorney-General's opinion as to the reading of the Act, do they not think that this point alone is important enough to warrant the immediate introduction of an amending Bill? The intention of the Legislature was not to differentiate between one provident society and another, or to deal differently with different bodies of citizens. Apart from that question, I am sorry to say that my experience shows that the administration of the Act generally has been very unsympathetic, to say the least of it. Every attempt has been made to lower the pensions of people who have come under the Federal Act from under the New South Wales Act. All sorts of flimsy excuses have been given for these reductions. the New South Wales Act has always been administered in the same way in regard to those who benefit under the fund to which the honourable member refers. or not, it does not affect our position. that the New South Wales Act was administered in that way. to learn it ; but the administration of the Federal Act generally, although it is supposed to be a more liberal measure than was the New South Wales Act, presses more hardly upon these people. Facts speak for themselves. Is the Treasurer prepared to A man who receives a gratuity or pension from a friendly society receives full consideration, but another, who receives payments from this fund, to which he has subscribed in the same way as he would have subscribed to a friendly society, is penalized. Is the Treasurer prepared to say that that practice must continue? If he will look at the question as he ought to do, I am sure he will agree that he can make no distinction between one subscriber and another. is exactly the same as in New South Wales. The point is: Does the right honourable member believe it to be right ? Mr J. H . CATTS -It is not the same, anyhow. it is the same. The question is: Is it right or wrong? It seems to be stretching the law to the furthest degree to exclude these people from the full benefits of the Act. Has the Treasurer decided, or has he not, that old soldiers' pensions shall not be regarded as income? They are income. ceived by the honourable member for Corio was incorrect. As I read it, it was that the Treasurer had decided not to treat old soldiers' pensions as income. I do not object to that. able member is in error. came from the Department in answer to a request by the honourable member for Corio.

I ask honourable members to permit the honourable member for Hunter to proceed uninterrupted. such details as were quoted by the honourable member for Newcastle, who put the matter very clearly. I agree with him that it is undesirable to levy a tax on the thrift whether the Treasurer himself is the kind of the people. We should remember that, although a man may not be a millionaire, yet, if he has brought up a family in such a way that its members are of use and service to the country, he deserves just as much credit as does a man who, perhaps, with a smaller family, leaves a large sum of money for public purposes. The wealth of a State is not to be counted only in pounds, shillings, and pence. We are not dealing merely with a question of gold, silver, and copper, but with the lives of men who have produced wealth for the benefit of the country. Such a man, who has lived a useful and industrious life, is, in my opinion, worth more to the country than many a man who leaves a mass of wealth behind him. I wish to make a suggestion .to the Government. I do not know that it is desirable to urge it particularly upon the Treasurer, because he is a sort of Cerberus standing at the door of the Treasury, and naturally anxious to diminish the expenditure of money. I would make an appeal to the Prime Minister, that he should, at the earliest possible moment, draft an amending Bill providing that miners' accident funds shall not be earmarked. evident, from what has been discovered on the point at issue being submitted to the Attorney-General, that an oversight occurred in the drafting of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. Such errors are not uncommon. amending Bills designed to improve Acts of Parliament. But no one can doubt that when the Act was under consideration there was a desire to be liberal, and not to have a narrow interpretation put upon the measure. The rapidity and unanimity with which the Act was passed is proof of what I say. The Miners' Relief Fund was established in New South Wales for a beneficent purpose. I am glad to say that I had a hand in assisting to establish it. Contributions are made to the fund by the Go%ernr is true that the fund is not called an association, but that is no reason why it should not be treated on the same basis as friendly societies, which have a similar object. The fund makes provision for contingencies that are likely to arise in such a dangerous occupation as that of coal mining. I do not think that there is any desire to save money for the Treasury in this way. I doubt of man who would desire to save a few pounds by shutting out a class on a mere technically. The Act was passed hurriedly It was a well-designed measure, but, of course, we only find out defects after such an Act has been in working order for some time. were discussed at all. were discussed. The desire was to pass the Bill quickly, and the details were not debated. I doubt whether the draftsman realized how the measure would affect such a fund as that which has been mentioned. I have no doubt that if honourable members had been reminded of the existence of this fund in New South Wales an amendment of the Bill would have been proposed to meet the difficulty which has since arisen. I am sure that honourable members of the Labour party, and particularly those representing mining districts, would have seen to that. The provisions of the New South Wales Act which has been referred to were based to some extent upon details which I was able to supply from myexperience, and as one who for very many years was associated with miners and Labour organizations generally, I should certainly have taken some action in the matter had I remembered the existence of this fund inNew South Wales. I was astounded when the honourable member for Newcastle brought under my notice the interpretation We have frequently had put upon the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act in this respect. I am not going to say that the Attorney-General is not right in his interpretation. The probability is that the honourable and learned gentleman is right, and in any case we have to be guided by his opinion. In the circumstances the Government should not hesitate to propose the necessary amendment of the law.

Those who have read of the conditions under which miners have to carry on their occupation at Bendigo and other places in the Commonwealth, who know how unhealthy the occupation is, and that young men working in mines frequently suffer and die from miners' complaint, will agree that there, is no class in the community more deserving of consideration. I hope that the Government will at once announce their intention to proceed with an amendment of the law. Now is the time to deal with the matter, and give satisfaction to a large section in the community who, unfortunately, because of this interpretation of the law, are shut out from the benefits it was intended to confer. They believe that they are suffering an injustice forwhich Parliament must be held responsible as long as the injustice continues, and the Government, having in their hands the conduct of the business of Parliament, must shoulder the responsibility for any delay in remedying the defect which has been pointed out. very glad that the honourable member for Newcastle has brought this matter under the attention of the House.

I believe that what has transpired adds force to the contention which I have emphasized more than once in this House, that if the operation of an Old-age Pensions Act is to be satisfactory its application must be'universal. Every one in the community should come under its operation without any disqualification depending upon the ownership of property. I have also been surprised to learn from the Treasurer that the New South Wales Old-age Pensions Act was administered in such a way that any one receiving benefits from the Miners' Accident Relief Fund was held not to be entitled to an old-age pension. as a matter of law. I asked the question to-day, and I am informed that that was the manner in which the Act was administered. At the same time the New South Wales Act was not identical in terms with the Commonwealth Act. learn that the New South Wales Act was administered in that way, because I was a member of the New South Wales Parliament when the Miners' Accident Relief Bill was carried, and I remember that we specially provided in the measure that the receipt of money from the relief fund should not interfere with the right of a miner to compensation in case of accident. It seems strange that the Government of New South Wales should hold that if a person is injured in a mine he can claim compensation from the owner of the mine, although he might be in receipt of benefit from the miners' relief fund, and that at the same time they should hold that if a miner is in receipt of benefit from that fund he is not entitled to an old-age pension. I understand that as Law Officer of the Crown, the Attorney-General is' of opinion that pensions jfcannot legally be paid to persons receiving benefits under the New South Wales Miners' Relief Fund. that, in common with other honourable members who have spoken, some amendment of the law will be passed to overcome the difficulty.

I can assure the Government that if they will which will remove this disqualification, no time will be wasted by honourable members upon this side of the Chamber in discussing it. I am glad that the matter has been brought forward, not only because it affects the miners of New South Wales, .but because it shows how anomalous is the law in regard to the payment of old age pensions. I do not ask the Treasurer to pay any claims made under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act which are outside the law. power to fix the amounts payable under that Act the scope of the law, I hope that the honourable gentleman will see that the Act is sympathetically administered. very humane measure, but it is one which contains anomalies will never be rectified until we provide for the payment of universal old age pensions. date the Government will bring forward an amending measure to meet the case of the coal miners of New South Wales, and to so widen the scope of existing legislation that every person, upon reaching sixty-five years of age, shall receive an old-age pension. Minister of Defence) [3.34]--As one who, with others, originated the legislation in New South Wales to which reference has been made-legislatio n which seems to lay upon the coal miners of that State a disability under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, I sympathize deeply with those who take up a similar attitude to that taken up by the honourable member for Newcastle. But it is a pity that he did not state his case without tilting at the Government. After all, we are bound by the law. vernment was provoked by the taunt of the Treasurer. ought to consider this matter free from prejudice, and absolutely upon its merits. To me, it does seem an anomaly that the contributions of the coal miners of New South Wales should be placed in a different category, so far as the Invalid and If the Crown Law authorities Old-age Pensions Act is concerned, from those made to ordinary friendly societies. Those contributions ought not to lay the miners under a disability-in fact, the introduce an: amending Bill, contrary should be the case.. The menare compelled to make those contributions. To my mind, the anomaly seems to be that while they are compelled by law to provide this beneficial interest for themselves under the Coal Mines Accident Act, they are also compelled as taxpayers to assist in providing funds witb which to pay old-age pensions to other persons who do not labour under a similar disability. The result is that the law bears unequally upon these citizens of the Commonwealth. To tell them that their action in contributing towards an accident fund shall hereafter constitute a disability under the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act, is a poor way of encouraging them. There is, of course, this circumstance to be considered, that It is a the New South Wales Government themselves contribute towards that fund to many anomalies. Those the extent of, I think, one-third. in the nature of State aid. It is made. I hope that at an early because the New South Wales Government receive royalties, and are part proprietors in the business. that. bute one half, the mine-owners a quarter,, and the New South Wales Government a quarter. amount contributed by the men was a third. But the fact that the Government contributes so little makes the claim of the minersall the stronger. The Coal Mines Accident Act was passed with the idea of encouraging them to provide for themselves whenaccident befell them.

J do not see why the coal miners of New South Wales should not be placed in the same category as the members of friendly societies and of other societies of a kindred character. In its very essence the fund to which they contribute is a provident fund. The very genius of the Act under which those contributions are made is to induce them to effect this provident assurance against accidents. scriptions of the miners have almost covered the amount which has been paid to them out of the fund. The other contri-butions are practically held in reserve. derlying the Act. ever the miners receive out of the fund, they first pay into it. I do not know anything about the subtleties of law, but it apsuggested by the honourable member for pears to me that in its very essence, the fund to which these miners contribute is a provident fund. However, I cannot pretend to interpret the legal position. I have no doubt but the Attorney-General has given this matter that careful and patient study which he bestows upon all matters demanding his attention. Knowing his humanitarian instincts we may be quite sure that if he could he would stretch the law a point in favour of the miners. Every one in the House, I believe, holds that opinion of my honourable friend, but, of course, he is bound by the law. I think that the suggestion of the honourable member for Hunter, that this matter should receive the earnest consideration of the Government, is a very proper one, and, on the Prime Minister's return, I shall put the case to him. member make an exemption where a house with a view to seeing whether a remedy was mortgaged?

The contribution to the fund means that so much is taken out of their scanty earnings every year. It seems to me that they are treated very harshly when the contribution is made a disability by the Old-age Pensions Act. If we were to take into account all the matters to which the honourable member for Dalley alluded, it would be necessary to reconstruct the law. It should be borne in mind that the very genius of our legislation is indigence as well as old age. In order to be qualified for a pension, a person must <be not merely old and incapable of work, but also indigent. It has been Barrier that the old-age pension should be made a matter of right, and associated with citizenship rather than with indigence. That is one of those evolutions of the future to which we shall all look forward with great interest. Speaking quite candidly, I should like to see established a great national insurance fund under which every individual would be entitled to receive an amount, because he was a citizen and a contributor. That, no doubt, is the logical outcome of this legislation, and hereafter it may become obligatory upon a Government to bring a scheme of that kind into operation, but that time is not now. The Old-age Pensions Act has to be administered as it stands. At the present time, certain miners are deprived of an old-age pension.

The definition of ""income "" in the Commonwealth Act is in part copied verbatim from the. New South Wales Act, and where it departs from it. must be assumed to do so for a good and sufficient reason. The New South Wales definition is thisAny moneys, valuable consideration, or profits derived or received by any person for his own use or benefit in any year, by any means or from any source, and computed in accordance with the provisions of this Act, and includes personal earnings, but does Dot include any pension payable under this Act, nor any payment by way of sick allowance or funeral benefit from any registered friendly society.

I wish to know why he considers that a State Department differs from an ordinary corporation. If we took away one ot the three contributors-the Stateto the Miners' Accident Relief Fund, the remaining two would constitute such a corporation as would enable any miner benefiting under it to draw an old-age pension without deduction. I think that we should proceed to the amendment of the Act only in the last resort. The Treasury has a traditional dislike to disbursing public money in a liberal fashion.

We all admit that the Act ought to be administered so as to prevent fraud; but when a case has ibeen looked into very closely by the magistrates-and they are generally pretty astute-it is stretching the point too far to reduce a pension, in the way I have described, unless for very good cause. This is only one case of the kind brought under my notice, but it indicates that there may be a great many more; and I plead that the Act should be sympathetically administered. tively small wages ought to be encouraged rather than discouraged in making efforts to provide in some measure for their old age. intended saying something on the matter of old-age pensions on the first item on the notice-paper; but, seeing that, for some reasons, which I do not quite understand, the adjournment of the House has been moved, I shall take the present opportunity. The discussion has taken an interesting, and, I think, instructive turn; and doubtless the Treasurer will have received some very useful suggestions for improvement in the administration of the Act. 1 agree with those who urge that thrift should not be penalized in the way it is under the present measure. A line could easily be drawn between indigence and competency, so that a person, of the required age, and in needful circumstances, should have the advantage of the Act. But the honourable member for Barrier, in his contention that everybody on reaching a certain age should be entitled to draw a pension, has almost reached.the reductio ad. absutdum.' No one will seriously contend that a person with a competency ought to be entitled to draw any supplementary sum from the public funds, though I believe that, if opportunity were given, there are people, with very respectable incomes, who would take advantage of such unusual generosity on the part of the State. fact, I am told by a gentleman who is in a position to gain information, that in Victoria, there are people receiving pensions under the existing Act who are not in such a position that such assistance is a necessity. scheme of pensions ought to be enlarged to include orphans and persons suffering from any infirmity which makes them unable to earn a living. Further, I should make it compulsory on all male adults to contribute to the pension fund until they reach the age of sixty-five. The collection could, I think, be made without much expense, and the price of a couple of beers, or a plug of tobacco in the fortnight, would result in a substantial sum. If any refused to contribute, I would first strike their names off the rolls of voters for both State and Commonwealth. member make them contribute whether they could afford it or not? attempt would be useless in the case of a* man out of employment; and People who earn comparaunder my scheme, men so circumstanced would receive assistance. If any person who was able to contribute refused to do so, I would ultimately make it impossible for him to derive any benefit in his old age. A contributory scheme of the kind would at once lift the pension out of the category of an, ordinary State dole, and make it something that a person could accept without the slightest loss of self-respect, assuming that there are people who hesitate to take the pension under present conditions. I desire particularly to direct attention to the fact that, although there has been some improvement in Western Australia in the rate at which pensions are being granted, the officers are still very much in arrears. A large number of claims have yet to be dealt with, and, as a matter of fact, the percentage is very much higher than in any of the other States. There may be some difficulties owing to the peculiar position of old people in Western Acstralia, who have come from other States, or even from other countries. But, even allowing for that, there is delay which the Treasurer ought to be at pains to obviate, if possible. I am quite sure that the gentleman who has charge of the work in Western Australia is straining every nerve, and, if he errs at all, it is in the direction of the dictates of humanity rather than of strict officialism. There is no fear in my mind In that the failure to give applicants pensions is due to the officials concerned; but there is evidently something wrong. It is just possible that the office is under staffed, or there may be some technical difficulties which the officials have some trouble in My idea is that the overcoming. At any rate, there is the fact that a large number of applicants are still without their pensions. Such a state of affairs should not exist to the degree to which it does exist even in Western Australia. I hope that the Treasurer will try to ascertain where the difficulty lies, and, if possible, to obviate it.",27,Beneficiaries

I urge the Treasurer to look into the matter further, arid get all the claims brought up to date as speedily as possible. ral) [4.22] I shall not detain the House by going into the question of law, because I am sure that honourable members will credit the Department with every desire to approach the construction of a Statute like the Old-age Pensions Act in a liberal spirit. At the same time, the Attorney General is not bound to read into the words of an Act his feelings of philanthropy if he cannot, by a reasonable construction of those words, find an exemption in them. If I were to follow the line of reasoning adopted by my predecessor, the honourable member for West Sydney, I am afraid I should 'not only bring in societies which ought to be within the purport of the Act, but which are not, but also all insurance societies and other bodies that are, perhaps, the source of the income of comparatively rich people. The honourable member asked. me a question, which I preferred not to answer in the Socratic method of question and answer of which he appears to be so fond, as to whether the mere word ""association "" itself, read altogether without regard to the words with which it is collocated, was not the test of this particular exemption. But in the definition of "" income,"" which contains the two exemptions, I have fo read each particular word in the light of the words with which it is in collocation, and, even by a stretch of the imagination with which lawyers are sometimes credited, one cannot read into the word "" association "" in 'that definition a meaning which would bring within it all the mutual insurance companies that can be found throughout Australia. That, however, would be the logical result of adopting the honourable getting member's principle of interpretation. The honourable member for West Sydney also asked whether we ought, under this Act, to assume that a man has this year an income which would debar him from receiving an old-age pension because he had a certain income last year. No such question has been submitted to me as Attorney General for consideration. Primd facie, the fact of a man having an income last year is hot a final test of his having an income this year. the basis of his income this year. only deal with what has come under the notice of my Department. AllI can say at present is that primd facie there is a good deal to be said for the contention of the honourable member for West Sydney. The honourable member for Newcastle urged that it was rather hard to refuse the benefit of the exemption to those receiving payments from the provident fund to which he referred, when Imperial Army or Navy pensioners were not treated in the same way. I did not make any inquiries as to that matter when I was considering the point of law, but afterwards, in considering the question of policy to see whether anything could be done by an amendment of the Act, I asked the question, and was told read evidently did not give the full facts. some mistake, for I have since made inquiries, and I believe the honourable member was under a misapprehension when he -spoke. Shortly put, our Act has not been based upon the New South Wales Act, although the administration in this regard is on the lines of the opinion given in New South Wales. In that State, in regard to the exemption, they stopped at friendly societies. Our Act has been based rather upon the Queensland Act, of which it is an exact copy, and it is very nearly a copy of the Victorian Act. The principle of the Act is, of course, to regard indigence as the test, with two exceptions only, and those two exceptions were put in so as not to discourage thrift; hence the word used is "" provident."" "" Providence,"" as the dictionary shows, is a matter of self help. On the question of policy, a great deal is to be said for amending the Act. I do not think it would cost very much to amend it so as to bring within it those about whom the honourable member for Newcastle is anxious. I wish we had had more help",28,Beneficiaries

It is just as well to be frank, and the reference which has been made to iron workers has led me to suggest to the Minister of Defence, who appears to be in a particularly good humour this afternoon, the matter of the construction of the destrover., Recently the matter has been brought under notice frequently byhonorable members representing Victoria, ancl I have myself asked a question of the Minister on the subject. member for Melbourne Ports got in early, and, about a fortnight ago, managed to introduce a deputation to the Minister of Defence, to remind him that the best place for the construction of the destroyer would be the Newport Railway Workshops. did not extend an invitation to the honourable member for Dalley to accompany him with that deputation. If he had done so, I persuasive language to induce the Minister to believe that there is a .better place at which to build destroyers than even railway workshops. If some consideration is not given to the claims of the place I have in mind in this connection it cannot be expected that I shall continue to be a supporter of the Government. There is a place called the Fitzrov dock in New South Wales, which is owned by the State Government, and in and around that dock are. to be found the largest engineering establishments in the Commonwealth. The Woolwich Engineering Works, in the electorate of the Minister of Defence, parts of the Commonwealth. There are are the largest private engineering works in the Commonwealth, and, perhaps, before the honourable gentleman comes to a decision on this matter, he will see what might be done in his own constituency. Mr J. H . CATTS -The State Government docks should be taken over by the Commonwealth. makes a good suggestion. If the Commonwealth took over the dock at Cockatoo Island, it would be good business, as we have the necessary plant there, and might assemble the parts of the destroyer ourselves building works established in the Commonmore cheaply than could any private firm in the Commonwealth. The Fitzroy dock, I may say, is not in my electorate. It is in the electorate of the honourable member for West Sydney, but the men who work at it live in my electorate. If I had not told honourable members that, some other honourable member would no doubt have done so before the night was over. As we have very properly decided to go in for naval construction, I have thought it well to remind the Minister of Defence of the splendid facilities immediately at hand, to which I have just referred. I am not suggesting that there should be only one naval construction establishment for the whole of the Commonwealth, and that at Sydney. I believe that latei on there should be one The honourable in Melbourne. If it were only for the purpose of effecting necessary repairs, naval workshops must be established at other ports in the Commonwealth. The necessities of the southern coast of Australia will have to be considered as much as those of the eastern and north-eastern coast. In case of accident a vessel should be able to run into the nearest port for repairs. I think that if the Government undertook the work of construction at the dockyard on Cockatoo Island, they would get better reshould probably have used some sults than by giving the work to private firms, though I do not doubt that private firms, like'Mort's dock, and other engineering firms that could be mentioned, could do the work that would require to be done. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports will probably admit that, as I was brought up with, and have always been associated with, iron workers, no member of the House is likely to be better acquainted with them. All the iron workers of the Commonwealth are not resident in either Sydney or Melbourne. To my knowledge there are hundreds of shipbuilders and other highly skilled workers in iron in different hundreds of such men who would be quite capable of undertaking this class of work. There are scores who have had actual experience in naval construction, because most of the iron workers of the Commonwealth have come here from Newcastle-on-Tyne and the Belfast shipbuilding yards. These men could undertake the work of naval construction to-morrow, if the necessary plant were available. I do not contend that there is available in Australia to-day the plant necessary for the construction of iron ships. Such a plant is not available at the Fitzroy dock, or at any other shipwealth. Mr J. H . CATTS -Repairs are effected to warships at the Fitzroy dock. ficient for repairs, but they are not able to carry out naval construction on any large scale.

I admired the last Government for their determination to have one of the destroyers constructed here. Personally I do not know why they should have gone out of Australia for the first two vessels, as models. All that they need have done was to get the plans from the Admiralty. Mr J. H . CATTS -They tried and could not get them. would have extended that courtesy to so important a portion of the Empire? Sir could not get them. ing firms would not part with the plans. There are naval architects who could draw the plans, so that we should merely require to import for a short period the men who are known as "" leading hands."" There are scores of men available in Australia who could do the work after the plans had been drafted. The practice that is generally adopted is to draw on the plates of iron a rough plan to which the shipwrights work, and the "" leading hands "" from the workshops of the Old Country would merely be required to direct them. There are in Australia to-day thousands of good iron operatives, hundreds who have a practical knowledge of this class of work, and scores'who have recently been engaged upon similar work in Scotland and Ireland. I do not pretend for ai moment that my action this afternoon is not promoted by consideration for the interests of my constituents. I make no attempt to conceal the fact that it is. I find that other honorSocialism preached from the Ministerial able members get up early. Only the other day the honourable member for Melbourne Ports introduced a deputation to the Minister of Defence for the purpose of urging upon him that the assembling of the parts of the third torpedo boat destroyer should be undertaken at Williamstown. I do not blame him for his action, but I think thai he might have invited the representatives of other districts who are interested in this work to be present. Had he done so I should have been glad to attend. One would think from reading the Melbourne press that the representatives of New South Wales were anxious to take all Commonwealth work from Victoria. As a matter of .fact there is ample room for the interests of that he would have liked to be present. both States to be studied. In Sydney the necessary, works are already established so that the third destroyer-upo n the arrival of its parts-coul d easily be put together there. The construction of the larger vessels should also be undertaken in Australia, and to that end the Government docks in New South Wales and Victoria should be utilized. The Commonwealth would thus save the profit which would otherwise be made by outside firms. It would merely have to incur the necessary expenditure on plant and to pay the standard rate of wages. We have already had some experience in the construction of a trawler. honourable member may call it. I say that if the Government can undertake any work better than can private enterprise it should undertake it. We have to consider the interests of the taxpayers. It is our duty to guard the public funds, and we shall do that effectually by getting these vessels constructed in the Government workshops. At the opening of this Parliament some honourable members, who avow themselves anti-Socialists, voted in favour of a proposal that provision should be made upon our mail steamers for the carriage of perishable produce. They were not concerned with the question of whether or not their action might be dubbed Socialism. In the same way I see an opportunity to make use of the Government workshops. I hope that the Minister of Defence will consider my remarks as favourably as he did those of the honourable member for Newcastle in reference to old-age pensions.

He has admitted that Socialism, so far as shipbuilding is concerned, is possible in Australia. He also mentioned incidentally that a few days ago I introduced a deputation to the Minister of Defence, which urge"" upon that gentleman the desirableness of having the third torpedo boat destroyer put together at Williamstown, and also of establishing ship-building yards there.

179,Mr Mathews,"Yes, the honorableattend a deputation whose object was to make the advantages of the Williamstown site so very apparent, because being human, he would, I ' assume, have liked to make an interjection or two. There seems to be a general opinion that it is necessary to establish docks for the building of ships. It is true lhat in Sydney the trawler was constructed in a dock, but such a procedure is never adopted by the ship-building nations of the world. In most countries ships are constructed upon slips, and upon their completion are slipped into deep water. The idea that New South Wales is up-to-date in dock accommodation is an absolute fallacy, and I am rather of opinion that the New South Wales Government recognise the fact, because, not long ago, they en. deavoured to make a bargain with the Commonwealth for the purpose of getting rid of their dock. Mr J. H . CATTS -It is the best dock in the Commonwealth. but while I admit that the Fitzroy_ dock is a good one, it is not up-to-date, in addition to which a dock is not necessary for the building of ships. ber seen the Fitzroy dock? sure of seeing it last year. I admit that it is a very good dock In introducing the deputation to which I have referred, I assured the Minister of Defence that its members were not present in any captious spirit, but merely desired to place before him the advantages of a site at Williamstown for a ship-building yard. We all recognise that ships can be built in Sydney harbour, and I see no reason why States, other than New South Wales and Victoria, could not undertake the assembling of the parts of the third torpedo boat destroyer. I am satisfied that we have workers in* Melbourne who, without any instruction from the Old Country, could put them together. But I suppose that the Government of the day wanted to be on sure ground, and therefore took a certain stand. I did not agree with their action, though I did not cavil at it. For many reasons, the site suggested by the deputation I introinto Hobson's Bay? duced is superior to the site in Port Jackson. No site could possibly be better than the Point Gellibrand site, as a strong rocky formation offers great stability, and there is unalienated land to the area of about thirty acres. A ship could be floated immediately into deep water without any possibility of trouble or danger arising. In the Old Country a ship could not be built end on because, if so built, it could not be launched. Therefore, every ship is built diagonally, and when it is launched, there is an arrangement for turning it down stream. No trouble in that direction would arise at Williamstown, because .a ship would be launched into an open harbour. That' is an advantage which no construction yard in Sydney could offer. Again, there is no possibility of a ship-building yard at Point Gellibrand being shelled by an enemy from the open sea. I have no desire to belittle Sydney Harbor, but in view of the fact that large guns will propel a shot for a distance of fifteen miles, honourable members can understand that it would be easy for an enemy to shell a shipbuilding yard in the remotest portion of Sydney Harbor. bourne. expect that my remark would meet with universal approval. Mr J. H . CATTS -Are the forts in Sydney Harbor to be closed ? gun-firing, but I do not think that the honourable member has. An honourable member has tried to point out in rather an ingenious way how a ship is at a disadvantage in comparison with a fort. I do not know whether he is an authority on the subject or not, but common sense tells us that it is harder to hit a moving object than a stationary one. To my mind, forts are placed at a disadvantage as compared with ships. There is no doubt that ships of war could stand outside Port Jackson, and shell any portion' of Sydney. But they could not shell the site at Point Gellibrand, in Hobson's Bay. Mr J. H . CATTS -Why? situated 30 miles from the sea, and there is no gun which can hit an object at that distance. In order to shell a ship-building yard at Williamstown, ships would have to stand off 6 or 7 miles from the Heads. Mr J. H . CATTS -Could they not get tainly if ships could get into Hobson's Bay they could get into Port Jackson. Mr J. H . CATTS -The guns at Port Jackson would not be so defective as those in Hobson's Bay.",34,Dockyards And Iron Sions In N Ew South Wales But Who To

CATTS -They could not get within, range either. father to the thought I cannot blame the honourable member, who represents a Sydney constituency, and is, therefore, impelled to stick up for "" Ma."" The fact that a ship-building yard at Point Gellibrand would be beyond gun fire proves that it must be superior to any ship-building yard in Sydney Harbor. I have always endeavoured to avoid provincialism. admit that, like other members, I have a little provincial feeling running through me I have received numerous communications stream. more provincial feeling in the representatives of New South Wales, more especially in the representatives of Sydney constituencies. afloat Sydney members always look after its interests, and I do not blame them. My opinion is that they have always looked after their capital, and obtained prettv well all that could ibe got, leaving little for any one 'else. to vote for protection. member took a certain stand on the Tariff, and, in my opinion, quite justifiably. When a site is required for a ship-building yard I would be foolish if I did not bring before the House a site which is distinctly superior to any site which the honourable member can find in Sydney Harbor. canoe at Williamstown. there are any canoe builders at Williamstown, but I do know that Melbourne iron workers can do more than the iron workers of Sydney can do. they do more. been constructed in Melbourne than in New South Wales. That assertion cannot be denied. The representatives of the Mother State, no matter to what party they may belong, fight with bulldog tenacity for her supposed rights, even, when none exist. They regard Sydney as entitled to everything. But the time has come when they should be shown that other parts of Australia have claims to consideration from: the Commonwealth Government. Svdney received from the Commonwealth? claimed, generally successfully, that the heads of the navy, the churches, and other organizations) religious and civil, shall live there. In my opinion, Newcastle has facilities which are superior to those of Sydney. As for Hobson's Bay, it is certainly better in this respect, that it is secure from the fire of I an enemy's ships. That is a very great advantage from a naval stand-point.

The intention of the New South Wales Legislature, when the first old-age pensions measure was introduced, was to enable the old people of the State to live, not in affluence, but with some degree of comfort, and what was called an "" economy"" provision was inserted, to induce thrift, so that they might not be entirely dependent on Government assistance. I am sorry that the Treasurer, who administers the Old-age Pensions Act, is not here, as he should be, to listen to these complaints. I have hardly seen him in the chamber this afternoon. as a placard. That was all the sympathy that he showed. speaking to waste time.

I know that when it was proposed that locomotives should be built at the Government workshops at Eveleigh, all sorts of objections were raised by those who believed that it would be better to have this work done out of the country. A number of the mechanics engaged in the Eveleigh workshops had served their time with Beyer Peacock and Company, of England, and with the Baldwin Company of America, and when the work of locomotive construction was undertaken there it proved so successful that the Government of New South Wales will never revert to the old system of having the locomotives used on its railways constructed by private enterprise. order for locomotives to the Newport workshops ? Mr J. H . CATTS I am not sure, but I know that locomotives are successfully constructed in the Newport workshops. the Baldwin, and ^1,100 cheaper than English locomotives, although higher wages are paid in their construction.

It has been found that after running them for a little beyond the necessary trial they have had to be brought into the State workshops to undergo considerable repairs. speaking now of English or of American locomotives ? Mr J. H . CATTS I speak of both English and American locomotives. I see no distinction between the greed of the British capitalist and the American capitalist. They are equally concerned in piling up wealth, and are not too scrupulous as to the means they adopt bad article is a funny way of piling up wealth. Mr J. H. CATTS -It is a funny way, but we know that some manufacturers of foodstuffs, in their endeavour to pile up wealth, do not hesitate to use poisonous in the Act. We could not have a more gredients. That would appear to be a funny way in which to pile up wealth, but the shareholders in private enterprises of the kind do not care how funny the methods of manufacture may be so long as the money comes in. Everything is subordinated to the rapid accumulation of profits. hardly establish a business by building bad engines. Mr J. H . CATTS I do not say whether the policy adopted is a mistaken one or not, but the fact remains that locomotives built by private firms have not been as satisfactory as those built in the Government workshops of either New South Wales or Victoria. The magnificent locomotive which takes our train every Friday afternoon from Melbourne to Albury is a standing testimony to the high character of the work done at the Newport workshops. On the New South Wales side we have to employ two engines to draw a train of the same weight as that which is drawn by a single engine from Melbourne to Albury. ment in favour of Williamstown as against the place mentioned by the honourable member. Mr J. H . CATTS -The building of locomotives is a totally different thing from offered to assemble the parts of the destroyers. Mr J. H . CATTS I was glad to notice that the anti-Socialist Government of Victoria were prepared to carry out the Socialistic doctrine to such an extent as to offer to assemble the parts of these vessels in the State railway workshops. This only shows how strong the case is for State manufacture as against manufacture by private enterprise. I wish to say a word or two on the subject of old-age pensions. The Government must have been impressed by the fact that so great is the dissatisfaction with the administration of the Act that, although two hours were allowed for the discussion of the motion of adjournment moved by the honourable member for Newcastle, quite a number of honourable members who desired to speak upon it were unable to do so in the time allotted. I have no doubt as to the chief cause for this dissatisfaction.

I remember that when the Invalid and Old age Pensions Bill was under consideration, and Labour members, including myself, desired to eliminate some of the clauses under which this unsympathetic administration has been possible, we witnessed the nervous excitement of the Treasurer in his opposition to every attempt to liberalize the measure. I say emphatically that we cannot hope to have a sympathetic administration of this and similar Acts until we have a Labour Government in power. Conservative Governments have passed legislation of this kind only, so to speak, at the point of the bayonet and in obedience to an almost universal public clamour. But what they have given with one hand they have taken away with the other by their unsympathetic administration. cided what the amount of an old-age pension should be, the Government have sought to limit the benefits of the Act by taking away so much for one reason and so much for another, until their action has given rise a number of things. But the Government to the objections which have been continually urged in this House since the present Treasurer has had the administration of the law. member in favour of giving a pension to a coloured native of Jamaica? Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member is aware that when that particular question was being considered I not only supported an amendment to give a pension to every naturalized citizen of the Commonwealth regardless of his colour, but I voted for the amendment when the opportunity offered. The honourable member spoke in favour of it, but the moment the party whip was cracked he voted against his convictions. Only a little while ago he wrote a scathing article to the Sydney Daily Telegraph in condemnation of the Fusion and the way in which its members had abandoned their pledges. Similarly he condemned the Fusion upon the floor of this chamber, but the moment the Government were in danger he ran to their assistance. Why? Because he is bound and gagged. Despite all his prating upon the public platform about freedom, despite his protestations of sympathy with the working classes, despite his avowals that he is as good as a Labour man, the moment the party whip is cracked and the cry "" Government in danger "" is raised, he deserts his professed principles. I have no doubt that his actions will duly impress his constituents and that at the next election a representative will be returned in his stead who is pledged to a definite programme, and who will be loyal to that programme. party to which the honourable member belongs will not withdraw its candidate. . Mr J. H . CATTS -The honourable member will discover that the electors will not trouble themselves so much about men as they will about measures. They have been too long fooled by men who proclaim themselves jolly good fellows. They want something more than jolly good fellowship. They require the sympathetic administration of our laws. The honourable member talks about what the Government have done Parliament having deancl what they ought to do, but they know perfectly well that his teeth are drawn and that there is no bite in him. All his barking is of no account/ He has been grumbling like a bear with a sore head about take no heed of his grumbling. They know that when the whip is cracked, he will vote submissively with them. When I was interrupted, I was pointing out that in my opinion the Treasurer is a most unsympathetic administrator of the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act. When that measure was under consideration in this House, clause 17 provided that a claimant for an old-age pension must be unable to maintain himself or herself. At my instance paragraph g of that clause, which contained this embargo, was eliminated. The Treasurer was absent at the time, and I well remember his troubled countenance when he entered the House next morning and learned of what had taken place. Upon page 1239 of Hansard, of 4th June, 1908, he is thus reportedYesterday, whilst I was absent from the chamber, an amendment was madeI understand, with the concurrence of the Attorney-Generalin the Old-age Pensions Bill. I desire to know whether the omission of the words in clause 17, providing that an old-age pension shall not be paid unless an applicant is unable to maintain himself. I have no desire to argue the question At this stage Mr Speaker intervened, and the Treasurer then asked whether, when the Bill had been passed by another place, he would be in order in again referring to the matter. He indicated that when the measure was returned to this House, he would endeavour to have the provision which had been excised by the Committee",42,William Lyne Parliamen T Would Have Nothing Whatever To Do

CATTS I have quoted a case in which the valuation of a property was fixed at 50 per cent, more than the amount which was accepted by the .State. Of course, I have no proof to submit to the House, but I conclude that, as the result of instructions issued to officers, the Act is being administered most technically. Sir honourable member have the Act administered ? Mr J. H . CATTS -It should be administered sympathetically rather than harshly, technically, and niggardly.

Let me state the case of more sympathetic the better it will be for a blind man who is over the age prescribed. the poor old people of Australia. His wife is dead, but before he applied for a pension she kept a little grocer's shop. When the authorities were winding up her estate, they could not make the books stated that the officers administering the balance, and they assumed that the blind old-age pensions law were appointed by the widower, who has not a penny in the world, Fisher Government. I do not know knew what had become of the moneys which could not be accounted or, whereas r he knew nothing about the matter at all. I brought the case under the notice of the Department, and was told a good while ago that the matter would receive consideration. What chance has a blind man of fighting an appeal ? If the officers are free to deal with cases sympathetically, I cannot understand why they are not authorized to display more sympathy. JOHN FORREST -Ho w would the man have a pension from the State? Mr J. H . CATTS I do not know whether he had one or not; but that is not the point. The deductions which have been made from pensions seem to me wholly unjustifiable. Is it not the height of absurdity to call upon a blind man to account for something which occurred in connection with the estate of his deceased wife, and about which he knows exactly nothing? This is not the first ocber has had a very good innings. Mr J. H . CATTS I was returned to this House to see, so far as I am able, that justice is done to my constituents. I cannot do more than my best. I have used my best endeavours with the Department to get their grievances redressed. I am bringing them before the Treasurer as intelligently as I can. My next duty will be to advise the electors not only in Cook, but in other constituencies to return Labour men, so that we may have a decent administration of laws which affect old people.

268,Sir John Forrest,"I have not givenwhether he suggests that they have failed to do their duty. In my opinion, the origin of the trouble is at a higher source. But were the Fisher Ministry still in power, those officers would be promptly replaced by others, should it be found that their administration was contrary to the intentions of Parliament. I make no charge against them; the responsibility rests with the Minister. He should give instructions that the old people of Australia must be treated more sympathetically in the future than they have been in the past. I have mentioned several instances in which fault has been found with the manner in which the Minister, or some of his officers, has used the discretion given under the Act. I have referred to the case of a blind man who was being supported by his wife by means of a small grocer's shop. The wife died suddenly, intestate, leaving her estate heavily encumbered with debts. Because the Curator of Intestate Estates is unable to trace certain moneys, the responsibility of accounting for them has been placed on the widower, who is an applicant for a pension. Surely officers should be invited to go out of their way to help applicants, rather than induced to put obstacles in their way. These old persons come to members of Parliament with their applications, and' we often have to go to their private residences, where, by dealing with their cases in a spirit of sympathy, Ave are able to set right the mistakes they have made in filling in their claims. Why cannot the officers of the Department act simideserves. I desire to mention another case larly ? Members of Parliament should not be called upon to do clerical work of this kind when there, are officers to do it. If , as has been suggested, the Department is short-handed, and the clerks cannot overtake the arrears, even by working late at night, assistance should be given. Mine is a densely populated constituency, containing over 30,000 electors, and my Saturdays and Mondays, and often, for the greater part, my Sundays, are taken up in attending to matters which should be dealt with by the departmental officers; a member to be engaged in. . Mr J. H . CATTS -Yes; if he can attend to it all. I am glad to be able to do what I can; but when I have been in Melbourne all the week, attending to my constituents' interests, I ought to be allowed to have an occasional Sunday to myself. [127]2 sons cannot get to the pension offices to have their forms filled up there. Mr J. H . CATTS-Thos e who call ore me would be able to go to the pension' officers; but no doubt they find that the oflicers have either not the time or not the inclination to attend to them. The latter cannot be held responsible; but the complaints have been so numerous that the Minister might well bestir himself, and have the grievances remedied. Another case to which I invite attention is that of Mrs. Anderson, Union-street, Newtown, which I brought under the notice of .the Department on the 13th August. On the 17th August, I was informed that further inquiries had been made, since when I have heard nothing, though surely the necessary investigation could have been made in a month. anything? Mr J. H . CATTS,I do not know; but, as I brought the matter under the notice of the Department, I should have been informed had any action been taken. Another case is that of Mrs. Rogers, 73 Wells-street, Newtown, to which I referred on a previous occasion. This old lady is totally incapacitated, has no one to provide for her, and is in every way eligible to receive a pension. Nevertheless, she has experienced considerable difficulty, and owing to technical objections has not yet received the pension which she in regard to which I have received to-day a letter. It is that of a Mr Stewart, of Dickson-street, Newtown. This gentleman interviewed me, and from vvhat I could gather filled in his application papers properly, and .was entitled to a pension. He had children thirty-five and forty years of age, natives of this country; he could prove that they were born here; but he had some difficulty in producing his own certificate of birth. There was no doubt that he was of the required age, but his claim was held up because he was unable to put his hands on the certificate of his birth. He is sixty seven years of age and a fitter in the iron trade; but he is unable to take his place at the bench owing, not only to the loss of several fingers, but to his advanced years. He has had considerable difficulty, however, in connection with his claim.

All these people have been many years in the country, have reared families here, have devoted all their energies to their work, and, owing to the action of Conservative Governments, have been pretty .well exploited throughout their lives. Instead of placing the cost of government upon the shoulders of those best able to bear it, various Conservative Administrations have contrived, by the imposition of indirect taxation, such as the present Government measures are not designed to Government desire to continue, to place most of it upon those least able to bear it. Money has been taken out of the pockets of the workers by taxing necessaries of life instead of imposing taxation upon those whose properties are increased by public energy. ber vote against any portion of the Tariff? Mr J. H . CATTS I voted against every revenue duty, and shall always do so. Unfortunately, when the Tariff was under consideration in this House, those who called themselves Free Traders and believers in direct taxation conspired to pass revenue duties, which would be horne chiefly by the working people, in order to save the rich landlords from their just share of taxation. assisted by a number of Protectionists. Mr J. H . CATTS -That is so. Free Traders and Protectionists who are Conservatives are to be found banded together on the Government side pf the House. When it is a question of putting a fair proportion of the cost of government upon the owners of wealth in the Commonwealth they come together to save the great landlords. I was asked how long I intended to speak to this question, and can only say that I think we might as well be discussing the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act as any of the Government proposals. I know of no Government measure on the business paper that would do anything to help the country. There may be proposals with Democratic titles, but'that is about as much Democracy as we shall obtain from any of the Government propositions. gentleman is simply killing time? Mr J. H . CATTS I am drawing attention to matters of importance. No doubt the Postmaster-General and other Ministers think that questions affecting the administration of the Old-age Pensions Act are of no concern. If the Government had something of greater importance to submit we might in all probability arrange to discuss this matter at some other time. I have no desire to unnecessarily take up the time of the House, but may say in passing that it is not the policy of the Opposition to block the measures which the Government are bringing forward. Believing as I do that the Fusion has been brought about in defiance of election pledges; that the help the majority of the people; that the Government are aiming at Conservative class rule and neglecting the interests of those who have less than enough, I should, if I had my own way, do my best to prevent the passing, of any of the legislation proposed by them.

If the Government had the interests of the people at heart, there would have been a general election months ago, and we should now have had a mandate from the people. As a matter of fact, the Government dare not face the electors, but' are trusting to the short memory of the public, in the hope that, assisted by the daily press, they will float into power again on some good party cry. I may say that I have taken very Httle part in the debates so far. For weeks at a stretch I have sat here without uttering a word; and to-day I have occupied only about an hour; and had I not had some matters of great importance to my constituents to bring forward, I should not have risen. There are one or two matters on which I shall have something to say later, unless I am prevented. through his Minister of Trade and Customs, induced me to give certain votes on the Tariff, on the distinct understanding that correlative proposals for new Protection would be submitted. We now have a Conservative Government with a Conservative following, and the Prime Minister has gone back on that arrangement. been secured from me under false pretences; and if the Government come forward with a scheme of new Protection, and it differs materially from the scheme that I was promised, they will, so far ""as I am concerned, have some difficulty in getting one line of it passed. I turned up Hansard, and showed the Prime Minister where he distinctly promised honourable members that if they gave certain votes on the Tariff, and the new Protection was not afforded, he would give them an opportunity to reconsider those votes. The half-hearted, hotch-potch new Protection which the Government now suggest has absolutely no relation to whatwas then promised. ber expect the Prime Minister to keep his word ? Mr J. H . CATTS I do not; and in the HouseI have told the Prime Minister that, after what has occurred, I cannot accept his word. I represent 30,000 electors; and when the Prime Minister enters into an understanding with me, I expect that understanding to be honouredThe Prime Minister has ' 'jewed ' ' me out of my rights, and I hold that as a bitter grievance against the Government. When the patchwork-quilt new Protection of the Government is proposed, I shall have something more to say; and it will not trouble me if I am charged with wasting time. I have spoken warmly on the subject of old-age pensions, because I think that, whatever our differences may be, the .Treasurer ought to take note of the constant stream of complaints, and see that the administration is such that Federal action shall not be discredited as it now is in New South Wales. There are large numbers in that State who are cursing the day the Federal Government took over the administration of old-age pensions and, although we have our party differences here, I am as jealous as anybody of the opinion which is held of the National Parliament by the rank ancl file of the people. The Treasurer has it in his power to so administer the Act that the old people of Australia, will look to the The Prime Minister, National Parliament with reverence and respect instead of with disgust and abhorrence.

301,Mr Fisher,"1 say that it is not in acthe time. I have been in this Parliament 1 have never known a position similar to that with which we are now faced to arise. I have never heard the order of the business that would follow the negativing of the formal Supply motion challenged. have known the motion to be discussed over and over again, and the universal practice has been to negative the question, ""That the Speaker do now leave the chair,"" and the House has then proceeded with the business next on the paper. I must admit that I find it somewhat difficult to give reasons at this juncture why the House should follow any other than the usual course. In the circumstances I put it to honourable members to say whether it would not be better to follow the ordinary practice rather than to establish a new, and it might be an improper practice in this re? gard. sir, appeal to the Government, as the leaders of the House, to follow the ordinary practice of the House. practice. fence takes that stand I have to ask your ruling, Mr Speaker, as to whether the Treasurer was in order in submitting the motion. Without debating the matter I invite you, sir, to protect the interests of the moved a motion which he did not give minority. We have only you to depend on at the present time. Our Standing Orders, and, as you have admitted, the practice of this Parliament are entirely against what is now being proposed. I appeal to the sense of fairness of honourable members on both sides to say whether they think we should violate the practice of the House in the way now proposed. the practice of the House. perfectly clear that the Treasurer could not have been in order in moving the motion because at the time he moved it there was the question before the House. "" That the Speaker do now leave the chair.' That ques1 tion had been put from the chair, but had not been decided. You, sir, have explained that it was a formal question under cover of which grievances might be discussed. It having been decided by the last division that you should not leave the chair, I submit that there is still before the House the question under cover of which we can go on with the discussion of grievances. If not, what is our position ?' It is this: You, sir, put the question, "" That the Speaker do now leave the chair."" That motion was submitted by a member of the Ministry, or it was not. If it was submitted by a Minister he could not vote I against it, but Ministers have voted against it. That is unanswerable. One of them had moved a motion, and if that were not so, the Minister of Defence could not have moved-' ' That the question be now put,"" because there would have been no question to put. Ministers voted against their own motion, if there was any motion. I say it was not proper to put the question under the circumstances; but the question having been put and carried in the negative, you, sir, remain in the chair, and Ave are entitled to go on with the discussion of the business, and Ministers must find some other way of dealing with the matter. The other way is perfectly clear. They should have voted in the opposite way to that in which they did vote. They should have voted to put you, sir, out of the chair. They could then have moved to get you back into the chair, and have gone on with other business. However, you are in the chair now, and there is nothing before the House but the formal motion-""That the Speaker do now leave the chair."" notice of yesterday, and which does net appear on the business-paper. Standing order No. 108 readsNo member shall, unless it be otherwise specially provided by the Standing Orders, make any motion except in pursuance of notice openly given at a previous sitting of the House andduly entered on the notice-paper.

The position is difficult enough for a new occupant to fill, without his being further confused by the exchange of remarks across the chamber. In reply to the statement of the Minister of Defence, I would point out that we are not dealing with two points of order at once, nor would it' be usual to simultaneously deal with three. But, in order to save time, I thought that it was advisable to allow the Leader of the Opposition to statehis point of order, as he has assured me that it has an important bearing upon the point of order which has been raised. divisions that have taken place during the last few minutes have had the effect of entirely destroying the Committee of Supply.

[8.56] -It seems to me that the mission of the High Commissioner will be a most important one, and that before_he can be properly equipped the Commonwealth ought to open in London a branch of the National Postal Banking System. I was sorry last year that we had to drop the proposal for the acquisition of the building which was selected in Trafalgar Square, away from the financial centre of London, I should like to know whether this clause permits me to discuss the qualifications which the High Commissioner ought to possess, because while I want to examine these matters carefully, I do not desire to break the Standing Orders. interests,"" in paragraph b, the honourable member can get in what he desires to say. have in London an establishment which would enable the High Commissioner to carry out the purposes for which he is appointed. If we had a building such as I suggested here several years ago, it could accommodate the State Agents-General, and then we should not have the spectacle of Agents-General abusing some States while praising their own. When I pick up their reports and see that they only talk of their own little section of Australia, I often ask myself how the Commonwealth will ever attain an exalted financial or commercial position in the world. When one meets a Yankee from any part of the United States -fro m the ice-bound coast of Maine to the golden sands of the Pacific, or from the Arctic snows of the north to the tepid waters of the Gulf of Mexico-h e talks of the United States, not of the little section where he was born. When I pick up the papers and find an Agent-General blowing up Tasmania, an Agent-General blowing up New South Wales, an Agent-General praising Victoria, and an Agent-General praising Western Australia, and none of them praising the Commonwealth, I begin to think that the time has come when we ought to have a representative with national ideasa man with a high order of intellect, possessing financial ability, and appreciating the objects of his mission. Otherwise, we shall have over again the same old muddle that we have ""had for fifty years. for building bridges, and when a bridge wears out, building another bridge out of borrowed money. We shall have no depreciation funds, or anything else. The conduct of the finances of Australia would disgrace a New York Tammany Hall, three-card, bunko-steering monte-man. As I may have the gagapplied to be, I propose to defer my, remarks until other honourable members have had an opportunity to speak. I am anxious to see that the Commonwealth is represented by a man with national ideas; in other words, by a big man, with a big head and something in it. motion for the second reading, some honourable members described the character of the man who was required for the position of High Commissioner, and on this clause we are to have a repetition of what was then said. It has been stated by the honourable member for Darwin that the High Commissioner must be a man of national ideas, and a leading financier. It has also been said that he must be a diplomatista man outside the ordinary run of diplomatists who, we are told, are honest men who lie in other countries. The representative of Australia must not lie in other countries : but he must be an honest diplomatist, and tell the truth .about Australia wherever he goes. These are some of the requisites demanded by honourable members opposite. member has said that the High Commissioner must be an Australian he has said everything. High Commisisoner must possess Australian ideals, but the honourable member for West Sydney has really put the position in a nutshell. The High Commissioner must not only possess Australian ideals, but live up to them when he is in London. The difficulty in Australia is not to find a man who has national ideas of finance, and can be a diplomatist when he is required, but to find a representative who will remain an Australian after he has coquetted with the club life of London. That is my only concern in regard to the requisites for the position. According to paragraph b of this clause, the High Commissioner shallcarry out such instructions as he receives from the Minister respecting the commercial, financial, and general interests of the Commonwealth. I suggested to the honourable member for Darwin by way of interjection that the",52,William Lyne Parliamen T Would Have Nothing Whatever To Do

323,Mr Wilks,"It has been said that the words ""general interests"" would permit him to speak his mind fully, because under cover of those words the Minister can advise the High Commissioner in England. It would be most difficult, not only in Australia, but even in the crowded cities of the Old World to find all the requisite characteristics in one individual at the munificent salary of £3,000 per annum. How are we to get a man who stipulated by the members of the Opposition? Australia is not clogged with patriots who are ready to sacrifice their livelihood in order to take up a position in London at £3>ooo a year. Men of that stamp in Australia are receiving more than that remuneration. I trust that honourable members who are demanding that the High Commissioner shall be a man with national ideals will not forget to vote an ideal salary for the office. The public should be taught that the High Commissionership is the highest post at the disposal of a Ministry. When it learns that, it will be prepared to pay a salary commensurate with the importance of the position. But it requires to be educated in the matter. If not properly advised as to the reputation and character of the man needed to fill this office, it may look upon the salary fixed in the Bill as a high one, and regard any attempt to increase it as extortionate. The High Commissioner should not be appointed because of his friendly relations with Ministers, or for political fidelity in the past. The honourable member for Darwin has described the type of man who is needed. We may not get one who possesses all the qualifications that have been mentioned, but I hope that whoever is appointed will be as nearly as possible the ideal High Commissioner. do not know why the Government has brought forward this Bill again now. It cannot be that it is anxious to appoint a High Commissioner, because as the Senate has adjourned for. a fortnight, even if we pass the Bill, if will have to wait at least that length of time for its consideration elsewhere. As has been pointed out, it matters little what kind of measure we pass if the appointment made under it is bad. Had the Government taken Parliament and the country into its confidence, and made a reasonable proposition, an appointment could have been arranged for within twenty-four hours, but since we do not know who may be appointed, and there is a chance that the position may lie filled to please an ally, .or to placate a toocandid friend, we must scrutinize the measure most carefully. If the provisions of the clause would apply only to men who have qualified for the position it creates,. I would assent to them without further discussion. The clause says "" the High Commissioner shall "" do certain things. He shall do nothing, if I can help it, until I will approach to the ideals know who he will be. orable member should ask to know all his successors as well. does not resemble Alice in Wonderland, but there are characters in Lewis Carroll's immortal work whom he does resemble. He preserves an air of severe detachment from the affairs of this world which I admire, but scarcely wish to emulate. The study of mankind is too attractive to me. I suggest that the clause should be amended to read ""the High Commissioner may"" do certain things, if directed in a certain way. He is to act as representative and resident -agent of the Commonwealth. Those words are surplusage. He will be appointed to act as our representative, but the use of those words cannot make him act in that way. The honourable member for Darwin spoke of the very high and important duties which he will have to perform, but here he is referred to as something a little lower than an Agent-General; he is to be merely a resident agent. The clause has been framed to meet the appointment of such a man as we all agree should not be appointed. He is to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are conferred upon and assigned to him by the Governor General. Clause4 provides that he must carry out the instructions he receives as to the States. Why should he be in the first place instructed by the "" Governor General,"" which means the Executive, and in the next by the "" Minister,"" which means the Minister acting under his cwn powers? No instruction should be given to the High Commissioner except by the Government. He will represent, not a Department or a State, but the whole Commonwealth, and should be instructed, in so far as it is necessary to instruct him, by the Government of the Commonwealth.

326,Mr Hughes,"The Attorney-Generalwho, it is conceivable, would carry out any instructions, or would not even wait for them. The High Commissioner is to act as the representative and resident agent of the Commonwealth in the United Kingdom; but he is to carry out instructions received from the Minister, not only in the United Kingdom, but elsewhere. In the United Kingdom he is to be the representative of the Commonwealth, but outside he is not; yet he is still to carry out the instructions of the Minister. This is a most amazing feat of draftsmanship. I suppose it is useless to ask the Attorney-General whether the Committee is to learn the. mind of the Government in this matter; but I certainly think it ought to. Will the honourable gentleman agree to strike out the word "" Minister"" in paragraph b and to insert in its stead the words "" Governor General,"" so that the Commissioner will have to take his instructions from the Executive, rather than from the Minister? That the word ""Minister,"" paragraph b, be left out with a view to insert in lieu thereof controls. He is the hand. As the duties the words "" Governor General."" No instructions should be given to the High Commissioner by a Minister. They should be given, if at all, by the Government. sioner must be under some Department. tries come and go. It is one of the defects of our present system that a good Government is often brought down by the act of an indiscreet Departmental administrator. In this Department such a man would have wider scope than elsewhere; and he might issue unwise instructions. To my own knowledge, instructions are often given by a Minister without the consent and approval of his colleagues; but under the theory of responsible government, all Ministers are responsible for the acts of one of their number. would make .all instructions a Cabinet matter? to understand why the Minister will not accept my amendment. have instructions given through the responsible Minister. this is a unique occasion. We propose to have a representative of the Commonwealth in England, and that representative ought to receive instructions from the Ministry rather than from a Minister. ral) [9.21] I am sure that the honourable member for West Sydney is as anxious as the Government are to make the Bill perfect. The office of High Commissioner is a very dignified one, and it would be a pity if we were, in all cases, to tie the hands of the Government in relation to instructions to an officer of such high importance, having a multiplicity of duties to perform, while in connection with Agents General, instructions may be sent through a Minister. think that the responsible Minister would send any important instructions to the High Commissioner without consulting the Cabinet? theory of Cabinet responsibility applies to the acts of Ministers, but a Minister is appointed to control those officers who are associated directly with the Department he of this office grow, it may be necessary to cable instructions to the High Commissioner half a dozen 'times a day. If on every occasion that we had to send specific instructions it was necessary first of all to convene a meeting of the Cabinet, it would be almost impossible for the Commissioner to carry out his duties with that expedition which modern commercial transactions require. I do not wish to reason a matter which seems self-evident, but would point out that authority goes in the direction we have taken. We follow, to some extent in expression, and, altogether, in effect, the New Zealand Act, which prescribes, as this Bill does, that the duties of the High Commissionerwhich are important, and are laid down practically once and for all-ar e to be prescribed by the Cabinet, or. as in our case, by the Governor General in Council. The actual operations of the Commissioner under the powers vested in him must be controlled to some extent by his own discretion, but if by any one from this side of the world, by the Minister in charge of the responsible Department. In the New Zealand Act, we have the declaration that the High Commissioner shall exercise such powers, and perform such duties, as are assigned to him by the Government. Then, under paragraph b of the same section, he is to carry out such instructions as he receives from the Government, which, of",54,William Lyne Parliamen T Would Have Nothing Whatever To Do

If the honourable member will look into the New Zealand Act, he will see that there must have been some reason for adopting this principle. The honourable member jocosely pointed out that in this case there was an error of drafting. graph b of the section of the New Zealand Act to which the honourable member has just referred is what I want embodied in this Bill. the Governor General in Council. The word "" Government "" is used in some cases to mean the Minister, and in some cases to mean the Government; and in Canada the same principle applies, and it is the Minister who gives the instruction; one is merely a generic term to cover the particular person. will see the distinction between the Governor General in Council and the Government, the latter merely meaning whatever member of the Government may administer the Act. The honourable member referred to what he called an error in the drafting of paragraph a; but there is no error. The ""High Commissioner is to act as the "" representative and the resident agent for the Commonwealth in the United Kingdom"" ; and, of course, he is not to act as the representative and resident agent on the Continent. But, while his place of residence and agency is the United Kingdom, his duties are not confined to the United Kingdom, but may carry him elsewhere; and hence the drafting is correct. the honourable member, but whether jocoselv or seriously I do not know. The honourable memlier said he was rather loath to vote for this clause-owing , I suppose, to what he thought the great responsibility to be vested in the High 'Commissioner-unles s honourable members were told who the High Commissioner was to be. does not like to invest such powers and duties in a man of whose qualifications and policy he is ignorant. If that be the objection, the honourable member should oppose the Bill, because, to be satisfied, he be part of the official duties of this officer. ought to know the line of successors, including, perhaps, people yet unborn, who are to be High Commissioners. It would be against all Parliamentary practice to insay that he had not the time, in conseferential ly affect the discretion of honorquence, to attend to other more important able members by naming in the Bill a particular person to be the first to hold the office, even if Ministers knew who he was-; and I may say that, up to the present, my ignorance on the matter is quite profound. General say that the man is yet unborn whom we are going to appoint? think that the honourable member was merely playing with the subject. knows that the man who is going to get the office was born a good while ago! ignorance as to the person to be appointed is profound; and, at, all events, it would be most injudicious, to put it mildly, even if the Ministry had a suitable person for the office of High Commissioner in their mind, to put his name in the Bill. Such a thing has never been done; The honourable member and, besides, it would be against the spirit of the Constitution, especially if , as is suggested, the person were a member of the House, for then there would be a constitutional objection.

The Agents-General, in their report, make a strong point of the social business; and, after a reference to certain other duties, state that the High Commissioner willin addition perform such social duties as would naturally fall to a high official. Further on the report statesSome allowance would have to be made to the High Commissioner to enable him to discharge the social duties of his office, for living in London is inordinately expensive, and there' are many demands oh the hospitality of Australian officials. I do not think that the High Commissioner ought to be called on to provide a free table for persons visiting London. I desire to see him dealing with serious business ; and I hope that his duties will be set forth at the discretion of the Government. If the High Commissioner desires fo entertain his friends or himself, he should be at perfect liberty to do so in his own time.' 1'he next paragraph requires the High Commissioner to perform certain functions and duties for the States. That would seem to pre-suppose that the High Commissioner will take the place of the Agents General. There is a strong consensus of opinion that since Federation there should have been a diminution instead of a multiplication of the number of public officials, aiid we ought to have a statement from the Government as to whether the High Commissioner is to be an addition to the representatives of Australia in London, or whether the number already there is to be reduced. If the State Agents General are to carry on their present work, the duties of the Commonwealth representative will be of a very, meagre .character. If all the Agents General could be withdrawn and one office established to* represent the Commonwealth as a whole, there would, perhaps, be some advantage to the people in appointing a High Commissioner, but there is no indication that that will happen.

357,Mr Wilks (Dalley) [9.47],"The honExcellency shows his astuteness in avoiding social engagements whenever he can. The difficulty is to get him to go to any of them. I should not blame him if he refused more than he does. But there are certain social functions in London which the High Commissioner will have to attend in the interest of the Commonwealth. He will have to entertain as well as be entertained. It is absurd to put in the Bill a stipulation regarding the social duties of the officer. He will not be able to accept invitations without himself giving entertainments ; and when he gives them they will not have to be three-courses-for-a-shilling feasts. I can' understand the honourable member being afraid of public money being wasted on banquets. We certainly do not want to make this a rich man's post. But the honourable member for Cook, having ventilated the view naturally entertained by some people, might very well withdraw his amendment. He may be satisfied that the person appointed to be High Commissioner will desire to live for a few years. He will not be so young a man as to be anxious to be continually attending banquets. We all know, as public men, that even in our own little way we do not, if we are at all wise, accept every invitation that is extended to us. We show our wisdom in the number of invitations that we refuse. Jf there is one time more than another when a public man is uncomfortable, it is when he is at a banquet. The honourable member should withdraw his amendment, being satisfied that the type of man likely to be selected will not go the lengths that some people seem to fear. I had not an opportunity of speaking oil this Bill.on the motion for the second reading. Now that we are discussing vvhat the duties of the High Commissioner should be, I do not know whether I shall be in order in referring to the qualities which the Commonwealth representative should possess. In the first place, I . venture to express the hope that the High Commissioner will possess all the abilities and qualifications that we should like to see in a matter would have been considered man occupying such an office. I hope that he will be thoroughly Australian in sentiment and aspiration, and will worthily represent the Commonwealth at the centre of the Empire. I have heard the name of the right honourable member for East Sydney mentioned as the man likelv to be appointed. I am free to admit that'if the Government saw their way to secure the services of"" the late leader of the Opposition, I , for one, should raise no objection to the appointment. I believe that the Commonwealth would find displayed by that right honourable member, not only all the ability that we are looking for, but that he would also be an exponent of the true Australian sentiment while holding this high and important position. But what .1 am chiefly anxious about is that our High Commissioner shall be armed with such powers and functions as will enable him to be a true representative of Australia in London. Indeed, he "" should discharge the whole of the functions that are now being exercised by the representatives of the six States. 1 hoped that this matter would be discussed at the Premiers' Confeience, and that some understanding would be arrived at which would enable the Government to come to Parliament and intimate the extent of the functions to be discharged by the High Commissioner whom it is proposed to appoint. Unless something of the kind is done, we shall be constituting an office that no doubt will be desirable, but the value of which will be largely detracted from by the fact that the High Commissioner will be only one of seven claiming to represent Australia. We shall thus be repeating one of the least desirable of the features to be met with in our public life, the States claiming equal powers with the Federation in many respects, and being jealous of the exercise of the powers vested in the Commonwealth. We do not want a repetition of that kind of thing in connection with our representation in the Mother Country. I hope that an effort will be made to secure in London an Australian representative in the widest possible sense, and not an official who will be merely one of seven contending Australian representatives. The Commonwealth must, of course, make a move in the matter before we can ask the State Governments to agree to merge their representation in London into that of the Commonwealth. As I have said, I had hoped that the at the Premier's Conference, and that the Government would be in a position to indicate to the Committee the extent to which we are likely to realize the purpose of this Bill. If the attitude of the State Premiers is such that the High Commissioner vvill be only one of seven Australian representatives in London, we must consider",58,William Lyne Parliamen T Would Have Nothing Whatever To Do
358,Mr Thomas Brown (Calare) [9.50].,"whether we should be justified in spending on this important office the amount of money which we might reasonably expend if the High Commissioner were to be really a representative of Australia. The matter is one which closely affects the interests of the. taxpayers of the Commonwealth. As reports show, and as might readily be understood without any reports, 'under the existing system of State representation in London, much of the work is duplicated. So far each State Government has been acting independently. They have been concerned only with the representation of their own State, and have had nothing to do with the action taken by the representatives of other States. This has involved duplication, increased expenditure, and considerable friction between State and State, conditions which might be removed by the appointment of a High Commissioner .to represent the States as well as the Commonwealth. of the matter should be pressed home to the State Premiers, and finally to the masters of State and Commonwealth Government's, the taxpayers who will have to pay for the representation of Australia in London. I have no desire to debate the matter at great length. I am not hostile to this measure. If the lines I have indicated are followed, I shall be prepared to assist the passage of the Bill. I do say, however, that when the Bill is passed, the Government should be in a position to take the necessary steps to appoint the High Commissioner, so that Parliament may know who is to be our representative in London. I understand that in discussing that matter, I am going beyond the limit of the debate, but I hope the Government will recognise the wisdom of the suggestion I have made. I hold it to be our duty to pay to the High Commissioner such a salary as will enable us to command the services of a man of ability and patriotism, who will do credit to this high office, no matter what his financial position may be. This office should not be considered as a perquisite of wealthy men in our community. It should be open to the best talent we can secure, but if we are to command the services of such a representative as I have described, the salary set down .in this Bill is, in my opinion, quite inadequate. amendment proposed by the honourable member for Cook, I think that the man fitted for this position would not dream of considering himself merely a social functionary. If we get the right man, we need not be afraid of anything of the kind. Of course, if we get the wrong man, if we appoint as High Commissioner a man who cannot rise above mere social functions, there will be some danger that what the honourable member for Cook fears will take place. There will be nothing to prevent the High Commissioner spending his own means in this way. I recognise that these social functions may be utilized as an important advertising medium. They might be made use of as a means of bringing Australian sentiments and views not merely before the English' people, but before the world. I ask honourable members to recall the reports we have received of some of these functions, and they will acknowledge that we have derived a great deal of information about Canada from the utterances of the Canadian High Commissioner at gatherings'of this kind. What we have to do is to appoint the right man, This view and trust to his discretion and judgment in this matter. excellent points the honourable member for Calare has made as to the selection of the best man, and the necessity of providing a salary which will secure the appointment of a representative Australian, whatever may be his private circumstances, have nothing to do with the amendment before the Committee, which is intended to prevent the High Commissioner from attending any function of a purely social nature. Mr J. H . CATTS -Certainly not to prevent him; he can do what he likes in his own time. able friends opposite that inasmuch as the Government are bound to endeavour to pass this Bill this evening, it might be as well if they devoted the time that we have at our disposal to the consideration of the more important questions involved in it. member say ? honourable member for Cook, who, having delivered his bombshell, is now immersed in the pages of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, that in the interests of the proper discussion of this Bill he should withdraw his amendment.

402,Motion (By Mr Hughes) Put,"hereinbefore described and similar to those now discharged by the Agents-General of the States, and shall perform the same without discrimination or preference, or to the advantage or disthe complete control of thefinancesof both advantage of any State as regards another State. States and Commonwealth, so far as bor-It is very desirable that the High Commissioner shall be the sole representative of the Commonwealth; and, in so far as the functions performed by the Agents-General are those which, in the aggregate, can be performed by a High Commissioner, it is entirely proper that the latter should perform them. But there are some duties performed by the Agents-General which are more in the nature of commercial agency business; and these, I submit, the High Commissioner could not effectively or even properly undertake. I doubt very much whether the States would consult their interests best by asking him to perform them. What vvill very likely happen is that the Agents-General, as we know them, will disappear, and in their place will be a High Commissioner, plus a commercial agent for .each State. It nowhere says in the clause, that it is the intention to limit the duties of the High Commissioner to those of the character I have indicated, and which are now performed by the Agents-General; and if the purpose of the clause is merely to empower the High Commissioner to do that which he-could do without this authorization, if the States so requested, I do not see that it is of any use. States and of the Commonwealth may be opposed in some particulars. stance, if both the Commonwealth and the States go on the London market to borrow, 'it may be that their interests will so clash that those of the Commonwealth cannot be served by an agent who represents both it and the States. conceive that it would be in the last degree disastrous to the financial standing of the Commonwealth if loans should be placed on the market by the Commonwealth and the States at the same time; and in such case, I do not see how one man could serve two masters. Since the Government do not propose to do that which is obviously right and proper, namely, sever the financial arrangements completely, we must contemplate such a position; and clause 5, as drawn, is not at all satisfactory. I was not permitted to move to exempt from the instructions in clause 4 those relating to finance; but the instructions of that nature referred to in clause 5 ought not to be carried out by the High Commissioner unless and until there has been handed over to the Commonwealth rowing operations on the British market are concerned. I do not see any prospect of usefully moving an amendment in the clause; indeed, an amendment could hardly be made in the clause as drawn. Perhaps the Minister will consent to such an amendment as would make the clause declaratory, because that is all it is in any case. It does not empower us to do anything we could not otherwise do, because we have ample power in the Constitution to authorize the High Commissioner to do anything we wish to which the States consent. In regard tofinance,there should be a clear understanding that, under no set of circumstances, until the complete control is in the hands of the Commonwealth, shall the High Commissioner be asked to perform those duties. If the clause is pressed in its present form, I shall be compelled to vote against it. [10..51] I think we are protected against any such disability as that referred to by the honourable member for West Sydney, seeing that the High Commissioner has to carry out such instructions as he receives from the Minister, in accordance with clause 4, and that clause 5 opens with the words "" SubThe financial interests of the ject to the provisions of the last preceding section."" I , and others, have fallen into For in the same error; but the Minister will see that the interests of the States and Commonwealth do not clash, and will give his instructions accordingly. I can The States may desire certain work to be done through the High Commissioner; and though the clause may be to a certain extent surplusage, it conveys the necessary power to the High Commissioner under the Minister. agree with the honourable member for Corio that the clause is not merely only declaratory, but is surplusage. To be of any value, the clause should prescribe a penalty of, say, ;£ioo for any neglect to perform the duties, because that is the only way to make sense out of a provision of the kind. The High Commissioner is appointed under an Act subject to the Governor General in Council, which means the Minister, so that clause",63,William Lyne Th E Honourable Forrest Sir John Storrer D

Read it again and again, and you will find that it contains nothing. It gives no larger powers. It is simply a string of platitudes. Every man appointed to such a position ought to be, and will be capable of performing those duties. No one could sav that the High Commissioner would differentiate between the interests of the Commonwealth and the States. this opportunity of reminding honourable members that the present Agents-General consider it part of their duty to extol their own States and reflect on other States. I made a number of quotations in the speech I delivered at Gympie to showwhat the Agents-General had been doing in that direction. If the Government want to lay down the functions of the High Commissioner, they should say that he must not speak in disparagement of anv State, but it is unnecessary to encumber the Bill with little directions of that kind. The duties might be denned in the Bill as briefly as possible, leaving it to the Government to say from time to time what they should be. a larger question. missioner will hold his office for a fixed period at a fixed salary, I see nothing in the Bill to enable the Government to remove or recall him if he carries out his duties in an unsatisfactory way. capacity "" under sub-clause 2 of clause 3? covers it.

I ' do not think that failure to perform a duty, or dilatorithat the States will come in and utilize this ness, or-wha t is equally grave-the giving vent by the High Commissioner to his own political views contrary to the views of the people of Australia, would amount to sume that the States will withdraw their "" misbehaviour."" by Parliament comes in. be necessary? It would be far better to A declaratory give the Government power over the High Commissioner, subject to any action of theirs in that direction being dealt with by Parliament immediately. After all, the more we endeavour to entrench an officer of this kind, the less effective he becomes. The High Commissioner is not in the position of an ordinary Commissioner of Railways. He should be there at the direction of the Ministry to carry out the policy of the Ministry for the time being. We do not want a man appointed for a number I take of years, and so entrenched in his position by this Bill as to be able to give vent to opinions that are contrary to the wishes of the Parliament and Government of the day. That would be an obvious mistake, and I should be very sorry if any gentleman were intrusted with such powers. of External Affairs) [n.i]--This clause is not only necessary, but highly desirable. The honourable member for West Sydney objects to it, first, on the ground that there may be some conflict. As the honourable member for Robertson pointed out, the whole of the clause, with a view to preventing conflict, is subject to the precedThis raises ing clause. By that the High 'CommisAs the High Comsioner performs his duties upon all occasions subject to the instructions of the Minister. If there were any possibility of conflict in financial or other matters, the Minister's complete control would prevent it, and the Government of the day would issue their instructions accordingly. It is advisable to retain the clause, because' we want to declare to the States the relations that we are prepared to enter into with them for the purpose of the carrying out of these duties. It is therefore necessary to state in clear, plain, and unmistakable language what we are ready to do in that regard. We tell the States in this clause that the High Commissioner may perform for them "" functions and duties similar to those hereinbefore described and similar to those now discharged by the Agents-General of the States.""

416,Mr Groom,"Judging by the tone ofI am of opinion that they will take advantage of this office. Agents-General? ably keep commercial agents in London, as the honourable member for West Sydney said, but the wisdom of having even commercial agents representing the different States has been questioned by eminent authorities. It is right that this Parliament should state clearly and unmistakablythat we are prepared to carry out work for the States if they so desire. But, as the honourable member for Robertson very properly pointed out, in order to prevent clashing, to preserve control, and to obviate conflict between State and State, the whole matter will be subject to Ministerial direction. withstanding what the Minister of External Affairs has said, it seems that this clause is covered by the preceding one. You cannot get anything broader, stronger, or more emphatic than the language of paragraph b of the preceding clause. According to that, the High Commissioner must carry out the instructions he receives from the Minister concerning certain specified interests of the States. It is not necessary to declare it again. If it is necessary, and the Government intend to retain this clause, I propose to move an amendment to the following effectThat after the word "" States,"" line 6, the words "" and with the consent of the Government of the Commonwealth"" be inserted. I shall move that amendment if this clause is not governed by clause 4. If the clause is governed by clase 4, the amendment is unnecessary. said previously that it was quite unnecessary to define the High Commissioner's duties so elaborately. Since then I have looked up the Canadian Act, and find that Canada followed exactly the ideas that I expressed. same. In Canada they had a number of Provincial Agents. ments of Canada were, comparatively speaking, as strong as the Parliaments of the States of Australia were when we federated. The Canadian Provinces had their commercial agents in London. ""What's in a name?"" Our Agents-General would be quite as important officials, even though we called them commercial agents. the slightest idea of business. misses the point. Although the commercial agents of the Canadian Provinces were more strictly commercial men than our Agents-General are, they were, nevertheless, the representatives of the Provinces. Let us look at the Canadian Act under which the High Commissioner is appointed. It consists simply of three sections. The first one is formal. The second section is so short lhat I will read it. 2. The High Commissioner shall(1) act as representative and resident agent of Canada in the United Kingdom, and in that capacity execute such powers and perform such duties as are, from time to time, conferred upon and assigned to him by the Governor in Council; How clear and direct that is. The remaining provisions of the Canadian Act are(2) take the charge, supervision, and control of the immigration offices and agencies in the United Kingdom under the Minister of Agriculture; (3) carry out such instructions as he, from time to time, receives from the Governor in Council respecting the commercial, financial, and general interests of Canada in the United Kingdom and elsewhere. 3. The High Commissioner shall receive a salary of not more than $10,000 per annum, and the same shall be payable out of any unappropriated money, forming part of the consolidated revenue fund of Canada. Instead of a short, simple measure, setting out the duties of the High Commissioner, as the Canadian Act does, we have a long Bill' containing a number of details as to what the High Commissioner is to do. In my opinion, the power of the Ministry is' limited by these numerous directions, which may have the very opposite effect from what is intended. I think that it would be a mistake to retain the clause in the Bill. During the absence of a State Agent-General, or during a vacancy, the High Commissioner might have to act as the representative of a State. Suppose that a State wished to put a loan on the market. Does any one think that the State Government would allow the Commonwealth Minister of External Affairs to exercise a voice as to how the loan should be floated?

425,Mr Agar Wynne (Balaclava) [11.8].,"High Commissioner acts for a State, he will have to obey the State Government, just as if he were the officer of the State. Under this Bill he will occupy a dual position, and I am afraid that friction and jealousy will be created. Suppose that two States wished to put a loan on the market at the same time. If the High Commissioner acted for one State and an Agent-General for another, this clause would give fhe High Commissioner authority to write to the Minister of External Affairs, asking him for permission to place the loan on the market on behalf of the State for which he was acting If the Commonwealth is going to have an oflicer in London, I doubt whether the States would be wise in allowing him to act for them; and if lie does, he will not act as their agent, but will be under the control of the Commonwealth Minister. I trust that the clause will be withdrawn from the Bill. that the Government will not withdraw the clause. The Bill requires a provision of the kind. I believe that it is necessary for the Commonwealth to have a representative in London, and I also believe that he will have to perform functions for the State. When I was a member of the Tasmanian Parliament, about six years ago, I remember a debate with reference to the Agent General. It was said that he should be appointed only for twelve months, because it was exceedingly probable that the Commonwealth would appoint a High Commissioner, who would then be able to act for Tasmania. If that was the opinion of a State Parliament six years ago, I do not think it likely to have been altered in the meantime. The States will be willing to fall in with any arrangement made by the Commonwealth. I do not think that the amendment suggested by the honourable member for Gippsland is necessary. The Bill itself uses the words "" subject to the provisions of the last preceding section."" The High Commissioner will always act under the control of the Commonwealth. Federal Government to work on the same lines as a business man would follow under such circumstances. We should have one principal man to represent Australia in London, and a number of business men to look after the interests of particular branches. The States and the Commonwealth should establish a uniformity of interests in matters of this kind, and we should not have regard to particular geographical boundaries. The Agents-General of the States have done good work in the past, but many of their functions will in future be discharged by the High Commissioner. I trust that the clause will be passed, in order that the States may see that they will be able to utilize the services of this officer, and that the Commonwealth is willing to work in unison with the States in reference to the matter. of External Affairs) [11.14] -This clause was inserted in the Bill deliberately, in order to enable the Committee to decide whether the States should be afforded the means of direct communication with the High Commissioner, subject, of course, to the permission of the Commonwealth Government. for that ? I trust directly stated in that clause, under which the High Commissioner can only carry out anything subject to the instructions of the Government. This clause was intended to declare in statutory form that the States would have the right to utilize the services of the High Commissioner. clause 5 which could not be exercised under clause 4? direct declaration. We thought it best to let the States know the exact position. The matter is, however, one upon which the Committee may express an opinion.

The honourable member for Wide Bay, amongst others, has sometimes complained that our Statutes do not clearly set out all that is intended. The complaint has frequently been made that in drafting Bills too much is left to regulation. The desire of the Government in introducing this clause was to bring this matter distinctly before honourable members.",66,William Lyne Th E Honourable Forrest Sir John Storrer D

Our desire was to make what is proposed quite clear in order to get the sense of the Committee upon it. [11.16] I think, this clause is all right. It seems to me that it is absolutely necessary to offer some inducement to the States to federate, because at present they are not federated. I want to provide something which will enable the State and Commonwealth Governments to come together in connection with financial transactions. The State Governments will not entrust the floating of their loans to the High Commissioner unless some body invested with the power to. deal with financial matters is created which offers them such an induce-ment as would enable them to float their loans at par under the Commonwealth representative, when they would be obliged to float them below par if they .did their business through their own Agents-General. I desire to have a branch of the National Postal Banking System established in London. of the functions of the High Commissioner. might be included amongst his functions and duties.

I am afraid, however, that the drafting of the clause, as it stands, might lead to some serious difficulty hereafter. I do not think our invitation to the State Governments will have much effect if when at our request they have agreed to entrust their affairs to the High Commissioner, he is in the management of those affairs to be under the direct control of the Commonwealth Government. What we want to do is to invite the State Governments if they have any particular business to transact in London to do it through the High Commissioner instead of through their own representative. But we could not reasonably expect them to accept that invitation if their agent in the transaction of that business, for the High Commissioner would in that matter be their agent, was to be under the direct control of a Commonwealth Minister. missioner must have but one master?

It would be far better to give him a stated sum. He should have a residence in London, and should not flit from place to place, or live in lodgings. We are dealing with a most important matter at a time when honourable members are thinking more of catching their trains than of the subject under consideration. mit to you, sir, that the honourable member for Darwin could move an amendment to increase the salary of the High Commissioner to £5,000 per year. The clause provides for a total expenditure of £5,000 per year, and in my opinion the Committee can allocate that sum as it chooses. If the salary vvere limited to £5,000 instead of to £6,000 the proposal of the honourable member might be acceptable to the Chair. I want to support the original decision of the Ministry, because I think that a salary °f ^3>°°° a year is quite enough. We are dealing with the remuneration of a business man only. The honourable member for Wide Bay quoted from an Act to show that the salary of the High Commissioner for Canada is only £2,000 per jear. We want a business man, not a society man, to represent Australia. I do not know how the appropriation of £12,000 per year for seven Ministers is divided, but I should not think that the Prime Minister receives more than £2,000 a year. Considering that we have obtained the best Australian ability for that salary, it would be veryunfortunate for the Commonwealth to have in its gift a better office than the Prime Ministership. salary at £5,000, and allow no expenses? I would vote for a proposal of that kind. that to be done. I rose to suggest a way in which possibly the Chair might accept the honourable member's amendment. I shall be glad to support the clause as it stands. Whether an official residence is necessary or not, I cannot say. Any official residence that may be provided may be useless to the High Commissioner, just as the official house in Downing-street was to Mr Gladstone or Mr Balfour, who preferred their own homes. It would depend largely on the domestic arrangements of the Commissioner whether he could conveniently live in an official residence. In my opinion, it would be better to give him £2,000 for expenses, without binding him to use the money for the upkeep of an official residence. But we must act economically. There is an impression abroad that there is too much spreadeagleism about our propositions. In my"" opinion, £3,000 ought to be a sufficient salary for a good man. We should think more of economy in our appointments, and he content to give fair and not extravagant salaries for good service. hope that the Government will stick to the clause as it stands.

I disagree with those who have expressed the opinion that it will not be necessary for the High Commissioner to travel.

[Quorum formed.'] Canadian representative has been mentioned as a precedent to guide us, but it must be remembered that that position has been almost monopolized by one man, simply because he has had money to spend in keeping it up. Wide Bay has said that Australia does not wish to make this position one for rich men. The most certain way to make it one for rich men is to attach a low salary to it, and considering what the High Commissioner will have to do, a salary of ,£5,000 a year will be little enough. I think, tco, that an official residence should be provided, for which I am willing to vote £2,000. The feeling of Americans is that their ambassador to the English Court should have an official home. would be undesirable to pay a lump sum for travelling expenses, because while one year a good deal of travelling might have to be done, the next year there might be very little. But in the performance of his duties, the High Commissioner might have to visit various places on the Continent, and even America, and we must be prepared to pay the expenses so incurred. support the clause as it stands; £3,000 is a fair salary to begin with. If necessary, we can increase the amount later, but if we fix a large sum now, it will not be easy to reduce it. My experience is that the best brains are not always obtained for the biggest money. We have in Australia men who could do the work satisfactorily for £3,000 a year. -When last in England, 1 had an opportunity to learn what the conditions are which attach to a position of this kind, and I say unhesitatingly that .£3,000 would be a ridiculously small salary to pay the Commissioner. the United States Ambassador, does not get a high salary, but he is a wealthy man, while Lord Strathcona, who represents the Dominion of Canada, thinks nothing of spending £50,000 on a week's entertaining, and does it very often. Our High Commissioner will have to rub shoulders with very wealthy men, and it would not do to have him curbing himself, and perpetually doubting whether his salary would carry him through the year. No man should be placed in such a position that he could not entertain in accordance with his position, though perhaps not as some other representatives do. My feeling is that if the High Commissioner got ,£10,000 a year it would be little enough. The Governors of ""Victoria used to get £10,000 a year and certain expenses paid, but their expenditure always exceeded their salaries'. I know of my personal knowledge that Lord The honourable member for Hopetoun, while here, spent £16,000 more than his official salary. It is not fair to send the High Commissioner to England and give him such a salary that the people may be led to believe that he or Australia is mean. We should pay the High Commissioner a salary sufficient to enable him to represent us properly and reasonably without being guilty of extravagance. Captain Collins has done very well in the position he has occupied in London, but he has not been It called upon as the High Commissioner will be to entertain the leading men of Great Britain and some of the most prominent men in the British Dominions. To pay the High Commissioner such a salary as would make it almost impossible for him to live under reasonable conditions would not be right. If the salary paid be that for which the Bill now provides, the appointment will be confined to a few wealthy men. A man cannot be expected to leave Australia for England and to devote all his attention to the position of High Commissioner unless he is well paid. I should not object to the appointment of a wealthy man, provided that he was capable and worthy of the position, but we must have regard for the name of Australia and see that our representative at Home is adequately remunerated.

The duties of the High Commissioner will bring him into touch with representative people with whom it is his duty to confer, and it may be necessary for him to return entertainments to a considerable degree. He must reside in London and in"" certain surroundings. Those who have lived in London or Melbourne, know full well that it is exceedingly expensive to keep up an establishment there. If the High Commissioner receives only ,£3,000 per annum, he will be unable to properly discharge those functions of his office which involve entertaining and a considerable expenditure; he will have to reside, as our Agents-General have done, in some suburb where he may live cheaply. He must live in town, however, if he is to entertain and play his part with representatives of other Dominions, and his expenses will certainly be more than £3,000 a year. For that reason I shall be prepared to support an amendment providing for a salary of £5,000 per annum.

There seem to be quite, a number of opinions as to the salary that should ba provided, and it would be well for us to proceed to a test vote in order that we may determine what the Committee is disposed to do. It is open to the Committee to do what it likes in a reasonable way so far as the question of salary and emolument is concerned. We inserted this.amount in the Bill because we thought it would be a fair salary, but if the Committee thinks otherwise the Government will not object to the amount being increased. I agree with the honourable member for Hume that the salary fixed in the Bill as it stands is insufficient to enable the High Commissioner to represent Australia in a responsible way and to discharge all the duties of his position. The salary is designed to enable the High Commissioner to represent Australia properly in London, and my experience as one who has visited England on several occasions is that of the honourable member for Hume. A salary of ,£3,000 per annum would be inadequate for the occupant of the office of High Commissioner, and il therefore propose to move an amendment providing that the amount be fixed at £5,000 per annum. of External Affairs) [12.3 a.m.] -It is not competent for an honourable member to move , to increase the amount named in the clause, but if the amendment for the omission of the word ""three"" be carried the Government will take it as a direction that the Committee is of opinion that the salary shall be £5,000 per annum. We will then bring down an additional message to cover the increased amount, and the Bill will be re-committed for the purpose of amending the clause. The Minister of External Affairs is creating new complications.. If the Government accept the omission of the word ""three"" by the Committee as an indication of its desire that the salary shall be £5,000 per annum, and no alteration is made in the next clause, the High Commissioner will receive £7,000 per annum and travelling expenses. I think we ought to be told if that is the attitude of the Government. Personally I do not like the provision as to travelling expenses, because I think a definite sum would be much better. Exception might be taken on the Estimates to an unusually high expenditure under this head, followed by a discussion not at all desirable in connection with this high and important position. It is clear that if the duties of the office are to include entertaining and social functions similar to those which fall to the lot of a Governor, the salary proposed is very small; and in my opinion the work which will fall to a High Commissioner calls for more ability than is required in the other position. I favour an increased salary, but I think the matter ought to be more fully discussed than is possible at this hour of the night. The Government proposal suggests that the High Commissioner should be compelled to have an official residence, but I think the suggestion of the honourable member for Darwin would better meet the case. No doubt an official residence would add to the High Commissioner's importance, and if that idea is not carried out, I suppose the proposal,",72,William Lyne Th E Honourable Forrest Sir John Storrer D

It has to be remembered that, although Lord Strathcona receives a salary of £2,000, his position otherwise is one which no High Commissioner for Australia can hope to occupy for many years to come. It has been said that Lord Strathcona entertains Royalty and royally; but he has an enormous private income, and if the High Commissioner is to vie with him, we shall have to pay very much more than £5,000 a year. I take it that we are sending a man to do the work of Australia, and not one to occupy an ambassadorial position. If this is not to be a hard business proposition we ought not to pass the Bill. Our object, I suppose, is not to have a High Commissioner who will enter into rivalry with the ambassadors from different parts of the world, but one who, in return for his salary, will do the work we expect. If we raise the salary to £5,000 in the expectation that he will entertain, we shall place the High Commissioner in an entirely false position, and render it impossible for any one to accept the appointment who has not a large private income. It is proposed to raise the salary, not because we think the work is worth it, but simply because we expect the High Commissioner to entertain and be entertained. whole trend of the arguments used; because, if there is no question of entertaining, a salary of £3,000 is ample. enable the High Commissioner to give a cup of tea to the Australians who would call on him. intention to make the High Commissioner's house a kind of sponging place for touring Australians. For some time past, I have thought that the electors would force on us the necessity of considering the abnormal growth of the Commonwealth Public Service salary list; because we have attempted to place the service on far too high a level. When the honourable member for Hume was proposing the first increases of salary, he said that the object was to make the Federal Service the blue ribbon of Australia. But there are two classes directly interested in the The great probability is that matter-the taxpayers and the taxeaters; and I believe that the whole of the service will have to be taken in hand by this Parliament in the near future. We are making the expense of running the machine far too heavy-and now, in what should be a strictly business arrangement, the House is asked to depart from the proper basis. We are invited to increase the salary of the High Commissioner, with a view to imposing upon him certain ambassadorial functions which can only make him appear ridiculous. If the High Commissioner is not expected to entertain largely the salary fixed in the Bill is sufficient. It is the highest with one exception paid in the whole Commonwealth service. I think the Chief Justice of the High Court receives £3,500 a year. For many years to come we shall not require a man of transcendant ability to fill the position. I want to see a good man sent to England, and if this is made a fair commercial transaction a. salary of £3,000 will enable the Government to secure the pick of all Australia for the position. If our representative were expected to meet the ambassadors of the great nations of the world on an equal footing a salary approaching £25,000 would be required, but to attempt anything of. that sort would be to make ourselves the laughing stock of civilization. Our representative will have no ambassadorial functions to perform, and for many years to come this will be a kind of honorary office and largely a sinecure. Until we take over the State debts or embark on a large immigration policy there will be practically nothing for the High Commissioner to do. To make the total cost of the office run into £12,000 or £15,000 a year will be to pay far loo high a price for the work that we shall get in return. Mr J. H.

Many honourable members went away tonight under the impression that the salary would be fixed at £3,000. I am not taking exception to a larger salary, but an opportunity should be afforded to deal with the question in a larger Committee. The remaining clauses could be taken quickly and nothing would remain but to insert a figure.

I am one of those who hold that Australia is not necessarily called upon to provide for a social butterfly. We ought to pay for brains, and to get the best man available, paying him an adequate salary in order that he may be able to maintain the dignity of his office. But we are not called upon to pay thousands of pounds for lavish entertainments. The opinion of those who have had experience of London, and who are acquainted with the duties of officers similar to the High Commissioner, are in the highest degree valuable. But those honourable members who have had such experience, and who can [128] advise the Committee on the point, have gone home to bed. If a blank is created we are given to understand that the Government will come down with another message to provide an increased salary for the High Commissioner. That is a most objectionable method of dealing with the COOK -The honourable subject. The Government ought to have afforded us an opportunity to discuss the question at a reasonable hour. We ought not to determine so important an issue, affecting the satisfactory representation of Australia in London, at a time when at least half the members of this 'Chamber are absent. Sydney) [12-35 a.m.] -If a further message should be required to increase the amount of the salary to be paid to the High Commissioner that might be considered to-morrow, but I hope the Government will not on any account yield to the wish expressed by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. They have been taunted with not getting their business through, and with neglecting to ask the House to sit late at night. Now, when they have asked honourable members to sit later than usual in order to get on with business which they were taunted with having postponed, it is claimed by those who previously taunted them, and expressed a desire to sit late, that it is not a proper thing to decide this question with a small attendance of members, and at this time of the night. If they yield to the appeal of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, in these circumstances, the Government will abrogate their powers altogether. The fact that there is only a small attendance is due to those who have delayed the passage of the Bill by their opposition. If honourable members who have opposed the Bill from the other side believed that they had good reasons for doing so, they should have remained while it was under discussion. So far as the salary of the High Commissioner is concerned, I may say that I would prefer to vote for that provided in the Bill rather than for the amendment, though I think that it would have been wise to offer another £1.000 a year. I am not prepared to increase the salary to the extent which has been suggested, and if a division is taken I shall vote with the Government.

545,Mr King O'malley (Darwin),"provided. I remind honourable members of the difficulty of reviewing the action of Parliament in passing a Bill of this kind. They will remember that it took us some years to secure an increase of our own salanot now to be postponed. I believethe ries. If a low salary is decided upon,we shall not get the best brains in Australia for this position. VVe require as. High Commissioner a man who will be able to shine alongside the great men with whom he will be associated. will be judged by the intelligence and knowledge of the man who represents Australia in London. I should prefer to vote for an allowance of ,£6,ooo in a lump sum, and let the High Commissioner do as ,he pleases as to the expenditure. The day is gone by for official residences. secure a suite of rooms at the ""Cecil,"" the ""Langham,"" or some other hotel, which would be his head-quarters. If we establish an official residence, we shall probably bankrupt the High Commissioner, because he will be unable to keep it up. Later on. when we have our own Commonwealth building in London, we can provide the High Commissioner with an official residence. Mr J. H . CATTS (Cook) [12.40 a.m.]. I understand that the proposal is to create a blank. If I thought lhat that would lead to a reduction of the amount of salary to be paid to the High Commissioner, I should be prepared to vote for it. I find, however, that those who desire to create a blank wish to increase the proposed salary by £.2,000, and I shall therefore vote against* the proposal. I would rather riot vote with the Government on any question, but I shall be compelled to vote on the same side with them if a division is taken on the question now before the Committee. I have already said that it is not likely that for some time the duties of the High Commissioner will be of a very responsible nature, because the State Agents General will continue to carry out their functions. In the circumstances, the salary proposed by the Bill is ample. If the responsibilities of the office increase, the salary can be increased later on. We are paying the Chief Justice of the High Court a salary of £3,500 a year; and it seems to me that he is charged with duties that are quite as onerous and responsible as -those which it is proposed that the High Commissioner shall attend to. It is, of course, a matter for themselves, but I find ' Bill. it difficult, to understand why some honourable members should be so ready to vote away the taxpayers' money. As we have gone so far with the Bill, I think it ought Government have made up their minds as to whom they will appoint to this position, and the increase of the proposed salary by £2,000 would not be a matter of much importance to the gentleman who is likely, Our country to be appointed. I feel that in asking that the proposed salary should be increased, honourable members are really asking the bulk of the taxpayers, who have little or nothing, to give more money to a person who will already have more than he will know what to do with. The honourable member for Franklin referred to the social side The High Commissioner could of the duties of the High Commissioner, but I did net notice that the honourable member was present earlier in the evening, when special reference was made to that aspect of the question. When I tried to have it considered, honourable members endeavoured to cast ridicule upon my proposal. desired to exclude the High Commissioner from all social functions. Mr J. H . CATTS -No, I did not desire to prevent the High Commissioner attending any functions he pleased .at his own expense, and in his own time. WhatI desired was that his attendance at social functions should not be regarded as. part of the duties for which he is to be paid. As I believe that the object in creating a blank is to increase the salary, I shall be compelled to vote for the clause as it stands. I think that the Government would be well advised if they adhered to the proposals contained in this clause. In my judgment, the class of work that the Commonwealth will require to be performed at Home is of a utilitarian rather than of a social character. There is no need to offer special inducements to capitalists to invest capital in Australia, as capital always finds paying outlets. What we more urgently need is the settlement amongst us of men who are possessed of small means. I shall support the clause in its present form, with the full knowledge that when the duties of the High Commissioner increase, his salary can be increased.",76,William Lyne Th E Honourable Forrest Sir John Storrer D

IRVINE -Could not all these matters be dealt with under the word "" prescribed "" ? frame a regulation to meet all cases. The idea would be to frame such a regulation; but individual cases might arise where the High Commissioner would wish to continue in the office for a period. No Minister would ever give a general authority to the Commissioner to be a director for a number of financial or trading corporations. The idea is to have that amount of elasticity which is essential in the practical working of affairs. I think, speaking from memory, and subject to correction, that in connection with public servants we do not allow payments to be taken, but where a public officer acts as an executor we make an exception in the interests of the family and bis own interest. The general intention of this provision is to prohibit the High Commissioner from taking paid positions. [i.o a.m.] I remember that one. State in the Commonwealth had a Minister who, -after he had reached almost every position, was sentenced to a term of years. Suppose that a man who was mixed up in everything came to be the Minister under this Bill, and found that it would be a good thing to have the High Commissioner to run the show, and so bring wealth to his syndicates?
