Petitions received. appears in to-day's Argus under the heading "" Naval Construction. English Finn's Offer ""A definite offer was recently made to the Commonwealth authorities by ' the shiD-building firm of SirW . G. Armstrong, Whitworth, and Co. Ltd., Newcastle-on-Tyne, in connection with' the Federal naval construction policy. embraced the construction of 'torpedo boats and destroyers, with partial manufacture in Australia, and it is at present under consideration. Its adoption would mean the establishment locally of ship-building works of sufficient capacity to c.irry out the contract. I desire to know from the Prime Minister -(1) ' What were the terms offered by the firm mentioned ? (2) Have any other offers been received? (3) Does the Government propose to establish ship-building works for the purpose of naval construction? (4) If . so, will the works be centralised, or will various suitable sites throughout the Commonwealth be availed of? (5) Before deciding will he consider the exceptional facilities for such purpose now existent at Sydney, both privately owned and State owned? (6) Will he consult the Premier of New South Wales as to what assistance will be given by the New South Wales Government in the matter by the use of the Government works at Cockatoo Island, which are so admirably situated for such works ? kindly informed me of his intention to ask these questions. No terms have been mentioned, the offer received being merely a general intimation of the willingness of the firm to enter into a contract on suitable terms, part of the work to be done in this country. Other similar general offers, but none that could ibe called definite, have been received. The Government has no intention to establish ship-building works, but should it be resolved at any time to do so, the attractions of our various ports will be considered, and the Governments of the States will then have an opportunity to offer assistance. paper which' I have here, it is asserted that a doeen vessels have Been ordered by the Australian Government, eight of them 26knot destroyers, and four 25-knot torpedo boats, most of them to be shopped here in sections. Then, in to-day'.s newspapers, is an account of an interview between Colonel Stanley and the Premier of Victoria, in which the former inquired as to the prospects of State patronage for an English ship-building firm. I wish to know whether there is any truth in the statement in the English newspaper that orders have been given, and I also ask the Prime Minister whether Colonel Stanley should not toe informed that the Government of New South Wales possesses excellent facilities for doing work of this The offer kind, and that an English firm will not be encouraged to enter into competition with it?",14,Setup

51,Mr Maloney,"A t present that firmfirm manufacture about one-fourth of the cigarettes' consumed in Australia, and employ about 700 or 800 operatives, who are engaged, not in making the paper covers, ibut in filling them. As I explained the other day, the machine-made cover does not allow so much paper to overlap, and, therefore, the deleterious effects of smoking paper are to a great extent obviated. The remaining three-fourths of the cigarettes consumed in Australia are machinemade, and their manufacture employs only from seventy to eighty operatives. mostly employed at a low wage in the making of the hand-made cigarettes, whereas men are employed at the machines ? the honourable member; because girls can be employed at the machines just as readily as can men, and the Victorian Factory Act precludes the employment of girls under a certain age.. The honourable member for Angas has said that it is better that tobacco should be stemmed -before being imported, for the reason that, when the leaf is moistened for the purpose of being stripped, it loses in quality. I have had some inquiries made, and I am in a position to say that that is an incorrect statement. Tobacco leaf, whether stemmed or unstemmed, has to be moistened before it can be manipulated here; and the very highest grades of tobacco are imported with the stems on, because it would injure the leaf to previously remove them. High-class tobacco leaf, such as that from Havana, Mexico, Sumatra and Borneo, is never imported stemmed; only the inferior tobaccoes from Germany, America and Japan are sent here stemmed. It is not in the interest of manufacturers to pay a higher duty on unstemmed leaf; and to get the stripping done here would occupy a fair amount of labour. tralia ployed in making only one-fourth of the number of cigarettes consumed, whereas over 3,000 could be employed if all were made by hand labour. The Combine's machinery provides three-fourths of the cigarettes consumed. The best cigarette machines are the Bonzac and the Baron. The Bonzac machine is controlled by the Combine, and the Baron machine can be used only by the Combine, who hold the exclusive Australian rights. I do not know whether it is because this question is before Parliament, and, by means of the daily press, before the citizens of Australia, but I must pay the compliment to the Combine bf saying that they are now doing their work very well, and acting fairly towards their employees. I hope the Combine will also act fairly towards consumers. One fact, which I wish to sink into the mind of the honourable member for Lang, is that nine hand-made cigarettes are sold at the same priceas are ten machine-made cigarettes in the market of Australia; and this fact illustrates the great difficulty in the way of the hand-made makers. From my parliamentary experience I doubt whether any speech ever wins a vote; but, nevertheless, I have much pleasure in submitting the amendment. I do not agree with Sydney) [3.29] I do not know what are the Minister's views of this proposal from the point of view of revenue. views the other day. mean after further consideration; because it seems to me that there will be a loss of from £ 2 5 , 0 0 0 to £ 2 8 , 0 0 0 per annum. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [3.30] -As the honourable member for North Sydney has raised this question, I should like to be allowed to make a statement: I have received from the Minister of Trade and Customs communications from M.r. Nevill and from the Department in regard to the estimated loss of revenue. I was informed on Friday that the loss of revenue occasioned by the vote of the Committee regarding twist tobacco will be from £ 1 6 , 0 0 0 to £ 2 0 , 0 0 0 per annum. But a report that is now before me .reduces that estimate very considerably. It is estimated that 400,000 lbs. of hand-made twist are manufactured, and that the loss of revenue will be about In Aus£ 5 , 0 0 0 per annum. crease. Sir. WILLIAM LYNE It may. In reference to the question now before the Committee, I have a memorandum from Mr Nevill, who saysI have the honour herewith to submit a reporton the proposed decrease of 6d. per lb. in the Excise on hand-made cigarettes. A summary of this report shows :First. If allowed it will cause a loss of revenue of £?,737 3s. per annum on the returns for 1906, and this loss will increase, as shown by the percentage of increased manufacture of hand-made over machine-made in the last three, years, which is 81 per cent, hand-made, 8f per cent, machine-made.",17,Excise Duties

It will serve to increase the already large profits of the manufacturers by is. 13d. per thousand without any corresponding benefit to the labour employed or to any other interest. Third. The testimony of Mr Schuh, a manufacturer of hand-m.ide cigarettes, before the Royal Commission, shows a higher price is obtained for the hand-made, enough to more than cover the difference in the cost of manufacture. Fourth. The additional profit to the manufacturers will be just what is lost to the revenue, ,£7,737 3s., and their profits, us shown by Mr ject from a practical stand-point. Schuh, are already large. It is stated that the manufacturers of handmade cigarettes are now making at least .£10,000 a year, and that under present conditions they can easily hold 'their own against the competition of machine-made cigarettes. from the Comptroller-General of Customs, who estimates that the loss of revenue would be from £4,000 to £5,000 per annum. He also says that the output of hand-made cigarettes is increasing yearly, and that the industry is by no means languishing. Tevenue, he saysThere can be no doubt that there would be a considerable loss of revenue from a differentiation. That can only be compensated for by an increase in the Excise rates-for instance, that the proposed Excise should be increased to 3s. on machine-made and 2s. gd. on hand-made. to afford protection, not to look after the revenue. considered that spirits and narcotics are articles which should be regarded mainly from a revenue point of view. We get an immense revenue from them. suggestion made by the Comptroller-General is rather an important one. He suggests that the excise should be increased to 3s. on machine-made cigarettes, and 2s. 9d. on hand-made, and he addsThis might possibly counteract the loss, but the question is how far it will operate against the interests of the whole of the Australian manufacturers of cigarettes, as such a rate would leave a difference between imported cigarettes and the Australian made at only is. 6d. and is. gd., and it seems doubtful whether this margin is sufficiently in favour of the Australian manufacturer. I wish it to be clearly understood that whilst desiring to the fullest extent possible to benefit our own manufacturers, and to give employment to as many as possible of our workmen, yet, as Treasurer, I must keep an eye upon the interests of the revenue. manufacture cigarettes at all ? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -That is a point worth considering. . facture cigarettes than to smoke them 1 made, somebody will smoke them.

I have also a memorandum We wish to encourage hand-making as-far as possible. I do not know much about cigarettes, but a hand-made cigar is certainly better than a machine-made cigar, and probably the same is true in regard to cigarettes, quality. them. Personally, I think that cigarettes are poison. Buti f the desire of the honourable member for Melbourne could be met by adopting 'he suggestion of the Comptroller-General of Customs, and if the adoption of the suggestion would not perceptibly interfere with other avenues of trade regarding tobacco and cigars, I should have no objection to it. But before agreeing to a proposal of this kind I should like to know whether it would have the effect of disorganizing the duties or affectThe ing their symmetry. BecauseI admit quite candidly-and I have tried very hard to grasp the whole of this question thoroughly-that it is a difficult thing to understand clearly how the excise will affect the duty, and vice versd. I wish to know before I agree to this suggestion whether it is absolutely certain that no injury will be done to the revenue if the desire of the honourable member be met. understand that the suggestion of the Treasurer is that the Excise on machine-made cigarettes be raised to 3s. per lb., whilst that on hand-made cigarettes is fixed at 2S. 9d. per Ib.

I will not absolutely assure the Committee that the import and Excise duties in New Zealand are the same until I have looked the matter up. member is right. will be found that the two duties are the same. While that plan does not encourage the local manufacturer, one very advantageous effect of it is a great reduction of the smoking of cigarettes by juveniles. But leaving that aside as a course which the Minister would perhaps, not be prepared to adopt, and Which would perhaps' be rather harsh to present manufacturers, I would point out that under the late Tariff the local article was so protected that the consumption of it is overtaking that of the imported article, and that the hand-made cigarette had a sufficient advantage to enable it to make rapid strides as against the machine-made. -circumstances, it would be very undesirable to differentiate the Excise. I cannot -see that any sufficient reason has been -shown why the Minister should take that course. -J f the honourable member for North ""Sydney were prepared to move in the direction of prohibiting the manufacture of cigarettes, I should be entirely with him, as I agree that cigarettes aire not good for 'either juveniles or adults; but, as there is no such proposal before the Committee, -I am surprised at the honourable member's line of argument. When we were discussing the question of hand-made and machine-made tobaccoes, the cry was, """" What is the use of kicking against machinery ""? Yet the honourable member for -North Sydney now supplies the Committee 'with' proof that the hand-made cigarette -is not only more desirable, but, in spite of is the New the introduction of machines, is making rapid progress against the machine-made. If that is so, and if it is really a good thing that cigarettes should be made by handI think it is, from the labour standpoint, as I understand that there are about three employees engaged in the manufacture of cigarettes iby hand to every one occupied in the machinery process not be idle, I hope. great many cigarettes are imported, and it is proved that a more desirable cigarette can be made by hand in Australia. I prefer to see the work done by Australians. If it is a good thing that cigarettes should be made by hand, and if , also, the honourable member for North Sydney is correct in saying that hand-made cigarettes are overtaking the machine-made, then it is right that the Committee should enable them to completely overtake the machinemade cigarettes at once. The honourable member for North Sydney says that one of the objections to the adoption of the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne is that we should be thereby making a present to a firm which is already ' doing a very good business. But there is nothing to prevent those now engaged in the manufacture, of machine-made cigarettes from undertaking their manufacture by hand. I am astonished, seeing the large profit that is being made by those now in the industry, that more enterprising commercial men have not engaged in it. But I In these feel sure that if we do pass the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne, a large number of firms now engaged in producing machine-made cigarettes .will turn their attention to the manufacture of the hand-made article. For the reasons adduced by the honourable member for North Sydney, I am prepared to support the proposal of the honourable member for Melbourne. I understand that the Acting Prime Minister has decided to differentiate between hand-made and machine-made cigarettes, by increasing the excise duty on the machine-made from 2s. 9d. to 3s. per lb. that was to be done. make the difference 6d. understand the amount of difference that",20,Excise Duties

I understand that the Government propose to charge an Excise duty of 3s. on the machine-made cigarettes. tion of the Comptroller-General. suggestion, from the point of view of the contention that the manufacture of cigarettes is a bad thing. We are not discussing that point at present, and what we want to arrive at is whether .it is better to make our cigarettes here by hand or by machine. If we make them by hand, we shall give employment to 700 people, as against 70 who would be employed if the present proportion of cigarettes continued to be made by machinery. Another reason that appeals to me is that hand-made cigarettes are much more wholesome, or, at any rate, much less deleterious, than machine-made. I am informed that the machine-made cigarette is f u l l of dust, and therefore very injurious. Those are two points whicli make me inclined to think that we ought as far as possible to encourage the production of cigarettes by hand. The honourable member for North Sydney has raised the question of machinery against hand labour, but in this case I do not think that argument applies. As a rule, I am in favour of machinery every time, because the public are better served by the use of machinery than by hand-work, and because, eventually -and perhaps very soon-actuall y more people will be employed when machines are used, and the work is better done. In 999 cases out of 1,000 those reasons apply, but they do not apply in this particular case, in which the public are served with a better article at the same price. I have taken the trouble to get a sample of machine-made cigarettes, and another of handmade cigarettes, and find that the public are at least as 'well served by the use of the hand-made cigarettes as by the use of the machine-made. ber of cigarettes in each packet? in the packet of hand-made, as against ten in the packet of machine-made. That is the only point against the hand-made article. per packet? packet of machine-made has the advantage of containing one more cigarette. If the use of cigarettes is undesirable, then tbe fact that a packet contains one more cigarette may be regarded as a disadvantage, although, of course, a man is not likely to buy nine when he can get ten for the same money. All things considered, this is a question, not of machinery against hand labour, but of whether, if cigarettes are to be produced here at all, we should not give the work to 700 people as against 70. If the Government will put their foot down ancl make the proposed differentiation in the Excise duty, I , for one, shall be prepared to support them. -The Government might with advantage go even further than they propose in increasing the Excise duty on machine-made cigarettes. I quite sympathize with the suggestion of the honourable member for North Sydney, as I indicated last Friday my view that it would be a good thing if cigarettes generally were made dearer than they are now. Packets can be bought in all the large centres in Australia for 3d. each, and it is the excessive cheapness .of cigarettes that attracts the juvenile portion of the community so much. That is not a good thing. Apart altogether from the question whether cigarette smoking is more injurious that other forms of tobacco smoking, it is undoubtedly a fact that youngsters are encouraged to smoke by the facilities with which they can obtain cigarettes. I should like to see the Government go further than they propose in levying an Excise of 3s. per lb. upon machine-made cigarettes. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Mak e it 3s. 6d. per lb. all round. like to see a slight differentiation between fhe Excise imposed upon machine-made cigarettes and hand-made cigarettes, for the reason that I am given to understand that the hand-made cigarettes are less injurious than are the machine-made. I do not pretend to be sufficiently an expert to express a definite opinion upon whether that is so or not. I confess that when my No , there are nine smoking appetite has been jaded I have smoked a cigarette. The Government might very well propose an Excise of 3s. 3d. per lb. upon machine-made cigarettes even if they permitted the hand-made cigarettes to be produced and sold at a slightly lower rate.

We have heard a good deal concerning the impetus which will be given to employment if we make a differentiation in favour of the hand-made cigarettes. wages paid in their manufacture are very much lower than those which are paid in the manufacture of machine-made cigarettes. In the production of the former, unskilled labour is employed. to ' f ill the cigarette-papers. that it is required in the manufacture of machine-made cigarettes. In the manufacture of the latter,adults are chiefly employed at fair wages, whereas employment in the production of hand-made cigarettes is very young girls, who receive is.' gd. per 1,000, and whose wages-accordin g to the skill of the individual-rang e from 1 os. 6d. to 17s. 6d. weekly. Onlv about half the girls employed in the manufacture of the hand-made cigarettes are engaged upon piece-work-the other"" half are employed upon day wages, and earn considerably less. In the manufacture of machinemade cigarettes a very much smaller number of operatives is employed, but the work is of a more skilled character. The older women operatives who are' employed in this work earn from 20s. to 30s. per 1 week. Machine-made cigarettes necessitate the employment of skilled males also, in looking after the machines. The average of employment is in the proportion of twelve men to ninety girls. The wages of The honourable the men range up to £ 4 per week. So that honourable members of the Labour Party, in advocating a differentiation between the Excise imposed upon hand-made and machinemade cigarettes, are really advocating a bonus for the employment of child labour at low rates of wages. If they will look into the matter more closely, I am sure that they will hesitate about supporting the proposal before the Committee. I am heartily in accord with the sentiments expressed by the honourable member for North Sydney, who pointed out the undesirableness of encouraging the smoking of cheap cigarettes by juveniles. Whilst we are dealing with these duties I think that we might take Under the differensome action to restrict, rather than encourage, cigarette smoking by that section of the community. A uniform excise of 4s. per lb. would check the juvenile cigarette smoking habit. -Honorabl e members who have acquired the habit of smoking have expressed themselves as being unable to comprehend the But, as a matter of fact, the technicalities of this particular subject, and it is hardly likely that a non-smoker can accomplish what they have failed to achieve. But this Committee-wisel y 01 unwisely-ha s decided to differentiate between the Excise upon hand-made and that upon machine-made manufactures in -the matter of tobacco and cigars. Now we are asked to extend the same principle to cigarettes. I have a great deal of sympathy with the position taken up by the honourable member for North Sydney, because I believe that of all forms of smoking, cigarette principally confined to smoking is the most harmful. Consequently I am quite in accord with the honourable member in his desire to restrict the use of cigarettes, particularly by the juvenile portion of the community.

To that extent also I am in agreement with the honourable member „for South who has approved of action being taken in a restrictive direction. disposed to discriminate between machine labour and hand labour in the matter of taxation generally. contrary to recognised economic principles. I notice that it has been stated on the authority of one witness, Mr Barnett, that a machine in use in South Australia can turn out from 4,000 to 5,000 cigars a day, whereas only some 400 per day can be manufactured by hand labour, or about 2,000 per week. That seems a very big margin. those who employ hand labour are chiefly persons of small means who are unable to purchase the raw material they require at such advantage as those who can purchase large quantities for manufacture by machinery. that the manufacture Commonwealth is very largely in the hands of a Combine. very great influence in trade, and practically threatens its supremacy in the manufacturing business, and also in the retail business. Those engaged in the retail tobacco trade .particularly feel the influence of the Combine in the regulation of their business.. As an indication of the extent to which the influence of the Combine operates in the Commonwealth, I mav remind honourable mem: bers that since the Tariff was introduced, a large portion of the works conducted by this monopolistic institution in Melbourne was shut down. On the 14th August last we were informed that some 500 operatives were shut out. Steps were also taken to ' shut down works in Adelaide and in Sydney. was that the action taken by the Combine was due entirely to the operation of the Tariff, but subsequently it was intimated that there were other reasons for it. It was stated that in Melbourne a proposal was before the Directors for the substitution of electric for, steam power in the works, and in Sydney it was stated that it ' was necessary under the new conditions im. posed by the' Tariff, that the sizes in which plug tobacco was placed on the market should be alteied. the shutting down of the works in Melbourne, a meeting of the operatives concerned was held to consider their position, and the following paragraph giving the Mr Thomas Brown. gist of the statements made at the meeting appeared in the Sydney Morning Sydney, HeraldA largely attended meeting of the members of But I am not the Tobacco Workers Union was held in the Trades Hall to-night, and made an emphatic protest against the factory of the British Australasian Tobacco Company being closed down at a To do so would be to run minute's notice. It was pointed out that the most unfortunate result of the action of this Combine was the helpless position in which the workers were placed owing 'to the company having practically a monopoly of the trade, thus making it almost impossible for the operators to get work at their trade elsewhere. One of the speakers at the meetAgain, it is pointed out that ing intimated that, in his opinion, the shutting down of the factory was not a result of the Tariff, but was due to other reasons which, to some extent, has since been admitted by-the company. One reason given was the enormous production that had We have also to face the fact taken place just previous to the closing of tobacco in the down of the factory. The company had been working at top speed' for a considerThis Combine exercises a able period, and had a large quantity of manufactured tobacco in hand awaiting shuts out all competition that consumption. This gave them an opportunity to close down their works. That statement was to some extent admitted by the manager of the Combine in Sydney, when interviewed by a representative of the Sydney Morning Herald. In the issue of that newspaper of the 15th August, the manager of the Combine is reported as having stated that the factory had been working at very high pressure for some tim<i previously/ On the 19th September, a letter from the company appeared in the Sydney Daily Telegraph. . This letter was .dated 19th September, and was published as coming from "" The British Australasian ' Tobacco Company Proprietary The first impression conveyed Limited."" It contained the following significant paragraph in reference to the action of the Melbourne operatives, who had been in the employment of the companyWe were anxious to nrevent any serious loss to our operators from their enforced idleness, and intended to put them, on half pay. For this purpose, and to discuss the Tariff situation, our Melbourne directors proceeded to Sydney for consultation with our directors here early this week. But on Tuesdav evening a meeting of the Melbourne operators took place, at which such scandalous statements were made about us, In connection with in spite of increases of pay and other benefits that we have recently conferred upon them that our directors, from sheer indignation, decided to do nothing. Thev therefore telegraphed to Melbourne that they would not carry out this intention with regard to half pay whilst the factory wns closed, as it would have the appearance of yielding to coercion. This is the position taken up by this large manufacturing company. down their works, at a moment's notice, as soon as the Tariff was introduced, and apparently without taking their operatives into their confidence to any extent whatever. The operatives were simply informed that, on account of the proposed Tariff legislation, their work must cease. Knowing the internal working of the company, and that the operation of the Tariff had been forestalled by large withdrawals of unmanufactured tobacco from the Customs, and by production for some time at high pressure, enabling the company to hold large surplus stocks, the employees gave voice to their feelings in connection with a matter which very materially affected them. The company intimated afterwards that they intended to give them half-pay, but because something to which they took exception was said at the public meeting, they at once decided, through sheer indignation at the criticism of the operatives, not to carry .out their intention. These circigarettes for 3d., whereas of the handcumstances appeal to me very strongly as indicating the extent to which the Combine will go'. If the operatives were not entitled to consideration, they had no claim, but the company admitted that they were entitled to some consideration since they were prepared to the extent of giving them halfpay while the works were shut clown. Bitt because, at a meeting which was held, some irresponsible persons made statements to which exception was taken, all the operatives, both present and absent, together with tiheir unfortunate wives and children, who, of course, took no part, were punished. This action, of the Combine did as much as anything else to lead me to vote to differentiate between handmade and machine-made tobacco and cigars. The only reason why I am not altogether disposed to act similarly in regard to cigarettes is that, according to expert medical opinion, their use is injurious to health, and most hairmful to growing lads. Something should certainly be done to prevent the smoking of cigarettes by our youths, and I am prepared to co-operate in any movement to that end. I think, however, that the principle which has been adopted in respect to the manufacture of cigars and tobacco may reasonably be applied in this instance on the basis of an increased' Excise. listened carefully to the remarks of honourable members, and the more I hear the They closed less able I feel to make up my mind on the question at issue. The interests at stake are so various, that the subject is one which would be better discussed by a Committee of experts than by the well-meaning members of this Committee, who, apparently, do not know too much about it. not seem to agree. inquiry that in Victoria there is one largf factory in which hand-made cigarettes are manufactured, employing something like 700 hands, and a number of small establishments, whose proprietors hold £ 5 licences, and turn out only limited quair tities of cigarettes. In New South Wales, too, there is a number of small makers, but no large factory. The tobacco manufacturing companies, which have formed themselves into a gigantic Combine, have a monopoly of the New South Wales cigarette trade. They can sell at a profit ten made cigarettes they cannot sell more than nine for 3d. Consequently, the Victorian hand-made cigarettes are excluded from New South Wales. It is to the interest of the Combine that no advantage be given to the makers of hand-made cigairettes; but we to meet them should be foolish if we listened to those who hold a brief for it. Last year the revenue from cigarettes was about £ 1 7 4 , 0 0 0 , and the loss which would be entailed by the proposed differentiation would be about one-fourth of that, or £ 4 3 , 5 0 0 . Mir. LIDDELL Yes . As a representative of the worker, the farmer, the clerk, and the professional man, I should like to assist in pulling down stones from the top of our gigantic Tariff wall, and, therefore, am inclined to support the proposed differentiation, notwithstanding the probable loss of revenue. As for the difference between hand-made and machine-made cigarettes, as a smoker, I know that the former are the better. When cigarettes are made by machine, the tobacco is thrust into a hopper, and, in the process of manufacture, is cut into small lengths, with a consequent making of dust, which goes into the cigarettes, and may be inhaled into the lungs of smokers, to their injury. But when cigarettes are made by hand, there is not this dust, and the cigarettes are more wholesome and better.. This morning I",23,Excise Duties

When I asked Mr Schuh to allow me to see the process of manufacturing the cigarettes he very courteously threw open the doors and escorted me over the factory. I found myself passing from floor to floor in a massive and well-constructed building, splendidly lighted and ventilated, and occupied by hundreds of employees, and I was really surprised to find such a place in Melbourne. I had no idea that the factory system was conducted in that excellent manner, and that an. occupation such as the manufacture of cigarettes was carried on under such healthy conditions as I noticed. As the result of my inspection, I learned that the manufacture of hand-made cigarettes gives employment to a number of persons. manufacturer can turn out the cigarettes by practically the million, and we know what an enormous quantity are put on the market; in fact, they have to be turned out in an enormous quantity in order to yield anything like a decent profit. manufacturer of hand-made cigarettes, however, makes a very much larger profit than does the manufacturer of machinemade-cigarettes, and he gives employment to a large number of persons. I had been informed that the average wage which was paid to women and girls-and certainly the employees were chiefly women and girls -was ' about ios. per week. that that statement is misleading. A t the factory the books were shown to me, and I saw that the wages for girls ranged from £ 2 to 5s. per week. A clever girl who could turn out 11,000 cigarettes in a week could make very nearly £ 2 . they get? question, I could not arrive at the rate. thousand. . like that. of producing the cigarettes is about '3s. od. per thousand. girls varied very considerably. who were doing what was practically untrained work received 5s. per week. All tbey had to do was to take a pair ot scissors and cut off the ends of ' the cigarettes. They were young girls who were practically 'in the position of probationers, but who as time' went on would become more skilf u l , and gradually their wages would be increased. On the top floor there was a room for beginners where they were overlooked, and did their work. It depends entirely upon the agility and skill of a girl whether or not she makes anything like a decent wage. It has been said that the labour employed in connection with hand-made cigarettes, is not skilled labour. I consider that it is skilled work. In some cases the cigarettes were made by hand almost from first to last. The paper was taken by hand, the tobacco was rolled, and placed inside the paper by hand, and the paper was pasted by hand. In other cases a certain number of machines were used in forming the cartridges, and all the girls had to do was to fill them with the tobacco. The By the aid of machinery the pulling out of the tobacco and placing of it in the cartridge is certainly skilled work. [ am satisfied that any one of us would need a considerable amount of practice before we could do it. In my opinion, an industry of this kind should be enA couraged, especially when we find that one factory in Melbourne is giving employment, and what appears to be healthy employment, to no less than 700 persons. The honourable member for South Sydney contends that it is a great pity that'we should allow the youth of the country to smoke cigarettes. That is almost entirely a question for the States to deal with.. In NewI consider South Wales, we have a law which was designed to prevent any youth below a certain age from obtaining tobacco from a tobacconist without an order. Unfortunately, one youth is able to write an order for another youth, and the law, I believe, is practically a dead letter. It is a sad thing that in Melbourne a boy is able to enter the shop of a tobacconist and buy one' A l t h o u g h I asked that cigarette for a'half-penny.

As I say, I hope the Government will make some differentiation between hand-made and machine-made cigars. In this connection the tobacco trade industry stands apart from any other; and tobacco, from a fiscal point of view, cannot be treated like any other commodity. feeling in reference to cigarette manufacture is that I would favour a bonus for those who manufactured cigarettes that would sicken the youngsters who use them, and thus cure them of the smoking habit.

It is a thousand pities that there should be this enormous consumption, which I regard as one of the serious dangers to the Commonwealth. The honourable memher for Yarra spoke of the power that the. States have, as distinguished from the inability of the Commonwealth, to take steps in regard to the deleterious compounds included in imported cigarettes, suggesting that opium is present to some extent. I think, however, that there is complete power in the Customs Act to deal with an evil of that sort. Section S3 of that Act providesNo spirit, opium, tobacco, snuff, cigars, or injurious traffic, .and would rather see the cigarettes shall be imported except in packages :is prescribed.. If any cigarettes containing opium are imported, I think they might ""be prohibited under that section. .Then there is a general power in the Customs Act to prohibit by proclamation. the application of the words in sub-section .g of section 52 of that Act. All goods the importation, of which may be prohibited-by proclamation ' I presume that to mean proclamation apart from any special Statute, and,' if that be Those so, any evil of the sort suggested may be grappled with. So far as concerns theaccount given by my honourable friend, the member for Hunter, of the factory which exists in Melbourne, we must all, of course,, be pleased to hear of such conditions existing in connection with an industry in Australia. My regret is that r.uch a splendid factory, and the young"" girls employed in it , are not engaged in something which would; be more beneficial to the Commonwealth at large. I trust that the interests of the revenue will be respected in this matter. The question of differentiation is one that should be regarded from the point of view of the revenue. I think that what is desired should be carried out by increasing -the. duty on machine-made cigarettes. that effect will be proposed. duties go up instead of down. The effect of the amendment of the honourable member for Melbourne is to institute a lower rate of duty of 6d. per lb. in favour of handmade cigarettes. I should prefer to see an increase of the duty' on machine-made cigarettes, leaving the present rate for the hand-made. right honourable member advocates the increase of duties. the tobacco duties from the point of view of fiscal differences. In New South Wales, when we had the freest Tariff in the world -w e had only five taxable items-ther e was always a substantial difference between the Excise on Australian-made tobacco and the duty on imported tobacco. Eveni n England, there is a difference in one line. At all events, I have heard so during the debate; I have not checked the statement.. I look upon the cigarette trade as a most duties put up than down. That could be done without preventing honourable members from carrying out the idea of a differentiation in favour of hand-made cigarettes. it ought to be prohibited. I am not quite clear as to would only support me I would endeavour to so formulate this Tariff that cigaretteswould be practically prohibited.

In that way, they have been able ""to Wipe out cigarette smoking amongst the juveniles of New Zealand. I should be delighted to support any such project, here, but I know that at present it is impracticable. I should, however, be glad to support such an increase of these duties as would have the effect of discouraging cigarette smoking. I do not think there is any suggestion that the manufacturers of hand-made cigarettes are not making a' handsome profit. The hand-made article appears to be rapidly increasing in popularity as compared with the machine-made cigarette. If that is the case, under present conditions, without any difference, it seems to me that we might very well put these duties up without injuring the manufacturers at all. They are doing well enough, I understand, and if we could only in some way discourage the use of cigarettes, whether imported or locally-made, I should be glad. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Trea surer) [4.55]-I have listened carefully to the debate which has taken place on this subject, and think that I shall be carrying out the wishes of the Committee, and at the same time protecting the revenue, by proposing to leave the 3s.

I do not at all appreciate the arguments for prohonorable member recognise that, in regard viding more work which we are constantly hearing from my honourable friends in the Ministerial corner. to it ; whilst the honourable member has been so long away from hard work that he does not like it. I know what hard work is as much as my honourable friend does. It is strange to hear in these days of advanced civilization the argument that we should betake ourselves to the discouragement of machinery, which we thought tended to lighten the tasks and toils of the world, and should go back again to a condition from which we have slowly emerged in the course of many decades.

Here, again, is an argument that suggests the correctness of my retort. are told that we should make this differentiation because it would provide more 1 work. My impression is that the way to provide more work is to take the fullest, fairest and freest advantage of the machinery which is evolved from time to time to meet the tasks of the world, and that it is a distinct step backwards to put aside machinery and go back to old time methods of hand labour. However, there seems to be some fear that these machines are a monopoly. I apprehend that such a state of affairs cannot long prevail, and that if a monopoly exists it is because of certain patent rights. If that be so, I hope that my honourable friends of the Labour Party will not try by a side wind to prevent the inventors of the machine from taking f u l l and fair advantage of their patent rights. reached in our history a time when Parliament is prepared to set aside the patent rights of traders. is only one man engaged in a particular industry the invention of machinery relating to that industry is discouraged, since there can be only one buyer of an invention. consideration apply to every patent? monopolv. to patent rights there must necessarily be a monopoly, until the ""expiration of the fourteen years' period in respect of which the patent has'been granted? is that in the circumstances mentioned there can be only one buver of a patent. any one could buy this patent, and apply it to the production of cigars and cigarettes, just as any man may take advantage of any other patent right if he is prepared to bid up for it.

This paper was used for cigarette casings, and it seems to me that under the proposed definition such paper could not be used in the manufacture of hand-made cigarettes. Then, again, the paper itself is made by machinery. I understand that the cases or paper tubes in which tlie tobacco is placed are made by machinery, and that the hand labour is employed in filling those cases. If that be so, the amendment would certainly have tlie effect mentioned by the honourable member for Yarra.

Sir WILLIA M LYNE -I do not think that they can ibe made by hand. By leave, I shall amend the amendment by substituting the word "" f ill in g "" for the word "" making."" Amendment, by leave, amended accordingly. I submit that the proposed definition, even as amended, would not cover the process that we have in mind. It would provide that the whole of the operation connected with the ""'filling and completion"" of hand-made cigarettes shall be performed exclusively by hand laibour. It is with the filling of the cigarette cases, and not with the filling of the cigarettes themselves, that we have to deal. We need to provide that the filling of the paper or tubing by hand shall constitute "" making by hand "" within the meaning of the section. As the amendment was first worded, the Comptroller General would have known quite well what the Committee meant, but now the Acting Prime Minister should state what he means by it in its altered form.

Take, first, the duty on blue, a common article of the household, in which the humble washerwoman is concerned. I remember that in 1894, when the right honourable member for East Sydney was introducing his land-tax proposals, a howl was Taised by the Opposition side about the land held by the poor widow. Later on, when we came to deal with the Early ClosingB ill , a howl went up from the right honourable gentleman's own side about the widow woman who owned a shop.

These are only a few items I have selected. items I have selected. ber has naturally selected other items. He is able to look upon the proposed duty on wire-netting from an impartial stand-point. I am looking at it, I hope, as a citizen, and not merely as a public man. I say that if we are to deviate from the order of the items as they appear in the Tariff, we should consider such items as tea, kerosene, woollen goods, apparel, and attire, mining, electrical, and agricultural machinery"" as soon as wire-netting. We may be at the commencement drought, though I hope not, and the farmer is called upon tobear an impost which must, until Australian manufacturers are able to supply Australian requirements, add to his burdens an amount which he can ill afford to pay. In the circumstances I say that we cannot, ancl I shall not willingly, permit anv item to be given prior consideration to that of agricultural machinery. As for mining machinery, I do most emphatically say that tens of thousands of people look to the mining industry of this country for a livelihood, and it is an extraordinary proposal to place on that industrv an impost of this sort, which cannot be regarded as excused by any desire to foster local manufacture, because, as a matter of fact, some of this machinery is of a highly complicated character,. and a good deal of it is protected by patent. Consequently it must be obtained elsewhere, if we are to continue to treat our low grade ores, and if our mining is not to be restricted, and a very great injustice thus done to the country. If we are to deviate from the regular order, and consider one item, because of the urgency of the case, I say emphatically that the case for wire-netting is not more urgent than that for many other items which might be referred to. I have nothing whatever to say against the very legitimate and praiseworthy desire on the part of honourable members whose constituents are vitally interested in the matter, to discuss the proposed duty on wire-netting as soon as posI n view of these sible. A t the same time, in the electorate which I have had the honour to represent since the inauguration of the Commonwealth, thousands of people are compelled to pay from 2s. 6d. to ss, per week more than they had previously to pay on articles which cannot be made in this country. I take kerosene as an example. On the one hand we have the Standard Oil Trust, and on the other the British Imperial Company, which approaches us under the specious pretence that it is a British Trust, and ought, therefore, to be encouraged. I say that one Trust is just the same as another to me, and whether a man is called Rockefeller or John Smith does not affect me very much, especially when my constituents are called upon to pay an extra amount for their kerosene. I have no hesitation in saying that I do not care whether the Standard Oil Trust would be injured or not. I shall not readily support of another great the proposed duty on kerosene. ' The pretence is that we should give employment to persons to make tins, while we know that the proposed duty may have the effect of throwing hundreds of people out of employment, carters, wharf labourers, and so on, who are entitled to just as much consideration, and no more, than is vouchsafed to others. Among the items to which, in my opinion, priority of treatment should be given, if we are to depart from the order of the schedule, are item 105, tea; items 106 and 107, apparel and attire; item 124, woollens-; item 148, agricultural machinery; item 177, mining machinery; item 178, electrical machinery; item 234, kerosene; and item 352, magazines.

Last week the Treasurer said that he was in charge of the Tariff, and that he would not allow the business of the Committee to be taken out of his hands, or the sequence of the consideration of the Tariff to be altered. To-night, however, we find him quite willing to alter that sequence, although he has given a promise to the contrary to deputations who have from time to time waited upon him. The Treasurer, when certain suggestions were advanced from this side, made a great, display of courage, and went so far as to say that those who took a contrary view to himself on the question of giving preference to the consideration of certain items ought to go to the other side. On that occasion I expressed my appreciation of his determination in regard to the conduct of business. It will be remembered that the honourable gentleman did make a partial promise to consider the question, and in reply to the leader of the Opposition, he said that, after the tobacco duties had been disposed of, he would see whether an arrangement could become to as to the precedence of, not one item, but several items. finite promise in regard to one item. tracted from the Treasurer under duress, because he thought the numbers were against him, and the leader of the Opposition took advantage of the opportunity to press the item, of wire-netting to the front. To-day the Treasurer still has charge of public business, but he is willing to consent to postpone certain items in favour of wire netting, so long as there is not a long discussion on the question bf postponement. To my mind that attitude is an invitation to honourable members to enter upon a long discussion. The honourable gentleman has advanced no reasons why certain items shall be postponed; but he has charged certain honourable members with being "" hysterical."" In my opinion the honourable gentleman was, himself, hysterical when he said that he was a country member, and that was why he favoured giving precedence to the item of wire-netting. We now have the secret of the honourable gentleman's position. Country members whose constituents use wire-netting will naturally. vote for precedence being given to that item. The Treasurer has said that he will not permit any other items, except that which he has mentioned, to be considered, for the reason that he cannot get honourable members to agree as to the items to be selected. But if the Treasurer has his list of items, which he desires to have considered, why should not the honourable member for West Sydney, or myself, also have a little list? My own opinion is that the sequence of the Tariff should not be disturbed, because it appears to have been arranged with design. Those items which most nearly affect the public, or the revenue, have been placed first on the list, and only in one or two cases has that rule been departed from. Those who had the arrangement of the Tariff, have not picked out any particular trade or district for preferential treatment, but have grouped industries and commodities together in the order of those which affect the larger portions of the community. Why did those honourable members, who are interested in wire-netting, not move the postponement of the consideration of the duties on intoxicants and narcotics? We heard no suggestion in. that direction. I know that the Standing Orders are very stringent, but there is nothing to prevent my moving that all the items, up to item 188, for example, be postponed, and so>",36,William Lyne I Said I Would With A Great Affectation Of Regret Declares

235,Mr Wilks,"That promise was exon The tobacco items represent venue of some £ 2 4 6 , 0 0 0 , and it was quite right that they should be considered in their order. Why should not the items relating to groceries afterwards take precedence? All classes of the community are affected by them. The bulk of the people do not use wire-netting. Take, for instance, the item, "" Currants."" They are used in every household, and especially by the poorer classes. I find that £ 7 9 , 0 0 0 was derived, in revenue from them in 1906. The duty is to be increased. Rice also produced revenue to the extent of £ 8 0 , 0 0 0 . that will not make a demand for precedence. Why should not precedence be given to the consideration of it? More people are interested in the duties on rice and currants than are interested in wire-netting. Then, again, revenue to the extent of £ 3 9 3 , 0 0 0 was derived from apparel and attire. Probably the Western Australian members would desire to consider the duties on mining machinery before we consider those on wire-netting.' Why should not their desire be acceded to? The honourable member for West Sydney has said that he intends to support'the early consideration of those items which most largely affect his electors. I shall do the same. It is only natural that Ave should take an interest in those items that especially concern our constituents. Wire-netting interests the country members in some degree, but I do not suppose that they are especially desirous of having the item considered before the other items are dealt with.

But I am urging that there is no reason for giving prior consideration to the products of any. particular industry. If we take this course in regard to wire-netting, there is not a single industry in Australia having friends amongst honourable members It is all very well for honourable members to say "" O h .

Petition after petition has been presented to the House from music teachers who desire us to deal without delay with the item of musical instruments. As a class, they are not highly paid, and if we agreed to this motion, why should they not ask for preferential consideration of the duty upon pianos? I am setting aside all pretence, and would point out that those who are supporting the motion are concerned in the wire-netting industry. are. The item affects country electorates. The honourable member for Lang has no constituents interested in the duty on wire netting, but in supporting this motion he may be actuated by a desire to conserve the I do not know; but in interests of the State of which he is a representative.

When the eyes of a country are picked out, it is often said that the land has been It ""peacocked""-and I object to the ""peacocking "" process being applied to the Tariff. According to the information put I am not before us, the imports of wire-netting last year were of the value of £ 5 1 2 , 0 0 0 , and I think it-is too stiff.

A heavy duty is proposed on anti-corrosive paints, which have to be imported. They are patented, and the peculiarities of their composition are such that they cannot be made here. The docking people in my electorate complain, and give specific cases of numbers of vessels that have had to leave Port Jackclasses of the community, and surely if a son and dock in Singapore and other Eastern ports, because of the heavy duty on these paints. Surely, then, I have a right on behalf of my electorate to ask for early consideration of the case of those 700 or 800 men, who are not employed at a very high rate of wage, and whose labour is intermittent. If they had high wages and constant employment, they would not feel so keenly the delay in dealing with the item, which is number 236 in the schedule. I should like to move afterwards that all items up to that one be postponed. fact is that a number of honourable members are interested in country districts, or gin to interfere with the order of the otherwise they would not allow the sequence of the Tariff to be altered at all to give priority to the item of wire-netting.

Another item involving articles of everyday consumption is that, of ""Sago and tapioca,"" under "" Groceries."" There is an increase in the duty of nearly 100 per cent., which the majority of peoplo who. use those articles are paying every day. That item, in the ordinary course, would have received almost immediate consideration, as it comes early in the list.

The order of the Tariff ought not to be interfered with. If we deviate from the order of the Tariff for the consideration of a particular item, the same course may be f o llowed in connection with other items, and honourable members from a distance, .who are compelled to leave this State to reach their homes, may find that many items in which they are interested will be dealt with in their absence.

I could understand the Labour Party supporting such a -proposal as that, but I cannot understand them supporting a proposal for a prior consideration of the duty on wire-netting. The Government are agreeing to the course proposed under pressure. I admit openly I cannot entertain that the wire-netting industry of New South Wales is not in my electorate, but many of the men engaged in the industry are constituents of mine. I have not put in a word for these men. In considering the last .Tariff, I supported the proposal to put wire-netting on the free list, but I have openly stated that I will not continue to do so. When I see other honourable members voting for duties in the interests of inI hope the Government will not dustries carried on in their districts, I say that the 400 men who are employed in the wire-netting industry in New .South Wales should receive some consideration.

It was only the other day that a very large . manufacturer complained to me that he was compelled to order his bottles a long . time ahead. I am glad to say that he gives his orders, not to the foreigner, but . to the .old country. He says it is a very great hardship that he should have to pay . the higher duty,. and that he cannot send back , the bottles because his name is blown on them. He does not know whether he ought to send more orders to the old country. . He is willing to give his orders locally, and I believe that it is possible to make the bottles here. In. fact, arrangements are being made by our glass works to produce any kind of bottle. the honourable member give him? solation to the gentleman, because I knew that the Government could not do what he desired.

But, as his name is blown on the bottles, he could not return them. Would it be fair for me to ask that an important industry like that should be considered before the wire-netting industrv ? member is getting off the track when the honourable member for East Sydney is commencing to cheer him. members of the Opposition are cheering me the Minister of Trade and Customs is smiling, because he knows that the Opposition intend to vote with the Government in this matter. But I believe that some members on the other side will also vote with me. When we are dealing with the Tariff, we ought not to consider for one moment what is thought by the press, or by a State Premier, or any little schemer. We ought to do a fair-and square thing, arid that is to take the Tariff line by line. If I were disposed to give prior consideration to any item, I would ask honourable members to deal with the duty on magazines, which represent the brains of the whole world. The booksellers and their agents are ordering the Christmas numbers of the magazines which, as honourable members are aware, are very bulky. Surely it would be a fair thing to deal with the duty on magazines before we proceeded to consider the duty on wire-netting, but I do not ask that that course should -be taken. Some of the items suggested by the honourable member for Dalley are-not of much importance, while others are of pressing importance. It seems to did me that, in determining which items are of importance, every honourable member has an eye upon the people in his electorate. I am sure that the honourable member for Bass, who is in a great hurry to get on with the Tariff, is very much interested in getting the duty taken off chairs. No doubt, if he could get his way, he would like the that item to be dealt with to-morrow. that chairs shall be exempted from duty. the Minister carried out the promise which he gave, even though, in my opinion, it was a very foolish one; but that is no reason why the rest of the Government should stand by him. ment. He could not isolate himself the Government he acted very inconsiderately, because I do not think that, in a matter of this kind, he should have spoken on their behalf without having consulted some of his colleagues. I cannot believe for a moment that any other Minister would have supported such a foolish proposal. minded that he has to speak for the corner as well as for the Government. bers in the corner can always speak for themselves, and speak freely. They speak for the Government when they are right, and against them when they are wrong. When the Government are wrong, and we want to give them something like a castigation, we always find the Opposition rushing to their rescue, just as they will do on this occasion.",43,William Lyne I Said I Would With A Great Affectation Of Regret Declares

Perhaps it suits the district which he represents. But there are a good many honourable members who oome from other parts of the Commonwealth which are interested in other items. Buti f honourable members sit here dumb and simply vote for or against the motion, they will find it very awkward to explain their action. At this stage, I think it is quite sufficient for me to protest against the action of the Government, and to endeavour, as I have done, to show that, if precedence is to be given to any items, it should be to those items in which people who are suffering most, and are least able to defend themselves,are interested. Those people, certainly, are not the producers who require wire-netting, and who cannot get it unless they pay a little more for it at the present, time, considering that the extra payment could easily be remitted by the various States Governments. -The honourable member for Hindmarsh has, I th nk, destroyed the effect of his ; speech and his logic by his ardour and vefrmenre.

[ 52]2 T withstandingI shall not say "" therefore,"" because it may be a coincidenceI am willing to reduce the duty, recognising as I do that one of the primary industries depends on the price of this particular article,not merely from the point of view of individual considerations, but as affecting the employment of a very large number of people in the country districts. There are no farms in my constituency, which is composed of thickly populated suburbs. I do not suppose a rabbit can be seen there from one year's end to the other, except in poulterers' shops. At the same time, all of us must get to a consider the big industries of the country; that is why I am in favour of giving precedence to items like that of wire-netting and mining machinery. food and clothing? think that the items of wire-netting and mining machinery have a sort of geometrica'i effect on the industries which they represent. Those who know anything of mining-and I spieak more particularly of Western Australia-ar e aware that many mining enterprises are depending entirely dn the question whether mining machinery is or is not to be admitted free, or with a small duty. What are called "" low grade"" enterprises are hanging in the balance, and hundreds and thousands of men are awaiting employment pending the decision of that question. There is no need for warmth, because this is a cold economic question. The honourable member for Hindmarsh has insisted on the tremendous hardship inflicted on his constituents because of the duty on kerosene. That duty is 3d. per gallon; and in a small household a gallon will probably last a fortnight or a month. It would appear, therefore, that, for the purpose of saving three-halfpence a fortnight, or, it may be, a month, in a small household, we should now refrain from dealing immediately with certain items on which the employment of hundreds and thousands of men depend, and to whom the delav mav involve, not three-halfpence per week, but their whole means of supporting their families.

We desire to deal with all the items in the Tariff, but most of us pay some regard to the interests of the large primary industries. In selecting the mining industry as an illustration, I am not considering my own constituency, within 50 or 100 miles of which there is not a mine. Strange to say, the industry of wire-netting manufacture, the item in relation to which I urge should be dealt with quickly, is carried on in my constituency; and I have no doubt I shall incur the displeasure of a large number of people by seeming to desire to remove the tentative duty from the commodity on which their industry is wrongly supposed to depend. for the honourable member, because those interested in that industry would not vote for him in any case. that it is safe, but, at any rate, that is not a consideration in my political life.

I sympathize with those-who desire to get on with the Tariff, but 1 think the Committee ought to have an opportunity of saying whether or not certain items should be given priority. I think that the method which has been adopted of piling amendment on amendment is the longest way round. perfectly open to an honourable member to move that all the items prior to wire netting should be postponed until after that item has been considered, and that when that had been disposed of, it would be equally open to any other honourable member to move that the whole of the items as they then stand should be postponed until after some other selected item had been disposed of. to deal with an item before that of wire netting, but after the item last dealt with? that would matter. that it did. bound by the Chairman's ruling, I do not think the Chairman is right in that matter. Just as the Government frequently postpone item after item on the business-paper, sometimes twice or three times in succession, I think we could move the postponement of the whole of the items until after that of mining machinery, and then the Committee would have an opportunity of saying whether or not they would agree to that course. If the Committee did agree, it would be a clear indication thathonorable members thought it desirable to deal with each of such items before other items. able member cannot discuss that matter now. so; I am merely pointing out what would be the advantage if-the Chairman did not rule again in the way he has done. It would then be open to any honourable member to move the postponement of all the items which stand prior to some other item. The Committee would then have the advantage of saying whether or not they thought the item was of sufficient importance to justify the postponement of other items, and thus we might get through the half-dozen or more items which certain honourable members seem desirous to have first considered. If there is any way of getting round your ruling, Mr Chairman, I should be very glad to secure for the Committee an opportunity of dealing with the items in the way I have suggested. The honourable member for Hindmarsh spoke very strongly when he said he was here to talk in order that his constituents might hear what he had to say. said. ber used words to that effect.

Although we have enjoyed a. long period of prosperity there is now a danger of drought, and it is urgently necessary that wire fencing should be put up to keep out the rabbits. I do not often find occasion to sav that what the Government are doing is right, but on this occasion I think they are doing right in proposing that the duty on wire-netting shall be considered immediately. I therefore give them my cordial support. In view of the fact that a number of items have been put forward for special consideration, I also desire to propose that item 177, Mining Engines and Machinery, n.e.i., item 178, Electrical Machinery, item 179, Electrical and Gas Appliances, and item 180, Electrical Materials, be considered as' early as possible. I am credibly informed that a great deal of the electrical mining machinery required in the mines cannot be manufactured in Australia. make it. I am also informed by a mine manager that the present Tariff would leave him out of pocket to the extent of about £3,000 in respect to electrical machinery. In his mines electricity furnishes the whole of the motive power, because wood has become so scarce. There is no honourable member who is more anxious to see the duty on wire-netting settled than I am. I think that every honourable member is in sympathy with the men who are struggling against the abominable rabbit pest. They are having a very hard fight. Some months ago I paid a special visit to the heart of one of the dislieve-indee d I urged last week-that we tricts where the. people are coping with the rabbits, and some of the settlers told me that at times they were in such despair that they asked themselves: "" I s it worthwhile to continue the struggle or not? Shall we go in for the rabbit industry, and drop the wool industry ? "" I shall be very pleased to see the matter dealt with as early as possible, though it seems to me that the Government have made a mistake in proposing tp depart from the order of the schedule. I think that any honourable member who is an expert in regard to any particular item is justified in giving reasons why he thinks it necessary that that item should be dealt with as early as possible. But it appears to me, nevertheless, that complications will be brought about by taking wire-netting out of its order. With regard to the item itself, we have had the statement that wire-netting has already been reduced in price. member must not go into the merits ' or demerits of the proposed duty. have an opportunity of discussing that question at a later stage? stand that the honourable member wishes to move an amendment? If so, I point out that there are already two amendments before the Committee. It will not be in order for the honourable member to move a further amendment just now. the amendments already before the Chair have been disposed of. I intimate now that I desire to secure precedence for items 177, 178, 179, and 180.

I rather think that the present position is due to the interpretation placed upon the recommendations of the Tariff Commission.

We considered them to such an extent thousands of miles of fencing, which would that we refused to impose duties on 107 give employment to a large number of men, items which the free-trade section of the remain in abeyance, pending the decision Commission recommended should be dutiof Parliament regarding the duty on wireable. adopted the whole of our recommendations we should have had a very fair Tariff. the Minister of Trade ""and Customs is that the Treasurer told us in this House that he had not troubled to consider the recombe obmendations of the free-trade section of the Commission. that he said that. plainly that he would not be bound by the recommendations of any section of the Commission, and that he paid very little heed to the Commission' as a whole; yet, when anomalies in the Tariff are pointed out, who are so ready to shelter themselves behind the Commission as the Ministers responsible for those anomalies? However, the anomalies are in the Tariff, and we we point them out, as deputation after deputa-tion has pointed them out, to the Government. The Minister should be glad of the I should like opportunity furnished by the Committee to rectify them at the earliest moment. I say nothing about the duty on magazines, to which reference has been made by the honourable member for West Sydney.

My constituents are nearly all workers, and I hope the same applies to the honourable member's constituency. Whilst there are a great number of electors in his constituency interested in wire-netting, there are a very great number of electors in mine interested in altogether different items. If there is one constituency in Australia that is not going to reap any appreciable benefit-a t all events immediately-fro m a highly protective Tariff, it is Kalgoorlie. the duties for them last time. the honourable member for Grey endeavoured to assist the people of Kalgoorlie.

I frankly admit that a good deal of what the honourable member for Grey says is quite true, and that the Minisin an interjection. I understood the Treater has been approached from different sides of the Committee with the object of getting this item placed in a prominent position on the list. But, although that is so, no obligation is thrown upon those honourable members who have resisted the proposal, and who believe that it is not going to save time, to sit silent and allow a proposition which they believe to be contrary to the expeditious conduct of business to pass without question. This is ""about the only matter upon which I have ventured an opinion during the discussion on the Tariff. Any departure from the order in which the items appear on the list will inevitably occupy more time in debate as to which item should be taken first than would be occupied if those items were reached in the ordinary course of events. It looks like it, at any rate. After -we have debated this question for a few hours more, it will probably look even more like it. This is one of those junctures when it is absolutely essential for those who hold a particular view to express their opinions in no uncertain language. If we start out on a correct basis now, thoroughly debate the matter, test the question on wire-netting, and that will undoubtedly be brought forward if wire-netting is to be considered a very much longer period than was estimated by the author of the motion. submitting it., From the stand-point, of their relative importance, there is no .justification whatever for postponing the consideration of other items in order to give precedence to that of wire-netting.

390,Mr Frazer,"The interests of thethink that the duty upon that article is second in importance to the impost upon wire-netting. Then, my own constituency is vitally interested in the duties collected upon mining machinery'. Australia is interested in that question. advised by the Kalgoorlie Chamber of Mines that if the Tariff be passed in its present form, it will increase the expenses of the Western Australian mines by £70,000 per annum. Bearing in mind the small margin of profit upon which some mining companies have to work in their treatment of highly refractory ores, I say that the duties upon some mining machinery which cannot be obtained in Australia is of more importance than is the duty upon wire-netting. A larger number of persons are interested in this item than in wire-netting, and as a representative of a mining constituency, which will receive very little benefit from the Tariff, I am justified in saying that this item should receive consideration equal to that given to any other. If there is to be an alteration in the order on magazines, the result will be to cripple in which the items are to be considered, the Committee will have an opportunity of testing the importance of the item affecting mining machinery. In this connection, also, I may refer to the proposed increase of the duty on oregon timber from 6d. to is. 6d. per 100 feet. No doubt the object in view, that Australian timber may be more largely used in mining, is a most laudable one, but the safety of life in connection with the mining industry renders the use of oregon timber for mining purposes in some districts almost essential. ber that ""talks."" miners, it is the only timber that "" talks "" before it is going to smash, and thus gives warning to the men who hiave to work under it. a stronger timber, that can be procured in Australia, and that need not "" talk"" at all? bition, ibut I remind the honourable member, who represents a farming constituency, and is naturally interested in wire-netting, that number of divisions of the Tariff in the those whose lives depended on the merits or demerits of timber used in the industry which they follow, have been able to get Australian timber without having to pay a duty on it, and yet have preferred' to use a timber on which they have had to pay duty. If the proposed duty is imposed on oregon timber, those who have been using it for mining purposes may be induced, at the risk of life, to use a timber that is entirely unsuitable, and this may lead to disaster. I am not in favour of anything of that kind, and if other items are to be taken out of their turn, it may f airly be contended that the proposed duty on oregon timber is one deserving of special consideration. Then there is an increase in the duty on agricultural machinery from 12\ to 20 per cent. That is an imposition on the great primary industry which the honourable member for Wimmera is so anxious to serve, and I have no doubt that, if he went intofigures,he could show that the amount involved in connection with that item is of greater consequence to the farmers than the amount involved in the proposed duty on wire-netting. Then there is the duty proposed on magazines. We have had deputations in connection with it, and have been advised that if the present Tariff rate is continued or ruin one great importing and distributing house, and to seriously affect the interests of the numerous vendors of magazines throughout the Commonwealth. We had a similar proposal submitted in connection with magazines in considering the Tariff some time ago, and if personal interests might be imported into the debate, the case made out by the importing house referred to is as strong as that which might be made out in connection with many other items. But the question we have to ask is whether the case submitted is sufficient to warrant interference with the whole of the proposals of the Government in the interests of the country. I""might refer to many other items, such as chairs, candles, blue, and to the 20 per cent, duty proposed on fire extinguishers. If the item of wire-netting is to be given precedence, I feel that an obligause tion will be thrown on the Committee to take a division on the question of giving preference to every one of the items I have enumerated. I repeat that this is the worse possible means that could have been adopted to procure a speedy settlement of the Tariff.

I have listened to it for the greater part of the night, and it has shown me the absolute impossibility of the Committee definitely' deciding that there are items which we can proceed with in preference to others. has given us very good reasons for the selection of certain items, and another for the selection of other items, and if we accepted what has been said to-night as proving the need for urgent treatment of the items named, we should pick out a great many items, and deal with the Tariff in a higgedly-piggedly fashion, although by going straight through the schedule we could dispose of our work much more quickly. UntilI had heard this discussion, I was under the impression that halfa-dozen items could fairly be selected for advance consideration, but the Government made a serious mistake in suggesting preference for the wire-netting item alone. What has been said in favour of that course could be urged with equal force in regard to many other items. If any particular duty is inflicting a definite and unavoidable hardship, it is undoubtedly that on magazines. I do not know why the Government imposed it, unless in excessive zeal for the protection of the literary talent of Australia. I think that public opinion is in favour of mingling with Australian literary productions a proportion from outside, and, so far as the public demand affords a criterion, the local productions are not at present sufficient. Therefore, consideration might well be given to the unfortunate importers of magazines in preference to persons affected by the other items which have been mentioned. I ask, too, how will the picking out of items fit in with the proposal to send the Tariff to the Senate in divisions, to accelerate the work of Parliament, and enable us to get back to our constituencies within a reasonable period. Looking at the matter as impartially as I can, I think that we shall be well advised if we continue the consideration of the Tariff in the order of its schedule. If , when doing so, honourable members are as brief as possible, we, who come from distant States, may be able, before the year is out, to make an appearance in our constituencies for the benefit of those who wonder why we find Melbourne so attractive that we spend little time with them, or even in the States which we represent. I hope that the Gov vernment will drop the proposal to give special treatment to the wire-netting item. the promise given a week ago? a promise was given. The Treasurer may have made a more or less indefinite stateOne honourable member ment, but, after the discussion which has taken place, he should reconsider the position, and admit the unfairness of taking any one item out of its order. I challenge him, or any other honourable member, to mention half-a-dozen items as urgent which could not be balanced by another half dozen of equal urgency. Therefore, as sensible men, we should recognise that we can get through our work most quickly by dealing with the items as they .stand in the schedule. stand that the Treasurer has promised to give first consideration to the wire-netting item, and, therefore, I point out that if that item alone is dealt with, and the duty is reduced, the local manufacturers will be placed in an unfortunate position, because there is a duty of 10 per cent. on. wire, n.e.i., and the wire used to make netting comes chiefly from America. going to vote against the duty on wire netting ? question when I have heard what the Minister and other honourable members have to say for and against the proposal.

But I now recognise that it is impossible to reach the item to-night. Some honourable members have manifested a fearful and wonderful desire to speak all round the Tariff without reaching the main issue. I do not suppose that if the present objection to an immediate consideration of the duty on wire-netting had not been taken, we should iby this time have been any nearer to the point at which we are aiming, because some other issue would have been raised, which would have caused delay. I hold that the Government are not only meeting the wishes of a large number of honourable members, but are endeavouring to consult the interests of the Commonwealth in proposing to bring forward the item at an early stage of the debate upon the Tariff. Of course, I recognise that there are other items which are of primary importance. this is the only one which he intends to take out of its order. pared to give similar precedence to other important items. member is not the leader of the Government. use regretting the impossible. The honourable member who interjects has advocated that special consideration should be given to kerosene. The people of my electorate are as vitally interested in that' item as are There is no need to enter into the history of the rabbit invasion, but some honourable members have failed to realize that the rabbit evil has extended from the purely pastoral areas into the agrifrom rabbit destruction. But during the cultural districts, and that unless special efforts are made to assist the farmers to protect their holdings, the whole country will suffer. City men, like the honourable member for Dalley, seem to think that this is a question of minor importance. But they will soon discover that unless the rabcrops failed, but because. the rabbits ate bit pest is coped with the very source of the wealth of this community will be dried up. I was astonished to hear honourable members urging that the whole Tariff, with its 444 items, should be taken as it stands, and that no precedence should -be given to major over minor items. In my opinion, the whole debate would be demoralized by such a proceeding. We should have the important items wedged in amongst' a number of minor importance. ber recollect any deviation from the order of a Tariff during its consideration by Parliament ? regard to this very matter. In 1902, the general duties affecting the iron duties were postponed for the purpose of giving consideration to wire-netting I do not understand how the honourable member for Cook, with his knowledge of country conditions, can fail to appreciate the reason why the Government of New South Wales, departing from the policy of non-interference in commercial matters, entered into competition with private enterprise in the importation of wire-netting. Does not the honourable member think that, before any Government would take such a drastic step, it would .have urgent reasons behind it? They did it for the purpose of assisting the primary producer. urgent than duties affecting the food of the people. the people is dependent upon this question. The honourable member may soon find that the food of the people of his electorate has been dried up at its source if the rabbit pest is not effectually dealt with. every political question is one of food, but we do not live on wire-netting, for all that. this is a matter of primary importance in connection with our food supplies. I know men in mv electorate who have cultivated their land for thirty-five years without loss last two years they have practically lost all that they have put into the land, not through drought, but through destruction by rabbits. Last year they had to buy fodder in Svdney, at a very high price, to feed their stock-no t because their fodder them Some honourable members do not seem to realize the seriousness of the position.

On making inquiries at leading warehouses, I found that Messrs. Lysaght Brothers would not supply, small land-owners with wire-netting; that they had to be supplied by the warehouses, and that the squatters who were prepared to place large orders with the firm were told that their orders could not be executed for nine or twelve months. When the Government introduced the Tariff, I obtained from leading Sydney houses quotations for wire netting on behalf of my constituents, and found that Lysaght Brothers' A and B brands were, being retailed in Sydney at from £ 4 0 to £ 4 5 per mile. On the other hand, the Government were supplying for £ 2 6 per mile imported wire-netting equal to, if not better than, that manufactured by Lysaght Brothers, and retailed at £ 4 0 per mile. An honourable member has told us that Lysaght Brothers have reduced their prices by £ 1 per mile. That is a mere bagatelle. Even with such a reduction the price of Lysaght Brothers' netting would be considerably in excess of that charged by the Government for imported netting, plus the duty. Honourable members are anxious to look after the interests of the workers engaged in the industry. A few months ago there appeared in the newspapers reports showing that men were working for Lyiaght Brothers at sweating wages. Experts received only about £ 2 per week, and the remuneration of others was so low that they went on strike. Many of them, failing to secure the desired terms, tion to the State manufacture of netting. sought other avocations rather than return to the factory under the old conditions. Boards in New South Wales? 1 have there a Conciliation and Arbitration Court, and those interested in sweating manage to spike the wheels of that industrial machine, and so hamper its effectiveness. And yet honourable members say that they have not heard any argument in support of the contention that preference should be given to the consideration of this item. The arguments are so patent that every one must recognise them. The ex-Minister for Lands in New South Wales, Mr Ashton, when the duty was first proposed, saidOf the 4,000 miles to be supplied under the If the Government could have current Government contract, about 2,500 have been delivered, leaving about 1,500 miles yet to be delivered. Of this, about 480 miles w i ll arrive next week, on which the Government w i ll have to pay duty to the extent of over ^3,000. The imposition of the duty raised by £3,000 the price of the wire-netting imported by the State and in the process of being deliveredAt present, wire-netting is free. The total duty payable in respect of the quantity yet to be received under the contract, is about ,£10,000, and having regard to the average quantity of netting per individual up to date, that ;£io,ooo will be paid by about %oo persons. He went on to say thatThe duty will increase the price of 42-inch wire-netting from £26 to £32 ios. per mile, and the 36-inch wire-netting from £22 ios. to ^28 4s. 2d. i These figures show how the duty will affect users of wire-netting. At a later date, Mr Ashton intimated that the Government had applications for 9,000 miles of it. member think it would be very much better if the industry were under the ownership and control of the State? Government have been forced by the conditions obtaining in New South Wales to import wire-netting. Finding that the importers and manufacturers, taking advantage of the demand for wire-netting, had put up the price, and that in this way the wealth of the country was being sapped at its source, the Government determined to step in and assist the primary producers by making direct importations. Only one step has to be taken from State importapaid on the imported netting ? know. member does not care. do care.

The demand for wire-netting on the part of our primary producers has led the Victorian Government to propose to erect machinery for its manufacture here. good work is done, I do not think that there will be any objection on that score. The primary producers, at all events, will be assisted by the adoption of the course proposed by the Government of Victoria. Those who say that this matter is not urgent argue against evidence submitted to them every day by means of deputations, circulars, and other representations. Only to-day, I handed to the Treasurer a sheaf of communications that I had received from representative bodies of all"" kinds in my electorate-resolutions , passed at public meetings by Farmers and Settlers! Associations, Pastures Protection Boards, local shire councils, and other bodips. I do not think that any other item in the Tariff has evoked so-much criticism as this one has done. I know of no duty that has called for more unanimous condemnation than the impost upon wire-netting. I hope that the Government will stand by their guns in regard to the motion to give priority of consideration to the item. there are otlier important items in .the schedule, which the Government would be wise to bring forward as speedily as possible. In that way, they would reach a more satisfactory settlement of the Tariff, and the minor items Avould not be debated at such great length, but would be practically dealt with On a vote of the Committee. Let us get to the important items, so that the (Committee may not be on pins and needles, waiting for months to know when an important item will be considered, while a number of minor ones are being talked to death, or used, as a means of blocking the fair consideration of those of more importance, affecting a large section of the community. I regret that the. Government have met with so much opposition to the motion, but I trust that they will adhere to the position they have taken up, and get the more important items out of the road as speedily as possible. 'honourable member for Cook stated that he was at a loss to know why members who were in favour of the motion to .give priority of consideration to wire-netting did not stand up and defend it. [iS3] reason is that we have nothing to defend. I congratulate the Minister on the proposal to bring wire-netting on first. Instead of a duty being imposed on wire netting, a bonus should be given to the farmers for using it. I notice that the only members who are opposing the motion are those representing large centres of 1 population. over the cigarette makers for a week, and now they cannot drop a tear for the farmer. If this was an item affecting manufacturers in Melbourne, the whole of those honourable members would be howling for it to be placed first, but the position is different when it is a question of helping a primary industry. I interjected that so far as the primary industries were concerned, we were getting no help af all from this Government. We do not look for any, because we know that we shall not get it. The honourable member for Cook, who was armed with a mass of figures, said that the manufacturers of wire-netting in New South Wales had given the Treasurer the assurance that the price of their product would always be £ 1 under that of the imported article. How good the honourable I recognise that member is to give that assurance ! The price of wire-nettingfluctuatesin the same way as does the price of any metal, and we thank him for nothing. The pastoral and agricultural industries of Australia are the backbone of the Commonwealth. They have to send their produce abroad. ing industry. able member for Barrier to look after that. My constituency is purely pastoral and agricultural. There is a little mining, but not much. The whole of the western portions of Queensland are devoted to pastoral and agricultural pursuits. I am reminded by the Attorney-General that there is an alluvial gold mine at Clermont, silvermines at An'akie, and opal mines in the far south-western and central western portions of Queensland. The people there,' however, are as anxious as any one else for this item to be settled quickly. The present duty on wire-netting means £ 8 70s. a mile extra to those who use the 0 article.

I suggest that a division be taken on the item suggested by the honourable member for Dalley, when there will be no necessity to divide on the question relating to item 187. But if we are to be kept here until we decide, in regard to item 187, I shall feel morally bound to support the honourable member for Dalley, and he, of course, will support me, and we shall be here all night. All-night sittings do not appeal to me, but I know that if we reach a certain stage, we-shall remain here. objects more than I do myself to all-night sitings. The items I have selected are sago, tapioca, candles, currants, rice, apparel, and woollens, and I select these in order that the Committee may have an opportunity of saying that if there is to be any precedence it shall not be confined to wire netting, but shall extend to the necessaries of life. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie has made a wise suggestion, but I do not see why he has selected item 28. my purpose. tural products and groceries as a means of indicating that the Committee are desirous that if there is to be any precedence, it shall not be confined to wire-netting. The necessaries of life are quite as important as the industry of wire-netting. If the Committee add sago and tapioca to the items to which precedence shall be given, I understand the result will be to give precedence to wire-netting and five or six other items. But even if the Committee do not fall in with my proposal, the difficulty will* not be got over, because as soon as wire-netting has been dealt with I shall move that precedence be given to items embracing the necessaries of life. I ask leave to withdraw my amendment with a view to the taking, of a test vote on item 34, sago and tapioca. Amendment of the amendment, by leave, withdrawn. Amendment of the amendment (by Mr That the figures ""34"". be added. [11.24] I should like to understand the position. The honourable member for Kai-. I am quite willing to take an goorlie proposes, I believe, to test the question whether or not other items than wire netting shall also be taken. That, however, does not take us much further, because there still remains the question as to which items shall be selected, if we decide to take other items. Committee decide not to add the ifem of sago and tapioca, we shall proceed to deal with item 187. other items. item 187, honourable members will be freeto propose precedence to other items. to re-open the debate, after we had closed it by deciding to take item 187. We areproposing to make a further selection. It seems to me that' that will lead to a difficulty. Anxious as I have been to see someother items put in the preferential cate-. gory, I am bound to say that we shall land ourselves in difficulties, and I shall, therefore, be compelled to confine my vote for the present to special treatment being given to wire-netting. surer) [11.26] I understand that honourable members are agreed that a vote with reference to giving special treatment to theitem tapioca is not to be considered as an expression of opinion on the item itself. It will merely be a test concerning the desire of some honourable members to givespecial consideration to other items thanwire-netting. Of course, any honorablememiber has a right to move that special consideration be given to any item. That right cannot be taken away. I hope that we shall now come to a division, the result of which will show, the extent to which honourable members desire to take items out of their regular order.
