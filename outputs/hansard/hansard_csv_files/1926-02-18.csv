Commonwealth legislation there is no distinction between a felony and a misdemeanour, and, accordingly, section 8 is difficult to apply. section 8A is for the purpose of conferring power of arrest without warrant only where tbe requirements of paragraphs a and 6 of the proposed section are fulfilled. It is not proposed to give a general power of arrest without warrant. The conditions of paragraphs a and b are that the constable must have reasonable ground for believing "" that the person has committed an offence against the law of the Commonwealth,"" and "" that proceedings against the person by summons would not be effective."" refers to cases in which the offender by absconding might evade service of the summons, and to cases in which, if he were summoned, the proceedings might not be effective, because he might not put in an appearance at the court. have legislation providing for arrest without warrant in a large number of cases.

Therefore, the law in New South Wales to-day is practically the same as that provided in paragraph a of the proposed new section 8A without the limitation imposed by paragraph b.

A t common law a conOne result of dealing with this subject of arrest without warrant in separate statutes is that a constable is apt to be uncertain of his powers.

When an act is made an offence under the The proposed new law it is proper to allow an arrest without warrant if the constable has reasonable ground to believe the facts set out in paragraphs a and b of the clause. If a constable were to act without reasonable ground-and that would be a matter entirely for a jury-h e would be liable to heavy damages. The objection to the provision for arresting persons guilty of industrial offences is not really associated with this, clause; it raises the question whether there should be industrial offences. If there be industrial offences, they must be treated as breaches of the The second paragraph law, and the ordinary procedure of the law must be applied to them. The alternative to introducing a general section, safeguarded as this one is, is to consider whether it is necessary to insert a special provision for arrest without warrant m The States each of the bills brought before this House.

I know of no industrial offence to which this principle could apply. The object of the clause is to deal with cases such as I have mentioned. know of no other law which providesthat the onus of proving his innocence shall rest with the person accused. Under the Roman law, I believe that that is the position, but British law throws upon the prosecutor the onus of proving the guilt of the person accused. I do not think that the committee will stand for an alteration of that fundamental principle of British justice. The case instanced by the Attorney-General is different from this one. Before voting for the clause, I should like him to give some better reason for its inclusion in the bill. A person who is charged with an offence is sometimes awkwardly placed because of his inability to get bail or to obtain proper legal advice. He may not be aware that he has committed an offence. Unless a better reason for the inclusion of this clause is given, the comhe would be prosecuted under a State mittee would be well advised to reject it . Personally, I think that it has been inserted to see whether members of the Opposition are alive to the danger of such a vital principle being interfered with. true, as the Attorney-General has stated, that various measures now on the statute book provide that the burden of proving his innocence shall be thrown upon the accused.

To say that under any law of the Commonwealtli any act, if done without lawful authority, is an offence against that law, and that the burden of proof of his innocence rests on the offender, seems to be a breach of the principles of British justice. should like to ask the Attorney General( Mr Latham) if a person who ventures on to a wharf in connection with a union's business becomes guilty of an offence if he goes on that wharf without lawful authority? charged with trespassing, in which case law, but this section would not apply to him. sity defer to the legal knowledge of the. honourable and learned member, but we are naturally suspicious of a bill of this kind which deals with industrial offences.

The absence of that Honourable members of the Opposition do not stand for violent revolution. There is nothing better than adult suffrage, It is. In such a which permits the people of a country to determine everything for themselves. But the proposed provision lends itself to criticism, and certainly calls for explanation. The words, "" The overthrow of the Constitution of the Commonwealth by revolution or sabotage "" are too indefinite.

I could underfrom a factory, and stand the provision better if the words '' violent revolution "" were used. Authorities admit that a revolution may be brought about in a legitimate manner, and that it may not necessarily be sought to be achieved in contravention of the settled policy of a country. In substantiation of this point, I quote resolution 74 of the Industrial Policy of the Church of England, adopted at the Lambeth conference. It reads as follows: An outstanding and pressing duty of the Church is to convince its members of the necessity of nothing less than a fundamental It change in the spirit and working of our economic life. DeanH a r t, of Melbourne, in a pamphlet dealing with the resolution, explains what was meant by a "" fundamental change ""A "" fundamental change"" is a revolution. I do not mean a violent one.

MrA . GREEN (Kalgoorlie) [4.5] I believe that all honourable members agree that the provisions in the bill under which penalties can be imposed upon those desiring by violence to overthrow constitutional government in Australia are necessary, but I regret that the Government has thought it necessary to bring in special legislation to deal with these people, as by doing so they are making martyrs of them. Similar action has not been taken in GreatB r it a in or other civilized countries. necessary, for political purposes, to promise legislation of this nature during an election campaign, there is no occasion for members of the Government and those supporting them to make it appear that the members of the Labour party are in any. way associated with communists.

The honourable member for Angas said that there has been an intrusion into the ranks of labour of communists who are anti-Christian. MrA .

The honourable member calls the Creator of mankind into political disputes. He wants the A l mighty on his side.

GREEN latest articleThe great communists, like Plato, More, Saint-Simon, Bobert Owen, were the very reverse of selfish or idle in their aims; and communism as a force in the historical evolution of economic and social opinion must be regarded on its ideal side, and not merely in its lapses, however natural the latter may be in operation, owing to the defects of human character. As a theory it has' inspired not only some of tbe finest characters in history, but also much of the gradual evolution of economic organization, especially in the case of co-operation (q.v.); and its opportunities have naturally varied according to the state of social organization in particular countries. The following should widen the knowledge of the honourable member for Angas: The communism of the early Christians, for instance, was rather a voluntary sharing of private property than any abnegation of properly as such. I am not here to support or condone the teachings of any people in Austraha who claim to bo communists, and who speak of using force in order to achieve their objective. I do not think that possible; but I deprecate the actions of honourable members who, under the plea of debating this matter in a spirit of sweet reasonableness, endeavour to prove that every reformer in this country has his hands gilded with Russian gold or covered with blood. On the one hand we are told that the communists have brought Russia to such a f e a r f u l pass that the people are starving, and in the next breath we are informed that throughout the civilized world, and particularly in the British Empire, they are spending millions in propaganda. If honourable members opposite think that the people of Russia or elsewhere are providing vast sums of money to assist the communists or the Labour party in Australia, the way is open to them to join the Labour party and thereby get their share of the money we are supposed to be receiving. I wish to quote other authorities, including one whose opinions are considered of value in this chamber. There is, for instance, the following definition of socialism; as adopted at the Lambeth Conference: Socialism itself as a scheme of brotherhood is the outcome of the life and teaching of Jesus Christ. Use property as a trust, use one's life as a trust, lent by God to be used, in His sight, for the benefit of brother man. this is the doctrine of Christ and the truth of socialism. Those gathered at the Lambeth conference I quote fro m the have, I know, a better knowledge of ecclesiastical matters than a lay reader, such as the honourable member for Angas. Let us see what the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) has to say on this subject, in his publication entitled The Casef o r Labour. Although the right honourable gentleman is now a member of another political party, I consider his knowledge of industrial matters equal to that of any honourable member on this side of the chamber. He is the only honourable member opposite who has the slightest knowledge of the Australian worker's view-point and position, and consequently his opinion should be of value. Dealing with the cause of unemployment, he says:Unemployment is the modern riddle of the Sphinx, which society must solve, and that speedily, or perish. Instead of debating this bill , which proposes to depart industrial leaders, we would be more usefully occupied in considering methods whereby this great riddle could be solved. We have heard a good deal of the losses caused by strikes in this country, but it has been shown by figurespublished by the Commonwealth Statistician, that those arising from unemployment are ten times greater.

But some, on the other of u n e m p l o y m e n t, t h e r i g h t honourable gentleman saysLet UB consider a little the causes of unemployment and some possible remedies. Private ownership of land is undoubtedly a primary cause; private ownership of capital is another. cient fertile land for at least 50,000,000 people, it is absurd that with' a population of under 5,000,000 there should be unemployed men. Buti t is not less absurd that with capital amply sufficient to employ a population much larger than our present one there should coexist idle capital and workless men. These are the primary and, so to speak, passive causes of unemployment. on active cause that I propose to deal with here, the manufacture of the unemployed man by employers of labour. There is no feature about the present unsystematized methods of production so tragic as. the manner in which private enterprise deliberately creates for its own selfish ends an army of unfortunates who are chained to their ringbolt in the industrial inferno by relentless necessity, as surely as were the galley slaves of old to the oar by fetters of iron. THE There is, as every one knows, only one way in which a five-year-old child can become a man-h e must grow and mature. There are many ways .by which he may be helped to become a healthy, strong, skilful, and wise man, rather than a sickly, weakly, unskilled, and foolish one; but only one way in which lie can become a man. He must grow and develop in the natural way. Socialism w ill come if it is to come-as I believe it w ill in due time; just as manhood comes to a boy. And its coming w ill cause no more astonishment than does the boy's arrival at what we call manhood. That is to say, it w ill cause no astonishment at a l l ; for its growth w ill have been so gradual as to almost escape attention, as does the growth of all things in the eye3 of those who see them daily. Indeed, this development of the social organism w ill be even less noticeable than adolescence in the human organism. A boy becomes a man, but his parents remain man iand woman. He changes, they change too, but much less than he. But with the social organism it is different. There are, so to speak, no lookers on, and the change runs through the whole sphere; those who stand by relatively unaffected by the processes operating in and upon others are a negligible quantity. The social organism as a whole is affected'. Complete collectivism, when we get that far, will appear the most ordinary, natural, and inevitable thing in the world to those who live under it . It w ill be as ordinary, natural, and inevitable as that a young man who is 21 a year ago should be 22 to-day. There w ill be no abrupt and rude transition from private enterprise to socialism, but every stage w ill follow upon a preceding one, preparing all men to expect, to anticipate, and to desire it . Many will think it a perfect or, at any rate. ' the best possible system, as many have thought every system under which they have lived i a hand, w ill not, and a few will peisistently denounce it as the few always denounced a l l systems. But even to these, as to a l l , the system then existing w ill be quite natural, for they w ill have either known no otlier, or have reached it along a road which was then the only and inevitable road that men could take, In Australia, where there is suffiand from which socialism had long stood out as the only and inevitable goal. If the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) were to preach that doctrine to-day, he would be in grave danger of being penalized under the proposed law. It is with ney-General may split straws, unquestionably the fundamental purpose of the bill is a crusade upon ideas. Even in the Mother of Parliaments, which hitherto we have considered not quite so democratic as Australian legislative institutions, nobody has dared to attempt to ONL Y WAY SOCIALISM CAN COME. legislate in the manner proposed in this bill. I have not quoted The Case for Labour in any spirit of hostility to the right honourable member for North Sydney, but merely to support my contention that any citizen of the Commonwealth should have the right to express to-day the ideas which the right honourable gentleman expressed years ago when he was a leader of Labour. No man can predict the future state of society, but we need not be afraid of ideas. Even in religions new sects spring up and make war upon the older order. Jock Garden is, I understand, a member of the same denomination as the honourable member for Angas( Mr Parsons), and, whereas the latter is merely a local preacher, the former solemnizes marriages. Yet the honourable member declares Jock Garden's Christianity to be wrong, whilst Jock Garden says that the honourable member is devoid of christian charity. I advise the honourable member to be less vindictive and less narrow. The intolerance of rival christian sects has been responsible for a good deal of trouble in the world, but at times they unite to make an onslaught upon agnosticism, which is not without influential supporters, even in this chamber.

But afterwards, when hired labour became more economical than chattel slaves, the American people abolished slavery. Therefore, I say we should cherish above nil things the right of the reformer to preach the faith that is in him. It is scarcely necessary for me to restate my attitude towards the fantastic ideas of the communists. what they preach than I. endorse the absurd defence of the fascists by the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr not subsequently come into power which Maxwell). prepared to crush the communists, but he would allow the fascists to assume the reins of government and maintain peace and order according to their methods. He may try to make himself believe that the Australian and the Italian fascists have nothing in common, but both bear the same name, and there is not the Mr A. slightest doubt that their ideas are If the Government identical. Some honourable members opposite have warned us against the possibility of repeating in Australia the horrors perpetrated under Soviet rule in Russia. I advise them to read BedI t is a thrilling story of Russia in the time of the Czar, when no man's life was Not so safe, and when a person who expressed general views different from those of the oligarchy was sent to Siberia. The people of Russia did not enjoy the privilege of adult suffrage as Australians do, and revolution was the only means of redress that was available to them. The honourable member for Riverina( Mr Killen) said that the bolsheviks had In America at one slaughtered 1,300,000 Russians. We do not know how many millions were slaughtered under the rule of the Czar. The Russian people have devised their own means for curing political and social evils, and even though in their fight for freedom they assassinated the Czar, let the William Lloyd Garrison, who fact not be forgotten' that the English people executed CharlesI . , and the was persecuted from one executioner, holding the head on high, said, "" Behold the head of a traitor!""

73,Mr Hughes (North Sydney) [4.35].,"be to go over again ground that was more or less covered during the debate on the motion for the second reading. Still there are points that yet need emphasis. I draw a sharp line of demarcation between the communist, the member of the Industrial Workers of the World, who believes in overturning constitutional government by force, the promoter of general strikes, the man who resorts to unconstitutional methods, and the unionist who, rightly or wrongly, strike. those who have not taken part in industrial struggles to understand just how strikes occur. An y attempt to analyse, tabulate, classify, and explain them must f a i l unless there is behind it experience and knowledge of the psychology of the unionist. One must see things the flected, which to him is the world of reality. dealing w i th this subject arises out of its complexity . 1 The question is, in some respects, a material one, but if one goes deeper, it is psychological. It maybe asked, why does one wing of the industrial army avow itself a believer in class war; why does it view with suspicion every act and utterance of the other wing, andregard the members. of that wing with suspicion and even hatred ? The not to-day, . but in the facts of history. understand the. Labour movement, they must remember that, during the. last 75 years, there has taken place a revolution so complete that, if in times gone by civilization might be regarded as a pyramid resting on its base, it is now poised on its apex. Of course, those who believe in democracy w ill say that, throughout the ages, civilization has pivoted on its apex, but now rests on its base. From the beginning of time, except at short and infrequent intervals, which were like oases in a desert, the people who have done the work of the world have been without power. They have been, at the best, pawns in the industrial game. For the most part the work of the world was done by slaves. I believe towards the end of the eighteenth century-minin g in '. Scotland was carried on by men who could not leave the districts in which they were working. But it has now come about that the labour wingof the industrial army-thos e who were Ishmaelites-hav e come into their kingdom. The stone that the builders rejected ha.3 become the corner-stone of the industrial, temple. Those who do the manual work of the world are now the repository of political power. Naturally, persons who have engages in an ordinary been nurtured on the traditions of the It is a little difficult for past, on stories of injustice done to the workers in days gone by, view w i th distrust and suspicion proposals for settling the industrial question on lines suggested by men of another class. In my opinion, that question cannot be settled; the problem cannot be completely solved. I do not say that nothing can be done, in the mirror in which that nothing, ought to be done. Inunionist sees the world redustrial trouble can be aggravated; it cannot be assuaged. But the Labour The difficulty I see in movement is human nature at work. To suppose that the buyer can have the same point of view as the seller, or that the conflicting interests of employer and employee can be reconciled, is to expect the lion to lie down w it h the lamb. Still, civilization has found a way, not of ending but of settling differences on other matters; the law forces a settlement on one of the parties. The rule of law is the mark explanation is to be sought, of civilization; without that rule it would in the conditions that exist be impossible for society to cohere; without organization civilization could not If honourable members wish to exist. While we may deplore the eagerness with which the unionist flocks to the standard of his union when it is unf u r l e d ; and when he is bidden comes out on strike, yet surely it ought to be one of the easiest things in the world to understand. The labourer is so placed that without solidarity, without united action, he would be utterly undone. Although we may deplore the fact that he strikes when his union tells him to do so, nothing would be more foolish in principle than for him to do anything else. How else can .he hope to protect his interests? But we are in a new age. Those who were formerly the servants are now the masters. "" Other times, other manners""; and we must, if we are to keep step in the march of proU n t i l comparatively recently gress, extend the principles and domain of the law to cover the sphere of industry. This bill takes up a rather illogical attitude. as such, to be illegal. It simply says that some strikers are to be penalized, while others are not; and it selects-as is natural in the circumstances, because the measure is born of the recent strike of British seamen-the transport industries as being the most important to the community. So, indeed, they are. In some industries a cessation of work inflicts no hardship on society. the persons engaged in the boot industry ceased work, the community as a whole would not be seriously affected. But the bill is marred by curious omissions. There 13 nothing in the bill to make it an offence for persons engaged in coal mining to 1 strike. life upon fuel. in themselves, are not an offence. is the stoppage of transport that is in certain instances, to be an offence against the law. A distinction like this is impossible to maintain. If we arc to endeavour to ensure industrial peace, Ave must have power to deal with strikes generally, and not merely in a piece-meal way. I do not believe that it is possible during a strike to bring about a settlement by the mere application of the penal clauses of the bill There should be means at the disposal of the Government for settling, or attempting to settle, disthe loss of £200,000,000. reduced hunputes. The bill purports to deal with the strike and the lock-out, and with any person who does anything to interfere with transport. trace the 'British seamen's strike back to its ultimate cause, they will find that it was due to the action of the British ship-owners iu reducing wages. Now the reduction of wages by an employer is not an act that comes within the provisions of this clause. But, technically at any rate, it should do so. The bill proposes to punish persons, not' for being in the wrong, but for doing certain things, whether these are right or wrong from their point of view. I do not agree with the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) that it is aimed at ideas; it is aimed at acts. A man may think what he likes, and, withiu reason, he may say what he likes. For every strike-I those shibboleths society which are current unionists-there Mr Hughes. Some employer or person, or section of It does uot declare strikes, society, has done some, definite thing to bring it about. It may be only that some one is suspected of having done this thing. Now unless the purpose of the Government is clear, and it is intended. ,to deal wi|th either party involved in a dispute, the unionists will regard this as a class conscious mea-' sure, and say that it is aimed at trade unions, that it endeavours to hamper; to For instance, if crush them, that it does not deal impartially with both parties, treating the employer, who is in the wrong as frequently as the unionist, in the same way as the unionist. Leaving this, I now turn to the proposal for deportation. Under clause 17, this penalty may Yet transport depends for its be imposed for every offence mentioned Under it, strikes, therein. As to its imposition upon It members of unlawful associations, I say nothing. But as a remedy for industrial unrest, and a punishment for strikes, it is a penalty not suited to the offence. We are living in the twentieth century, and are dealing with an infinitely complex and difficult situation. Strikes are the most common phenomena of the age. They occur everywhere. The other day I read in a. newspaper that a strike in Pennsylvania had just terminated after a duration oi, I think, 165 days, during which it had caused dreds of thousands of people, of all classes, to the verge of destitution, and had thrown the industries of America If honourable members will into confusion. We read every day of strikes all over the world. Clearly deportation is not a remedy to Ibe applied 'to so universal a disease. I admit freely that the leaders of industrial trouble in this country are mostly persons who were born elsewhere. That, perhaps, may be a slap in the face for myself. The recent, strikes were fomented by persons born abroad. There may be something in this country that distils and sublimates the grosser nature common to people from countries overseas; that here, as it were, mankind is spiritualized. However, I tshall not dwell upon this fascinating theme further, lest I unduly elate the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) and others. Although am putting aside strikes may be led frequently byand concepts of persons not born in Australia, it is obamong vious that the majority of those who take is an immediate cause. part in them are Australian born, and they may do what they please, paralyze the trade of the country, without fear of deportation, it is . quite a wrong conception of industrial unrest to think, for one moment, that this clause, if put into operation, would prevent strikes. What we want in this country above everything else is population. This is not only a white man's country, but a country in which the people of one race so predominate that practically 97 per cent, of its inhabitants are of British origin. We are all agreed that British people are the most desirable migrants. We are holding out both hands to welcome them. proposedthat, when they come here and engage in their favourite recreationstrikes are more common in England than anywhere else-the y shall be deported. I do not believe that this proposal is in the best interests of the count r y. civilization rests upon the rule of law. But the law should f it the circumstances and apply to all alike. ment would have done better to declare every strike a breach of the law. strikes are wrong, they ought not to be permitted.' To permit or condone an illegal act while its effect is small, and thus encourage it u n t i l it has arrived at a point which cannot be checked is wrong. The Arbitration Act declares that strikes are illegal. would be better to face the position by admitting that under our present powers we cannot deal effectively with the industrial problem. Assume that a strike such as the recent strike of British seamen occurred after this provision hadcome into operation, and that it provoked that most dangerous form,a sympathetic Strike, how would it be dealt with under this section? As a civilized community we ought to face the fact that we have grown up, and cannot afford to have insurgent movements aimed at the destruction of society. If a strike is wrong, it ought to be declared illegal. can we do? by a throughout this country, it may readily become general, and clearly no law would be effective against it . I do not say for one moment that the Government in framing this measure has not, as it were, been compelled to proceed along certain lines. It was committed to them by its pledges to the people. It had ample warrant, so far as the vote of the people was concerned,, for introducing this bill, or even a measure going much iurther. But I say that Ministers would be better advised It could not do so. to confine the deportation penalty to unlawfu l associations, and to rely upon other penalties which are flexible, convenient, and usual, in dealing with ordinary industrial disputes. It cannot bo said that the remedies upon which we rely for maintaining law and order generally would he ineffective in maintaining industrial peace. In my opinion it would be better to f a l l back upon those Y e t it is penalties against which, in themselves,, nothing can ""be said by the unionists or the general community. In New South Wales during the recent strike, the B r i tish seamen who refused to work their ships were sent to gaol in such numbersLaw must be observed, because that the authorities had to call a halt, because of insufficient gaol accommodation. B ut Messrs. Walsh and Johannsen, The Governthe head and front of the offending, suffered neither imprisonment nor inconIf venience, though if they had been subjected to the same penalty as was in flicted upon the seamen, I am inclined to think that it would have had a salutary effect upon them There is about mild punishment something that would appeal to the great body of the people in Yet strikes take place. It this country, and I am, therefore, in favour of amending the clause so as to provide for summary procedure for ordinary cases which I . think is essential. Graver offences should be. heard before a jury. The punishments inflicted would be flexible, and generally applicable, so that theywould incite neither comment nor opposition. I cannot in the circumstances do other than make the suggestion to the -Government, leaving the responsibility for the bill on its shoulders. As honourable memhers in dealing with But what this clause have discussed it as a whole, If the strike is supported I suggest that you, Mr Chairman, put sufficient number of people to the committee first the proposed new sub-sections from 3 0 A down to and including 3 0 H , which deal with unlawful associations, and thus provide fora separate discussion on proposed new subsections 3 0 J and 3 0 K , and also on the proposed new sub-sections from 3 0 L to the end of the clause ?",32,Crimes Bill

General prepared to accept the amendment ? to do so. in all advanced forms of society. There is a left wing in the Labour party. During the whole of my life I ' have been a left-wing man. We should not forget that the world was made perfect, and that, therefore, any imperfections that now exist are man-made. man-made, they can be unmade by man. I live and strive for the day when we shall attain to that state of perfection which existed at the creation. was then no capitalistic or wage system; no policy of "" the devil take the hindmost "" ; no "" pull devil, pull baker "" for a living or an existence. days of the trade union movement men advocated ideas which at the time were considered just as bad as are the ideas advocated by some persons to-day. would not injure one of my opponents, nor would I advocate violent revolution, or any action which would cause destruction, because to do so would be futile. After having created something, it is futile to tear it down without first enjoying it. For a person's actions to be judged by the standard of this measure is not just. Not only do I want to protect the trade unionists and the f eople inside the Labour movement, but also want to stimulate to further effort those who may think that, having reached a certain stage of progress, they can rest. There can be no rest until what ought to be attained has been attained Numbers of trade unionists hold that view. The present High Commissioner, Sir Joseph Cook, speaking in the New South Wales Parliament in 1S92, said that he was a republican; that he was not one of those men who were prepared to sit down ana. wait for the republic to come, but was prepared to put his shoulder to the wheel to hasten the day. A t that time Sir Joseph Cook had no thought of King or flag. But how would he fare if he uttered that sentiment to-day? Except in respect of that one ideal, Sir Joseph Cook led a blameless life; no exception I propose to do so; could be taken to anything that he said or did. Since that time, however, he has shown his apostasy by wearing buckled shoes and knee breeches, and by carrying a sword which from time to time trips him. That shows the transformation that can take place in man. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), who has just resumed his seat, is not different. When he, in turn, has to wear buckled shoes and knee breeches, and carry a sword, I do not know, what will happen. It ' is remarkable what changes Being can take place. In the light of the definition given by the Church of England to the word "" revolution,"" and with the administration of this legisThere lation in the hands of one whose political bias runs away with his common sense, it is possible for any person to come within its purview. We are not asking In the early the Attorney-General to restrict in any way the power to deal with unlawful associations, but we want his assurance that it will apply only to those who I preach violent revolution, sabotage, and destruction. The man who comes here -lik e myself, a ""pommy,"" except that I have had a more extended residence in -Australia-and is prepared, although a citizen of the Commonwealth, to fly in the face of convention, has only himself to blame if through repeating an offence he is deported. But that is not the class of man who will be dealt with, under the proposed new sub-section 3 0 J. That sub-section deals with the trade unionists who are out to improve the condition of the workers.

The honourable member referred to my statement that communism was anti-christian, and gave a definition of communism which he extracted from au old edition of a certain book which has since been more or less revised. In the light of history, it is clear that the honourable member made an unfortunate reference to the old edition. History supports my previous statement and refutes the contention of the honourable member. The communistic revolution in Russia has [43] supplied sufficient evidence that communism is anti-christian. The Christian That means the governChurch was attacked by communism, beI do not suggest that cause the communists realized that it stood between them aud the attainment of their objective.

ThatI f we leave the clause as the revolution was not aimed solely at the Greek Orthodox Church, which came It is not unusual for a man more or less under the protection of the State, is shown by the fact that other Christian churches and sects were' similarly misused by the communists. I have it on the authority of one of the most learned and respected Lutheran' pastors in South Australia, that no section suffered more from the communists during A f t e r the the great Russian upheaval than did the Lutheran churches. That pastor, who But having, like a has spent the greater part of his l if e in the service of the Lutheran Church, stated emphatically that communism was anti-Christian. He added that, while he would not participate in political warfare, he had preached, and would continue to preach, against communism from the pulWe ask only for pit of his church.

It is only in certain exceptional circumstances that the executive must accept responsibility.

Sir ELLIOTJOHNSON tion clause could be inserted. It was stated during the second-reading debate that the term "" job control "" has not yet been defined, but that is incorrect, because I find that in the Commonwealth Law Reports, volume 23, there is a f u l l definition, although it does not cover everything, by Mr Justice Isaacs and Mr Justice Rich, and also by a witness, Mr Adams. ment? found in the report of the case Commonwealth Steamship Owners Association v. Federated Seamen's Union of Australia. On page 305 .of the Commonwealth Law Reports, volume 23,' I find the position stated as follows :-As an instance of the difficulty in the present case, Mr Adams, who. as an expert, gives the principal evidence on the subject, says : "" I should say it was an attempt by the men on a particular job to refuse work on that job for tlie purpose of enforcing industrial conditions."" The mere fact of his stating, '' I should say,"" may indicate a mere personal opinion, and not a knowledge of the meaning accepted generally by others as well as himself. Then he makes it part of the definition that the control must be ""by the men on a particular job."" This would exclude all men who refused work before engagement, and would therefore exclude almost all the evidence as to the exercise of job control by individual members in this case. Again, he says, job control may be in some cases by an "" organization.""' That is not consistent with what went before, but, if true, it is outside this case both because the information does not charge the exercise of job control by the organization, and because the award does not include it. mits the final definition, because what is selected as the thing to be controlled, and called the "" job,"" is naturally not susceptible, of prior delimitation. It must vary with circumstances and with the progress of industrial operations. shop, or a ship, or a waterworks. control,"" so far as we understand that phrase to have acquired any definite meaning, connotes the control by employees, whether already engaged or not, or by some organization representing them, of some single enterprise or portion of an enterprise of an employer, which is selected as an isolated unit of industrial operations; the effective method of enforcing the control being, not a general Very often strike in the industry or of the union, or even in the general service of the employer, but a strike of the employees engaged on.that unit or a refusal to engage on it at all. If that be the true meaning of the term, it does not, as we have stated, accord with the definition in evidence in this case, nor does it entirely coincide with the application of the phrase by the terms of the award, though there is A defininothing in the award, so far as we can observe, inconsistent with it so far as its meaning is concerned. If that is the definition of these learned judges, it seems that it needs amplification, and I suggest for the consideration of the Attorney-General that it might be well to consider this proposed new sub-section a little further before asking the committee to pass it . It is most important that we should have a clear definition of the terms employed in the measure, especially where there seems to be such a wide divergence of opinion concerning what the words actually mean and what they actually imply. A f t e r all, tha Attorney-General's explanation can, in the absence of any clear and judicially authoritative definition, be regarded only as hia opinion. I think it would be wise to clear up any doubt in the matter by inserting a definition clause covering words or phrases as to which there is any ambiguity regarding their meaning. MT .

We speak very familiarly to-day of the industrial revolution in England, but there was no force or violence about that, and it was certainly not very gradual. It was, in fact, very sudden from the point of view of the craftsmen who were thrown out of employment by the introduction of machinery. The honourable member for Perth( Mr Mann), and the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse), might advocate a revolutionary change in our Commonwealth Constitution. We have heard it threatened in this chamber that Western Australia may secede from the Commonwealth.. To do that Commonwealth Constitution.

The Government says it intends to punish only those who. advocate revolution by force or violence. That being so we contend that the word's "" force o r violence."" should be included; in the first, paragraph of the proposed new seetion. Therecan be no reasonable explanation why the wordfe should not be included in eaGh of the paragraphs. Paragraph a (<) refers to"" the .overthrow of: the Constitution of the Commonwealth by revolution or sabotage,"" while paragraph a (ii) refers to "" the overthrow by force, or violence of the establishedgovernment of the Commonwealth."" should the words "" by force o r violence "" beincluded in. the paragraph that deals with the overthrow of the established government of the Commonwealth, but not in the paragraph that deals with the overthrow of the Constitution of the Commonwealth ?What difference is there between "" the Constitution of the Commonwealth "" and "" t h e established government of the Commonwealth "" that calls for this variation in phraseology? The distinction made in drafting the bill M a n y a revolution suggests, that the intention of the by honourable Government is to bring, under the headThey were quite ing of unlawful associations those who advocate a complete and sudden change, whether accompaniedby violence or mot. I submit that the. provision as it stand's is dangerous,, and that the intention of the. Government should be made clear. To say that the word "" revolution,"" without qualification, means. revolution by force or violence, would not carry much weight in a court of law, when, in the next paragraph, the words "" force or violence"" are used. The court would undoubtedly come to the conclusion that the distinction was made deliberately, and would hold that, if. no distinction had been intended, the words "" force or violence "" would have been included in both paragraphs. The fact that the Gowould be to overthrow our vernment declines to insert the words in both paragraphs shows that it wishest o class as unlawful-, associations that advocaterevolution without force or violence.

We may agree that there are persons in .this country who advocate . the use. of force and violence, and the attainment of rtheir .ends by force, -and . we all agree that they ought .to be punished; but I suggest -that -whatever punishment is inflicted hears the evidence and sees the .prisoner.

The -one .great principle we have .tried to lay down in all legislation providing .punishment for crimes is that penalties shall be imposed by .the -.judiciary of the country, removed from tlie taint of politics and the prejudices of parties. In support of that contention, let me quote the honourable the Attorney-General. On a former occasion, When we were discussing a proposal 'to appoint appeal boards for 'taxation purposes, the honourable gentleman opposed the government of the day, ! and saidThe principle is embodied iu .the Constituthat judicial powers -shall be exercised by judicial persons.

We on this side are firmly of the opinion that the determination of whether a mau shall be deported from Australia is a judicial, function ; but if it is held to be not a judicial function, then I say that the grave act of deportation should not be performed unless accompanied by the judicial action that accompanies a j u d icial function. We are asked to assume that the Attorney-General w ill act in a judicial way, but on his own interpretation of the Constitution no judicial, function should be performed unless by a judicial person, who is not the political head of the Government, but pointed under the Constitution. are the arguments advanced by the Attorney-General? He said that there might be certain facts and certain evidence in justification of the deportation of a man under this legislation that could not be brought before a court of law as relevant evidence. He said that the history ancl general record of the man would be irrelevant as evidence before a court, and therefore could not come into consideration in the question of deportation. It sounds well in theory, but what is the practice? What would the Crown Prosecutor do when charging a man from another part of the world, who had a bad record? He would certainly put it in . sible. It would be very improper . for him to attempt to do so. tion might be improper, but the Attorney General knows that many improper things are done. cutors; they are a f a i r set of men. In any case the judge would prevent such evidence being put in . cutor would certainly divulge the history of the accused. He would charge h i m with being an advocate of revolution, and I venture to say that it would be relevant for h i m to produce the record of the aclife. The Attorney-General said cused in other countries, especially if he only judicial persons sliould were a revolutionary and an advocate of judicial powers. The esthose things so much talked about by the Attorney-General. Apartf r o m that, in our ordinary courts, before a prisoner is sentenced, a list of his prior convictions His is read, and there is nothing to prevent, this Government, if it so desires, from including in the b ill the right to produce to the court, before sentence and after trial, evidence to show justification for deportation. I should not object to the Government having the right under this b ill to deport certain undesirables who have recently arrived in this country, persons with criminal instincts, who have been chased by the police from other countries: But wo distinguish between those undesirables and persons who have made this country their home, those whom the Leader of the Opposition defined as Australian citizens. We distinguish entirely between the power which the Goa member of the judiciary apvernment already possesses under the What Immigration Act to deport undesirable immigrants, and the power to deport our own citizens who have lived here probably half a lifetime, merely because they are guilty of an offence for which Australian-born citizens can receive at the most only about two years' imprisonment.

It would not be possible. On the other hand, Australian-born citizens committing a similar > offence are to be sentenced at the most No doubt such an acto two years' imprisonment. The bulk of our people who have come from across the seas are British. They are of the stock that laid the foundations of this country-the stock from which we No t by Crown Prosehave sprung.

This clause provides, not for judicial punishment, but for political punishment. all tried to convict persons without a proper trial.

Yet a person who advocates something that is opposed to the economic and political ideas'of the Goverument may be deported from Australia at the mere w ill of the Minister. The Attorney-General justifies the proposal to give the political head of the country the power to deport persons for the very same reason that he gave in support of the appointment of the political board to which I have referred. It is no use saying that any action taken by h i m w ill be judicial; it will really be political. It w ill be political punishment superimposed upon the decision of. the court. While the judge sitting in the court, having heard the evidence and watched the demeanour of the prisoner, may consider the offence triflin g and impose a fine of, say £ 5 , the .fact, that the man was found guilty w ill enable the Attorney General to say that he shall be deported. It is a wrong power to place in the hands of the Attorney-General, and it is a wrong punishment to give to persons who have made this country their home. The only word of unfriendly criticism that, I can utter about the excellent speech just delivered by the honourable member f b r Yarra( Mr Scullin) is that, The Government failed on the perhaps, he is taking the absurdities of It appointed a political board to the Government a little too seriously. A fte r all he should, in a spirit of Christian charity, remember that the Government is under the necessity of justifying its election war-whoops. Having endeavoured to create a scare about a chimera which had no real existence, and having succeeded in frightening a considerable section of the electors into supporting it in its absurdities, it must now legislate in order to preserve uniformit y on the lines upon which the supporters . of the Government spoke The Government first of during the recent election. The part must be acted in f u l l . The Government cannot call off the piece after having staged the first act. It cannot ring down the curtain and disperse the crowd.

F r om the very memorandum which the Government has printed to show the amendments in their proper relationship with the Crimes Act as a whole, it w ill be seen that we already have powers under the laws of this country to deal w it h such crimes as sedition, disaffection, treason, and other offences against the order and good government of Australia. And so, in truth and in fact, by an examination of this document it may be proven that there is no real reason whatever for this panic legislation which the Government has introduced.

What we are considering for the moment is the proposed new subsection 30c, which readsAny person who 'by speech or writing advocates or encourages(a) the overthrow of the Constitution of the Commonwealth by revolution or .sabotage; (Zi) the overthrow by force or violence o'fthe established government of the Commonwealth or of a State or -of any other civilized country or of organized government; or (c) the destruction or injury of property of'the'Commonwealth or of'property used in trade or commerce with other countries or among the States, shall be -guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for any period not exceeding -two years, and, in addition (if he was not born in Australia) to deportation by order of the 'Attorney-General as provided in this act. My first comment is -that that is sufficiently provided for by existing My next legislation, the Government catch cries with which it has become 'familiar -by a 'too deep reading of communist literature. "" sabotage "" as though that word had an -established meaning in modern literature. bad French. "" job control "" as though it knew what, the term meant; but it does not attempt to define it. ment's idea is that 'we on this side will enlighten them as to the meaning of these Mr Brennan. terms, which are to be embodied in acts of Parliament. Owing to 'the propaganda of the Government, many people are 'becoming afraid of their own shadows, and, therefore, they say that no one ought to object to the punishment of an association or of an individual who advocates' the overthrow of .the Constitution'of the Commonwealth by revolution or sabotage. I was never a great advocate of physical force in bringing about industrial, political, or international reforms. In .fact, I am afraid that in the year 1915, and thereabouts, I gaiued a somewhat evil reputation for being, of all things in a Christian -country, a pacifist. I was one of those who, at a time when such views were unpopular, advocated -that we should import into our dealings with 'other nations something of the spirit of the Sermon on the Mount, in which, during What really is to be retimes of peace, we profess to believe, but which, in that time of war, were .scrapped or dealt with by the censor. I cannot, therefore, be accused of being an advocate of political or industrial reform by force of arms or bloodshed. I do not believe in those things. But I do believe in freedom of speech. I believe also in the wisdom of the policy pursued by Great Britain for 100 years, which permitted all sorts of cranks, fanatics, and heretics of various kinds to meet in their little meeting places in the centre of London, unhampered and unhindered, -and to give expression to their views .as to the best -way to overthrow -by force the established government of the very country in which they were speaking. No harm came from their' utterances. The honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) -was correct when he said that 'those .meeting places provided those people with a safety valve, which prevented their danlaw. gerous doctrines from developing in secret comment is that, in its as they did in Russia and elsewhere, unti l is adopting they resulted in actual .and treacherous physical force, causing the murder of officials and of men in high-public posiIt nas used the word tions, .and the useless destruction of human life. It is arguable whether it is English wise to pass legislation to render it a It is not English, and it is penal offence to express opinions. I beIt has adopted the term lieve in making it penal to commit offences; but the .'expression of opinions : is a different matter. Being a pacifist, Apparently, the Governinfected with notions of Christianity which are consistent with the Sermon on the Mount, 1 do not likebloodshed or force, and, therefore, I am content to allow that portion of the bill toremain. B ut it goes further. It is also an offence to advocate the. overthrow by force or violence of the established government of the Commonwealth, orof a State, or of any other civilized country or of organized government. It would appear that people in Austraha may not advocate with propriety the overthrow, by .physical force, of. a civilized government on the other side of the world. If the Prussian Czar were now on the throne, it would clearly be an offence to advocate that czarism should be overthrown in that country, notwithstanding consent meant the denial of the very elements of liberty. under the regime of the czars was very different from conditions in Australia, where every adult has a vote. regime of the czars has been overthrown, and the Soviet regime has taken its place. . Isi t equally unlawful to advocate the overthrow of the Soviet regime by force? that it would not be au offence to advocate the overthrow of that government while the present Government is in power in Australia, but that it would be if the Labour party were in power here. It is not difficult to see the purely political nature of this legislation. It has relation, not to the real issues at stake, but merely to the political condition of the people's minds from time to time. Let us consider also the position of the great Chinese empire in the days before the republic. During the time that his serene highness was on the throne, it would have been an offence under this bill to advocate the overthrow of that empire by force. Buti f SunY a t Sen had driven a dagger into his back and taken possession of the umpire, and, in turn, established another civilized government-civilized , that is, more or less-clearl y it would have been an offence in Australia for one to have suggested that his government should be overthrown by force, notwithstanding that in China the different factions were, and still are, all the time busily attempting to overthrow one another by force. If -befove Mussolini secured power in Ttaly by force we had suggested that he should do what he actually did do, we should have been liable to punishment or to deportation.. But Mussolini, having secured the power which he sought by force,, we should now be liable to deportation if wesuggested that he should be overthrown, by force. If the AttorneyGeneralhad a sense of Inunour,. he would not have the courage to place such measures before honourable members. Unfortunately, a fatal lack of humour afflicts him;, hecannot see a joke. This bill', which says that it is ' an offence to advocate the overthrow of organized government,, does, not define organized government. No r does it define sabotage or job control. Does the Government which introduced the measure know what that by common organized government is? Organized the. rule of. t h e ' Czars government in one country differs greatly from organized government in another The position in Eussia country. .The only test that I can suggest as. satisfactory to the Government is that organized government is government But the de facto,, whether obtained by force, fraud., or otherwise, so long as. for the time being it has the upper hand. It is clear, therefore, that no person The answer that I suggest is has a right to advocate the overthrow of any government. Apparently it is a case of whatever is, is right, and whatever is proposed, is revolutionary and wrong. That precept is distinctly nationalist, and it is no wonder that to oppose it is a penal offence. Again, the destruction or in j u ry of the property of the Commonwealth is an offence. Hare it would be possible to appeal to the Attorney -General's sense of humour, if he had one. If a person saw an objectionable building on the grounds surrounding this building, and on sanitary or other grounds destroyed it , his action would be regarded as an offence under this bill. The person who commits that offence is to be liable, on conviction in the courts of the country, to imprisonment for two years; and oh the completion of that term the Attorney-General, waiting at the door of the prison, may deport h i m from the country. . That is fine! We have certainly never had that before. We thought that criminal offences could be dealt with under the criminal law in the courts of this country. We did not believe that convicted men would be made the plaything of a party in tbe political arena. The Government has been forced to do these things by reason of the absurd position it took up during the recent election campaign. think thai the Attorney-General in these things. I should like this House to know that my great respect for the Attorney-General behalf that. I do not believe for a moment that he is in favour of the bill which he has introduced. present Speaker, he has received a mandate, and that mandate he must obey. Each, in turn, steps up higher, and another takes his place; the great work must go on. I am against any extension of the power to deport which already exists in the Immigration those who believe in limiting the powers of the Commonwealth gard to the preservation of the race. This Parliament has an undoubted right to expel from the country people who are undesirable, and who by their coming here may lower our standard of living or affect our racial purity. I believe that Australia should control her ow ports in regard to immigration gration. done so for years. Ever since the establishment of the Commonwealth the courts have been employed to deport people who had no right to come or remain here. I believe in the exercise of that power.

They must appear to be in earnest, even if they are not. The elections are just over. They had to meet in the summer to appear to be in a h u r ry to do these absurdities. Let them do them. Proposed sections 30A to 3 0 H agreed to. Proposed sections 3 0 J (Industrial Disturbances, Lockouts, and Strikes), and 3 0 K (Obstructing or hindering the performance of services) General) [8.50],-As various honourable members nave already said, the provisions now before the committee are of considerable importance. very naturally and directly from recent experiences in Australia which are so fresh in the minds of honourable members that it is quite unnecessary for me to describe them again. It is, however, important that honourable members should understand exactly what is sought to be provided, because during the second reading debate there was directed towards these provisions a great deal of criticism which was entirely misconceived. It was said, again and again, that this was legislation dealing with strikes in general, and that it was diiwte d against trade unionism in Australia. I have no desire to limit the discussion, but it appears to me that the Attorney General is setting out to give a reply which he should have given last night on the motion for the second reading. I want to know if it is competent for an honourable member to reply extensively in committee to arguments raised at the second reading stage. I understand that the honourable the A t torney-General is now merely making some . introductory remarks in regard to proposed sections 3 0 J and 30K. specifically with those two provisions. The first point to be considered is their actual scope and significance, and then as to their effect. The section is not ' to come into operation unti l a proclamation has been made. by the first words of sub-section 2, which comes into effect only during the operation of a proclamation made under subsection 1. Consequently the section does not operate unless a proclamation is made, and it therefore follows that this provision, is not legislation directed generally against strikes ""or industrial disturbances. made whenever the government of the day desires it . vernment of the day thinks proper to make one. That is perfectly clear on the face of the section, and I have no desire to disguise that obvious fact. It is, however, also equally apparent that, having made a. proclamation of this character with a f u l l knowledge of-the penal nature of the subsequent provisions of the section, the Government of the day incurs They arise a responsibility for which it will have to answer to the people of the country. A government would not, if it were at all well advised, run the risk of issuing a proclamation unless the circumstances justified the application of emergency legislation. This is essentially emergency legislation. It is not directed against all strikes. It is not a part of our industrial legislation. So far as this Parliament is able to legislate on industrial matters, its industrial legislation is to be found in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. ""That measure is designed to produce industrial peace, whereas this bill is designed to protect the community against interference with I rise to a point of order. vital services, and has quite a different object from the general purpose of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Not only does this legislation not come into effect u n t i l after a proclamation of a serious industrial disturbance, prejudicing or threatening trade or commerce with other countries, or among the States, has been made, but it will also be observed that the lockouts and strikes which are dealt with are of a very limited and defined character. Under the first heading they are "" in relation to employment in or in connection with the transport of goods, I propose to deal or the conveyance of passengers, in trade or commerce with other countries, or among the States."" Not only does the section not apply to strikes in. general, it does not even apply to strikes i u or in connection with trade or commerce, That effect is produced interstate and foreign, but is confined to strikes relating to the transport of goods or the conveyance of passengers. That is to say, it is strictly limited to interference with transport.",52,Crimes Bill

166,Mr Latham,"Wheneve r the gocriticisms of the. bill. reasons for that limitation. The first is that the Government, under , this b ill , is endeavouring to deal with the real difficulties and evils which exist. As has already been pointed out, it has been discovered by some people that interference w i th transport is one of the best means of. holding up the community. second reason is that, although the Commonwealth Constitution permits this Parliament to legislate upon interstate and foreign trade and commerce, it gives it no. general power to legislate upon industry. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Coleman), managing to maintain a solemn countenance, said in an earlier stage of the debate-to which the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) will not allow me to refer more particularly-that he objected to this legislation, because it discriminated-it picked out transport. He said that it should apply to everything, but he was evidently suffering from a strange lapse of memory. Hitherto he has not failed to recognize that the Commonwealth Parliament has limited powers and that it could not legislate generally upon strikes, even if it thought it proper to do so. Therefore, thenon-discrimination which the honourable member suggests is impossible. only upon certain limited matters. tempt* to legislate on all matters within our jurisdiction. Mi-. LATHAM to legislate upon all strikes it would be plainly invalid. The second heading rer lates to lockouts or strikes, ."" in relation to employment or in connection with the provisionof any public service by the Commonwealth, or by any department or public authority under the Commonwealth."" The real problem with which proposed section 3 0 J seeks to deal is that of industrial disturbances, which are not merely industrial disputes, but are of a much more serious character. This provision is aimed at dealing with industrial disputes which threaten the life of the community. Recently we have heard some most surprising statements about the in alienable right to strike. suggested that the right to strike is is one of my valued as a great, substantive righ t of the working men and working women of aretwo Australia. I think t h a t honourable members who suggest this do. the men and women of Australia an injustice. To talk about the inalienable right to strike is nonsense-, as any one who knows anything about the present conditions of industrial legislation in Australia .will recognize. Honourable members opposite The flatter themselves with the conviction, which is apparently sincere, that they alone are acquainted with industrial conditions in Australia,, and that they alone are informed as to the nature of indust r i a l legislation. It has been argued inside and outside this chamber that one of the prized rights of an Australian is the right to strike, and that the men and women of Australia will fight to the bitter end before they abandon that inalienable right. member aware that the legislation of New South Wales provides for strikes. w i th that particular point. For the moment I am not discussing the policy of this legislation; I am simply and shortly directing the attention of honourable members to. the actual legislative provisions of the Commonwealth and the States on the subject of strikes*' because it has been suggested that it is We can legislate an unheard-of thing to legislate against strikes. they have not previously been brought under the criminal code. a qualification by the honourable member. which we have always taken up. the matter from that point of view. Any act the commission of' which renders a person liable. to punishment by fine or imprisonment, comes within the operation of the criminal code. Let us begin with Commonwealth legislation. Ever since the Arbitration Act was introduced in 1904, the statute-book of the Commonwealth has contained provisions prohibiting strikes in so far as the Commonwealth has had power to legislate in that direction. I refer honourable members to section 6 of the Commonwealth Arbitration Act, It has. been which has been a part of the act from the commencement of its operation. That",53,Crimes Bill

Under section fi., a second often ce may 'be punished by .imprisonment. I also 'direct the attention of honourable members to section 6A, which Avas introduced .1^1920. All the provisions to which I propose to refer apply equally to lockouts and to -strikes, but in the present discussion the strike aspect is the more important, and I therefore quote particularly the antiStrike provisions. Section 6A prohibits strikes by unions that have the benefit of, -or are bound by, an award. Many governments, of various political complexions, have had opportunities to alter the arbitration law, but it has never been altered in such a way as to take from it the prohibition against strikes. i Mr >STEWART -Has there been any conviction under it? victions. granted at different times under section 48 of the act for an injunction against a strike, in terms of section 6 or 6A. prisonment ;ever been 'imposed ? case in which'there has been a second conviction.

In re.gard to unions that are not bound by an award, a penalty is imposed if a strike takes place and fourteen days' notice of that intention has not been given to the Minister.

181,Mr Latham,"A t present the Comber has failed to follow me. quite plainly that there was power to deal with a strike on account of an interstate industrial dispute, and also a strike by a registered union that was bound by au award. Those are the only cases that come within the provisions of the Commonwealth act. Justice Powers explicitly decided that the British seamen's strike did not fall under either of those heads. are limits to the right to strike. There is no necessity upon this bill to discuss generally the question of the right to strike. After all, that right is subservient to the claim to work under proper conditions. It is not an end i i i itself; it is useful only for the purpose of enabling men and women to obtain work under what they regard as proper conditions. limitations imposed upon any claim to the right to strike.

It has been conclusively demonstrated that the object of certain of the promoters of that strike was to precipitate a general strike and a general hold-up in Australia. The Government ought to have power to deal with such a contingency if it arises. If it does not arise, the legislation does not come into operation. Without this legislation such a crisis cannot be adequately handled -fident that it will receive the approval of Every one recognizes the difficulty of dealing with these subjects. It is important that they should be dealt with m a fair-minded manner. The object of this legislation is, not to deal with strikes in general, but in an emergency to protect as far as possible the vital services of the community in the interests of all sections of the community. It is the duty of the I stated Government, within the limits of its powers, to preserve essential services. The preservation of those services obviously benefits trade unionists as well as every other section of the community.

Their only difficulty was that they did not There are, at least, two have good matter with which to fill those columns, and their propaganda regarding woollen mills and the. like, having been If in prepared months previously, was so outof-date that it made no impression upon the people.

The Government was returned to power with an overwhelming majority. I repeat what I have previously said, that no Government can possibly secure a. majority in both Houses of the Federal Parliament without the assistance of the votes of hundreds of thousands of working men and women. Honourable members of the Opposition have no claim to consider themselves the special or the sole representatives, of the workers of Australia. In bringing forward this bill, as honourable members on this side well know, the Government is submitting legislation which has the strong support and approval of large numbers, not only of the working classes, but of the trade unionists of this country.

If they did know anything about the industrial position they would not endeavour to make criminals of honest working men, and that is 'what is being done by this measure.

The -dispute is concerning an industrial matter, and it becomes an interstate dispute -and involves an interference with transport.

We do not want to see such troubles arise. The men concerned do not want to see them. They have an honest desire for their settlement, but if in the f u t u r e . such troubles should reach the stage I have referred to, the workers concerned in them will be liable to all the pains and penalties of this measure and may be branded for all time as criminals. Under the industrial laws of the Commonwealth and the States to-day, i u such circumstances the leaders or their unions might be not be imprisoned or regarded as criminals. That indicates the distinction between this and existing measures dealing with industrial matters. I listened carefully to the Attorney-General, and he tried to evade the issue. He endeavoured to mislead the public and the committee with regard to the true interpretation of his bill. No other construction could have been put upon what he said. If honourable members opposite doubt the view that I have expressed concerning its effects, I am prepared toaccept the opinion of any outside legal man as to what might happen under the proposed section 3 0 J if there is an industrial disgiven f u l l publicity during the elections, turbance which results in an interference with transport and trade and commerce in Australia. It is on this account that honourable members on this side are fighting this particular clause. Honourable members opposite proclaim that they have a mandate from the people for this legislation. Let me tell them that the people never realized what that mandate would be interpreted to mean. If ever, as the result of an industrial dispute, an attempt is made to send a number of the leading men of a big industrial organization in this country to jail or surely as I am speaking at this moment, the people of Australia w ill, with no uncertain voice, redress the wrong they did at the last election. The people really did not understand the position; we could not expect them to. The Attorney-General referred to the recent general elections and the reports that were published. May I , as Leader of the parliamentary Labour party, inform the Minister that when I visited many parts of the Commonwealth during the elections, I was interviewed by pressmen who said, that they had. come to report my speeches I replied, "" That is very good'; but no reports w ill appear."" WhatI said was correct; the reports did not appear. The reporters were there merely in the hope tliat I might say something which would enable the Government, to discredit the Labour party in the eyes of the people. H a d I said anything that would be of service to the Government it would have been reported and used to the detriment of this, party. I did not get f u l l publicity, and very often the reports of my utterances were merly half truths, or were published only in part with the obfined, but they would ject of injuring, the Labour party. The Government and its supporters speak of the mandate they received from the people; but could any one have expected a different result to the elections in view of the conditions that existed during the campaign? Hundreds of thousand's of pounds ware contributed towards the campaign funds of the National party. In Victoria £124,000 was spent in support of the National party; a larger amount was also spent in New South Wales, and in other Statesi n proportion to their importance. We are told that the Labour party's policy was and that we had a f a i r deal; but that was absolutely impossible in the circumstances. We were not given a fair deal. W ill the Minister now turn his attention to the definition of the words "" s t r i k e "" and ""lockout,"" I stated during my second-reading speech that I was dissatisfied w i th the definition of "" lockout/' and that since our Commonwealth Arbitration Act had been in operation no employer had been cited before the court for causing a lockout. It is almost i m possible to prove, the existence of a lockto deport them then as out. In proposed new section 3 0 J "" lockoil t "" is defined in this way"" Lockout"" includes the closing of a place or part of a place of employment, and the total or partial refusal of employers, acting in combination, to give work, if the refusal is unreasonable. * The employers, in order to avoid that, w ill take care that they do not work in combination.

It is the principle in this instance that is vital. The provisions of this measure can be applied to every industrial leader, and I believe it has been definitely drafted in such a way as to aim a blow at trade unionism. I make that statement without the slightest fear of contradiction. It will strike a big blow at the great militant unions of this country. I wish to see Australia prosper, but success in that direction cannot be achieved by bludgeoning trade unionists under repressive legislation such as this. Disputes should be settled in a constitutional way. The Government is worthy of censure for T h a t is what I the attitude adopted by the PrimeM in ister during the industrial disputes which have arisen. Since the right honourable gentleman has been in office nothing has been done by him to effect a settlement of any industrial dispiite. I asked a question to-day in regard to a dispute in the coal mines; if trouble occurs the miners w ill be blamed. I now desire to place on record the fact that the coal-miners have been waiting for two years for a settlement of a dispute. Delegates were appointed to attend a meeting last week. It was explained that the Prime Minister was asked to appoint a tribunal under the Indiistrial PeaceA c t to settle the dispute, but that request was refused. Isi t fair members of the that these men who have been waiting for two years for the dispute to be settled not should be subject to the penalties which can be imposed under this legislation? If honourable members opposite think that the men w ill continue under existing conditions they do not know them. If they find that they are being unjustly treated they w ill kick, and stand up for their rights. No coercive legislation passed here w ill deter them. If they are placed in j a i l or deported hundreds of good others w ill take their place. The people ancl w ill turn against the Government as they did against the Wade Government We heard about in New South Wales after it had passed certain coercive legislation. If this measure is brought into operation, as we expect it will be, I believe that the people of Australia will speak with no uncertain voice when they next have an opportunity to do so. They are prepared to punish those who I am dealing break the laws, as meu have been punished for offences against the A r b i tration Act, but they are not w ill in g to make criminals of honest working men, especially as the workers have never been asked to surrender their right to strike.",60,Crimes Bill

With some reluctance I voted -last evening with the Ministry iagainst the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition, but, ia regard to the proposed new section now before the committee, I had hoped that the Government would relent, and, in the light of representations by honourable members opposite, review its very stringent proposals, with which I certainly do not agree. I listened with a great deal of interest to the speech of the Attorney General. leagues have made up their minds that uot one word or sentence in the bill shall bo altered. Such an attitude in regard to so important a. measure is wrong. The Attorney-General stated that the penalty provisions of this proposed uew section will not be put into operation until -a proclamation 'has heen issued by the Government. The Government, after all, is but ia collection of individuals .occupying for a while .the treasury bench, .and in times of industrial turmoil and strife even a government is prone to lose its head. people losing their 'lives recently. the Government should have all reasonbelief that all justifiable strikes are in able powers to maintain law and order the limbo of the past. No honourable and protect the lives of citizens. Tho only point in question is-wha t powers are necessary to that end ? The Attorney General said that this section would require to be very carefully operated, and that no self-respecting government would attempt to harshly use the powers it confers. Perhaps the honourable gentleman is able to speak with confidence of the present Ministry, but it is only temporary, although, no doubt, like all other governments, it considers itself-the wish being father to the thought-mor e permanent than it may prove to be. However, though it may possess all the virtues that a good government should have, it cannot guarantee that future governments will be equally qualified.

If . it reallybelieves that legislation of this characteroffers a solution-,,.

But allowing that there has been among the workers alarge degreeof laxity in connection with industrial: disputes,.

If two leaders of an -industrial dispute, one an Australian, and the other not an Australian, are sentenced to twelve All individuals! and all secmonths' imprisonment, the one not born in Australia may be deported the next day, or at any time during the term of his sentence, and by deportation he is naturally considered to have served his sentence. I am not inferring, that the Government is deliberately making this provision in order to abuse it , but whatever the Government's intention may be, in certain circumstances some of the clausesof this b ill may operate harshly and unwisely.

I revolutionist, but the decent, English trade unionist, who has made his home here, married an Australian wife, and has Australian children. However much the Attorney-General may protest that it is not intended to operate in that way, the cold fact is that the bill could be put into operation against such a man. My objections to this bill are honest. speak in a critical way, not because I am anxious to be shooting at the Government, but because I have my responsibilities, in common with all other honourable members, to the electors who sent me here. The Government is said to have a mandate. I can only say that I , also, have a mandate from my constituents, and the mandate that I have is certainly not a mandate to deport industrialists under the conditions set out in this b ill . I speak for myself, just as supporters of the Government have spoken for themselves. During the election I said that I did not think that the deportation of trade union leaders was wise. I made that statement many times during the campaign, and I was returned again to this House. I regret very much that the Government has taken the hard, fast, and relentless stand it has taken, and unless I receive an assurance that it is prepared to reconsider this clause, I in tend, when the committee divides, to vote against it . It is, indeed, .refreshing to hear the democratic sentiments expressed by. the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart). It affords me a ray of hope to know that there is at least one member sitting on the other side who is prepared to show some independence. have followed this debate very closely, and I can assure honourable members that I was loth to rise to speak on the bill . Honourable members supporting the Government refuse to be influenced by the reasoning and pleading of honourable members of this side. Wef u l l y realize that they represent the large business interests which during the recent election Imperialist than the right campaign did their utmost to enable the composite Government to continue in office and to destroy the Australian Labour party in the process. Anything that honourable members on this side say has little or no effect, and the polite rebuke administered to the Government by am keeping in mind not the the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr. Stewart) was f u l l y justified. The Government's refusal to accept any suggestion offered by the Opposition should be deprecated by all fair-minded men. I strongly oppose the bill, and particularly the proposed new section 3 0 J , because it is class legislation directed against the trade union movement of Australia. I I have had considerable experience in trade unionism, and have been connected w i th a number of strikes. I have held offices in organizations some of which included large sections of Commonwealth public servants. The Government must carry on the game that it began prior to the election, and this panic legislation is neeessary to convince the people that there is still a likelihood of serious indust r i a l disturbances in Australia. I warn the Government that any attempt to put this legislation into effect w ill be playing with fire, because, so soon as any trade union leaders are arrested or deported for association w i th strikes, thousands of men w ill be ready to step into their places, and the effect w ill be to stiffen the backs of the strikers and the trade unionists. During the election campaign a great deal was said about the frequency of strikes and the general behaviour of trade unionists in Australia. It was also said that members of the Labour party were promoters of strikes, and f u l l y prepared to take part in disloyal actions. The Nationalist party was strongly backed by the capitalistic press, and because of that the Labour party were misrepresented and placed at a great disadvantage. I remember, during the election campaign, ' seeing a cartoon depicting Australian industries being strangled by three monsters I -Strikes, Anarchy, and Revolution. That cartoon should ha.ve properly shown Australian industries being strangled by i m porters and others, who have little or no interest in Australia, their only concern being the making of huge profits at the expense of our industries and workmen.",63,Francis N O One Suggested Able Members Opposite Think But I Am
218,Mr C. Riley (Cook) I[10.10],"The Attorney-General, in his second-reading speech, quoted at length from the Workers' Weekly, It is strange that honourable members behind the Government have displayed a greater interest in that journal than have honourable members on this side. We have every reason to suspect that the Workers' Weekly is controlled by the interests that largely contributed to the campaign funds of the Government. The Attorney-General significantly stated that no advertisements appeared in that journal, and, in view of the thousands of its. copies that are distributed, and the tens of thousands that were distributed just before the elections, I special Investigation Branch and the members of the Commonwealth Police Force were not instructed to inquire as to the source of the funds of this journal? members behind the Government were guilty of many utterances which they did not honestly believe. I desire to place on record a statement made by the honourable member for . ""Wentworth ( Mr Marks) at Clovelly, on the 19t.h October last. The question was addressed to him, ""Can you j u s t if y the action of the Bruce Government in' having cruisers! built overseas ? "" cause the Government knew that if the keels were laid at Cockatoo Island, the communists would prevent them from ever reaching the water."" 'So honourable member would seriously subscribe to such a contention. That statement was deliberately made w i th a view to in j u r in g the Labour candidate and the Labour party generally. Then, again, we have been charged w it h disloyalty. The Governor General Lord Stonehaven, on 23rd October, said, "" L o y a l t y to the Crown is nowhere more marked in the whole of the Empire, not excluding the centre of the Empire, than it is in Australia,"" Bruce), for purely party purposes, at that time said, "" Revolutionary forces are at work in Australia to disrupt, our Empire; I am appealing to the country to give me a mandate to deal with the situation."" I should like to ask whether it was His Majesty's representative or the Prime Minister who told the truth. This measure is purely camouflage, and introduced with the idea of saving the face of the Government. I shall never admit that to strike is to commit a crime. Why does not the Government display the same earnestness in dealing w it h market-riggers and the manipulators of cold storage that it shows in introducing al bill w i th a view to in j u r in g and interfering with the trade unions of Australia? The honourable member for Angas( Mr. Parsons) spoke of the primary produce of the country having been held up. It is lawful for owners to hold up primary produce, but a similar act by the workers is considered a crime. Not many months ago the wealthy pastoralists and the wool-selling brokers of this counask the Attorney-General why the try decided to withhold their wool from sale because they were not satisfied with the prices they were receiving. That was countenanced by the Government. Buti f the workers, who have nothing to sell but their labour, During the election, honourable refuse to sell it because the return is considered to be unsatisfactory, the Government says that they must be punished, or even deported, for having been associated with a strike. The refusal of the pastoralists and the wool-selling brokers to offer their wool for sale threw hundreds of storemen, trolley and dray men, as well as seamen and wharf labourers, out of employment, but there was no sympathy The reply was, "" Yes, befor those men. If it be wrong for a man to refuse employment, it is equally wrong for another who has a commodity to sell to refuse to offer it for sale. The Government hastens to introduce a bill to deal with strikers, but it does nothing to interfere with the monopolists and profiteers in our midst. The right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr. Hughes) shortly after his return from the Old Country during the war period said that he was out to shoot the profiteers. But no shooting took place. We have now another Nationalist Administration, which also allows these enemies of the country to> go free. Many combines are The Prime Minister( Mr in operation in Australia to-day. We know that the brick and tile combines have operated to the detriment of the whole of the people of Australia, particularly of the returned soldiers who, having returned from the war, have been made to pay excessive prices for the bricks, tiles, and timber used in the construction of their homes. To the shame of the Government, be it said, that it has not raised a finger to protect them.
