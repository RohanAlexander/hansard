409,Mr Latham,"to move:Wednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26469 Wednesday, 4 April 2001 ----Universities: Country Students new government study relating to country students’ participation rates in university education. I also want to highlight Labor’s education policies, albeit somewhat briefly, particularly those relating to education priority areas, and the importance of country university facilities to country communities. I refer to the report compiled by the Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs headed ‘Access: effect of campus proximity and socio-economic status on university participation in regions’. This report noted that 28.4 per cent of city people between the ages of 19 and 21 went on to university, while the figure for the country was only 18.3 per cent. In my electorate, in the City of Greater Bendigo, the report reveals that the participation rate is 26.6 per cent. In Mount Alexander and the Central Goldfields region, the figure is 21.3 per cent. In both of these districts the participation rate is above the Australian country average but below the Australian city average. It is dramatically below the situation in affluent Kew, where 64.2 per cent of young people go on to university. The report concludes that the difference in participation rates is because of income and social factors, that country students are less interested than city students in university education, and that it is not because of geographical disadvantage or the fact that there are fewer university facilities in the country. I observe that the basic inequality that is often seen as geographical inequality is in fact inequality in income and life opportunities. It is not surprising that fewer country young people than city youth go on to university, because they are generally less well off, they generally leave school earlier than city youth and they are less able to afford the cost of a university education. The whole thrust of the coalition parties’ policies is to favour the rich against the rest; to favour the city against the country; and to favour wealthy schools against the less affluent Catholic parish and government schools. The coalition policies, most recently through the GST, have made education dearer. For many country kids it is a bigger sacrifice to go to university than it is for many city kids. That is why Labor’s policy of setting up education priority areas is vital for country kids. It will invest extra resources into country schools in areas of need and assist young people to stay on at school. This will help to encourage them to proceed on to the tertiary education that they want for themselves. This is a policy that faces up to the real difficulties that country kids face and will be a big change from the slash and burn policies that country schools have seen formerly under the coalition parties in Victoria. The coalition always looks after the tall poppies. It always looks after the big end of town. It is time to get back to the grassroots. I warn the government against using this report to cut back on country university facilities. I believe the availability of a university like La Trobe in my electorate does help to make university education more a part of the normal education landscape for young people. A university located in the country, as with La Trobe University’s campuses, is more interested in making itself relevant to the country community and breaking down the old barriers to university education than is a university in the city. That is why I have been so interested in protecting the identity of La Trobe University in Bendigo. (Time expired)",134,Questions To Mr Speaker What The Minister Said And Is In Keeping With

They are certainly not tall poppies; they are salt-of-the-earth people. This shows that we do recognise people right across the broad spectrum. I refer to an Australiana band, Snake Gully, a four-piece outfit featuring Tony Hillier on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Peter Ella on mandolin, fiddle, lagerphone and backup vocals, Steve Gilbert on harmonica and backup vocals, and Dave Hart on the double bass. Already a favourite with Far North Queenslanders, tourists and traditional music fans, Snake Gully is a genuine, home-grown Aussie band whose brand of music and extensive repertoire of traditional and original songs have helped the band to win the hearts of audiences wherever they perform. The widespread appeal of the band stems from its ability, through its songs and colourful renditons, to remind us all of things that make us proud to call ourselves Aussies. Snake Gully has now been invited to represent Australia at several overseas events, including performances in Beijing and at the Agricultural World Trade Fair in Shouguang City, China, later this month, as well as one of the premier folk festivals in Scandinavia, the Skagen Festival, in northern Denmark in June. As an unashamed fan of the band, I am delighted that they are now taking their act onto the world stage. That is very much in part due to the support from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, who have provided the band with an Images of Australia grant to help cover the costs of getting them to Scandanavia. They will be the sole Australian voice at one of the region’s largest and most prestigious music festivals, sharing the stage with some legendary international acts, including the Dubliners and the Fairport Convention. In China, Snake Gully will perform in the company of Nikki Webster, who starred in the Olympic Games opening and closing ceremonies. I have no doubt whatsoever how warmly Snake Gully will be received by audiences abroad, particularly at a time of heightened interest throughout the international community in Australia and its colourful heritage in the Centenary of Federation year. The passion and essence of fun they exude on stage ensures the band is booked from daylight to dusk and beyond every Australia Day, Queensland Day and for many other civic events. They often provide their talents free of charge to community groups. Snake Gully are facing the biggest gig of their 12-year career, and I cannot think of a more appropriate group of cultural ambassadors to represent our country on the international stage. I wish them every success. (Time expired) Gellibrand Electorate: Youth Initiatives Ms ROXON (Gellibrand) (9.46 a.m.)-I would like to take the opportunity in National Youth Week to congratulate some young students in my electorate who have taken an initiative to become a little more active in communicating their concerns about politics in the community to the wider region. This has come about as a result of my regular visits to secondary schools and an invitation, when I was first elected, to each of the secondary schools to send a number of their SRC students, or those students who were most interested in politics in the community, to come and meet in my electorate office. That group met a number of times and we discussed a lot of issues that were of concern to those students. Even as a young member of parliament, I am nearly double the age of most of these year 11 and 12 students, but I am very much aware that a lot of the stereotypes about young people really are not correct and that there are young people who are taking a great interest in the community and who are passionate about making sure that the world around them is a better place to live. They may find it a little easier to talk to me as a young member, but they still have concerns that are quite different generationally. I have been very pleased that they have been able to raise a range of issues with me.",135,Representatives Main Committee

Now that a number of those students have left school, this group intends to still maintain an interest in the students at the schools that they have left and involve other young people who are going off into the workplace and to university and get them to participate in the community in a range of ways. We are going to meet with them and talk about lobbying. We are going to ask the local paper to run a column from this group. We are going to talk to the councils about whether they will look at setting up youth councils. The students themselves have already identified a number of issues that they have got immediate concerns about-for example, the rights of young people in the workplace, especially as some of them enter the workplace; ways to promote drug education amongst young people, particularly using other peers to educate them and former young users. They are very concerned about youth suicide. They are interested in setting up a peer support program and providing information to others in the community about scholarships that are available within our region. They also have identified local youth housing, government support for young people and apprenticeships and training as issues that are of great concern to them. I think it is commendable that they are prepared to take a bit of a leap and that they are going to actually ask the community and representatives like me to take on their issues. I look forward very much to working with them. In particular, I want to congratulate Luke Bond, Cameron Wilson, Fiona Garlick and Tuanh Nguyen. There are also others like Imogen Ryrie, Luke Sammut and Hamza El Kurdi, and others who I hope will be more involved in the future. (Time expired) Telstra Country Wide: Townsville Herbert Electorate: Douglas Arterial Road stra and Telstra Country Wide for the very proactive way in which they have been supporting regional Australia. Only two weeks ago, I was very pleased indeed to announce 209 new full time jobs in the Telstra call centres in River Quays in Townsville. Those 209 new full-time jobs from Telstra in the CBD of Townsville have been a magnificent boost to the economy. That was on the back of 110 new full-time jobs in the Centrelink call centre. The Telstra call centre has an Australia-wide reputation in that it has won international awards for customer service. When the new staff come on board, the Telstra call centres in Townsville will be the largest call centres in regional Australia. That is a feather in the cap for Townsville, as you might imagine. On top of that, last FridayI opened the Telstra Country Wide office in Townsville. John Hooper and his team are doing a terrific job. Telstra’s philosophy is also terrific: local problems are now solved by local people, and local decisions are made for the local community. That process is working extraordinarily well because of the foresight of the Telstra board. The Queensland manager, Don Pinel, the northern Country Wide manager, John Hooper, and all the team under him are delivering customer service right on the ground where it is needed. It is the public face of Telstra, which has been missing for so long. Other exciting things are happening in Townsville and Thuringowa.

Liquefied Petroleum Gas not only in my electorate but right across Queensland and around Australia-the potential collapse of the LPG autogas industry. It has come about in recent times because of a range of factors. In particular, the collapse in the industry has come about because of the increased cost of LPG at the bowser-a cost that, depending on the source you look at, has risen by more than 300 per cent in the past 18 months. One might ask, ‘What effect is this increase in price at the bowser having not only on ordinary people who use LPG but also on the industry itself?’ The sale of installation kits and the conversion of cars have almost come to a complete halt. Nobody is converting their cars, not only because it is expensive to do so-about $2,000 to convert a car to gas-but also because of the extra GST costs involved in conversion. On top of that, as everyone knows, the price of LPG has gone up as a distinct result of the introduction of the GST. Government members interjectinglook at it. Let us compare the price of LPG before and after the introduction of the GST. Before, there was no excise and there was certainly no GST, but at the time of the introduction of the GST the price of autogas skyrocketed. ordinary people who use LPG every day. Government members always come back with this, ‘Are you going to take it off? Are you going to take it off?’ Government members interjectingcisions for all Australians. The government goes out there and rips off the ordinary consumer and then turns around and says, ‘Don’t blame us; we’re just the government.

You cause the pain and then you walk away. will address your remarks through the chair. have not caused the pain, but the government certainly has. In a media statement, the ACCC said that soaring LPG prices were caused by a combination of things-and I will be pretty honest about this-including high world prices. High world prices are, in some part, a reflection of the increased price of a barrel of oil. But the ACCC went on to refer to the GST. Further, it went on to say that prices have risen by more than 300 per cent. I can tell you what this is doing in my electorate: it is hurting ordinary people, and the government is responsible.

According to Mr David Gray, the head of Boeing in Australia, that decision need not be made for two years. Members might remember that the initial proposal to build airborne early warning and control aircraft was put forward prior to the East Timor excursion. In the wake of East Timor, we had the white paper. The white paper set out very comprehensively the needs of the defence of Australia in the wake of East Timor. It made many changes to the priorities and to the way in which we set about defending this country. We have a decision to make about the numbers of airborne early warning and control aircraft; we also have a decision to make about whether or not there will be other priorities.

In accordance with standing order 275A, the time for26474 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 April 2001 As the foreign minister himself noted in introducing the bill, the Commonwealth and state and territory governments agreed to develop a national criminal code by 2001. A key element of that development was the enactment by the Keating Labor government of the Criminal Code Act 1995. The schedule to that act, the Criminal Code, enables the most serious offences against Commonwealth law to be codified and also establishes a cohesive set of principles of criminal responsibility. An important step in the process of finalising the Criminal Code is to ensure that all offence creating and related provisions throughout Commonwealth legislation are drafted in a manner that is compatible with the principles established by the Criminal Code. Therefore, the purpose of this legislation-one of a series of bills being introduced into this parliament on a portfolio by portfolio basis-is to apply the Criminal Code to offence creating and related provisions within 11 foreign affairs and trade portfolio statutes. These laws include, among others, the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act 1994, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, the Diplomatic and Consular Missions Act 1978, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act 1991 and the Passports Act 1938. These are important statutes which underpin the proper and efficient implementation of a range of Australia’s international obligations and, in respect of the Passports Act, ensure the integrity of Australian passports as highly reliable documents of identity. The explanatory memorandum for this bill observes that the application of the Criminal Code to all offences will improve Commonwealth criminal law by clarifying important elements of offences, in particular the fault elements. At present, many hours of court time are wasted in litigation about the meaning of particular fault elements or the extent to which the prosecution should have the burden of proving these fault elements. The major forms of amendment affected by this bill are (1) the application of the Criminal Code to all offence creating and related provisions; (2) deletion of references to some Crimes Act 1914 general offence provisions, which duplicate provisions of the Criminal Code and replace these with references to equivalent Criminal Code provisions; (3) the application of strict liability to individual offences or specified physical elements of offences; (4) reconstruction of provisions in order to clarify physical elements of conduct, circumstances and result; (5) removal or replacement of inappropriate fault elements; and (6) repeal of some offence creating provisions which duplicate general offence provisions in the Criminal Code. As indicated a little earlier, in his second reading speech the foreign minister said he anticipates that the clarification of the law affected by this bill will save many hundreds of hours of court time. It remains to be seen whether the benefits will be quite as dramatic as this but, nevertheless, it is a welcome improvement. Given the technical nature of the amendments in this and other portfolios, it will only be over some period of time that any glitches or complications will become apparent. We will need to monitor the application of the amendments across portfolios and move to redress any anomalies or problems which arise. That said, the opposition is pleased to support this legislation which is part of a broad bipartisan project to give Australians greater certainty, protection and confidence under the criminal law. islation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2000 and to commend the ministers involved in introducing this bill. Obviously, as the shadow minister has mentioned, it is a coordination of the Criminal Code Bill throughout all areas of administration. The bill arises as a result of an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states and territories in 1993 to develop a national uniform criminal code. It was to be developed by 2001, so that is why we are seeing it coming into the House at the moment.",139,Representatives Main Committee
428,Mr Baird (Cook) (10.04 A.m.),"I also rise to support the Foreign Affairs and Trade LegWednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26475 Probably the most significant changes made by this bill are those that expressly apply strict liability to the offence creating provisions of the original act that it amends. They are applied in this way so that the strict liability nature of some provisions is not lost in the transition to the new Criminal Code. One of the reasons for having a uniform criminal code is that it is clear to both sides of the House that it will ensure consistency in establishing a cohesive set of principles of criminal responsibility across Australia. That, of course, is part of the significant aspect of it. The commencement of the Crimes Act 1914 created a number of Commonwealth offences, most of which concern conduct towards and conduct of Commonwealth officers and Commonwealth property. The vast majority of the Commonwealth offences created by that bill pertained to portfolio areas like environment, health, banking and insurance-areas that predominantly fall under Commonwealth jurisdiction. There were some areas of inconsistency and some grey areas in the legislation, so it was decided to bring in this uniform code. In the mid-1990s, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General decided to put the issue on their agenda at the suggestion of a group of interested parties that was pushing for the reform of criminal law. A model criminal code to SCAG was developed in mid-1992. Fifty submissions were taken into consideration before releasing the final report in 1993. In this report, SCAG agreed that we would have a uniform code by 2001-which is why we are discussing this legislation today. As part of the program of moving towards a uniform criminal code, the Criminal Code Act of 1995 was enacted, which set out a staggered timetable for this legislation to be amended and to apply to all Commonwealth offences legislated by government. From 15 December this year, it will apply to some pre-existing Commonwealth offences. In order to meet the deadline, since the middle of last year the government has introduced a large number of bills in various portfolios. Those portfolios include Treasury, justice, environment, heritage and veterans’ affairs. This bill is one of that series and applies the Criminal Code to the Foreign Affairs and Trade portfolio. The changes made by this bill are all mechanical and I only intend to cover them briefly. Put simply, the purpose of them is to ensure that offence-creating provisions will be interpreted in the same manner as they are currently, following the introduction of the Criminal Code, which particularly relates to the Foreign Affairs portfolio. The amendments are made to legislation that has been very important in Australian foreign policy, and pertains to some of the most significant international agreements that we are party to. We welcome the foreign minister to the Main Committee and commend him on the legislation before the House. The amendments cover such legislation as the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act of 1994, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act of 1998 and the Nuclear Non-proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987. With regard to the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act, this legislation harmonises existing law with the universal criminal code by applying the fault elements of ‘intentional’ or ‘reckless’ to several offences that relate to the creation, development or stockpiling of chemical weapons, all of which are obviously forbidden under the legislation. A chemical weapon can use agents like chlorine to irritate lungs; hydrogen cyanide, which kills by depriving the blood of oxygen; vesicants-mustard gases-which can cause blistering and lung damage; and nerve agents such as sarin. We are all aware of their potential dangers, brought home so vividly during the Gulf War in the 1990s, when it was feared that Saddam Hussein might have already developed chemical weapon capability. These are weapons with a sinister edge and I am pleased to note that Australia has always played a leading role in international opposition to the development and production of chemical weapons. We commend the minister for his leadership in that area. Australia, in fact, is widely recognised as having 26476 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 April 2001 played an important role in the success of the chemical weapons convention, having been one of the first countries to ratify the treaty, and having promoted it among the countries and major businesses of our region. I turn now to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1997. Australia has always played a vocal and constructive role in nuclear non-proliferation negotiations. We voiced our concerns particularly loudly when, a couple of years ago, Pakistan and India began testing nuclear weapons in contravention of the overwhelming international desire that these weapons not spread any further. We have also contributed well over $14 million to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation in order to encourage the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. This is particularly commendable in terms of the move towards bringing together the two Koreas. The bill removes references in this act to sections of the Crimes Act 1914 dealing with ancillary offences, and replaces them with the relevant sections of the Criminal Code. Offences regarding the failure by former authorised officers to hand in identity cards and failure of persons to give information when requested are also harmonised. Similarly, a change in terms of failure to return an identity card when a person ceases to be an inspector is made in regard to the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998 and the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty Act 1986. The bill will apply the provisions of the Criminal Code to the International Organisations (Privileges and Immunities) Act 1963, and it will also ensure that the particular offence of strict liability relates under that act to unauthorised use of symbols, logos, motifs and other representations of international organisations. This legislation also applies the new Criminal Code to the Australian Trade Commissions Act 1985, the Diplomatic and Consular Commissions Act 1978, the Export Expansion Grants Act 1978, the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act 1991, the Passports Act 1938 and the Registration of Deaths Abroad Act 1984. The bill assists in the broad application of the Criminal Code and, particularly, applies it to foreign affairs and trade. I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs for bringing this bill into the House to be implemented by the agreed date of 2001. I commend him also for his leadership in regard to the acts I have mentioned, particularly in relation to the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act, which he has been administering, and internationally in relation to the nuclear non-proliferation act and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty Act 1998. This bill will assist him in terms of our legal provisions in making the requirements uniform with the Foreign Affairs and Trade Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2000. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. bate on the Foreign Affairs and Trade Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Bill 2000, may I say that I appreciate the contributions that have been made by honourable members. I particularly appreciate the contribution by the member for Cook, who has shown an interest in this bill and in many of the issues that it alludes to. Given that this is a completely uncontroversial bill, I do not think there is any need for me to say very much more about it at this stage. I would just say that when the codification which is incorporated in the bill is finalised it will represent a very significant improvement to the existing Commonwealth criminal law, where serious criminal offence provisions are currently scattered through the broad range of legislation. The bill applies the Criminal Code to all offence creating and related provisions in acts falling within the Foreign Affairs portfolio, and makes all necessary amendments to those provisions to ensure compliance and consistency with the Criminal Code’s general principles. The member for Cook spoke a little about some of the pieces of legislation that this codification relates to-the Chemical Weapons (Prohibition) Act, the Comprehensive Nuclear TestBan Treaty Act, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act and so on.

429,Mr Downer (Mayo,"Minister for Foreign Affairs) (10.12 a.m.)-In concluding the deWednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26477 important components of Australia’s contribution to arms control and disarmament. I think it is has become something of a great Australian tradition on both sides of politics that we have been able to contribute so much in these areas, from the work Australia did on the development and eventually the introduction, by coalition governments, of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, back in the 1960s, through to the work that was done by the former Labor government on the chemical weapons convention. My predecessor, Gareth Evans, was very active in drawing up and implementing that convention. To claim something for myself: we worked to bring into effect the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, which was another of the great achievements of Australian policy in this area of arms control and disarmament. We have enacted legislation in our country to implement the provisions of those treaties. Although all that this legislation does is to clarify the Criminal Code in relation to those acts, it is an opportunity for us to reflect on the very long and great tradition this country has in providing a common sense input to the global debate about arms control and disarmament. It is something that we will be continuing to do in the months and years ahead. As the foreign minister I appreciate it that this is a completely uncontroversial piece of legislation. It saves me a lot of time if my legislation is uncontroversial. With that in mind, I commend the bill to the Main Committee. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. COAL INDUSTRY REPEAL BILL 2000 Second Reading Debate resumed from 28 June 2000, on motion by Mr Entsch: That the bill be now read a second time. which often go without saying because they are so self-evident, we are inclined at times to forget their importance. Energy, and coal, is one such commodity. Coal is such a part of our national life and has been for so many years that it is easy to take the commodity, the export income that it provides and the energy that it generates for our homes, commerce and industry for granted. But that would be a very serious mistake because coal is one of our most significant commodity exports, if not the most significant commodity export, contributing some $9 billion to our national export quota. It is a significant contributor to GDP. Over many years, energy usage, and in particular coal usage, has changed quite dramatically. We need only look back 100 years to see the way in which world energy usage has changed. In those days, coal was very much the dominant influence. Over the next half a century, it continued to be the most important single factor in energy production and was a very significant part of the Australian east coast economy, to say nothing of the developing world. The rationale for the Coal Industry Repeal Bill 2000 is that, in the days following World War II, the significant importance of this one commodity justified very significant and special treatment in a legislative and community sense. The Commonwealth and New South Wales agreed that it would be an important step forward in the development of this industry if they were to combine, in mirror legislation, to establish a Joint Coal Board of the Commonwealth and New South Wales parliaments and governments, which would allow somewhat greater input into the development of what was then, and remains now, a vital industry for Australia. The Joint Coal Board, in the days since it was established in 1946, has undertaken some very important work in the mechanisation of the industry, in dramatically improving mining and safety standards-I will have more to say about that shortly-and in establishing some",142,Representatives Main Committee
430,Mr Martyn Evans (Bonython) (10.16 A.m.),"With respect to many of the things26478 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 April 2001 very important community facilities in those areas where coal is mined, many of which city dwellers take for granted, including things like recreational facilities and parks and gardens, as well as the actual utilities which the towns in those coal areas depended upon. The board ensured that there was investment in mechanisation, which has contributed so much to the productivity of the industry, and investment in worker safety, which should always have been the highest priority of the industry and perhaps in recent years has actually taken that position, whereas in earlier days there were some significant fatalities and serious injuries. Obviously, we need zero tolerance for mine deaths and injuries, something which the industry is now conscious of; certainly, it is something which the board has helped to foster within the industry, particularly in recent times. One may gather from those remarks that the Joint Coal Board has been, in the 50-odd years of its existence, very successful in promoting the objectives which those who established it all those years ago had in mind. That is a very valid conclusion. But the board, like any organisation which has been so successful, can in some respects be the author of its own demise. Because of that success and the condition in which the industry now finds itself, and because of its highly competitive nature and the very significant overseas demand and need for entrepreneurial activity in the industry by way of management of many of the processes which the industry uses, it is probably quite appropriate that the Commonwealth should now step back from its involvement in the Joint Coal Board and allow this to be a state issue in New South Wales-as it is in every other state. There is no longer any compelling reason, any national justification, for the Commonwealth to be involved in the management of a joint coal board in New South Wales when it is not in any other state. New South Wales is quite capable of managing and running its own coal industry. The negotiations in recent times between the stakeholders-the New South Wales and Commonwealth governments, the various unions involved and the industry-have been relatively successful. As I understand it, some matters remain to be negotiated and resolved: the mirror legislation in New South Wales is yet to be introduced and passed, and the Commonwealth legislation will not be proclaimed until such time as there is complete agreement. That would certainly accord with the opposition’s view in this matter, because we prefer this to be done by consensus and agreement between the unions, the industry, the New South Wales government and the Commonwealth government, which is stepping out of involvement. It is important that that takes place, and I would appreciate an assurance from the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources and/or his parliamentary secretary that it will be the primary consideration in the proclamation of this legislation at some point in the future. Agreement of all of the parties, including the workplace through its representatives, is vital and we would not expect changes to proceed until that step has been achieved. Let me turn to the more mechanistic provisions such as for the funding of superannuation. The board has been involved in a whole range of activities, from picking up the unfunded liabilities of the super fund some years ago to workers’ compensation measures, and it has assisted in ensuring health standards. For example, the black lung which was so prevalent years ago has been dramatically reduced, and some very important steps have been taken by the board to ensure not only the productivity of the industry but also the safety and security, health and welfare of the work force. These considerations have been very important over time, and we should never lose sight of them. The coal industry is very important to Australia and, indeed, to the world as a whole. Coal remains one of our important sources of energy, but it is a controversial source in the context of a greenhouse challenged world. That is an issue which we must all address in the years to come. However, the reality is that, in the immediateand medium-term future, coal-in particular, but along with other fossil fuels-will remain one of our most significant contributors to energy. So we need to look at ways of ensuring that the coal itself is able to generate that Wednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26479 energy in the most efficient and least carbon intensive manner. That is very important because, obviously, coal is mainly carbon. Except where it has a significant component of water, as in the case of the Victorian brown coal-which makes up for that by being substantially cheaper-the burning of the carbon in the context of generating electricity produces significant pollutants, including one which is now recognised as a pollutant but was not so recognised until recently: carbon dioxide. Significant work has been undertaken in eliminating many of the other traditional pollutants-the nitrous oxides, the sulphur dioxides, the particulate matters and other components of the gas stream which come out of the burning process. This has been particularly important in ensuring that these plants are environmentally acceptable to the community in the traditional sense. I think modern plants can now lay claim to being very low pollution devices indeed, provided that they are properly operated. This is true especially of the most recent and modern plants. Those which are operated in the developing world and some of the older plants in Australia are, unfortunately, still significant contributors of traditional pollutants and are very substantial contributors of carbon dioxide. One of the best things Australia and the developed world can do in the short term to contribute to both the removal of traditional pollutants from the atmosphere and the removal of carbon dioxide is to ensure that their own plants are efficiently operated, that the latest technology, which is significantly better than previous technologies, is implemented in their own power plants and that the developing world has access to this new technology. It is a far better use of our resources to ensure that they have access to that technology and that they have some of the most efficient plants as against those which they now operate or which they propose to build in the medium term, because that is one of the best ways of reducing the overall pollution load on the planet’s atmosphere. That would be a far better contribution to the future of the planet. Of course, few people really take this aspect into account. The transfer of technology and funding which would allow that to occur in the developed world would be a very significant contributor to our joint futures in this matter. In Australia coal has enormous potential to be a cheap source of energy into the future, but to do that we have to be very conscious that research is required to ensure that it is at world’s best practice and that we continue the downward trend. Unfortunately, the government, in its greenhouse response and in its response to the industry as a whole, has really failed to address in any significant way-although there are some initiatives that I will speak about in a moment-the need for a massive investment in R&D into the use of coal technology. That would allow us to continue to use coal for some time but still be a responsible environmental and global citizen and still take advantage of the cheap energy which Australia has always relied on and which remains to a large extent our competitive advantage. All of the coal initiatives in recent times-the CRC for sustainable energy and the clean coal technology initiatives-are vitally important. Coal in a Sustainable Society, for example, is undertaking research into the lifecycle analysis of coal and other energy sources to provide full information to consumers and the government. The much touted hydrogen technologyhydrogen cars are an example, and this is something that I support in an energy context-is claimed to be a source of energy free of carbon dioxide pollution, and indeed most other pollutants. But I refer to this as a pollution elsewhere technology, because the reality is that, while the use of that hydrogen in a vehicle at the time of combustion is relatively pollution free, to generate that hydrogen one requires the significant consumption of energy and the production of other pollutants at other times and other places. We need to understand the lifecycle analysis not only of hydrogen but also of coal in its use for power generation, steel production and a variety of undertakings in comparison with natural gas and other energy generating technologies like biomass and so on. Unless we take into account the pollution production, including CO2, of these energy technologies, from the cradle 26480 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 April 2001 to the grave, so to speak, we will not properly understand the overall impact that they have on our environment. It is very important that the government contributes far more than it has already to these technologies. The industry is contributing on a significant basis, and I encourage it to continue to do that, because it is its own future that we are looking at here. Certainly, the Australian national interest will be best served by having significant investment in research into what I might broadly characterise as clean coal technology and improving the efficiency of the use of coal technology. In that way, we can continue to use what has been a very important source of cheap energy for Australia. That combination of investment by the government, investment by the industry, retrofitting of older plants where that is relevant and, most importantly, the transfer of this technology to developing countries, represents the most significant contribution that we can make to the overall advantage of our own $9 billion a year coal export industry and to the world as a whole. In supporting this legislation in the context which I have already outlined, I conclude by mentioning one of the most important areas in which the Commonwealth government, at a national level, can continue to provide leadership in this industry-that is, apart from the environmental questions that I have discussed, the issue of mine safety and worker safety. We must have a zero tolerance policy in respect of mine accidents, mine injuries and mine deaths at any level. We must ensure that this culture is spread throughout the industry. While the Joint Coal Board, which we are referring to this morning, had a very important role to play in that regard, a lot of work remains to be done. There needs to be Commonwealth government leadership, not just in relation to the New South Wales industry but in relation to the industry as a whole. There are 18,000 to 20,000 workers in New South Wales and Queensland alone, plus those who work in the alternative brown coal industry in Victoria, plus those in other parts of the country to a lesser extent, including in my own state of South Australia, which has significant deposits in Leigh Creek and elsewhere. That issue of mine safety remains paramount. It is an area where the Commonwealth government probably has minimal legislative and day-to-day management responsibility but where it can take an overall leadership position in ensuring that industry and state governments remain fully conscious of the need for zero tolerance and adapt the latest world’s best practice on standards and performance issues in mine safety and mine management. You cannot impose industry-wide directives which specify precisely how each mine will be run ‘safely’. The reality is that this is a day-to-day management decision and a decision by each individual throughout the work force who is involved in the mining process to ensure that safety standards are at the highest possible level. It is a responsibility of the individual at the coalface-in this case literally. That responsibility also heads right back through management, through the supervisory staff, right through to the board of directors of the company which owns the resource. That responsibility must be shared equally by those groups. They each have a responsibility to ensure the adequacy of their own performance in this matter. At the very top of this process, the Commonwealth government has the responsibility to ensure there is national leadership by talking with industry and state governments, convening groups where necessary, ensuring the publication of statistics so that we can monitor these activities, and ensuring that everyone is aware of the importance of this issue. In supporting the bill on the basis that I have outlined, importantly, there is the need finally to conclude the negotiations with the New South Wales government, with industry representatives and with the trade unions involved, to make sure that everyone’s position has been appropriately taken into account in relation to the legislation. With that qualification, the opposition is happy to support the measure-indeed, because it reflects so much about Australia’s industrial capacity both historically and, I believe, into the future. Wednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26481 of Wentworth, and I do not think there ever will be. I have to say that the income that people enjoy in parts of my electorate, certainly when you look at it by postcode, is among the highest in the nation. As the previous speaker, the member for Bonython, said, coal energy and the support that it gives to the Australian economy should never be taken for granted. HenceI chose to speak on the Coal Industry Repeal Bill 2000. I do so for another reason. Nothing gives me more pleasure around Canberra than to see the Commonwealth withdraw from having something to do with an activity that could be better done by a state government. I am very much a federalist in these matters and I do think that, over the years as power has relentlessly found its way to Canberra and as the powers in section 51 of the Constitution have been more and more loosely interpreted, the quality of government has not necessarily travelled along the same path. So it is a fine thing to see the national parliament handing back control over some particular instrumentality to a state-in this case the Joint Coal Board. The very name, the Joint Coal Board, takes you back to the middle decades of this century when governments tended to set up boards to control things. I think we could do well to withdraw from a few more of these. In an abstract sense people think of energy as a matter of national security, as something that is very important to the idea of protecting one’s sovereignty even and one’s safety in a dangerous and sometimes difficult world. This debate has emerged in the context of the bid by Shell for Woodside. I will not say anything more about that other than to support the notion that some security of energy supply is important. In Australia’s case it is clear that our comparative advantage lies squarely with the low cost of energy that coal provides us. This is especially so in Victoria and especially so in the seat of McMillan-and the honourable gentleman from McMillan is sitting on the other side of the chamber. The debate on coal, energy and so forth leads inevitably to Kyoto and the events of the last week from Washington and through other capitals in Europe. Things were said by heads of government about the protocol negotiated at Kyoto that attempted to regulate carbon worldwide. The failure of that attempt is now very much on the agenda in Canberra too. There are some things about the science underpinning the Kyoto protocol that ought to be said fairly clearly. The first is that the greenhouse effect is not something new. It is in the minds of some people that this has recently been discovered and is inevitably linked to the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This, of course, is rubbish. There has been a greenhouse effect on this planet ever since it came into being. Water, clouds and vapour in the atmosphere trap sunlight or infra-red energy and hence keep the surface of the earth warm. Otherwise we would simply freeze every night, as would be the case on the moon, for example, where there is no water. There has always been a greenhouse effect. What is under debate now is whether or not that greenhouse effect-what is called ‘forcing’ in meteorological science jargon-is increasing the temperature on the surface of the earth as a result of the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. There is no argument that carbon dioxide concentrations are increasing. Last night at a private meeting of the Joint Committee on Treaties, Dr Stephen Schneider, an American scientist, provided us with graphs. One graph shows CO2 concentrations purporting to go back to around 1,000 years and then projects the possible increases henceforth. The curve rises exponentially. I seek leave to table that graph. Leave granted. years or so are a fact. The next step in the debate is: what is the nature of the nexus between carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and climate. This gets down to what are known as GCMsglobal climate models or general circulation models. These are the mathematical equations",143,Representatives Main Committee

432,Mr Andrew Thomson,"Increases in CO2 in the atmosphere for the last 100 to 15026482 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 April 2001 that scientists involved in research into this area have been using to try to prove a connection between carbon dioxide and temperature increase. Temperature has always fluctuated on earth for reasons that are not well understood. Some factors, such as the movement of ocean currents, give rise to different fluctuations in average temperature from year to year, decade to decade or century to century in different parts of the world. You can see that the cycle of temperature change in the North Atlantic, for example, will be different to that in the Pacific, where ocean currents, which give rise to El Nino and La Nina phenomena, have a different effect on the climate here. When you try to model the whole planet according to these projections or according to these hypotheses, you get something that is terribly complicated-so much so, to be frank, that in the inquiry that the treaties committee have been carrying out we have simply been unable to obtain a clear explanation of how these models work. These projections contain various hypotheses rendered into mathematical equations which, according to some of the scientists, take account of what are called stochastic variations-that is, random events. For example, you might have a sudden seismic movement in the Antarctic which will give rise to a surge of ice down the glaciers. This will have an effect on the currents flowing around the Pacific which, in turn, will have an effect on the climate. In these models, it is supposed that the random nature of some of these seismic movements is taken into account. I frankly find this difficult to believe, but it was said to us by some of these scientists and, for the time being at least, it is open to debate whether the models in that respect are reliable. What is going to happen henceforth with this research is probably of more importance to us. When people say that the science is certain or the science is in doubt, it is not quite accurate to say that. It is more that the science is still developing. For example, research into the issue of water vapour, and a phenomenon described as ‘venting’ in the Pacific, has been drawn to my attention recently. I note that in an article in the Financial Review today, Peter Walsh, a former senator, alluded to a piece of research conducted by three scientists from NASA’s Goddard institute which is in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The three scientists-Richard Lindzen, Ming-Dah Chou and Arthur Hou-published an article in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society entitled ‘Does the earth have an adaptive infrared iris?’ This is a very interesting piece of research. By observing the cloud cover in the tropics, particularly in the tropical area between Australia and Japan, these scientists discovered that in certain places where the surface temperature of the earth increased or was higher than in the surrounding areas, the cloud cover above that particular area was much less than it was in the surrounding areas. They state: ... it has been found that the area of cirrus cloud coverage normalised by a measure of the area of cumulus coverage decreases about 22% per degree Celsius increase in the surface temperature of the cloudy region. What this in a sense means is that where a particular spot on earth-in this case in the tropics-heats up very quickly, it may be that the clouds will naturally open, as the iris of your eye will open or close according to the ambient light, and allow some of the infrared energy, that is the heat, to vent back out through the atmosphere. So it may be-and this is again hypothesising-that the atmosphere itself can adapt to increases in temperature of a cyclical nature or even increases of temperature caused by, if it is true, increases in carbon dioxide. That is to say, it has been assumed all along that carbon dioxide is going to increase. Therefore, according to the greenhouse effect, temperature will increase somewhere between, according to the latest estimates of the IPCC, 1.5 degrees and 5.8 degrees in the next century. Put aside the enormous difference in those estimates and ask yourself this: is the atmosphere something static? Is it simply a mathematical equation, such that A plus B will always equal C? Or can the atmosphere itself adapt to changes that might be happening within it? Wednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26483 These things, of course, are hypotheses; they are uncertain. But if they are true, and if it is the case that the earth will adapt to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the estimates of temperature increase are wrong-that is to say, they will not increase by that muchthen to take measures now to cap emissions, to raise the cost of energy by an enormous degree in an economy such as Australia’s now, would be quite simply foolish in the extreme until the research on this is much more certain. The risks of doing that are far too high. There are other aspects of the science that are still evolving and developing now and that are not included in these GCM models; hence the reliability of them remains, I believe, in question. For example, the west Antarctic ice sheet contains enough water in it to raise the sea level on the surface of the earth by five metres. If the ice in the Antarctic were all to melt, the sea level would rise five metres. That would be the end of us: ‘It’s all over, Red Rover.’ What is the state of that ice sheet? Some say that, as the temperature is going to rise according to the models, it is going to melt anyway, so we are all ‘rooned’, to use a phrase these days. But on the other hand, surging or streaming of ice from the glaciers in the Antarctic-which is a land mass, of course-happen not simply as a matter of ambient temperature but also because of seismic events underneath it. If random or predictable types of seismic events are going to cause a greater surging of ice in the future, then this will have the effect of raising the level of the sea in any case, regardless of what happens in the atmosphere. So, in one way, the debate about Kyoto, about global warming as it is described, is missing the point if these things are going to happen for reasons other than temperature, or if they are not going to happen because of the earth perhaps even adapting to anthropogenic changes, or even if the ocean, which sequesters carbon, may adapt. That is another piece of research that is worth noting: in volume 407 of the journal Nature from October last year, a review article published by two scientists, Daniel Sigman and Edward Boyle, pointed out that the sequestration of carbon in the ocean interior by a ‘rain’, as they call it, of organic carbon out of the surface of the ocean is something that they describe as a ‘biological pump’ and is not yet quite understood and explained. That is to say, they talk about the presence of a concentration of carbon dioxide in the ocean and in the atmosphere going back during the Ice Ages as being something that is not understood. Likewise, just as the atmosphere itself may adapt to an increase in carbon dioxide, it may well be that the ocean will do so too and will absorb more of it; and hence this will have an effect on the models. These things are not yet in the models. I would urge those interested in the debate in the future, and particularly those in government, to spend more time on research that is not so much directed by the IPCC, which seems to regard itself as the custodian of the science of this question, but that goes into some of the surrounding areas that would tend to question what those involved in the IPCC are doing-because, if there is anything valuable going to come out of this debate or this issue, it will be a genuine debate between the scientists. Lastly, on coal and the question of carbon leakage, as it has been described, no-one should be under any illusion as to the ruthlessness with which large multinational corporations and other custodians of capital will make investment decisions in the future, based on the cost of energy. It is simply fantasy to imagine that, where there are differences in the regimes regarding the emissions of carbon dioxide-if that is to be the case in the future-investment will not naturally shift to where the return on equity will be higher as a result of those differences. That is to say, if Australian governments are so foolish as to attempt to initiate a carbon withdrawal regime in this country it is quite obvious that, in the future, smelting capacity will move offshore. It will move to Indonesia, to India and to China, and it will inflict enormous damage on our national income and on employment prospects, particularly in areas outside the metropolitan parts of Australia: the Latrobe Valley area, the Hunter Valley, the Bowen Basin and other parts of Australia that so proudly produce our valuable cheap energy. 26484 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 April 2001 This bill is something I am glad to hear that both sides of the parliament are going to support. It is good to see the Commonwealth withdrawing from an activity that can be better done by a state government. Most of all, I urge members to pay more attention to some of the science surrounding the issue of carbon dioxide emissions, atmospheric changes and so forth, and to take a little more objective view of the debate than otherwise you might if you listened only to those who propose that we sign up to Kyoto and do nothing else. portant debate on the Coal Industry Repeal Bill 2000, as it deals with changes to the administration of the coal industry within New South Wales. It is always interesting to listen to the honourable member for Wentworth, and it was quite interesting to follow him today because the Wentworth family made their fortunes from coal. Indeed, in my area the main street through Port Kembla is called Wentworth Street, not that any Wentworths ever lived there. The mines that the early Wentworths owned and operated were very different to the mines of today, but the progress and work conditions in the mining industry were not easily won. There has been a long history of struggle; indeed, within the industry, it is still a struggle. As others have said, the purpose of this bill is to dissolve the Joint Coal Board under the Coal Industry Act 1946 and transfer all the assets and liabilities to New South Wales. This follows a long standing Commonwealth government policy to place the New South Wales coal industry on an equal footing with other coal producing states that each adequately service their coal industry without this level of Commonwealth oversight or involvement. There are still a few minor issues to be sorted out between the New South Wales government and the federal government, and indeed within the unions, but I am confident that the issues will be adequately sorted out. As I understand it, this legislation has to be jointly proclaimed within New South Wales and the Commonwealth. It is quite interesting that, usually when an instrumentality or a body is transferred from the Commonwealth to the state, this comes at a cost, but there is no cost involved in this transfer. Madam Deputy Speaker Gash, as you would appreciate, coming from the south coast of New South Wales, the coal industry has gone through dramatic changes, especially in relation to underground pits in recent years. Too much coal has been sterilised, especially in the Illawarra, and I believe in years to come Australia will pay a price for this. The coal industry work force has dramatically changed. When I was first elected in 1983, something like 5,000 employees worked in the pits in the southern coalfields. This figure has now been reduced to about 1,000. I strongly support what the opposition spokesperson said about mine safety. Everyone appreciates that safety in mines is a vital issue; it is one of the key issues facing the coal industry. The Australian Coal Industry Council conducted a survey that found that underground coalminers in Australia have a one in 28 chance of dying over a working life of 40 years. We are very familiar with the tragedies in the pits in the Illawarra. Only two weeks ago, I attended the annual commemorative service at the Bulli miners cottage commemorating that dreadful disaster in 1887 when there was an explosion in the Bulli pit which left 81 people dead. The impact on that small community at that time was quite devastating. That tragedy is commemorated each year, and the names of those who have died in the pits in the following years are added to the honour roll. This year, another name of a miner who lost his life in the southern fields last December was added. Members would be very familiar with the Appin disaster which occurred a few years ago. So always within the southern area, we are very conscious of mine safety and we are conscious of the cost of these accidents not only because of the loss of human life but because of the impact they have on the community. There is a need for a rapid and substantial improvement in mine safety performance, particularly as it relates to the elimination of fatalities and serious injuries. The key to reaching these goals is the attitude of all employers, management and staff involved in the mining in-",147,Representatives Main Committee
433,Mr Hollis (Throsby) (10.51 A.m.),"I am pleased to make a short contribution to this imWednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26485 dustry. All employers and employees must adopt an attitude of zero tolerance for fatalities and injuries. To achieve this attitudinal change, the boards and management of all mining companies must show absolute commitment to safe practices. There is a need for the government to keep working with the coal industry and the unions to develop a national approach to implementing world’s best practice in mine safety. One pleasing and little noted aspect of this legislation is that the rescue stations will come under the control of the Joint Coal Board. The work of the mine rescue stations is vital, but funding for their important work has always been difficult to come by in the past and it has always come on a very ad hoc basis, sometimes through levies and other funds. But now, adopting a secure funding situation will ensure that their work continues, it will give added confidence to the work force and it will enable increased training in rescue techniques to be carried out. One issue relating to the industry that concerns me is that BHP and coalminers in the Illawarra and parts of Queensland have been involved in very protracted negotiations over pay and conditions for 12 months. There have been numerous stoppages and industrial disputes during this time as miners have tried to get a fairer deal in pay while maintaining their conditions. Miners have been involved in ensuring the productive capacity of mines in Australia. They have restructured their workplaces. I have seen the decline in the work force, but I have also seen the restructure in those workplaces. They are efficient and productive workers. Surely miners deserve some of the recognition for their involvement in ensuring the survival of coal production in Australia. They are not asking for a certificate to hang on the wall; they just want fair wages and conditions. Coal prices have been up in recent years, and the workers deserve a cut of this. As I have pleaded time and time again, BHP should negotiate with the miners and the CFMEU in good faith and resolve the pay dispute. The demand for coal has grown by over one million tonnes over the past two decades. Australia is the world’s largest exporter of black coal, a position it has held since 1984. Australian coal is exported to more than 30 countries around the world. Although many people are not as vocal on the issue of a national coal authority today as they have been in the past, I am still committed to this concept. I raised it in my first speech in this parliament, and throughout the time. I have been in the parliament I have constantly argued in favour of it, not only with the current government but with governments on my own side of politics. It always seems to me that shadow ministers for resources are very enthusiastic about a national coal authority until they become ministers with responsibility for resources; then the industry bureaucrats get at them. We have had national authorities for wool, wheat and beef, but somehow, when we are dealing with this commodity which is vital for Australia, they say, ‘No, we can’t have it there; free market forces must reign supreme.’ Over the years I have watched the producers, one after the other, being called in from their hotel rooms to the boardrooms in Tokyo. One after another, they are played off, one against the other. The first one caves in, then there is a mad scramble for market share. It usually involves a cave-in on a declining price, so in order to keep that up, there is a mad scramble for market share. I think there should be a national coal authority. I have always believed that. Coal is so vital to the economy of Australia that you cannot leave the negotiations to the producers, who will always cave in. There must be a national approach. I support this legislation and commend it to the Main Committee. I know that there are still a few issues to be resolved between the New South Wales government, the federal government and other people who are involved, but I am sure these issues will be speedily resolved. As I said, I commend the legislation to the Main Committee and to the House. 26486 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 April 2001 Repeal Bill 2000, and there is a lot of history in our nation’s coal industry. I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate. The history contained in this bill is characterised by cooperation-cooperation between state governments and federal governments and between employers and employees. I think we can draw on that history all the way back to 1946, when the Joint Coal Board was first established. Today, in the year 2001, we should think about the lessons that can be learned from that history and from those people’s experiences. The Joint Coal Board did a lot of good things. It put occupational health and safety for coal workers at the very front of the debate on the coal industry. It played a major role in things like mechanisation in the coal industry, and it also provided important support for coal mining communities in terms of providing recreation, sporting, community and cultural facilities. So it played an empowering role; it played a developing role for coal workers, for their communities and for the industry more generally. I think that sort of cooperation, that sort of coming together, so that people understood they had more in common than in disagreement, is the sort of history from which we should try to learn today, some 55 years after the Joint Coal Board was first established. In my electorate, there are vast brown coal reserves. In fact, the Latrobe Valley has the largest brown coal reserves in the world. We use that brown coal to create the electricity which is used to power the state of Victoria. Increasingly, we supply to other states as well through the interconnects. There is a proposal to develop a link between Tasmania and Victoria, which would enable us to provide electricity to the state of Tasmania as well. So the role which the Latrobe Valley has played over 50 years has been to power Victoria and, increasingly over the last few years, we have also been making a contribution to providing electricity to New South Wales, and perhaps in the future to Tasmania. We have done this by dint of the hard work and application of the people of the Latrobe Valley. There have been great sacrifices made by many families. In fact, the Latrobe Valley is one of the great Australian stories in terms of bringing migrants into our nation to do work on important national infrastructure projects. People talk a lot about the Snowy. The building of the Snowy Hydro Scheme is a great national achievement. On the same scale is the building of the power stations in the Latrobe Valley. It is appropriate that we recognise the contribution of those workers and their families to building those assets, which are so important to Victoria and increasingly to other states in the Commonwealth. It did not come easy to those people who were working on those power station projects. Whilst we have heard that the Joint Coal Board did a lot to move occupational health and safety forward in the coal industry in New South Wales, unfortunately the monsters who used to run the SEC in Victoria were not so concerned with the occupational health and safety of their work force. They allowed the widespread use of asbestos in construction for many decades. This has led to a serious problem that we now confront in the Latrobe Valley. Sadly, the Latrobe Valley has one of the highest incidences of asbestos exposure of any region in the industrialised world. This is as a direct result of the uncaring attitude taken by SEC management in the Latrobe Valley for many years. It is a shame that we did not see the improvement in the Latrobe Valley that the coalminers and their families saw in New South Wales as a result of the Joint Coal Board. In New South Wales they saw substantial steps forward taken because of this coming together of workers, employers and the state and federal governments. Real improvement was made to their circumstances and to the occupational health and safety of their industry as a result of the Joint Coal Board. Sadly, in Victoria, we did not see anywhere near enough progress made in terms of occupational health and safety for the work force of the Latrobe Valley. We are suffering",150,Representatives Main Committee
434,Mr Zahra (Mcmillan) (11.02 A.m.),"A lot of history is contained in the Coal IndustryWednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26487 now as a result of that. The high incidence of asbestos exposure in the Latrobe Valley is proof of that neglect by SEC management over many decades. Such cooperation which led to the forming of the Joint Coal Board can only happen where there is goodwill between employers and employees and a will on behalf of government to create an environment in which this cooperation can take place and can be encouraged. Sadly, of late in the power industry in the Latrobe Valley, industrial relations have been characterised by barbarism rather than by any cooperation. The worse example of this is the prolonged industrial dispute that is taking place right now at Yallourn Energy, the old Yallourn power station, and has been dragging on for more than 18 months. It demonstrates what happens when you get a company which is prepared to use all of the monstrous provisions of the industrial relations legislation put in place by this government to try and get rid of all the hard-won conditions and entitlements of its work force. This company wants people who work at Yallourn Energy reduced to casual employees on limited wages and at the beck and call of the company. That is not our way in the Latrobe Valley. We have a long and proud tradition of cooperation and working together with employees and employers to come up with positive solutions to any of the industrial situations that we face. During a period of profound change in the Latrobe Valley, over eight or nine years we moved from having about 12,000 people to having 2,500 people directly employed in the power industry. We did that with almost no industrial disputation. Successful negotiations for EVAs have been achieved at Loy Yang Power, Energy Bricks Australia and Hazlewood Power, the other generators in the Latrobe Valley. It has only been the absolute determination on the part of Yallourn Energy to strip its work force of its hard-won conditions and entitlements that has led to this prolonged dispute. I just make this point, Madam Deputy Speaker, before I quote from a number of documents. There have been many attempts to get Yallourn Energy and its owners, formerly Powergen International, now China Light and Power based in Hong Kong, to arrive at a position where they can resolve this dispute. There has been a lot of goodwill shown by its work force repeatedly. I know a lot of the employees who work at Yallourn Energy. I grew up with a lot of them; a lot of people worked there with my father for many years. They are ordinary working people from the Latrobe Valley. They coach our football teams; they send their kids to our local schools. A lot of these guys’ wives teach in our local schools. They run small businesses. These are just ordinary people. This is not a group of employees which enjoys any special benefits or any special entitlements above those which are enjoyed by most Australian workers. Yet the company has seen fit to try and demonise its work force as it has put in place a barbaric industrial relations strategy aimed at doing whatever it takes to take away these workers’ job security. Job security is important in the Latrobe Valley and particularly important in Moe and in Morwell where most of Yallourn Energy’s employees come from. We have an unemployment rate of about 15 per cent or 16 per cent in both of those towns. You can understand that, having gone from such a large number of workers to such a small number over that decade, people are obviously very keen to hang on to their jobs. This is especially so in light of the difficulty that people would have in getting jobs elsewhere in the district if they were to lose their jobs as a result of Yallourn Energy management getting up its agenda of stripping the work force of their job security. I am offering that just as some background for the chamber before making some remarks about the way that Yallourn Energy has conducted itself. I wrote to Yallourn Energy in relation to this dispute. In fact, I wrote to China Light and Power, the new owners of the Yallourn power station and offered to use whatever good offices I had at my disposal to try to help the dispute. I know a lot of the people involved and I know 26488 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 April 2001 a lot of the people who are on the CFMEU sub-branch at Yallourn. I have got a good relationship with the state government, with the national office of the CFMEU and with the state office of the CFMEU. I said in my letter that I had spoken to these people and that I would be prepared to intervene to help find a negotiated settlement. I thought it was a reasonably generous offer on my part. I sent the letter dated 14 February 2001 to China Light and Power. I was very disappointed, however, in the response which I got back from the group managing director, Mr Andrew Brandler, in relation to this matter. He says in his letter to me: The CLP group has made a significant investment in the Latrobe Valley. Further, the CLP Group prides itself in its track record of being a responsible corporate citizen. I seek leave to table both letters. Leave granted. about how CLP seeks to be a responsible corporate citizen, given the way that Yallourn Energy management have conducted themselves in relation to this dispute. I have here a company document from Yallourn Energy which sets out their approach in relation to industrial relations generally and the Yallourn Energy dispute more specifically. They create a number of scenarios as they work through what to do if the Australian Industrial Relations Commission comes up with a number of different possible decisions. What do they say? If the bargaining period is terminated, the strategy is: Progress to arbitration as quickly as possible. Do not negotiate during the conciliation process. That defies the whole idea of it, doesn’t it? As you go down you find they have got points 1 to 8 in relation to what they would do if the bargaining period were terminated by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. No. 5 under the heading ‘Bargaining Period Terminated’ includes civil proceedings against employees and keeping writs up their sleeve until the appropriate opportunity presents itself to lodge them. The final point under that heading is to use the public interest card, using a positive outcome to Yallourn Energy’s advantage and trying to talk that up as something which would be good for our community. As another option, they talk about what they would do if the bargaining period were suspended. In relation to what the company position should be, they say: Do not negotiate during the conciliation process. Lewinthey mean Commissioner Lewinhas assumed that both the AIRC and himself can resolve all the issues through private conference. Maintain the line that arbitration is the only way forward. Use 170MH application as a driver towards arbitration. Very cheekily, in my view, No. 4 in their strategy for what to do if the bargaining period is suspended is to argue: “Conciliation has not worked in the past why should it work now” How can it work when you have a company, or the management of a company, which is deliberately undermining the efforts made in good faith by Commissioner Lewin of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to bring the parties together to get some conciliation and a negotiated settlement? It is set out here in black and white. What this company is doing is making a mockery of the good offices of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to try and resolve this dispute. What cheek, to have in here a specific argument saying, ‘Look, conciliation has not worked. Therefore, we should go to arbitration,’ whilst their strategy earlier on is to not be involved in conciliation. It really is outrageous that they could be involved in these activities.",152,Representatives Main Committee
435,Mr Zahra,"Thank you. It seems amazing to me that he would make this commentWednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26489 Perhaps most serious of all the options is what they propose to do if the bargaining period remains in place-if that is the decision of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. They say the company position is: Take all possible actions to force a resolution of the EB process. Abandon “high morale ground”. Adopt a “feral” / more ruthless approach. Target both the union and Yallourn Energy’s employees. This is a company document. This is what they propose to do. This is how they propose to treat the people of the state of Victoria, the people of the Latrobe Valley and their own work force. Point1 under the heading ‘Bargaining Period Remains In Place’ is: Lodge an appeal within 24 hours. do not negotiate during the appeal process So, whilst we all want to see cooperation, agreement and a negotiated settlement, they are about getting 100 per cent of their agenda up and are not interested in negotiating in good faith with their work force. Point No. 2 is to lodge a 170MH application ‘immediately on the handing down of the Lewin decision’ and not to wait for the appeal. This goes on. Again there are eight points under this heading, including taking civil proceedings against their employees. Point6 is to lock out their employees for a minimum of six months, and point 7 is to increase pressure on government through summer blackouts, no further investment in Yallourn Energy and the fact that their employees will be locked out for six months. It really is a disgraceful document. And it really is disgraceful that a company should be involved in these types of deliberations which are made very calculatedly in company boardrooms to try to undermine the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and, eventually, to strip decent, hard working people of their hard-won rights and conditions. It really is appalling that a company is involved in plotting in this way to undermine the electricity supply in the state of Victoria and to undermine workers in the Latrobe Valley. I made a very genuine effort to try to intervene in this dispute, and I was very disappointed that the parent company, CLP, did not see fit to respond positively to the invitation that I extended to them to try to find a resolution to this long-running industrial dispute. It seems to me to be a great shame that we have a company which owns a very large asset in the Latrobe Valley but which is doing nothing to improve the lot of the Latrobe Valley or to improve the industrial relations reputation of our district. We have a very good record when it comes to industrial relations in our district, and we are proud of that record. We see a lot of steps forward taken on the industrial relations front by the other power generators; namely, Loy Yang Power, Hazelwood, Energy Brix and others. However, it is all for nothing when you have a prolonged industrial dispute, which is what we have at Yallourn Energy, which gets the headlines in the Melbourne and national newspapers. They talk about the industrial relations climate in the Latrobe Valley which was entirely created by plotting and scheming by CLP and its local management at Yallourn Energy. I again appeal to Mike Smith, the CEO of Yallourn Energy, to take a step back from his hardline approach to industrial relations, to recognise that more can be achieved by cooperation and by working together, and to take a step away from the hardline industrial tactics which he has employed and which thus far have got him nowhere. (Time expired) Ms HOARE (Charlton) (11.22 a.m.)-It is pertinent to point out at the beginning of my contribution the number and types of speakers who have contributed to the debate on the Coal Industry Repeal Bill 2000. We have just heard a valuable contribution from the member for McMillan, outlining the dispute that is going on in relation to power generation in his electorate in his home state of Victoria. I congratulate him on standing up for the workers in his electorate. Before the member for McMillan, we heard the member for Throsby talk about the coal mining industry and its long history in his electorate. 26490 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 April 2001 I represent coalminers and have underground coal mines in my electorate of Charlton in the west Lake Macquarie area. At last count, we had about nine underground coal mines in my electorate. It is interesting to note that the only speaker from the government side, the member for Wentworth, stood up and said, ‘I don’t have any coal mines in my electorate.’ It is telling that the coal mining areas throughout New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria are represented by Labor members of parliament, because the coal mining industry and the workers in that industry know that Labor will continue to support that industry and the workers in that industry. The Coal Industry Repeal Bill 2000 was first introduced into the House of Representatives on 28 June last year. I understand that since that time a fair bit of negotiation and discussion has been going on among the Commonwealth, the state government, the mine owners, the Minerals Council and the CFMEU, which represents the workers in the coal industry. The purpose of the bill is to repeal the Coal Industry Act 1946 and to provide for the dissolution of the Joint Coal Board as constituted under the Coal Industry Act 1946 and the New South Wales Coal Industry Act 1946. I would like to talk a bit about the history of the Joint Coal Board. We have heard a lot about the history of coal mining in our country and the contribution that that industry has made to the development of this country. I would like to speak about the history of the Joint Coal Board as, at the end of this debate, the Commonwealth will abrogate its responsibility to the coal mining industry in New South Wales. In 1997, the Joint Coal Board celebrated its 50th anniversary and it posted a brief history of its operation on its web site. I thank them for that and I will draw on some of that material in this discussion. The Joint Coal Board was first established after a royal commission into the coal industry conducted by Mr Justice Davidson. In 1930, the commission reported to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on the outcomes of that review. At that time, the commission made the initial recommendations that a board such as the original Joint Coal Board be established. They describe in great detail what the proposed board’s powers and functions should be. In fact, 30 recommendations came out of that royal commission, the majority of which can be summarised. Seven of them related to industrial relations and employment in the industry; five related to coal prices; four related to general powers of committees, et cetera; three related to welfare; another three related to coal production, utilisation and transport; three related to coal leases; two related to mine closures; two related to the internal workings of the proposed board; and one related to statistics. At that time in 1930, there was no mention of workers compensation and little mention of occupational health. The statistics that were recommended to be gathered related to production and profit, but not to accidents. The first report of the Joint Coal Board in 1948 noted that, in 1946, the Commonwealth government and the New South Wales state government mutually agreed that: ... it would be unwise to allow the coal industry in New South Wales to revert to a situation of unfettered private enterprise. This was wartime legislation and the governments in those days realised that to unleash this industry into the capitalist marketplace run by the owners of the coal would not be a very wise thing to do. In 1946, the bulk of Australian coal was produced by New South Wales. It was essential to electricity, gas production, rail transport, steel production and other industries such as cement manufacture, and for ships’ bunkers. At the time, the production capacity of the New South Wales industry was inadequate in relation to Australia’s total coal demand and that had serious implications for postwar redevelopment. Urgent action had been required to increase production, to improve efficiency, to upgrade mine and community facilities-which were spoWednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26491 ken about earlier-and to provide better health and workers compensation services. The Joint Coal Board then became a coal proprietor because nobody else was able to invest the substantial capital required to develop new mines. Particularly in the 1950s, we are talking about the development of open-cut mines and using new technology to develop those mines. At this time, the Joint Coal Board expedited the mechanisation of the industry. When the board first began operations, the general standard of pit amenities throughout the industry was poor. Only three mines had bath and change houses of a satisfactory standard, while more than half the mines did not have a satisfactory supply of drinking water at the surface. The board acted to improve these amenities to the extent of issuing formal directions to some mine owners. The board also provided funds to local government authorities to improve facilities such as water and sewerage schemes, recreational facilities, libraries, parks and gardens. We are talking about whole communities here: the communities relied on the mines for the work in the region; and then, in turn, the Joint Coal Board developed those communities to ensure that the families of the coalminers had facilities that were as good a standard as that found in capital cities. The actions of the board since its inception in upgrading pit amenities and funding the community amenities help explain the strong support for the board’s role by the miners and their unions in these local communities. The Joint Coal Board around this time started to get into more of the compensation and medical services areas of the coal mining industry. At this stage, the high cost of dust claims had actually pushed the cost of workers compensation to the point where one South Coast mine was paying the equivalent of 40 per cent of wage costs in insurance claims. The board saw this and proactively decided to establish its own scheme of workers compensation insurance, which enabled it then to be able to spread this cost throughout the industry. After 1953, the board started to look for export opportunities for coal. It identified the Japanese market as a growth area. The 1960s and the 1970s were a period of virtually uninterrupted growth for the coal industry, particularly in exports to Japan. Increased demand was reflected in coal prices. The average free-on-board value per tonne of Australian coal exports at the time was $11.28 in 1972-73; by 1974-75 it was $22.10; and by 1981-82 it was $49.63. There was a massive surge in new investment in coal mines. Capital expenditure on New South Wales coal mines was $50 million in 1970-71; $198 million in 1979-80 and $822 million in 1981-82. Between June of 1976 and 1982, 19 new mines began production-13 underground, and six open cut in New South Wales. We are starting now to see mines close in some Hunter Valley areas. In 1983 we saw a major downturn in the New South Wales coal industry. World oversupply worsened for both steaming and coking coal as new production came on stream. In New South Wales the industry collectively lost $400 million in the five years which ended in June 1988, and 15 mines were closed in the two years from 1986 to 1988. This downturn in the industry led to discussions about the future of the board and in 1984 a decision was made to restructure the board. In broad terms, the activities of the board have changed since its inception from comprehensive control of the industry, including itself producing coal, to a role of regulation and provision of specific services to the industry. It became primarily concerned with the occupational health and welfare of mine workers and continued to collect accident statistics and underwrite insurance. The brief history posted on the Joint Coal Board’s web site concludes: With its proud history of achievements in health and welfare over the last fifty years, and with innovative and responsive management, the Board looks forward to its next fifty years of service to the New South Wales coal industry. 26492 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 April 2001 I think that was in 1997. I doubt very much that they anticipated that the Commonwealth would seek to withdraw its responsibility from the New South Wales coal industry. There has been a fair bit of discussion-and very important discussion-about the health and safety of mine workers. In my local area, which is covered by the Northern District Branch of the United Mineworkers Federation in the electorate of my colleague, the member for Hunter, is the Jim Comerford Memorial Wall. This memorial wall was unveiled in 1996 by the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul Keating. I would just like to read a bit of the memorial to let members of this place know graphically what the history of coal mining really means to some of our communities. It states: This wall is a Memorial to all those who were killed in the NSW Northern District coal mines since mining commenced in 1801. While there are 1,532 names listed, it is not the full toll of all those who died as a result of being employed in the world’s most hazardous industry ... The records show that the youngest is 11 year old Robert Irving, a driver boy who was killed at the Co-operative colliery at Plattsburg on February 16, 1883, when he was ‘run over by loaded skips’. My boy has just turned 11, and I could not begin to imagine him working in a coalmine. It goes on to state: The oldest fatality on record is 73 year old Frederick Charles Roose, who was killed at the Waratah Colliery by a ‘fall of stone’. The Northern District is the State’s biggest coal producing region its borders stretching from Grafton in the north to Sydney in the south ... and Gunnedah in the west. It is the birthplace of Australia’s coal industry. The first seam was noticed in 1795 at Nobby’s Head near Newcastle. In 1801 Governor King dispatched a group of 16 convicts to mine coal there under military guard. They were soon recalled because of the difficulty in supplying this remote outpost ... There were among some 200 Irish convicts who had taken part in the Castle Hill rebellion, near Parramatta in Sydney. Their leaders were hanged and the 35 who were sent to become Australia’s first coal miners were among those who were considered the most dangerous to the colony. Since that brutal historic beginning, the Australian coal industry has grown to become our nation’s single biggest source of export income. Our industry is also the world’s leading coal exporter. While we can all be proud of the prosperity of our coal industry, this Memorial Wall is a reminder of the price Australian coal mineworkers and their families have paid for it. The United Mineworkers will continue to fight for improved safety standards and conditions for our members. We will continue to campaign for a better deal for our members and our communities. We will continue to pressure employers and Governments to ensure Australia receives a fair return for our coal in contract negotiations. Our resolve to achieve these things is steeled in the value we place on coal. We can never forget that the real price of coal is the blood and bones of our members along with the heartache and pain inflicted on the thousands of families and friends of those who lost their lives in winning coal. Black coal is Australia’s largest commodity export. It is worth more than $9 billion a year in exports, and the industry actually exports over 70 per cent of its production. We need to ensure our future coal production and we need to conserve its resources. I have a few doubts about this bill and I will take a couple of moments to express them. The Commonwealth’s withdrawal at this stage is a fait accompli. I am not fully convinced that all of the necessary arrangements or all of the points of contention between the different participants in the industry have fully been ironed out. There is not a structure in place yet in New South Wales to be actually able to take over these functions of the Joint Coal Board, and I would encourage all of the participants to work quickly to put such a structure in place. The rush by the government to tidy up some of its so-called loose ends prior to the election that will be held at the end of this year is, in relation to this bill, a bit premature. However, at the end of this debate we are going to see, as I said, the Commonwealth abrogate all its responsibilities in relation to the New South Wales coal industry. Wednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26493 I am concerned: I have outlined the history of the Joint Coal Board and the importance of the Joint Coal Board in the development of the coal industry and particularly in relation to the health and safety of its workers. Early last year, when it was first mooted that the Commonwealth withdraw from the coal board, the chairman, Ian Farrar, was quoted in the Newcastle Herald, and the article is entitled ‘Uncertain future’-and at this stage I still believe that it does have an uncertain future. Mr Farrar said that the New South Wales government was yet to decide what it would do with the board, but that he was confident that it would remain in operation. He said: We’ve had various discussions with employers, and while it might be their ideological preference that the board be abolished, they are realistic enough to know that it might not happen under the current State Government. SoI urge the state government to act quickly to establish a structure to take over the board’s responsibilities. The board has been self-funding for quite some years. As I said, it once held vast powers, including the control over the opening and shutting of coal mines; but these have been wound back and its main interests are now occupational health and safety, and mining statistics. In conclusion, I urge the state government to act quickly now and establish a structure. (Time expired) the member for Greenway is the occupant of the chair. I am speaking today on the Coal Industry Repeal Bill 2000, which repeals the Commonwealth’s Coal Industry Act 1946. I want to raise a number of issues, particularly the importance of the coal industry to Australia and to our export markets. The coal industry, which is particularly important in Queensland also, actually represents export dollars of around $5.2 billion from Queensland and a bit over $3 billion from New South Wales, and a smaller figure from the other states. But it certainly represents about a massive $9 billion worth of export trade to this country. In fact, it is the largest export commodity that we have and therefore, in my mind, it would be one of the most important industries, if not the most important industry, in Australia. There are many things said about coal and in relation to coal. It is one of these broad ranging debates which would lend itself to almost any topic, because coal is so important to employment and to exports, and it is so important in terms of all government policies. It is particularly important in terms of debates on the Kyoto Protocol, greenhouse gases and a whole range of environmental issues. It is also important in the debate about alternatives to coalsuch things as solar power, wind power, tidal power, hydro-electricity and whatever other alternative sources of fuel or methods we have to actually produce electricity. So it is a great pleasure to be talking on this bill. The bill will basically put the states on an equal footing to administer the coal industries with the Commonwealth government. The board was previously instrumental in doing a range of things, including introducing mechanisation of the Australian coal industry and eliminating pneumoconiosis, or black lung, from the New South Wales and Australian coal industry, throughout its industrial hygiene and occupational health services; and was also responsible for improving a great deal the pit amenities of workers throughout Australia. In particular, an area I want to focus on is actually a very important part, the improvement of the welfare of coalminers themselves. Earlier on I mentioned just how much money this industry represents in terms of export dollars. I also want to touch briefly on the importance of jobs. The figures I have here are from June 1999. In Queensland alone we saw 12,600-odd persons being employed in the industry. It represents a huge part of our work force. Unfortunately for the coal industry, things have not been so rosy. The coal industry is facing a bleak future. There is a whole range of reasons for this. One key reason is obviously the low price of coal on international marketsand, of course, the falling prices generally-and the level of overproduction. There is cer-",154,Representatives Main Committee

This issue is of particular importance. The government should take note of the academics who say that employees and productivity have been unfairly blamed for the industry’s apparent poor performance. It is not the workers themselves or the productivity levels which are to blame for the current state of the coal industry. Dr Bradley Bowden and Dr Peter Waring commented about this at an international industrial relations conference in Newcastle. They said: There are a number of other factors, such as technology, geology, techniques and expenditure ... Those who explain the industry’s declining performance purely in terms of labour productivity fail to understand the relationship between the market and industrial relations. I say that because I want to draw the government’s attention to their continual attack on workers generally, particularly coal workers and the union that represents them. This is a reflection of the sad state of this government when there are so many other big issues. They try to blame the occurrence of one thing on something else. This is reflected much more widely in some of the things that are occurring at the moment. I happened to come across an article in the Canberra Times last Saturday, which was entitled ‘So much time, so little success’. It goes on to highlight this bill and exactly what this government do. You can have a look at a range of issues but let us take one as an examplethe moratorium on Internet gambling that this government have failed on. They have failed on this, like they have failed on so many other things, because they have failed to understand the principal issues at hand. They have put together this bill which will not prohibit access to international gaming sites on the Internet but will prohibit access only to Australian ones. They probably think that the Australian community is so ignorant that they would not be able to access the international Internet gaming sites if there were Australian sites. They are forgetting that the Internet itself is the World Wide Web. Australians, under the government’s policies and laws, will certainly have access to as much gaming and gambling on the Net as they want as long as it is not on Australian sites. It is okay to gamble on unregulated international sites, but it is not okay to gamble on Australian sites. ranging debate but I do not know how we move from the coal industry to Internet gambling. I just do not quite see the connection. lines myself. I would ask the member to speak about the bill before the Main Committee. government’s policy approach to the coal industry, the effect that the coal industry has on our export markets and on employment, and also the welfare of those people employed in the industry-and, in particular, their families. I want to touch on how this relates to the welfare of those coal mining families that are affected by this bill. I think that Internet gambling is one of those things, although I do understand that it strays a little from the bill at hand. But this only goes some way towards demonstrating exactly where we are at. Government members might appreciate it a little more if I refer to the current state of our dollar, because this relates directly to where we are today in terms of coal. You would expect that a lowering Australian dollar would be a good thing for the Australian coal industry, but it certainly has not been because the coal industry is facing a very bleak future. I will look more closely at that, and at where we were in 1996, when the Australian dollar was at US74c. At that time, on 30 January, Peter Costello, the current Treasurer, said: A falling Australian dollar reduces living standards ... With each fall of the Australian dollar, Australians have to work longer and harder to acquire any given amount of imports.",159,Representatives Main Committee

439,Mr Ripoll,"Mr Deputy Speaker, my remarks are perfectly relevant in terms of thisWednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26495 That was when the dollar was at US74c. I know that the Treasurer has certainly changed his tune now that we are facing a bleak outlook, just as the coal industry is, where the dollar is now at US47c. No-one really knows where this will stop. He went on to say, when the dollar was at US71c, on 30 June 1995: To the extent that this Government drives down the Australian currency, it impoverishes every Australian. I think this has a direct bearing on coal because coal is so important in terms of Australian exports and Australian industry. The flow-on effects really have to be addressed, having regard to where the Australian dollar is at. If it is going to impoverish Australians at US71c, what is it going to do at US47c? That is where we are today-at US47c. It is a real tragedy that this government refuses to accept responsibility for what it has done to the economy. I noticed yesterday in question time that there was this new rhetoric, the double-speak of government-a government that says black is white, that white is black, that says if you repeat a lie often enough, someone will believe it. They keep saying in this place that, somehow, the woes of the economy-and I am assuming that, in the economy, they are referring to the bleak future of the coal industry as well-are all related to the opposition talking the economy down. We are talking it down; therefore, the economy is heading downwards. What a load of rot! Could any self-respecting person come up with this theory that, somehow, because the opposition has stated the facts about what is actually occurring and has held the government to account on the state of the economy, we are responsible for it? Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and all the government members who are listening, that, firstly, we did not do this; the government did this. They did this through their mean, unfair, inequitable GST programtheir ideologically driven GST program, which has had such a huge impact on Australia that it has not only devastated many industries but has had a flow-on effect that at this stage has not been fully accounted for. We would have trouble, as the government does, accounting for where it is at in terms of the damage they have done to Australian exports, Australian jobs and a whole range of areas. The government talks tough in terms of coal and where it stands on Australian industry. It talks tough on Kyoto, on greenhouse and on a whole range of areas. But when it comes to the welfare of families in those industries, it just does not talk tough anymore. It falls very short. If we look at one of the government’s self-proclaimed claims to fame, as it were, this government says it stands for fiscal responsibility. This is a government that says it governs for all and that it governs in a fiscally responsible manner. Where is that fiscal responsibility today? The government is now falling over itself, bumbling and tripping over itself, in backflips and rollbacks, to try to appease the community that it has so much offended and hurt. We have seen rollbacks every day. We have seen rollbacks on beer. And why has there been a rollback on the excise on beer? Because the government misled the Australian people. At the time of the election, the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, promised that the ordinary beer price would not go up by more than 1.9 per cent. Of course, that was not true. It is as simple as that. It went up by much, much more. Now, because the lobbyists and the beer companies have been successful in redressing that issue, the Prime Minister says that this is somehow unfair. When you make a promise, somewhere along the line you either keep it or you do not keep it; but either way you will be held to account. That is what is happening now. All the pain that government members are experiencing is pain that they have created, and it is pain that they will feel quite directly not too long in the future. I want to talk briefly about coal as a product and what people think about when they switch on a light. When they turn on a light or switch on their computers, very few people, in the 26496 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 April 2001 back of their minds, think, ‘This is a coal driven light,’ or ‘This is a coal driven computer.’ Right now, I am able to speak through this microphone because it is driven by coal. People might think there is a magical formula that somehow makes this happen. Let me make it clear that coal drives this. As I said earlier, it is such an important part of Australia in so many different ways. To that end, we must be very careful about how we protect the Australian coal industry and how we treat the Australian coal industry. The Australian coal industry has gone a long way in the last 12 months to address some of its PR problems and some of the attitudes that people have towards coal. It is seen as a dirty, old fuel. I would say that that is not the case; it is not a dirty, old fuel. It is actually a very modern fuel that can be used in a very modern way. I know the Australian coal industry is working very hard in this regard. I meet with them regularly, through a subcommittee of the Australian Labor Party caucus on coal issues. I am very interested to see what sort of alternatives the coal industry is working on and what sort of alternatives are out there. Things like solar power, as I mentioned earlier, still have a long way to go before they become a viable and real option to replace coal. It is a long way down the track to the time when we will be discussing these matters in real terms-the delivery of what we all expect as normal, everyday services, such as providing energy to drive the fridge, the telly, radios and the lights in our homes. To some extent, this is at the heart of the problem of what we do about greenhouse gases, Kyoto and so many other things. Until we can either find a replacement or people in the Western industrialised world decide that they will not switch on the lights, that they will not run the computers, that they will look at other options, it will be a long time before coal is threatened as a major source of fuel. I turn to another issue that relates directly to coal-that is, the exchange rate, and the value of the Australian dollar. Much has been said about the Australian dollar. It must be getting very hard for the Treasurer and the Prime Minister to defend where the dollar is at and say, ‘It’s okay.’ Only last week, the Prime Minister was talking to a number of pensioners. He was saying, ‘Don’t worry about the Australian dollar.’ It is a bit like what a previous Prime Minister in the UK said during the seventies when the sterling fell through the floor, and the damage that that did to ordinary people. That is what it relates to: the damage that it does to ordinary people. I think the approach taken by this government has been very irresponsible. What really angers people out there, and what angers me, is not so much the GST; it is not so much where the dollar is; it is not so much all of the money that has been ripped out of health, education and all the nasty things that are going on; it is this constant Orwellian approach to making excuses about where we are at. Somehow, it is all the Labor Party’s fault. Everything is the Labor Party’s fault. We have endured this government for five years. We have long suffered this bumbling government which trips over itself, to the point now where it is a government that will do anything, at any cost, to win re-election. It has hit the panic button. The big, red button in John Howard’s office is about three-feet wide. He has tripped over his chair and he has hit the button, and the government is in panic mode. And they are in panic mode because they no longer know what they are doing. They no longer have leadership; they no longer actually know what they are about. A good example of this is something that happened last week, when the government pulled a bill. Surprisingly enough, it was the postal bill. Why would they do that all of a sudden? It is something that has been on the Notice Paper and it is something on which the government has stood firm-the deregulation of the postal industry and the privatisation of Telstra. And all of a sudden theyWednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26497 fore the chair-the Coal Industry Repeal Bill 2000 and related matters. coal industry, and in particular to those families who are affected by the coal industry. I pointed this out earlier because I wanted to make clear the number of families affected. And it is the policies of this government that affect those families. They are the ones who suffer. They suffer under this legislation; they suffer under all the policies of this government. I know I am ranging rather wide in terms of the topic, Mr Deputy Speaker, but I think it is very important to understand where this bill originates in the mind of the government. As I was saying about what occurred last week, why would it possibly do this? What is the relationship here? It is a government that has suddenly realised that it is no longer popular. Suddenly, the bill it had on the table last week is bad for the community. This realisation has not come about because of good will in order to do the right thing for all Australians; it has come about purely because it wants to win a few cheap votes. It is as simple as that. We have seen rollback and rollover on so many things that I could not possibly list them in the 20 minutes that have been allocated to me. The privatisation of Telstra, by way of example, certainly will not happen while we still have a voice in this place, and certainly while the National Party are still suffering so much in the bush. I am sure they had some hand in the reason why the postal bill was mysteriously pulled from the government’s vicious agenda against ordinary Australians. Let me sum up by saying that, in supporting the bill that is before us, I think it will be positive for the Australian coal industry, but the government needs to work much harder to try to help the coal industry to modernise. It needs to look at policies and methods that will give advantage to coal. Certainly, it needs to look very closely at the Kyoto protocol and at what the United States of America is doing. It needs to take real action to make coal a viable fuel for the future-not an old technology, but a new technology. With respect to research and development dollars, which this government has so gladly ripped out of so many areas, they should be returned to that industry. (Time expired) I want to highlight a number of policies of this government which represent attacks on Australian workers and Australian industry. One of the great loves of the Howard-Costello government is to attack unions. They will not be happy until the last unionist in Australia is no longer there. If ever there was an industry that epitomises the value of the trade union movement, it is the coal industry. As a young fellow growing up in the western suburbs of Newcastle, I can well remember the miners coming home after shift, their crib tins on their hips, and coal dust all over them because there were no such things as ablution blocks. Those were the sorts of conditions in which men were asked to work. I can well remember an old mate of my dad’s describing how you had to crawl in on your belly to drill into the coal by hand. You had to chip the coal out and drag it out behind you. I can remember him saying that, if you were a right-handed worker, you were always looking for a left-handed shoveller so that you could maximise your output; and how you never made an enemy of the tally clerk, because if you did not like the tally clerk or if you fancied the tally clerk’s daughter and he did not like you, he would downgrade the value of your coal and say that it was dirty coal, and you would have sent a skip of coal up for absolutely no return. I can remember an uncle of mine dying at the age of 52 with dusted lungs, lying in his bed coughing up blood, in enormous pain. The only thing that saved these people and got the coal industry to where it is today is the trade union movement. That is the movement on which this government has waged a relentless attack in the last five years. That is why this government will be marked down by all those people who remember those things, as I do.",160,Representatives Main Committee

442,Mr Horne (Paterson) (12.02 P.m.),"In this debate on the Coal Industry Repeal Bill 200026498 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 April 2001 The trade union movement has a proud place in the coal industry. I invite anyone in the government to visit Cessnock and have a look at the Wall of Remembrance for coalminers. You will find boys from the age of 12 and 13 who lost their lives in coalmine accidents. What happened? The mine stopped work for a day; the miner’s family got another weeks pay; the fellows had a few beers and went back to work; and the coal barons survived. I cannot understand why this government is so hell-bent on destroying unions. Unions in towns in the Hunter Valley have been very responsible indeed. They have helped create towns like Kurri Kurri, Cessnock, Singleton and Muswellbrook. They guaranteed that the quality of life improved and those towns became very viable and vibrant communities. I am proud to say I am a member of a union. I am proud to say that the history of unions in Australia is a very honourable one. This government should be ashamed of its continued pursuit to destroy unions. I would like to make another point about this government’s policies. Joint Coal Board statistics for coal production in New South Wales show that from 1998 to 1999 there was an increase in production from 132 million tonnes to 134 million tonnes. However, the level of employment in coal mines dropped from 10,898 to 9,748. At the same time that there was an increase in production of over two million tonnes there was a loss in employment of 1,100 workers. Again we hear this government attack the productivity of workers. That sounds like a pretty fair productivity return in 12 months-an extra two million tonnes with 1,100 fewer workers. What has the government got to complain about? The other thing I point out is the increasing foreign ownership of Australian coal. A natural and national resource that belongs to all Australians is being sold off. Over the past decade particularly we have seen increased foreign involvement. BHP wanted to get out of coal mines. They got out of coal mines. Who bought them? Mainly Rio Tinto. But I also notice that, through Tony Haraldson, there has been increased South African ownership of our coal mines. I would have thought that Australia was economically way ahead of South Africa. I would have thought that in comparison their economy is considerably smaller, yet they own many millions of dollars worth of coal mines in Australia. It was interesting to note that, about three or four weeks ago when there was a jump in the price of coal of about $26 a tonne that was negotiated by the Australian industry with the steel mills and electricity generators of Japan, every one of those South African coal mines went on the market the day after. The government’s short-sightedness allowed this to happen. People are playing monopoly with our national natural assets. That is the sort of thing people in this country are objecting to and asking to stop. At the same time as this government is hell-bent on reducing the work force and taking away the rights of Australians to an honest and decent job, this government is allowing foreign investors to reap the benefit of the increased value of Australian assets. These are some of the tragedies that I see in coal mining towns. I think in the last five years you would find that in the Hunter Valley there has been a loss of about 2,500 coal mining jobs. In towns where it was traditional for young boys to follow their dad into the mine, they cannot look forward to that any more. It does not happen. I suppose we will hear government members say, ‘Yeah, but what about the tremendous wages they get? What about the bonuses they get?’ Have a look at the accident rate of coalminers, have a look at the time lost through accidents, and you will soon realise that it is one of those jobs where your life is continually on the line. It is one of those jobs that has a very high record of injury. I do not intend to speak much longer. AllI ask is that this government accepts the coal industry for what it is and for what it has given to Australia and recognises that in legislation. I ask the government to recognise the fact that unions in the coal industry, probably above all, have delivered a sense of decency and a quality of life to people and have given their liveseither directly through mining accidents or indirectly through disease and silicosis that has been associated with their industry-and that it cease this ridiculous attack on unionism. UnWednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26499 ions are responsible organisations. Unions do promote responsible, positive discussion between employer and employee and unions most definitely have a place in our industrial world. The bigoted blindness of this government, and in particular the current minister, is doing nothing but create an enormous chasm between workers and employers. I look forward to the day when the current minister might stand up and say, ‘Yes, I agree that unions have a place,’ but unfortunately at the rate he is going I do not expect it will be soon. Coal Industry Repeal Bill 2000 but, as there are no more coalition speakers, I would like to take a few minutes to refute a few accusations that have been made. I compliment the member for Charlton, Mrs Hoare, on her address. I think it came from the heart, and her speech was one with a lot of very good research-stuff that I did not know. I did not agree with all the content but I did agree with her general thrust. Nevertheless, the next two speakers, the members for Oxley and Hunter, really surprised me in the line they took. The member for Oxley represents all those coal mines around Ipswich. Quite frankly, if I had been a constituent I would have been quite insulted by his presentation, because he did not come to the core of any of the problems. All he did was talk about beer prices. He played the populism card. As I remember, with regard to the withdrawal of the postal bill, the coalition decided to pull that before Christmas. This was just the technicality of removing it from the paper but that was turned into a major drama. Then we had a dissertation that electricity would still be around and therefore we would need coal. I do not think any of us dispute that. We would like to see a vibrant Australian coal industry. I had a lot of coal mines in my old electorate of Hinkler in the area around Biloela and Moura. I had some very interesting times with the coal industry there. A very efficient coal industry it was too and, as I remember, it had very good relations with its employees. This idea that the coalition wants to downgrade the unionist or the worker is absolute nonsense. I am very much pro unionism. I think people should be able to be members of unions, but it should not be compulsory. was proud to be a member of that and to participate in it. But I think it is important to note that compulsory unionism has been used as a tool to control unionists. I saw this start to die in the resource area that we are talking about, in Gladstone, at about the time that I became the federal member for that area. Some unions would not come up to scratch with respect to new ideas. I have seen unions doing marvellous things, whether it is in the coal industry or the resource industry generally, to enhance benefits for their workers. For example, there are some very progressive ones around Gladstone in my electorate in which the employees have subsidised medical benefit schemes and the like. That is very good for them. It gives them a choice when they want to go to hospital and it relieves the strain on the public hospital system. On top of that, it provides them with a better standard of health care. I think those things are marvellous. Unions should be enhancing benefits for their members. They should not just stand there all the time as the playthings of the union bosses. With respect to the presentation by the member for Hunter, it was all about the loss of power by some unions. A lot of unions are very focused on looking after their members; others just see unionists as a plaything. Let me return to coal and resources in general. In my electorate there was a resource based industry whose employees were offered a workplace agreement as opposed to staying under the award. There was quite a spirited debate in the community, particularly by the workers in that particular plant. The union picketed the gates to intimidate the guys going to work. When the vote was taken, about 83 per cent were in favour of the workplace agreement.",163,Representatives Main Committee

I would have thought that coalminers and people in the resource industry have done very well out of this government, because they generally earn well above award wages. It is not uncommon for them to be in the $60,000, $70,000 or $80,000 brackets. In fact, in Central Queensland coal mines, the wages are much higher. Under this government, they have got low interest rates. They are paying $3,000 a year less for their home loans than they were under the Keating government. In addition, most of them in that wage bracket are paying $63 a week less income tax. They are paying very little for their medical benefits, especially in the plant I just talked about, because they would be getting the 30 per cent rebate as well, on top of the subsidy they are getting from the employer. So they would be paying a minimal amount, by Australian standards, for health insurance. They have got low home loan interest rates and low inflation-all the factors that make for a much more vibrant economy for people in that wage bracket. I would be surprised if coalminers were particularly upset about the policies of this government. The member for Hunter even spoke against his colleague the member for Charlton. I heard her say very clearly that she would not want her 11-year-old son to be working down a coalmine. I think that is a fair thing for her to say. As a mother, she wants the best for her son. Yet the member for Hunter tried to say that it was desirable for sons to follow their fathers into coal mines. I think it should be neither desirable nor undesirable, but an option that they can exercise. I felt that to some extent he spoke against his colleague. This whole business of the debate on coal getting down to unionism diminishes the debate. On the Australian dollar, I do not know where the member for Oxley was coming from. I would have thought it was in the interests of the Australian coal industry, as of a lot of other export industries, for the Australian dollar at this time to be low. I read a very interesting article last week on the number of industries-wool, beef, sugar, a whole range of Australian primary and resource industries-that are now coming out of difficulties because of the low dollar. Certainly there is a problem with the importation of crude oil, certainly some luxury imports might be a little dearer, but I would have thought that for Australian resource and primary industries broadly this was a good opportunity to even up the agenda. I just add that small contribution because I think two of the last three speakers were quite skew-whiff and opportunistic in their comments. and Resources) (12.21 p.m.)-in reply-I thank all of those members who contributed to this debate on the Coal Industry Repeal Bill 2000. Clearly, most members have approached the legislation in the spirit of cooperation, with a recognition of the positive direction this legislation takes. I certainly thank the honourable member for Bonython for his positive comments about the present and future role of the industry, and I agree with his supportive comments about the role of the Joint Coal Board. It is important, though, that I confirm that the Commonwealth act will not commence operation until New South Wales has its legislation in place. All members need to be aware of that. The points made about the importance of safety and the need for R&D into energy efficiency, recognising the future role of coal, were a very valuable contribution and support both the work that is being done in ANZMEC and also the recent announcement by this government to fund the formation of a CRC for coal in sustainable development.",165,Representatives Main Committee
446,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, ScienceWednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26501 The contribution by the honourable member for Wentworth concerning the various theories about earth’s adaptability to changing CO2 concentrations is a timely message to governments as we work our way ahead in addressing our many greenhouse issues. The points made by the member for McMillan regarding development in the Gippsland region are interesting but not directly relevant to the legislation. But he, like other members, emphasised the importance of safety, certainly an area where there was very strong general agreement. The member for Charlton has, appropriately, placed on record the history of the industry in New South Wales and future directions for the industry. I can assure the member that there is every wish to see New South Wales sort out the final sticking points at their end. I emphasise that the commencement is very much contingent on New South Wales finalising their legislation. So there needs to be no concern in that area. The contribution by the member for Oxley was somewhat interesting, particularly in arguing that the employees were not solely to blame with regard to productivity initiatives. There is some validity to that, but industry has very much had to improve. But they are also part of the equation that needs to be addressed. Industry has had to improve its performance in response to low prices and substantial international competition. The government has done its job by putting in place the necessary framework for industry to get on with the job of exporting in a very competitive environment. I was surprised, given that he was speaking on this bill, that the honourable member was not aware that in most cases coal contracts are, in fact, written in US dollars. Provided that they are hedged properly, they would certainly be doing very well, having regard to the low value of the Australian dollar. The member for Throsby again emphasised safety. ANZMEC has a process under way to ensure that governments, both state and federal, develop occupational health and safety standards for the mining industry. Zero tolerance of accidents and the adaptation of world’s best practice are key objectives of the mining industry. In terms of industrial issues, I note that the government’s industrial relations legislation has delivered substantial improvements for the industry, making it very competitive internationally. It is now up to all parties to work within that legislation. The member for Paterson in his contribution drew attention to the productivity gains that have been achieved recently. This has certainly been achieved through the mechanisms that the government has put in place. Industries need to be competitive in the international market, and we certainly do not make any apology for that. I also point out to the honourable member that, while we all very strongly support local investment in this country, foreign investment is also a very vital and important part of the growth of our economy. I do not think we should be suggesting that this should be discarded. I think we should be continuing to welcome foreign investment in this country. I also noted with interest the honourable member’s remarks on unions. There seems to be a perception from those on the other side that we on this side have no understanding of unions. I do not know whether any of us are actually members of unions, because we feel that we need to be impartial when we are in this place and not be controlled by the union masters. I noted that the member for Hinkler commented on unions as well. I was actually a convenor for the metalworkers and shipwrights union-a somewhat militant union that I am sure members on the other side would be aware of. I am very proud of my association with that union and very strongly supportive of the union movement. But the member for Hinkler rightfully expressed concern-and I think it was a very valid concern-while also acknowledging the value of the unions, that union masters or leaders try to maintain their relevance, and I guess their pay packages, by undertaking actions which, in many cases, show that they have no interest in serving the needs of their members. While they continue to insist that most members on the other side should be members of relevant unions while they are in this place, one cannot help being cynical and believing that members opposite are somehow controlled by those masters. 26502 MAIN COMMITTEE Wednesday, 4 April 2001 The Coal Industry Repeal Bill 2000 certainly represents a very important step towards the removal of unnecessary regulatory intervention in the Australian coal industry. The bill supports the Commonwealth’s withdrawal from the Joint Coal Board and facilitates the smooth transition of its remaining functions to government and industry within New South Wales. Since the JCB was established in 1946, the Australian coal industry has evolved from a highly regulated industry supplying domestic markets to become the world’s number one exporter of top quality coal. In the process, coal has become Australia’s single largest export commodity, accounting for around 10 per cent of the merchandise trade. Most importantly, the industry continues to grow very strongly. Australian coal exports are expected to expand by around $2 billion-$2,000 million-in this financial year, to exceed $10 billion for the very first time. It is a very significant contribution to the Australian economy. Further strong growth is expected next year on the back of price increases and expanding output. Coal is also Australia’s primary source of electricity and, as such, is very important to Australian households and industry. All of our electricity, with the exception of about 15 per cent, comes from coal. I am sure members will appreciate that many of our major industries, such as steel, aluminium, chemicals, plastic and cement, rely very heavily on economical, coal fired electricity in order to be internationally competitive. Members will also recognise, I am sure, the important contribution that the industry makes to regional Australia. The industry operates in a dynamic and highly competitive international environment. This government’s policy is aimed at providing a secure operating environment and implementing reforms that remove regulatory and other impediments to industry operations. The contribution of the industry to Australia relies on its capacity to respond effectively to the many challenges it faces. For instance, depressed coal prices over the last few years threatened the viability of large sections of the industry. The extra flexibility afforded by the government’s workplace relations reform allowed the industry to find ways to improve productivity and to operate competitively at these lower prices. The Commonwealth’s withdrawal from the JCB continues these reforms. It will put the New South Wales coal industry on an equal footing with those in all other states who have adequately managed their own coal industries without this level of Commonwealth involvement or oversight. For the first time since 1946, New South Wales will be given the flexibility to fully manage its own coal industry responsibilities without additional Commonwealth involvement. On Commonwealth withdrawal, all the existing functions of the JCB are to be fully transferred to New South Wales. These functions are in the areas of workers compensation, occupational health and rehabilitation, training and information. This government has worked in cooperation with the New South Wales government and industry in developing arrangements for the Commonwealth’s withdrawal from the JCB, and an important aspect of these arrangements has been to ensure that the resources of the JCB that they used to manage its existing functions are fully transferred to New South Wales. This includes existing staff of the JCB. The Coal Industry Repeal Bill 2000 provides for the transfer of all the assets and liabilities of the JCB to the New South Wales government, to use as it determines to manage the functions carried out by the JCB. The net assets of the JCB are $23.5 million as of 30 June 2000. The New South Wales government and industry are in the best position to determine what is best for their industry. As such, this government has not sought to intervene or influence the arrangements being established by the New South Wales government and industry to take on these functions. These arrangements are to be embedded in corresponding New South Wales legislation, the New South Wales Coal Industry Bill 2001, which supports the winding-up of the JCB and the establishment of a new entity to take on the essential functions of the JCB. I note the intention is that the new entity will be owned and managed cooperatively by industry Wednesday, 4 April 2001 MAIN COMMITTEE 26503 participants. The government wishes New South Wales every success in implementing the new arrangements for managing these functions. I would like to conclude this address by noting the very important contribution of the JCB over the past 55 years in the development of the New South Wales coal industry. As I have noted in my second reading speech, the JCB has made major contributions to the areas of early industry mechanisation, setting occupational health standards and improving the health of coalmine workers and community services. This government is certainly fully appreciative of the role played by the JCB and thanks all its former and current staff and board members for their very valuable contributions. Question resolved in the affirmative. Bill read a second time. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Main Committee adjourned at 12.35 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Australian Government Solicitor: Clients (Question No. 1849) (1) Is the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) representing a Mrs Haywood and a Mrs Nardi in relation to letters addressed to them dated 27 April 2000 from Ms Christine Trevett, a former staff member of Mr Cameron Thompson MP. (2) Is it the case that both Mrs Haywood and Mrs Nardi are not employed by Mr Thompson in his capacity as a Member of Parliament. (3) Are there any restrictions on the classes of clients which the AGS may represent; if so, what are those restrictions. (4) On what basis is the AGS representing Mrs Haywood and Mrs Nardi. (5) Who is paying the costs of the AGS in respect of Mrs Haywood and Mrs Nardi. (6) What is the sum of those legal costs to August 2000. (1) Yes, save that the letters dated 27 April 2000 were from Ms Trevett’s solicitors, not Ms Trevett personally. (2) I am advised that neither Mrs Haywood nor Mrs Nardi is employed by Mr Thompson in his capacity as a Member of Parliament. (3) The AGS may provide services to the persons and bodies set out in, and subject to the conditions in, s55N of the Judiciary Act 1903. (4) Section 55N(4) of the Judiciary Act empowers the AGS to provide services to a person if the CEO of the AGS so determines and to do so would be within the functions of the AGS. The functions of the AGS are provided for in s55K of the Judiciary Act. They include provision of legal services and related services to the Commonwealth and anything incidental to any of its functions. In this case, Mrs Haywood and Mrs Nardi were to be central witnesses on behalf of the Commonwealth in unfair dismissal proceedings brought against the Commonwealth by Ms Trevett but then discontinued by her. The subsequent letters from Ms Trevett’s solicitors threatened court action against Mrs Haywood and Mrs Nardi in relation to statements they made which contributed to Ms Trevett’s dismissal. In these circumstances it was considered to be in the Commonwealth’s interests for AGS to act for Mrs Haywood and Mrs Nardi in relation to the court proceedings threatened against them. Considerations supporting this view included the Commonwealth’s interest in what was an indirect challenge by Ms Trevett to the correctness of her dismissal. Accordingly, the CEO of the AGS has made a determination under s55N(4) of the Judiciary Act enabling the AGS to act for Mrs Haywood and Mrs Nardi in relation to the letters from the solicitors for Ms Trevett and any consequential litigation instituted by her. (5) The Commonwealth, through the Department of Finance and Administration, is paying the costs of the AGS in respect of Mrs Haywood and Mrs Nardi. (6) The AGS’s costs in relation to this matter as at 31 August 2000 were approximately $4,035. Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (Question No. 2013) Mr Crean asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 4 October 2000: (1) In respect of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, what was the 2000-01 Budget revenue estimate for the 2000-01 financial year? (2) On what price per barrel of oil was this estimate based?",166,Representatives Main Committee

(2) The Government does not publish this figure. Fuel Prices (Question No. 2119) Mr Rudd asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 2 November 2000: (1) What was the retail price of diesel on (a) 30 June 2000 and (b) 30 September 2000. (2) What proportion of the 30 September 2000 price was represented either by the GST or GST related factors. (3) What was the industry-specific rationale for providing both farmers and the heavy transport industry with access to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. (4) What was the cost to budget of the application of that Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme to those two industry sectors. (5) Is he aware of the impact of the increase in diesel prices on the civil engineering contracting business. (6) Will he consider including the civil engineering contracting business within the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme; if not, how does this industry sector differ from the two industry sectors to which he has extended the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme. (7) What was the impact of diesel price increases between 30 June and 30 September 2000 on the construction price of underground power, footpaths, country roads and residential real estate developments for consumers. (1) The ACCC’s ‘Report on the movement in fuel prices in the September quarter 2000’, released on 20 October 2000, provides detailed pricing information on diesel. (2) GST is calculated as 1/11th of the retail price. (3) The Government proposed in Tax Reform: Not a New Tax, A New Tax System, a full credit of excise on diesel and like fuels used off-road by registered businesses. The opposition of the Australian Labor Party to the Government's tax reform legislation required the Government to seek the agreement of the Australian Democrats to secure parliamentary approval for tax reform. As part of the agreement a full rebate is only available to eligible activities under the diesel fuel rebate scheme including an extension to rail and marine transport. (4) The Government does not separately identify the costs of the diesel fuel rebate scheme by industry. (5) Yes. (6) See answer (3). (7) See answer (1). Competition Principles Agreement (Question No. 2157) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 27 November 2000: (1) What were the changes made to the Competition Principles Agreement (CPA) at the recent Council of Australian Governments (CoAG) meeting on 3 November 2000. (2) Will the changes need to be assessed by the Federal Parliament. (3) How will the changes address the concerns about National Competition Policy (NCP) expressed in the (a) Productivity Commission’s report into the Impact of Competition Policy Reforms on Rural and Regional Australia and (b) the Senate Select Committee into the Socio Economic Impacts of National Competition Policy.

450,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:decision making process surrounding the application of competitive neutrality, (d) the decision making process for assessing jurisdictions implementation process and payment of the NCP tranche payments and (e) improving the role of elected Governments in the process. (5) Has the five year review been completed, if not when will it be completed. (6) Since March 1996, (a) how often has CoAG met, (b) how often has it considered NCP and (c) what decisions were made. (1) The3 November 2000 CoAG decisions concerning NCP, including changes to the Competition Principles Agreement, were announced in the CoAG Communiqué and have been made publicly available from the National Competition Council website (www.ncc.gov.au). (2) No. (3) CoAG indicated that these amendments will serve to address a number of community concerns regarding the application of NCP which were identified in the recent Productivity Commission and Senate Select Committee inquiries into competition policy. The Prime Minister has written to Premiers and Chief Ministers noting the Commonwealth’s 10 August 2000 responses to these reports and the recent CoAG amendments to NCP, and seeking their consideration of the issues raised in the reports (particularly those recommendations relevant for State and Territory Governments). See also the answers to question (4) below. (4) CoAG noted that the adoption of these changes will establish a practical framework for the ongoing, effective implementation of NCP, while demonstrating its ongoing commitment to this policy and safeguarding the flow of benefits it is delivering to Australians as a whole. (4)(a) and (b) As noted above, CoAG indicated that the amendments will serve to address a number of community concerns about NCP. CoAG has also agreed to take an enhanced role in guiding the NCC in relation to its role in explaining and promoting NCP policy to the community. Further, it was agreed that Governments, in meeting the requirements of sub-clause 1(3)(a)(b) and (c) of the CPA, will document the public interest reasons supporting a decision or assessment and make them available to interested parties and the public, and give consideration to explicitly identifying the likely impact of reform measures on specific industry sectors and communities, including expected costs in adjusting to change. CoAG has also agreed that, in assessing whether the threshold requirement of Clause5 (legislation review) of the CPA has been achieved, the NCC should consider whether the conclusion reached in the report is within a range of outcomes that could reasonably be reached based on the information available to a properly constituted review process. However, within the range of outcomes that could be reasonably be reached, CoAG considered it is a matter for Government to determine which policy is in the public interest. (4)(c) As noted in the answers to (4)(a) and (4)(b), the CoAG amendments are intended to enhance the transparency of decisions relating to NCP matters. This includes decisions made in relation to the implementation of competitive neutrality (sub-clause 3(6) of the CPA). (4)(d) Amendments to future assessment processes cover both procedural matters and the interpretation of specific reform commitments (legislation review and competitive neutrality). It was decided that the NCC would undertake an annual assessment of all jurisdictions beyond the initial third tranche assessment in June 2001, and make recommendations on the level of competition payments to be made to each State and Territory. The amendments are set out in the source material mentioned in the response to Question (1). (4)(e) CoAG has agreed that the NCC will determine its forward work program in consultation with CoAG Senior Officials, and has noted that the NCC will provide a six monthly report to Senior Officials detailing its draft forward work program, including its communications and future assessment activities. Senior Officials are to continue to provide guidance to the NCC to clarify CoAG’s requirements in relation to the interpretation of NCP reform commitments, including appropriate assessment benchmarks, as required. A further review of the NCP agreements, and the NCC’s assessment role, is to be conducted before September 2005. (5) Yes.",171,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice

Companies: Shareholder Meetings (Question No. 2250) Mr Murphy asked the Treasurer, upon notice, on 7 December 2000: (1) Has his attention been drawn to instances at a number of annual general meetings recently where Westfield, Boral and Davnet circumvented a long standing tradition of a call for a show of hands to register shareholder approval for resolutions or directors put to the vote of publicly listed companies. (2) What plans has the Government in train to enforce basic meeting procedures at shareholders meetings of listed companies. (3) Is it a fact that over 30% of superannuation funds do not cast their votes at the annual general meeting of listed companies in which they invest. (4) Does he have any plans to increase the voting rate of these superannuation funds. (1) The internal voting procedures of a company are a matter for the shareholders and directors of that company. If any of the shareholders of Westfield, Boral or Davnet consider there has been a procedural irregularity in the company’s voting procedures that has resulted in a substantial injustice they may apply for a court order to rectify that injustice – this is a matter on which they would need to seek private legal advice. (2) I am advised that: procedural requirements for the meetings of any particular listed company are set out in the Corporations Law, the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) Listing Rules and sometimes in the company’s constitution. Enforcement of requirements is generally a matter for the company and its shareholders, and in certain circumstances the ASX and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC); the Corporations Law automatically validates certain procedural irregularities concerning meetings, unless the irregularity may cause an injustice that cannot be remedied by a court order (the onus of showing substantial injustice rests on those opposing automatic validation) – this would be an issue requiring private legal advice; as an additional matter it should be noted that the government recently released a response to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securites on matters arising from the Company Law Review Act 1998 which dealt with a number of aspects of the conduct of company meetings, including arrangements for proxy votes. Additionally the government proposed a new “square root” test for determining the number of members that may require the directors of a company to call a general meeting. (3) I am not aware of any published information specifically regarding superannuation funds' voting records at annual general meetings of listed companies in which they invest. However, I am advised that a research report entitled Proxy Voting in Australia’s Largest Companies by the Centre for Corporate Law and Securities Regulation (the University of Melbourne) and Corporate Governance International, indicates that in companies with a widely held shareholder base – that is, without a major non-institutional shareholder – proxy instructions for director-election resolutions represented on average 35% of total voting capital in 1999. The 1998 figure was 32%; (4) The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation is on record calling on funds managers and trustees to take a more activist role in policing corporate accountability. While the Government strongly encourages institutional investors (including superannuation funds) to be actively involved in the corporations they have invested in, it is not something the Government should additionally need to legislate for. Trustees of superannuation or investment funds owe a general fiduciary duty, and duties arising from industry specific legislation, to act in the interests of their investors, and should in all cases consider whether to exercise their votes on behalf of their members where that is in the best interests of the company.",172,Representatives Main Committee Questions On Notice
452,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Commonwealth Defamation Legislation: National Uniformity (Question No. 2297) (1) What steps has he taken since the meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in Perth 1998 to achieve national uniform defamation legislation. (2) In the absence of agreements by the State and Territory governments to pursue national uniform defamation legislation, has he received any legal advice relating to the extent to which the Commonwealth could unilaterally enact Commonwealth defamation legislation relying on the heads of power available to it in the Constitution. (3) What barriers exist to the enactment of Commonwealth defamation legislation. (1) Given the continued inability of the States and Territories to reach agreement on uniform defamation laws, the Government is not pursuing the issue at this time. I note, however, that on 9 December 1999 the ACT Attorney-General introduced a Bill into the ACT Legislative Assembly to reform ACT defamation law. In addition the NSW Government held a forum on defamation law in May 2000, and continues to explore this issue. (2) In 1997, my Department received advice from the Chief General Counsel on the ability of the Commonwealth to enact national defamation legislation. (3) Based on advice received, I understand that the Commonwealth has some limited constitutional power to enact defamation legislation. I have been informed, however, that such legislation could not provide a comprehensive and uniform approach to defamation law. The Government has supported consistency of defamation laws throughout Australia, and this requires State and Territory involvement. While the issue of uniform defamation law has periodically been under consideration by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, unfortunately, the States and Territories have been unable to agree on substantive reform. Holsworthy Correctional Centre: Additional Investigations (Question No. 2326) Mr Price asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 6 February 2000: (1) Further to the answer to question No. 557 (Hansard, 12 May 1999, page 5321) was the military police investigation into the majority of the allegations completed as stated by the end of May 1999, if not, why not. (2) Did the former Minister or his staff direct that the investigation should be wrapped up; if not, who ordered the investigation to be wrapped up, when all allegations had not been investigated.

The Military Police investigation that concluded on 29 April 1999 identified a complex series of allegations involving a large number of witnesses. Over 200 witness statements were taken.
