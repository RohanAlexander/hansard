External Affairs) (2.4-3) I beg to lay on the tableCopy of the articles of an agreement made between the Postmaster-General, on behalf of the Government, and Sir James Laing and Sons Limited, of Sunderland, England, shipbuilders, the contractors under the agreement. For the convenience of honourable members. I shall briefly summarize the salient features of this new and very important contract. in order for the honourable and learned gentleman to make any comment in laying the paper on the table, it would be well for. him to move that the document be printed, if he desires to give any explanation to the House. course. The new contract is for a service between Adelaide and Brindisi, and vice versa, once a fortnight, to alternate with a similar service to be provided by the Imperial Government. It is for a period of ten years, and is to replace the existing service by the Orient Royal Mail Company when it expires in February, 1908. The period of transit is to be 636 hours in both directions, as compared with 696 hours provided for in the existing service under the contract with the Government of the. Commonwealth, and 662 hours as provided in the contract between the Imperial Government and the Peninsular and ! Oriental Company. The price as agreed upon for the new service is ,£125,000 per annum for the transit period above mentioned, but provision has been made for an acceleration of twenty four hours between Brindisi and Adelaide for a reimbursement of actual expenses incurred, to be determined by mutual agreement or arbitration, but not to exceed ,£25,000 per annum. This price must be compared with that now paid to the Orient Royal Mail Company, namely, £ji 20,600 per annum for a service of 696 hours, which is equal to about 3s. 8d. per mile, as compared with 3s. iod. per mile to be paid for an acceleration of sixty hours. Peninsular and Oriental Company cannot be stated, as iit is included in the sum of ,£340,000 per annumwhich includes the India and China services also. Provision is also made in the contract for the new service for a still further acceleration, if any other mail service to Australia is running to a faster time-table than that under which the mails are carried by the contractors, upon conditions fully set forth in the cont-fact. The steamers under the 636 hours' timetable would leave Brindisi, calling en route at Port Said, Colombo, and Fremantle, and would arrive at Adelaide in time for Saturday's express, thus enabling a simultaneous delivery of the mails to be made in both Sydney and Melbourne early on Monday, and permitting of replies from the former place being sent by the outward mail of the same week, an advantage not enjoyed under the existing arrangements. Under the 612 hours' time-table, the steamers would arrive at Adelaide in time for the express on Friday, and the ma""ils could be delivered in Melbourne on Saturday, in Sydney and Brisbane on Monday, with an accelerated train service; and replies could be sent from Brisbane by the outward mail of the same week. A longer interval would be afforded for replies if an equally favorable alternative service is provided by the Imperial Government. On the outward journey, the steamers will leave Adelaide on Friday, instead of on Thursday, as at present, thus affording a longer interval for replies. In connection with this improved ocean mail service, an improved railway service is contemplated, avoiding delays which now occur, and insuring greater expedition in both directions. way service is contemplated""; it has not yet been arranged for? because three States have to be consulted. Brindisi has been determined upon as the European port for the mails, in order that advantage mav be taken of the special trains provided in connection with the Indian mail service. Provision has been made in the contract for the acquisition of the steamers to be employed under it by purchase, or alternatively for their charter if desired. The port of registrv will, be within the Commonwealth, and the steamers will fly the Commonwealth flag. Australians will feel that they have a national interest",14,Warrnamboo I Fiel D Artillery

Government has also received the most satisfactory assurances as to the firm of Sir James Laing and Sons, with whom they have made this agreement'. As bearing upon the conditions of the contract, it is desirMr Deakin. able to state that now that the Commonwealth has been admitted to the U n i versal Postal Union as one Administration, the distinctions hitherto recognised as between the States comprised will cease, and the payments hither£25,000 to made by one State to another for the carriage of its British and foreign mails will be discontinued, as will also the payments that have been made by the United Peninsular and Oriental ComKingdom and foreign countries for the or other steamers under contransit of mails despatched by them after being landed at Adelaide. It will be seen that the stipulations as' to penalties for late arrival are more stringent than those under It has, of the present contract, and altogether the contract, which is for a mail service only, compares most favourably with that now currentI may add that, although the contract is for a mail service only, we are informed Five tenders were received, that the cool storage accommodation proconsidered, the accepted vided on the steamers will be about three All the usual times as great as that afforded by the mail steamers at present under contract. nage of the proposed new steamers? bound in any way to provide cool storage? bound.

Sir' WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Min ister of Trade and Customs) [3-3] It is true that I have given notice of I should think amendments in this part of the Bill, but they chiefly deal with a proposal in substitution for the Board provided for in the Bill as it stands. As I have previously stated, it was originally intended, if we could have managed it, to have had matters dealt with under this part of the Bill decided by a Judge, rather than by a Board. Lately it has been found possible to secure the acquiescence of the High Court in the request that they should consider these matters, and amendments have been circulated substituting a Justice of the High Court for the Board.

These clauses will have to be analyzed with the greatest detail unless we have more information. I echo what the honourable and learned member for .Corinella has said, that we should have the fullest possible information before we are called upon to pass these clauses. They rest upon the foundation that dumping of a mischievous character is taking place, and that it is injurious to Australian industries. There is absolutely no need for this B ill , unless such dumping does take place. Therefore, if the Minister furnishes us with no information in proof of his statements, we should refuse to proceed with the measure. Personally, I believe that he has no information of the kind. I am of opinion that there is no dumping of such a character as to injure the industries of this country. honourable member some soap. soft-soaped a number of people in this country, but there is one man whom he cannot soft-soap, and that is myself. The honourable gentleman is trying to force this Bill through by bluff. Why does he not bring forward the evidence collected by the Tariff Commission to show that dumping is proceeding to the injury oif Australian industries ? He would not consent that this information obtained at such -cost, and given on oath, should be at our disposal before proceeding with the Bill, because, in my opinion, he was satisfied that if the Tariff Commission's evidence were before us it would be proved conclusively that there was no need for the Bill. member must not discuss the B ill, but the clause before the Committee. not give a single instance of dumping that has injured any industry in Australia. It is true that he has referred to wire nails and a few other commodities, but there was no proof in what he said that injurious clumping takes place. Because goods are sold here for less than the price at which they are sold in America, it does not prove that they are dumped into Australia. It simnlv proves the absurdity of a fiscal nolicv which consists in keeping up prices of goods in a protected country, and enabling the same goods to be sold cheaply abroad. member is proving too much. dumping whatever, there ought to be plenty of proof of it . Strong free-trader as I am, if it were shown to me that manufacturers abroad were trying to kill our industries with the ulterior purpose of raising prices, I should at once be inclined to stop that kind of thing. If the Minister will take the Committee into his confidence, and will give the information that he has indicated that he possesses, I shall gladly listen to him. But, honestly, my opinion is that he has no such information ; and, therefore, I urge that there is no necessity to pass clauses which will have such an injurious effect upon the trade) and commerce of these States. Honourable members opposite have taken exception, some for one reason, and some for another, to the introduction of these provisions; but it appears to me that the objection to pass the clause, unless the Minister makes a certain statement, whiclfi t is alleged that he promised to make later on, is an argument not deserving ot very much attention. thing ? it is quite immaterial whether the Minister has at his disposal certain instances which would seem to show that it might be desirable that this measure should become operative in the future.

If he knows of any where it . is expedient to take that course immediately case. a moment that I should not vote for this proposal in any case, with this one safeguard-that it must not be put into force unless it be to the interests of the producers, workers, and consumers. Take, for instance, kerosene oil. On the face of it, how can it be to the interests of the consumer to impose such restrictions as will increase the price of kerosene oil by, say, 200 or 300 per cent. and learned member see how absurd fhe Bill is? the Minister thinks. AllI say is that, under the provision, he will not be the one to decide the point. If a man went into the Arbitration Court with a case, such as the honourable member for Robertson has given, He would not succeed. Milk Carters' case, where the men asked for one delivery of milk on Sunday. Amongst other things, it was stated by the employers that this would necessitate the payment of higher wages, and some said, ""We cannot afford to pay an-increase."" The proof of that would settle the case. of evidence would be effective here. Therefore, if the price of a commodity is going to be enormously increased in that way, I apprehend that, under this section, a decision in favour of a particular manufacture could not be obtained. If such a decision were obtained, and the price of the commodity were effectively increased, then cerwant to introduce now in detail any of the tainlv that could not be consistent with showing a due regard to the interests of the producers, workers, and consumers. With my eyes open, I could not vote for anything that would have such a result. who has been busily engaged for some time in investigating cases of alleged dumping, I also would be glad if the Minister would give some specific instances. He may be in possession of information which has not been laid before the Tariff Commission, and, if so, it ought to be placed before the Committee. Seeing that dumping is alleged to be carried on in Australia to a considerable extent, this question ought, I think, to be threshed out, in view of all possible evidence, for the simple reason that it seems to be very largely a stock argument used by those who desire increased duties. If one is to believe all that has been stated before the Tariff Commission, one is driven to the conclusion that there is hardly such a thing as legitimate trade carried on in the matter of imports. Dumping has been alleged in innumerable cases from rock salt to cotton wadding. Whenever a man wants an increased duty, and seems to be hard pressed for a reason, then dumping is alleged. I can say without hesitation that, when followed up, a great many cases of alleged dumping seem for the most part to have dissipated into thin air. I admit readily that in a country like Great Britain dumping undoubtedly is carried on. That is to say, a country with a large population and free ports offers facilities for those who wish to get rid of surplus stock in other countries and still get the best possible rates. And because this dumping has existed in Great Britain, as has been frequently admitted even by Take the free-traders, it has been found a very useful argument, indeed, I should say almost a scarecrow, to be used in Australia. It has been so introduced and established by the great protectionist organ of Victoria, which, day in and day out, has brought before the eyes of its readers the danger and the detriment of dumping, until I apprehend that the same sort the idea has positively obsessed all protectionist politicians. AlthoughI admit readily that dumping has been carried on in the case of Great Britain, and for certain reasons, there are, so far as Australia is concerned, reasons which will tend for manrv a day to come to make dumping a very rare occurrence indeed. I do not evidence which has been submitted to the Tariff Commission.

153,Mr Fowler (Perth) [3.53],"As oneAustralian Industries ried on here under present conditions. Dumping is of two kinds. Goods' may be introduced into a country with the object of killing a local industry, or they may simplv be introduced to bring what they will fetch, without reference to whether there are competing industries in the country or not. With regard to the first class of clumping, the conditions under which, it could be carried out are very rare. No one would allege for a moment that any business man in a country outside Australia interested in an industry which is pretty generally conducted throughout the world would send his goods here and sacrifice them, in order to k ill an Australian industry, for the simple reason that he would be doing something which could hardly bring him any advantage. If he killed the local industry he would simply do so, not for his own benefit, but for the benefit of other competitors by whom he was surrounded. I take it that no business man is such an arrant fool as to spend money in killing an industry in Australia when he has stronger and more powerful competitors around him, who would immediate! v step in and get the advantage of his sacrifice. The suggestion is absolutely ridiculous when it is examined from a business point of view. Again, take the dumping of goods into Australia in order that they may bring whatever they will fetch. In Australia the conditions are such as to make that a most improbable act. In the first nlace, if a merchant in a part of the world which produces a superfluity of goods of a certain kind wants to dump, he will look for the biggest market he can possibly find, for the simple reason that if he were to select a limited market and send his goods there, the mere fact that they were thrown at the consumers would tend to bring down their value very considerably. protected market. presents those necessary conditions to the man who wants to dump goods. The Australian market is too limited to induce a man on the other side of the world to send his goods here, and run the risk of getting for them prices much lower than he could obtain in a larger market. Great Britain is the dumping ground for the surplus products of the protected countries of the worldj because her market is open, and is situated nearer to the manufacturers, while [10 JULY, .1906.] Preservation Bill. ""53 it is also the biggest available. If a manufacturer has a large quantity of goods of which he wishes to dispose, he sends them into that market, because he knows that there the risk of a flooding taking place which would seriously lower their values, is the least possible. But manufacturers know that goods sent to this market are likely to be affected in price by the mere fact that they are being dumped. I desire more information on the whole subject than is yet in our possession, before proceeding with these clauses. I do not wish to vote for a mere electioneering kite, which the Bil l seems to be. It is just possible that those responsible for it have introduced these clauses before the presentation of the reports of the Tariff Commission, fearing that, if they waited, those reports would show no justification for their action. [4.4] -The honourable member for West Sydney has delivered a most interesting,, though, on the whole, a very peculiar speech. He began by abusing those on this side of the Chamber, and also their attitude in regard to the fiscal question generally, and declared that the right honourable member for East Sydney is still his fiscal leader. It may be that he is following the right honourable gentleman, but, if so, he is following him afar off. brick. year or two he has been following him throughout the Commonwealth with a political brick in his hand. If he regards his present conduct as a backing of his fiscal friends, I say a plague on such backing. He declared himself to be in favour of the Bill, and, in supporting the measure without expressing the slightest desire for its modification, he is not following the B ill into opposition. Throughout "" last week, he was paired with the Government and against the Opposition on these dumping clauses, and in regard to other provisions. No honourable member has "" jumped Jim Crow"" more often than he has done in regard to matters as to which he claims that his conduct has been fair and above board.

It mav be that he has no special information. If not, I venture to sav that he ought to have. Sof ar ns we are able to judge, only ordinary competition has been proceeding in the harvester business, which the Minister seems to have taken specially under his charge. The bulk of the harvester-importing business is concentrated in the hands of the Massev-Harris Company, which is a British company. great deal of talk from the Prime Minister, and those who support him, as to the importance of preferential trade, and the necessity of straining and twisting our Tariff with a view to concentrating the trade of the Empire in the hands of the citizens of the Empire. we find that the British trade in harvesters is being directly challenged. Massey-Harris company. Sir WILLIAM LYNE It is a Canadian company, supported by the United States. company operating within the charmed circle of the Empire, for the prosperity of which Ministers profess so much concern. Now, however, they have submitted legislation which is specially aimed at the Canadian exporters of harvesters to Australia. If the Massey-Harris CompanyI do not think are engaged in destructive competition, such as has been so clearly explained by the honourable member for Perth-if they have designs on our harvester trade, and have expressed a determination to drive the local makers out of the market with a view to afterwards increasing the prices of their I shall not look to the machines, the Minister might appeal to us to do something. But when he is challenged, he merely quotes figures which I know that. show that the trade has been carried on in the ordinary course.

It does not appear that they are being subjected to -destructive competition. On the contrary, it Now, however, the Minister is clear that our harvester manufacturers are holding their own against Canadian and American competitors. At any rate, I hope with all my heart that they are. NeitherI nor those associated with me on this side of the Chamber, desire to see the local factories closed up ' through the operation of foreign competition. Nothing would please us better than to see the Australian harvester manufacturers flourishing, and able to compete with all 'their outside rivals, so long as they can do so We have heard a upon terms fair to the public. There is nothing in the present conditions, so f ar as they have been disclosed to us, to indicate that anything beyond ordinary trading operations are being carried on.

Minister of Trade and Customs has been appealed to by various members of the Committee for information in regard' to legislation of a most drastic character. The honourable gentleman has -been coaxed, cajoled, and cuffed, but we cannot get any answer from him. He absolutely refuses to give the Committee the information which it is necessary that we should have before voting upon so important a measure as that before us. The Attorney-General has tried his hand with the honourable gentleman, and so has his friend the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, known locally as "" 66 Boirake-street."" But even the combination of the Attorney-General and "" 66 Bourke street"" could not wring from the Minister what evidence of dumping he has. A fortnight ago I moved an amendment on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, to secure delav in the passing of the measure until we could get some information from the Tariff Commission on the subject of metals and machinery. There is the same reason for delay to-day, for the honourable member for 'Perth, who is a member of the Commission appointed to inquire into this matter, has said that the Commission have never yet received a singje bit of evidence in regard to dumping in Australia. able member to say that the Tariff Commission has received no evidence to warrant the statement that dumping is taking place in Australia. statement as that. now uses the word "" sweeping.""

Mr .WILKS -The honourable member for Perth has condemned himself out of his own mouth, because if , as a member of the Tariff Commission, he had obtained this information, it would not be necessary for him to ask it from the Minister. .The honourable and learned member for Corinella had the Minister on the gridiron like a live eel over a slow fire, but while the honourable gentleman twisted and squirmed, he made no answer. The Minister knows that he has behind him an army of blind supporters. The honourable member for Parramatta has just said that they are dumb, and I say that they are also blind'The honourable and learned member for Corinella appealed to the Minister, if he had any information, to give it to the Committee, and if the honourable gentleman had done so, two hours of the time of the Committee would have been saved. Either the information which the honourable gentleman has is 'of so weak a character that he is afraid to mention it, or else, as the honourable member for Parramatta has suggested, he considers all importations in the nature of dumping. If that be so, it but proves the argument used from this side that this measure is a surreptitious attempt to get round the Tariff, and to give the Minister the fullest prohibitory powers he could possibly obtain. No wonder the Minister said eighteen months ago that he would not attempt the Tariff issue in this House. The honourable gentleman knew what he had before him. If honourable members are sent here by their constituents to give effect to protectionist principles, they have a perfect right to do so, but they should not do it by means of such a measure as this. If the Minister considers that all imports come under"" the category of dumping, and wishes to prevent that kind of dumping, he is, in this Bill, smuggling through Parliament a policy of prohibitive protection, and is asking us to be as blind as are his supporters. The honourable gentleman will not give the information for which he has been asked, and he is not now even in an irritated mood.

201,Mr Wilks,"Customs, there would be no need for a Tariff to be passed by this Chamber. I do not know whether the Minister's own sweet reasonableness will come to our rescue, or whether he is going to prove so adamantine as to require some political dynamite in the form of a vote of censure, to extract the information. am really beginning to think that a vote of censure is the only way by which we can attain our desire. If a vote of censure were tabled,. I guarantee that even members of the Labour Party would be compelled to vote for it, in view of the treatment which has been meted out to honourable members and the public. If it became known in the constituencies that members of the Labour Party were, to use another Americanism which the Minister will understand, ""going blind""'-were voting in the dark, simply on the ipse dixit of the Minister-thei r supporters outfrom reliable evidence given before the side would be far from satisfied. That, however, is the concern of the Labour Party. I am responsible to my constituents, and I refuse to vote for any portion of this clause in the absence of the necessary information. silence lends support to the idea that he is simply using speculative arguments; and I hope the honourable gentleman will at once tell us all he knows about this matter, and thus save, perhaps, a long debate. I cannot help feeling sorry that this part of the Bill has been brought forward in anticipation of the receipt of the reports of the Tariff Commission. I say. that partly because, to some extent, I feel embarrassed, and almost tongue-tied, in dealing with certain questions which are now really under the deliberation of the Royal Commission; and I cannot, in justice to my colleagues on the Commission, freely, fully, and exhaustively discuss here questions which they have yet to settle. There are certain members of the Royal Commission who are not Members of Parliament, and who cannot make use of the opportunity, which is presented to us, to ventilate their opinions. It would, I think, be a mistake, in propriety as well as in etiquette, to now fully and exhaustively dismaterial is profit. When a distiller in a large cuss those questions on the.floor of this Chamber. At the same time, I shall endeavour, without trenching on the prerogative of the Royal Commission, to make a few remark's in reference to this question. Honourable members are distinctly at a disadvantage in dealing with this part of the Bill in the absence, not only of the report of the Commission, but of the evidence given before the Commission. Some honourable members have sugI gested that the dumping question is not a normal part of the Tariff question-no t a normal part of the Tariff conditions. So fair as my recollection serves me, there has been a considerable amount of testimony tendered to the Commission concerning proceedings under the name of "" dumping ' ' ; but there seems to be considerable difference of opinion as tb the exact meaning of the word. Some of the witnesses used the word "" dumping "" in a comfortable, self-assured manner-muc h in the same way as the old lady used the ""blessed word Mesopotamia."" But so far as I can understand Commission, the true definition of "" dumping "" is the export of surplus stock from one country into another, and the sale of that surplus stock in the importing country at prices lower than the prices of that The Minister's stock in the home country or country of origin. referred' to in all the consular reports. does not mean the sale of those goods at a. loss, or at a price below the cost of production, but it certainly does 'mean the sale of goods in the market of the importing country at prices lower than the sale prices'within the country of origin. I should like to draw honourable members' attention to paragraph 17 of the Tariff Commission Report No. 2, which has already been presented' to' Parliament, in reference to spirits and the distillation of spirits. In that paragraph honourable members will find a preliminary reference to this question of dumping, and a definition in reference to the transport or export of surplus stocks of spirits. The paragraph is as follows: When the stocks of the Scotch distilleries are heavy they ship their surplus out to Australia. They do not care at what price they sell, because it is only their surplus. Once fixed charges are paid, anything over the cost of labour and wav of business has manufactured a certain number of gallons, and has earned sufficient to cover as cautiously as I can his fixed charges, any further quantity made is not charged with these expenses, and can therefore be sold at a much cheaper rate. He is at a great advantage compared with a distillery",33,William Lyne Thi S Is A Pro Interests Of The Fiscal Faith That I Hold

Of course, selling at a price below the cost of production could not last long, and could not form part of a continuous commercial system; only in rare and extraordinary instances, such as bargain sales, would goods be sent here and sold at prices below the cost of production.

We 'have had evidence in connection with many branches of the metals and machinery industry, which I must decline at the present stage to discuss. But this Bill will not meet those grievances, nor will it remove those complaints. It will not satisfy those who have made them. It will be a disappointment and a disillusionment to a number of people who are now waiting for remedial legislation. This Bill rather stands in the way of the redress of grievances, than tends to give relief. I want this House and this Government to facilitate the early consideration of the Tariff Commission's reports: and I say that there is enough work to go on with now. There is almost a month's work in the reports furnished by the Commission, dealing with spirits distillation and wine. Why should not Parliament have an opportunity to discuss them? Although only a part of the report of the Commission has been presented, and it is a partial and incomplete report, there is sufficient material for the House to deal with. once propose that the House shall gp into Committee of Ways and Means for the purpose of redressing grievances in an industry which is crying for relief, and in which upwards of a quarter a million of capital has been invested ?

When the honourable memter was speaking on the 20th June, according to Hansard, page 469, he said, referring to myselfI would ask him whether there are any cases in his cognisance in which dumping has taken place to the substantial detriment of Australian industries. I saidI think so, most certainly. Then the honourable member asked me whether I knew of any special cases. After my interjection, he saidThat is information ' which honourable members are entitled to have in their possession. If the evil be pressing we are justified in taking more strenuous steps, and incurring more risks to cope with it than it would be the case if it were not more urgent and pressing. Would the Minister be good enough to tell the House in what industries his experience leads him to suppose that dumping of the kind to which he objects is taking place? To that I saidI shall reply to that question at the close of the debate'? I did not tell the honourable member that I was going to give specific cases. Then the honourable member went onI presume that he is cognisant of cases, though he did not tell us what they were when he moved the second reading of the B ill .

Further on the honourable member saidI t was his duty in introducing the B ill to give us all the information in his possession. I am just as earnest as he is in my desire to support a fair protectionist policy in this country, and I resent being placed at a disadvantage by his refusal to give information which it is his duty to supply.

Sydney) [5.4°]--If the Minister had given at 3 o'clock this afternoon the answer which he gave at 5.30, he would have saved the time of the Committee. Some of his statements are extraordinary. He says that dumping is the selling abroad of goods at prices less than those for which they are sold in the country of origin, although the sale may give a very good profit to the producer. Does he see how far that definition takes him ? Does he not know that the operations of our own people come within it ? Sir WILLIAM LYNE people send goods abroad? member mean to say that the harvester people sell more cheaply abroad than they sell here? orable member's mind is f u l l of harvesters. The only object of the B ill would appear to be to deal with the importation of harvesters. on the markets of the United States and of Manufacturers in Canada and Canada, because they are not used there. the United States. lian manufacturers of harvesters put their machines on the South American markets. But would anv manufacturer send his goods abroad if he could sell them in his own country at an equal price and lower selling charges? Manufacturers only exI have here the port, and sell at lower prices abroad, what they cannot sell in their own market. For instance, those in the butter industry keep prices up here by exporting surplus, but take what they can get for the surplus exported to Great Britain. Those engaged in the f r u it industry do the same thing, while the same remark applies to our meat industry. Are not better prices obtained for meat in Australia than are obtained I am not talkabroad? But, as there is a surplus, it must be sent to other markets, to fetch what it will bring. If this practice is a criminal one, the suppression of which by legislation is justifiable, are we going to deal with our exports as well as with our imports ? others. (North is left to others in the belief-probabl y with the assurance-that Great Britain will not turn against her own dependencies. If it is dishonest to follow the practice that I have described, and it is intended to penalize the importers who adopt it , we should also penalize our exporters who resort to the same means of getting rid of their surplus. It is quite a different matter when goods are deliberately sold below cost in the markets to which they are exported in order to destroy a local industry. I do not think so. object. not the object, if the goods are sold at a fair profit.

If the Minister's interpretation of dumping be adopted, he will have to deal with an enormous number of cases. A large quantity, of our imports are sold at prices lower than the rates which prevail in the markets of production, and still most of them are sold at a profit.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE what I have stated, so far as selling prices were concerned? Minister, instead of dealing with this matter by means of the Tariff, as we might expect of him as a protectionist, and as has been done in Canada, says, "" You must give me power to refer this to a Judge, who will be compelled, in certain cases such as I have instanced, to put the Act into force, and enable me to exclude good's."" Sir WILLIAM LYNE ister, but the Comptroller-General, who will take action. Comptroller-General will act through the Minister, or the Minister through the Comptroller-General. The Minister may originate the inquiry, or the Comptroller-General may do it . same. The Minister has not added to the clearness of his proposals by his contradictory explanations. A t first he told us. that the provisions of the Bill would be operative only in a few cases; but, if his definition of dumping be adopted, it will apply to a very large number of cases, which will crop up day after day. The honourable member for North Sydney has referred to the Canadian legislation with regard to dumping, and I think that one aspect of that law should be specially mentioned, because it meets the case of local manufacturers who endeavour to dump their goods upon the markets of other countries. There is a clause in the Canadian Customs Act which provides that, if it be proved to the satisfaction of the Court that any manufacturers are selling, goods for export at lower prices than are being charged to local consumers, the Tariff duty which they enjoy shall be reduced. Thus the same treatment is meted out to the local manufacturer as is accorded to those who dump goods upon the Canadian market. The Minister, in his anxiety to pass legislation differing from any adopted in other parts of the world, carefully omitted a We are merely proprovision such as I have described. He dumping of Australian products upon other Canada does not exclude lian people. The Minister has given us an disc ploughs. I s not that exactly Sir WILLIAM LYNE And other ploughs as well. the information of the Minister, that the manufacturer of disc ploughs in Australia referred to in that statement is, and has been, manufacturing disc ploughs under licence from the Americani patentee.

Osborne has been tried, and that the very question to which I refer has been dealt with. Messrs. Robinson and Company, who were manufacturing disc ploughs under the American patent, complained that other persons were manufacturing similar goods, in disregard of the patent rights. They called upon the American patentee to protect his patent, and it was then found that the patent was faulty.

303,Mr Robinson,"I accuse the honoras evidence. It is no more evidence than would be any statement made from the top of the Princess Theatre, or anywhere else. I have referred the honourable gentleman to a case which came before the Courts in which sworn evidence was given, which proved beyond a doubt that T. Robinson and Company and other Victorian manufacturers have been manufacturing disc ploughs under a licence from an American patentee. The Minister could find out the truth of that for himself if, instead of repeating here statements submitted to him by interested parties, he would walk into the Parliamentary Library and look at the documents. But even if his statement was perfectly true, the conying of these implements would be no crime. Is the Minister aware that his pets, MrH . V. McKay and others, acted as agents for an American firm of manufacturers of what are called seed drills for a number of years, and that when they had a full knowledge of the construction of those drills they copied them, and so closely that they even copied private marks on the implements, as to the meaning of which they were entirety ignorant? These are the people for whom the Minister is now endeavouring to legislate. I say they were perfectly entitled to do this, so long as there is no patent right involved. The world would nevfer make any progress if this kind of thing were not done. If a farmer sees that another is following more up-to-date and better methodst than he is, is he not entitled to copy them? I say that so long as these innovations are not protected bypatents every manufacturer, whether Australian or American, is entitled to copy entitled to copy the American seed drill, but I also hold that, having done so, it does not lie in his mouth, or in the mouth of the Minister, to complain that implecopied by American manufacturers. The honourable gentleman's statement shows that, while he is willing that evidence of the adoption of an ordinary trade practice shall be a bar to American manufacturers, he regards indulgence in the same trade usage by Australian manufacturers as something which should not be challenged in any way. The members of the Committee and the country are misled by the honourable gentleman's statement that American manufacturers are guilty of piracy because they have adopted a universal trade practice, which is followed with very great care by [40]2 the manufacturers of implements here.

Surely the honourable gentleman must be aware that typewriters and sewing machines are not manufactured here. ment of the Comptroller-General; it is not mine. . tra duties imposed upon these articles because they are dumped here, when we know that not a single manufacturer in Australia makes them. Manufacturers here use them, but the honourable gentleman would prevent that. learned member's statement is absolutely incorrect. gentleman in his statement to the Committee read out a list of dumped articles, including typewriters and sewing machines, and it is of no use for him to try to wriggle out of it. and learned member mean to sav that sewing machines are not made here? machines are not made here, and the honourable member for Bourke knows it. ber is referring to the fact that a firm in North Melbourne are selling the A.N.A. sewing machines, but if he will refer to the secretary of the branch in that district, he will find out that those machines are made in Germany, and are only put together here.

But even that is not done in the case of typewriters.

The Minister gave us information as to the export trade from America to New Zealand, but I do not think he can ask us to accept off-hand an assumption that the not propose to penalize what is dumping same sort of importation is going on into according to his idea, but only what is set Australia. Sir WILLIAM LYNE It is, absolutely. Minister believes that to be true. Sir WILLIAM LYNE the position of giving a verdict, and honourable members ought to be shown .evidence of dumping in Australia before they are asked to vote. The Minister gives a new definition to "" dumping ""a definition I never heard before. I notice that, in thd discussions in England and elsewhere, "" dumping "" is usually held to be the selling of imported goods at less than the cost of production in the country of origin. The Minister has, however, extended that definition, and holds that, not only shall imported goods not be sold at less than, the cost of production, but that goods shall not be landed if they are to be sold here at a price less than that which retailers in_ the country of importation are able to obtain. That is a most extraordinary and far-reaching proposal. If that is what the Minister means by "" dumping,"" his proposal, if carried, would .affect probably nine-tenths of the import trade of the country. Sir WILLIAM LYNE would have to be done in a very large way before it was touched. that, in many cases, where goods are bought after the season in other parts of the world, and sent to Australia in time for the season here, those goods are procured at less than, If the principle is once the actual ordinary selling price. amendments limiting the purchases to purchases from the manufacturer, or some person representing the manufacturer.

There is one other point with which I should like to deal. This Bill affects our primary producers almost as much as .it affects the importing classes. That t/he B ill affects the importing classes is easily shown by the widespread fear of the results of the legislation. But the primary producers are vitally interested in getting their goods to market as cheaply as possible, and those markets are at the otherSuch importing end of the world.

The honourable gentleman has introduced to this Chamber a modest cake of soap! He has not asked the Committee to wash its hands of its privileges, but he has produced this small tablet of soap as the only inducement he has to offer as to why the Committee should follow his lead ! sure that the Committee will feel gratified that the Minister of Trade and Customs has at length yielded to the pressure of criticism, and vouchsafed to give us somG information, meagre as it is, on the subject of dumping. We ""are indebted to the honourable member for Bendigo for having practically forced the hands of the Minister in this connection; and I hope that he will give serious heed to the advice tendered well complain under the circumstances if by that honourable member to delaying the further consideration of the Bill, especially in view of his authoritative opinion that to proceed with it before the reports of the Tariff Commission are laid upon the table for the information of honourable members, of Ministers, and of the country, may have the effect of prejudicing any future action that might be thought necessary to be taken in the direction of correcting Tariff anomalies. right in saying that the honourable member for Bendigo has expressed views which are shared by a considerable section of honourable members. All along, the contentionhas been made, especially in relation to the particular poring is going on in Australia-a n effort tion of the measure.now under consideration, that it ought not to have been submitted to Parliament at the present juncture, and certainly ought not to have been pushed forward with such undue haste and such a disregard of the immense interests, financial, commercial, industrial, and general, of the trading, manufacturing, and industrial communities, as well as of the public generally of the Commonwealth of Australia. to display an inward ""fear that the reports of the Tariff Commission will be unfavorable to legislation of this kind. He seems to have had either some premonition, or perhaps some private information, that the reports of the Tariff Commission, if based upon the evidence which has so fatbeen published in the) newspapers, will not only show that legislation of this kind is not desirable, but that there is no necessity whatever for it. It seems a reasonthis Bill, and especially the portion of it now under review, is that he is afraid to risk what the Tariff Commission's reports may reveal. If the Minister and those sitting behind him are sincere in the belief that evidence exists which will show the necessity for such legislation, that is an argument which shouid induce' him to listen to the request of members of the Opposition to delay the passage of the' Bill. But in spite of all entreaties, not only on the part of members of the Opposition, but of some of those who are of the same fiscal faith as himself, to delay further action until such time as we are in possession of fuller information, the Minister has determined to push on with the Bill. He cannot very some of us and the country at large are disposed to regard his feverish haste with suspicion. Coming to the clauses relating to dumping, we are entitled, I think, to have some definition of the term. What is "" Dumping"" ? The Minister this afternoon, after two hours and a half or thereabouts of hard pressure, condescended to rise and endeavour to give some sort of a justification for introducing this meaI think I am sure. But he carefully avoided telling us what dumping is. He did not attempt to define the term, or to explain the process, but he attempted to show that something in the nature of what he was pleased to call dumpwhich, I make bold to say, was not a brilliant success. The only thing which the Minister did was to show that certain importations are coming into this country, that they are competing with articles which are produced here, and that in some cases they are sold at a price below the cost of locallv-produced articles, and, he also asserted, below the price of the same articles in the country from which they are exThe Minister appears to me ported.

380,Mr Johnson (Lang) [7.32],"I amthings which they need at a considerably less cost than they would have to pay if they were dependent purely upon the mono-' pol'istic efforts of local manufacturers, with competition entirely shut out. But it does not afford any evidence of dumping as that term is applied in the old country. All that it shows is a desire to get a fair footing in the markets of Australia for these products, and that in doing so they give the public-the consumera wider range of choice at a lower cost for the article. The instances quoted by the Minister himself as awful examples of dumping and alleged ruinous competition, were not particularly striking, and certainly the Comptroller-General of Customs has not been very happy in his selection of the articles which it is asserted are being dumped into this country. special emphasis was laid by the Minister and the Comptroller-General were sewing machines, typewriters, and oils. mentioned incidentally. In regard to sewing machines, I should like to know where in this country they are manufactured. I have no knowledge of any local sewing machine being manufactured right out in this country.

As to typewriters, it may be that there is a typewriting factory in Australia of which honourable members have no knowledge. I certainly know of no such industry. I do know that most typewriting machines are the subject of patents, and I take it that whatever manufacturing there may be here is done only with the consent and under the control of the patentees, who are mostly, if not wholly, nonresidents of Australia. I do not believe, however, that there are such cases. Certainly I have never heard of them. In regard to oil, it has been shown that oil can only be produced here at a considerably greater cost than that of oil imported from where the natural oil is obtained from wells.

First, the Minister complained -about the effect of dumping being to bring about cheapness, because he spoke of the imported article under-selling the Australian article, and he said "" That is an evil, and must be stamped out, and the only way to prevent that cheapness is to stop the introduction of these articles, so that'the l ocally-made articles can command a higher price."" breath he contradicted himself, by declaring that the reason why he wanted to prevent importation was not that the local producer could get a better price for his -article, but that the public could get the article at a lower price. low dictory character ? possibly have any faith in them, because if he only reflects for a moment he utter absurdity and absolutely self-contradictory character. But we know perfectly well that all this facing-both-ways is -characteristic of the Minister and those who want to bleed the unfortunate public for private gain. What they want to do is -to raise the price of all goods to the consumer. The result will be absolute injury to the great mass of the people. In regard to dumping, the honourable and learned member for West Sydney referred to the scriptural illustration of the falling of manna. Minister of Trade and Customs would say that was dumping of the very worse description. Yet, if we were to get all our material wants rained down from heaven in the same way-if the earth were to be flooded with bounteous gifts of the things which minister to the necessities, the comforts, the luxuries, and the happiness of the peopleI suppose that it would be called dumping in the most -extreme form. But can anybody point to -a single person who would be hurt or injured by such a process of dumping? I wish that those who object to dumping would only dump into my back yard all those useful things which go to minister to the wants and luxuries of mankind. I -should receive them most thankfully. -should not take it ill if my grocer, my -or any one else to whom I usually have to give something in exchange when I want his goods, were to insist upon dumping them into my back yard every hour <>f the week at a fraction of cost or at no -cost at all to me. I wonder who would get poor firstI cr the dumpers? Why, sir, it is absolutely absurd to argue that any system of importing the things which the people need at the lowest possible rates can do injury to the community. Is it to be supposed for a moment that a country will dump its goods into Australia without getting some equivalent in return ? Does not the Minister know sufficient of But in the very next economics to be aware that imports are paid for by exports, and that no country can be a purely exporting country unless it chooses to pay about twice or, perhaps, even more, the rate of freight which otherwise would be charged, even if trade could be carried Who can folon at all of such a one-sided character? arguments of such a contraOnly this afternoon, in connection The Minister cannot with the mail contract, we had from the Prime Minister a statement in which he said that certain ships with a must be struck with their very large tonnage would have to be built, and provided with an immense amount of storage space for the purpose, of-what?-takin g away Australian perishable products in exchange for .goods produced in other countries. How are the sales going to be effected? The Minister knows perfectly well that such sales are effected by means of exchanges, and that the exports in the mail ships will have to be paid for by goods imported from other countries in exchange. Does he suppose that these magI suppose the nificent ships will leave London, and other ports, and come to Australia with thenholds empty? Yet the very object of this measure is to try to bring about such a state of things ! We know perfectly well that they could not carry on trade and commerce on those lines for a month without going bankrupt, and doing immense damage not only to themselves, but to the trade and prestige of Australia. This afternoon we had the honourable and learned member for West Sydney, a professed out-and-out free-trader, defending legislation of this character, certainly in a more or less unconvincing and, perhaps, half-hearted way. Has he considered what the effect would, be upon the particular class of persons whom he comes I here specially to represent? One of the effects of any diminution of importabutcher, my baker, my tailor, tion by means of the prohibitive power proposed to be granted to the Minister would be to largely paralyze the trade, commerce, and industry of this country. There would be fewer ships coming here to land goods. A multitude of the men who find employment on the wharfs of Melbourne, Adelaide, and Sydney would have to seek other avenues of labour. Our graving docks and ship-repairing yards would suffer severely through a diminution in the volume of work which ordinarily went to them. The hands who are now employed in industries which are more or less dependent upon shipping, and the success of which must either be promoted or diminished as our shipping is encouraged or discouraged, would be very seriously affected by the operations of the Bill. Honourable members must know that any interference with the trade and commerce of this country would involve not only the importers, with the immense army of employees dependent on the importing trade, and an immense number of carters and others, but also various branches of industry which are directly and indirectly associated with, and dependent upon, shipping. This would affect all our ports and all the people of Australia. I do not wish to pursue the subject at any great length at the present stage, but I would seriously urge the Minister to give due weight to the speech of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo. Coming from the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, as it did, it certainly should carry a very large amount of weight with the Minister. I urge the honourable gentleman to give due consideration to the appeal to delay the further consideration of the measure until honourable members generally have had an opportunity of studying the reports of the Tariff Commission, and then seeing whether any such necessity exists for this legislation as he alleges does exist. I do not for a moment believe that there can be brought forward any evidence which will justify the introduction of a Bill congether imported parts. While I admit that taining clauses of this description'. I do not believe that the Minister knows of a tangible case of dumping which will justify the enactment of such legislation. In the face of anv evidence to the contrary, we can only assume, and we are warranted in assuming, that there must be some sinister influences outside the House which have not been disclosed by the Minister, or anv of his supporters, to account for this indecent and undignified haste in pushing forward a measure for which no reason whatever has been shown to exist. we have had a very instructive debate on why db not Ministers orinp; forward for 1 Part III . o£ the Bill, no utterance to consideration the reports of the Tariff Comwhich honourable members have listened deserves more serious consideration than that of the honourable and learned member for Bendigo, supported as it was by the speech of the honourable member for Perth. Surely the Government must feel that in disregarding those remarks it is practically flouting the Tariff Commission. The honourable and learned member adduced weighty arguments to prove that at this stage we require more information than we at present possess in regard to the dumping which Part III . is intended to guard against. With the utmost respect for the members of other Royal Commissions/ I say that it will be generally admitted that no Commissioners have more thoughtfully, carefully, and attentively carried out the tasks allotted to them than have those appointed to consider the effect of our Tariff upon Australian industries. There have always been large attendances at the meetings of the Commission, and the desire to secure evidence on both sides of the questions coming before it has been evident from the first. Therefore, the appeal of the Chairman for the postponement of the consideration of this important measure deserves more respect than has been shown to it. I do not wish to speak unkindly, but the action of the Minister forces us back to the belief that the Government is being compelled by others to push fKe measure forward before information, which would be available after a very short delay, can be obtained. The Minister was challenged to give instances of dumping such as the Bill would deal with, and replied most weakly. He referred to one or two industries which, in the proper sense of the words, are, not manufacturing, but assembling, industries, the work of whose operatives is to put tosuch industries are serviceable to the community, they are not such as justify the enactment of legislation like that before us. I ventured to suggest, when speaking on the second reading, that the Committee would be found unanimously opposed to the deliberate importation of goods for the purpose of destroying Australian industries; but the measure provides for a direct restraint of trade, and gives to the Minister powers which he should not be permitted to exercise, even with the safeguards arranged for. If it is really the desire of the Government to give relief to industries re-",52,Willis W H E R E Do They Do The Same Thing As Soon As They Have
398,Mr Knox (Kooyong) [8.5],"Although' quiring assistance and further protection,mission already to hand? The honourable and learned member for Bendigo thinks that it will take at least a month to consider those reports, and to give effect by legislation to any decisions arrived at in regard to them, and I , for one, am prepared to pay serious attention to the recommendations of the Commission, with the desire to do all that is necessary to give help to industries requiring it. By the time the three reports now before us had been dealt with, the Commission, I have reason to believe, would have presented other reports. menced to deal with the Commission's reports to-morrow, I think that I can safely say that the Commission would undertake to keep it supplied with work for the rest of the session. which the Ministry should pay serious heed, arid I have no doubt that it will be endorsed by the chairman of the Tariff Commission. have been made by the honourable and learned member for Bendigo and the honourable member for Perth, as chairman and member of the Tariff Commission respectively, amount to a challenge to the Government, who profess to desire to assist our industries, to postpone the consideration of the Bill for' fhe present, and engage in the more practical work of dealing with the reports of the Tariff Commission. If Ministers adopt this course, I am sure that they will receive the assistance of a number of honourable members on this side of the House. business men of Australia, and are unnecessarily interfering with the course of trade and commerce by unduly pressing forward legislation of this kind. The object of the part of the Bill now under discussion is to prevent the importation of goods which are deliberately brought here for the purpose of destroying our manufactures, and Ministers will best accomplish their end by giving reasonable consideration to the requests of honourable members. I do not believe ' that mere cheapness should be our sole aim. I desire that the fullest justice should be done to all our producers and manufacturers, but I do not think that we should be .called upon to deal out of hand with an incomplete and ill-considered measure such as that now before us. It would be an outrage, not only upon the House, but upon the community generally, to pass the Bill under present conditions^ and any w^rong that may be inflicted as the result of the Government persisting in their present course will inevitably react upon the members of the Labour Party, who are pressing, them forward. It seems to be imagined that both our manufacturers and the working classes will be benefited by the prohibition of imports which it is intended to' exclude by means of the dumping provisions; but it is questionable whether the Bill will confer the benefits that are exParliament compected to flow from it. I trust that the Government will cease their efforts to bulldoze honourable members into passing this ill-considered Bill. common with most honourable members on this side of the Chamber, I am bitterly opposed to the B ill , and think that we are being unfairly treated by the Government. The honourable and learned member for Corinella asked the Minister of Customs to afford us certain information, and the Minister has made a statement in which he has done little more than repeat what he stated during the second-reading debate. He threw very little additional light on the subject. He produced a bit of soap which, although it bore a German label, he toid us had been made in Japan. soap it was. to judge, the soap was fairly good. I did not test it by making use of it, because, fortunately, I do not require so much washing as do certain Ministers. The Minister The Government are flouting the endeavoured to impress upon us the fact that dumping was being carried on to an extent that was proving disastrous to many of our industries. If he had desired to convince honourable members upon that point he should have proved his case by bringing forward incontrovertible testimony, instead of merely producing a piece of soap. Although he stated that the soap had been made in Japan, it bore a label printed partly in French and partly in. German, and there was absolutely no evidence that the article was the product of Japanese tabour. The Minister should not content himself by making mere assertions, but should submit absolute proofs. Of course, the object of the Minister was to excite the feelings of honourable members against the introduction into the Com-",54,Willis W H E R E Do They Do The Same Thing As Soon As They Have

405,Mr Cameron,"S o far as I was .ablemonwealth of the products of cheap labour. If he knew anything about Japan, he would be aware that the Japanese, who live principally on rice and fish, have a very small number of cattle and sheep, and are therefore not able to produce large quantities of tallow with which to manufacture soap for export. If the soap produced by the Minister was made in Japan, its principal constituent, namely, tallow, must have been first imported either from Australia or South America. The Minister should be in a position to substantiate his statements. I should like to point out that three classes of the community are deeply interested in this measure. The first class, the manufacturers, is a comparatively small one. The second class, the employees in our manufacturing industries, is not a very large one; and the third class, the consumers, is by far the largest and most important. It appears to me that the Minister of Trade and Customs has gone mad on the subject of protection, and that in his desire to bolster up Australian industries, he has entirely lost sight of the interests of the largest class in the communitv. who will undoubtedly suffer seriously if this precious Bill becomes law. Dumping is generally understood to consist of placing upon the market a large quantity of a given commodity within a very short time. can be no question that when a market is flooded in this way, the tendency is to depress prices for the time being. may not be of any benefit to the manufacturers, or their employees, but it is certainly good for the great bulk of the consumers. The Minister says that if , as the result of dumping, our manufacturers are ruined, the importers who have been flooding the market will in a very short time raise their prices, and the consumers will eventually be no better off than if they had paid reasonable prices all along. prices were unduly raised, those who had been responsible for the dumping, with the object of securing the market for themselves, would very soon be exposed to competition from other quarters. Most European countries are unable to consume all the manufactured goods that they produce, and would very readily seize an opportunity to enter into competition with anv bodv of men who might seek to monopolize our market in the manner indicated. I do not know of any article except oil, the price of which could be unduly inflated for any Mr Cameron. length of time, because competition would undoubtedly operate to bring prices down to a normal level. For these reasons, it appears to me that we need not be afraid that any very disastrous effects will follow from dumping. The honourable and learned member for Wannon, before the adjournment for dinner, made an extremely eloquent speech, in which he conclusively proved that statements which the Minister had accepted as gospel were utterly without foundation. Manufacturers abroad, by the aid of better machinery, or owing to the fact that they are able to manufacture on a large scale, are enabled to produce certain articles very much more cheaply than they can be produced here, and if we pass this Bill we shall say to those persons, "" We shall not allow you to sell your goods at a price which yields you a fair profit, and-which you are prepared to accept, but we shall compel you to raise your price to that of the Australian manufacturers of the same goods."" If we take ploughs, for example, which are amongst the most useful implements employed in one of our primary industries, we shall find that Australian ploughs at the present time cannot be sold at much less than from £ 6 10s. to £ j . We are told that they are superior to the implements imported from America and Canada. Whether that be so are not, I am unable to say. The workmanship of There the imported implements may not be quite as good as that of the implements locally manufactured, but they answer their purThis pose, and American and Canadian ploughs can be sold here at from £4. 10s. to If this Bill is to have any effect at all, action may be taken under it to compel American and Canadian manufacturers of ploughs to put their price for those implements up to the price charged by Australian manufacturers. Who will suffer by that ? It will be the farmers of Australia, of whom I am one. I therefore say that if this Bill is allowed to become law, its We know, however, that if effect may be to inflict injustice on one of the most deserving classes in the community. I recognise that honourable members can speak more than once to the same question in Committee, and I shall, therefore, not speak at length at this stage, but, before resuming my seat, -I do urge upon the'free traders in the labour ranks opposite to consult the best interests of the people of Australia, and vote against these anti-dumping clauses. propose to go into the question as to what",55,Willis W H E R E Do They Do The Same Thing As Soon As They Have

I shall not detain the Committee any longer at this stage, but I indicate that, to test the feeling of honorable members, I shall move an amendment upon this clause, providing for a definition of labour. The alphabetical arrangement is not followed in the clause, and I propose to move, after the definition of the word "" trade,"" the insertion of these words"" Labour"" means labour in Australian industries to which a Commonwealth or Slate law providing for the fixing of the remuneration of labour by an award of a Court of Arbitration, an industrial agreement, or a Board applies, or, if no such law applies, in which in the opinion of the Justice the remuneration of labour prior to the alleged unfair competition was fair. We find that on the subject of harvesters some of the gentlemen who gave evidence before the Tariff who are advocating prohibitive duties, submitted figures from which it appeared that about 25 per cent, only of the product was represented by labour. Let us now protect that 25 per cent., and not give the whole of the protection to the other 75 per cent. unreasonable, and I have therefore framed the amendment so that it shall apply not merely to industries protected under an Arbitration Act with provision for awards in favour of labour, by an industrial agreement also sanctioned by an Act, or by Wages Board, but that it shall also apply where these means of protection do not exist if the Justice thinks that the remuneration of labour prior to the alleged unfair competition was fair. effect as the institution of a Wages Board. effect. As we now find gentlemen, and amongst them politicians, in their spare time perambulating the country, organizing labour and telling labourers that all sorts of things will follow the prohibition of imports, and the increase of Customs duties, that if we reverse the rule which hitherto we have thought led to productive progress, the millennium will come about, I propose to move the amendment in order that the hopes which, have been raised amongst the labouring classes by these perambulating and somewhat loquacious persons shall not be falsified.

I do not think that fhe instances of dumping in Australia of exports from the United Kingdom are more I have no wish to be than the instances of dumping of Australian goods in Great Britain, and the Minister has said nothing to shake that belief. There is, therefore, no serious reason for excluding British goods under the provisions of Part III . of the B ill . Harvesters, which seem always to be at the back of the Minister's mind, are not sent here from the United Kingdom. The first very important reason which I would urge in support of my amendment is the treatment which Australia and the other dependencies of the Empire have received from the It would' have the same mother-land.

The Vice-President of the Executive Council, who represents an electoral division in which there are many butter factories, knows that an association determines what quantity of butter is likely to be absorbed by this market, and fixes the price for it, the balance being exported to Great Britain, to be sold there at what it will fetch.

482,Mr Dugald Thomson,"The Minmeasure anti-dumping provisions, but which have been called so here. scribes the provisions. Canadian Minister and some member of the Dominion Parliament may so describe the provisions. I am not finding fault with the description, and I am quite willing to call them anti-dumping provisions, if the Minister chooses. How does Canada deal with the question? The Dominion Act of Parliament is more a measure for the equalization of prices than anything else. The section of the Canadian Act which deals with this matter is as fellows: Whenever it appears to the satisfaction of the Minister of Customs, or of any officer of Customs authorized to collect Customs dues, that the export price, or the actual selling price to the importer in Canada, of any imported dutiable articles of a class or kind made or produced in Canada, is less than the fair market value thereof, as determined according to the basis of value for duty, provided in the Customs Act in respect of imported goods subjected to an advalorem duty, such article shall, in addition to the duty otherwise established, be subject to a special duty of Customs equal to the difference between such fair market value and such selling price. It will be seen that this aims at an equalization of prices, and even to that there is some limitation in the following:Provided, however, that the special Customs duty on any article shall not exceed one-half of the Customs duty otherwise established in respect of the article, except in regard to the articles mentioned in items 224 (pig-iron and cast scrap iron), 226 (iron or steel ingots, and other forms less finished than iron or steel bars, & c ) , this is apart from the question, before us. and 231 (rolled iron or steel plates), in ScheduleA to the Customs Tariff 1897, the special duty of Customs on which shall not exceed 15 per cent, ad valorem, nor more than the difference between the selling price and the fair market value of the article. The effect of these provisions is simply to equalize, by the duty, the prices of the imports, and even that is subject to some limitation. Canada does not attempt to exclude: she admits the goods, and only attempts to equalize prices. But what is Canada's treatment of Great Britain? Although, these duties are imposed, Canada charges Great Britain only two-thirds of the duty which is charged to other nations. duties first. a distinction, in any case. I am merely stating the facts, and not. arguing whether Canada is right or wrong, or is too geneMinister has read it, and deliberately rerous, or not sufficiently generous. I only jected it. We will see what that provision desire to impress on the Minister the fact that Canada does to some degree recognise Great 'Britain in this connection. Now we come to the New Zealand measure. We often hear New Zealand measures lauded by members of this Parliament, and frequently by members' of the. Government. It is evident, from the data which has been placed before us that the Government consulted the New Zealand measure before they drafted these anti-dumping clauses. The Government have not adopted the New Zealand provisions, and one reason for that may be that, while the Bill proposes to affect all gocds, New Zealand only saw reason to deal with agricultural implements-that is, to deal with them if the occasion arose. I do not think that New Zealand has yet applied the provisions, and that is, I suppose, because there has' not been found any necessity to do so. the Act, and if we pass the Bill we may not find it necessary to put it into operation. sent Minister of Trade and Customs in office ! Minister stands by the speech he has made, the Bill will be put into operation every day in the year. know that there is the greatest difficulty in understanding what the Minister of Trade and Customs does say. At any rate, all New Zealand has not considered her legislation any too liberal, at any rate to the mother country. What are the provisions of the New Zealand Act? It is provided ' that if a certain Board finds that implements have been uodulv and improperlyreduced in price by the importers, the price shall not be increased to the consumer by excluding competitors, but a bonus, up to one-third, may be granted to the New Zealand implement makers to sustain them through the unfair competition.

The New Zealand Act in section 9 providesFor the purpose of this Act, implements of British manufacture shall be deemed to be manufactured in New Zealand,' and the importers of such implements shall be deemed to be manufacturers thereof in New Zealand. It will be observed that not only does the New Zealand Act provide that implements of British manufacture shall be "" deemed to be manufactured in New Zealand,"" but it makes the further provision that the importer of such implements shall be deemed to be a manufacturer in New Zealand. That means that if a bonus is given to prevent the destruction of industries by foreign importations, the importer of a British implement gets that bonus as well as does the New Zealand manufacturer. clude ? making my amendment as wide as that, because it might be considered to embrace something which was not desirable. able member prove that the goods were really British? proved in New Zealand?

Havanna, and they are exported from that place as ""Havanna cigars."" merce Act, which the honourable member assisted to pass, presents the same difficulty. If the Customs Department cannot ascertain with sufficient clearness to satisfy itself that particular goods are the products of Great Britain, it is mot nearly so alert and capable as I suppose it to be. Will the honourable member for Northern Melbourne tell me this: Which is the greater difficulty, to say what is the ordinary cost of a product in English or foreign markets or to say whether the product is imported from Great Britain or from a foreign country ? I know which task I would rather undertake. value of goods from other people. not find out the cost of production of certain manufactures from the productions of other manufacturers in the case of complicated articles of trade. In the New Zealand Act there is a generous recognition of the mother country. Whatever we may think of the New Zealand legislation, and of its nature and necessity, surely we must recognise, as New Zealand has done, the generosity of Great Britain, the support we get from the British Empire, and the protection it gives to us. New Zealand has recognised that within the four comers of an Act dealing with importations such as we are considering now. giate to New Zealand. rally ; they ought to be attracted to a country of that character. Any Briton ought to be. In a Bill such as this, where no need can be shown as regards British goods for such provisions as those which we are considering, we ought to recognise our debt to the mother country. Is the Government prepared to say deliberately in this measure that British goods shall be prevented from coming-here under the very same conditions as those under which we send goods to Great Britain? Is the Minister of Trade and Customs prepared to say that there shall be no difference between the treatment of the mother country and that which is shown to foreign nations? Is he prepared to say that the policy of preference-of concession for concession-whic h this Government has supported, is so much empty sham, and that we shall take the first opportunity we get, not to assist Great Britain to send goods here, but to shut out British goods from our markets when there is no need for it ? It has not been shown that there has been any dumping of British goods into Australia, except that dumping which consists in the export of a surplus, and the obtaining of the best possible price in the market to which the goods are exported; which is the class of dumping that we carry on with the great bulk of our exported products. I will ask whether there is any evidence of an intention to carrv the preferential trade policy of the Government into effect; does the Government propose to follow the example set by preferentialists like the late Mr Seddon of New Zealand?

"" remark was made last week that the Minister nominally in charge of the Bill was practically absent during the greater part of the time devoted to its consideration, and was, in fact, represented by counsel, while tonight again the speech of the honorable member for North Sydney has been replied to, not by him, but by the Attorney-General. This seems to me only right, because the Minister of Trade and Customs, in introducing the B ill, stood very much in the position of a criminal in the dock. The TEMPORA RY CHAIRMAN ( Mr machines could be introduced here, and member must withdraw that remark. cused "" for "" criminal.""

It is not an anti-dumping Bill, but a measure to secure that MrH . V. McKay, of harvester fame, shall not have competition to meet. It must be remembered, too, that Mr the honourable member for Yarra would obMcKay carries on his operations in a district in which there is no Wages Board. The great bulk of the Labour Party are so false to their principles that they suppout this Bill to allow a certain capitalist to increase as he pleases the price of his machines. honourable member for Perth, and one or two others, labour members have given no sign of their intention to support the amendment of the honourable and learned member for Angas, providing that anv extra profits made as the result of the measure shall go to the workers, and not to the capitalist. It is pitiable that a large section of honourable members should so dread a dissolution that, at the dictation of the Minister of Trade and Customs, they will swallow whatever legislation he puts before them, even when, as in this case, it will benefit only a few, and greatly oppress the community as a whole. I was astounded at some of the remarks made by the honourable and learned member for West Sydney this afternoon. He has asserted a thousand times that legislation of this kind is beneficial only to the few,-, and makes it difficult for the man of small capital to exist. Measures like this always bring about combinations of capitalists which create monopolies, and that will be the effect of the B ill . No thought is being given to the interests of the great bulk of the workers. Now'let us see what dumping means. The Minister mentioned the case of sewing machines, and I would ask honourable members whether it would not be of the greatest advantage to our householders if sewing sold at half the present price. If , on the other hand, a prohibition law were brought into force, the present price would probably be quadrupled, to the detriment of the general public, but to the benefit of Perone manufacturer who happens to be a friend to the Minister. Even he does* not manufacture the machines, in a strict sense He of the term, but by a little persuasion he will be able to induce the Minister to place sewing machines on the list of prohibited imports. Sewing machines would be excluded merely because a local manufacturer reported to the Minister that he was being Every one knows injured by their introduction. No consideration would be given to the hundreds of householders who would gladly buy machines if they could be sold at a reduction upon their present price. I wonder whether ject if any one attempted to dump a first class sewing machine, or even twenty sewing machines, into his house. Would he not open his doors as widely as possible, and sav. "" This is a good thing for me""? If , in addition to doing that, some one were With the exception of the to dump into his house all the clothes that he and his family required, would he not be delighted? If he had no need for such articles himself, hundreds of his poprer brethren would be only too delighted to have many pounds' worth of clothing dumped into their homes. I have a paddock large enough to hold all the goods that could be dumped here from any part of the world, and I should be glad to receive them.

I would not keep them for myself, because no man can eat or drink more than a certain amount, nor can he derive any advantage from having am inordinately large stock of wearing apparel. I venture to say that the doctrine which is being preached by Ministers, if carried to its ultimate conclusion, would result in los3 to us. Any operations must result in loss, unless they are founded upon the lines of true commercial morality. When I heard the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who professes to be a Christian, speaking in harsh terms of people in other parts of the world, I felt inclined to apply to him a certain phrase contained in the Bible. WheneverI hear a man who professes the doctrine of Christianity preaching the doctrine of selfishness, I conclude that he must have an utter contempt for the great principles of morality in which he professes to believe. and learned member talking about? honourable member can wear it. I will guarantee that if the Denton hat mills dumped all the hats they made into his shop, and charged him nothing for them, he would open his door widely enough, and would take care that he did not dump the goods upon any one else without getting something in return. It is utter cant and humbug for honourable members to speak as they have done. Where are these people who are willing to dump their goods upon our markets? All my life I have endeavoured to buy the goods I required as cheaply as possible. obtain an article that is worth to me more than I pay for it, I regard myself as an absolute .gainer by the transaction. Where is the man who does not take the same view, and who does not act upon that principle in his daily life? If he carried the doctrine of altruism to the extent of utterly ignoring the ego, he would starve in the streets. Therefore, we mav regard all this humbugging talk about anti-dumping as an attempt to trick and deceive the great mass of the people into the belief that we are going to do something which will prevent them from being injured, whereas if we could cheapen the* imported goods required by them by one-half, we should double the value of the produce which we export in payment for them. Our wheat and our gold would increase in 93 value two-fold. I can conceive of the joy with which protectionists would view such a state of affairs, and how they would glory in the fact that our products, instead of being worth ^40,000,000 were worth ^80,000,000^. If I could buy for £ 1 a suit of clothes for which I formerly paid £,2 , the value of my sovereigns would be increased two-fold. It is because we generally use gold as a measure of value that many persons fall into the mistake of supposing that it is the only measure of value. I would point out, however, that in many cases a workman who receives £ 2 per week i-i one place is receiving greater value than a workman who receives £ 4 in another place. Many of the Bendigo miners who went over to Western Australia found that they were better off in Bendigo with £ 2 a week than they were at Cue or similar places with £ 4 per week. Under the dumping provisions of the Bill, it is proposed to stoD the importation of certain goods. Unfortunately, as the B ill stands, it will be within the power of the Minister to take the initiative. That is the principle of which I complain more bitterly than of anything else. The Minister, through the Comptroller-General, will set the law in motion. Of course, we are told that the Comptroller-General"" when he has reason to believe,"" will take action. That means that he will have reason to believe when he is told by the Minister that certain action is necessary. The Minister in his turn will ""have reason to believe "" when a friend of his conies along and tells him that it is necessary to exclude certain goods. The Minister beIfI that the harvesters that were being.imported from Canada were being .greatlv undervalued. So strong was he in this belief that he declined to credit the reports of the Canadian Minister, the sworn invoices which indicated that £ 3 6 or £ 3 7 was a fair valuation, and also the evidence of his own officer, Mr Smart.

I might illustrate the position by reference to what occurred when we were dealing with the subject of the duty upon blankets, and an attempt was made to impose aheavy duty. aware that at the time the supply of blankets in Australia was so short that the manufacturers were unable to meet the demand, and, though mills were working f u l l time and overtime, they were obliged in many cases to forfeit a certain amount of money because they were unable to f u l f i l so termed because they are sound and solid their contracts.

I ask for the name of one man in Great Britain or in America who wants to dump goods in Australia? I should be prepared to pay the duty in every case, provided I were not asked for anything more.

Are we never to conHonorable members should remember that, according as a The amendment is man pays less for some articles he requires, he has the more to spend in the purchase of other articles. The result of cheap production in the one line is to increase the demand for labour for production in other lines. Instances of this are numerous. We ""have only to look at the development which has taken place in the last seventy or eighty years, during which the rise in wages has been one hundred-fold, and the price of the general run of articles, that is to say, the cost of living, has decreased by nearly one-half. Let honourable members consider what an enormous difference that has made to the great mass of the people. After all, I presume that it is not intended to apply these so-called a'nti-dumping provisions unless goods are brought in in great profusion. If goods are imported in that way it will be only because they are largely demanded, and because the mass of the people use them. That is so self-evident that one feels rather pained -to have to repeat it so often. The necessity for doing so can Honourable members may not be only be attributed to the absence of study of a few simple economical principles, which after all are only called economic laws because they are the result of the experience of mankind.

His idea has always been rather to increase duties against the foreigner, than to lower duties as against England; in fact, to practice another fraud on the public.

The honourable gentleman has been Prime Minister now for twelve months, and yet he is not one whit further advanced, and there is not much hope of anything in this direction for him.

The treatment we receive from England is beneficial to England herself, because under her present policy, she has prospered more than any similar country in the world. due to the spirit of freedom; and the nation which most freely trades with us, is the nation in regard to which we might deservedly make a favorable exception. If the Attorney-General. is correct that these clauses will not often be applied, there is all the more reason for accepting the amendment. On the other hand, if the clauses are meant to be largely applied, there is ground for exemption in favour of British manufacturers. We derive great benefit from the fact that the mantle of the British Empire is thrown over usi; but for that protection we could not have carried out some of our legislation in regard to aliens.

That is an appeal that will never be made in vain to me; I have always recognised the deep debt of gratitude we owe to the mother country. But I cannot see that on the present occasion there is any justification for .such an appeal on the part of the honourable member to anv one who, like myself, is truly patriotic. British products. interjection for the honourable member for Laanecoorie. have any impertinent interjections. When the honourable member for North Sydney was speaking, I interjected because he was If the power proposed be given making statements which I thought very remarkable from one who is regarded, and correctly so, as a commercial authority. The honourable member desired to point out that certain products sent to England from Australia had a prejudicial effect on the British producer, in driving him out of his That is all own home market. The honourable member gave several instances, and I challenged him on one, namely, the butter industry. We realize that Australia and other parts of the Empire have done a great deal in supplying the wants of British consumers in this particular article. But I do not think the honourable member for North Sydney was justified in his statement that the Australian butter-maker is thrusting the English butter-maker out of his home market. I have since consulted the last returns. was that the returns showed that that was not entirely so. Trade, of course, does not lection, the honourable member said at first ""wholly,"" and then ""almost."" On consulting the last return presented to both Houses of Parliament in the old country, I find that the quantity of butter sent from the British Possessions as a wholeI am dealing not only with Australian butter, because I take it that the matter really affects the whole of the Possessions of the mother country, and that it has a direct bearing on the ratio of the amount sent from European countries-wa s in 1901 631.985 cwt.; whilst the quantity sent from foreign countries was 3,070,905. In 1902the quantity sent from British Possessions was 525,035 cwt, and from foreign countries 3,449,898 cwt. In 1903 the quantity sent from British Possessions was 557,828^ cwt., and from foreign countries 3,502,866.

In 1904 the importations of butter from British Possessions ran up to 1,045,758 cwt., and from foreign countries the imports fell to 3,195,207 cwt. There was an increase of imports from British Possessions, and a relative decrease of imports from foreign countries. In 1905 the imports from British Possessions totalled 1,054,209 cwt., and there was almost a relative diminution from foreign countries-3,093,65 7 cwt.

That the House do now adjourn. sire to bring under the notice of the Postmaster-General a matter relating to the postage of opals from Australia to America. I am informed by the Post and Telegraph Department that we cannot send opals through the post to a greater value than £ 1 0 . I have been informed by the opal buyers at White Cliffs that while they are unable to send opals from Australia to America by parcels' post to a greater value than £ 1 0 , they can send them to England to a much higher value. The people at White Cliffs are extremely anxious to develop in America as well as in Germany a trade in opals. from what I am told, that they are correct a mistake which I made when hindered in that respect now. They are speaking on the Supply Bill. I refer to very anxious, however, that the American the case of a man who has a contract for market should be open to them.

Owing to the representations of the honourable member, I discussed this and other matters with the representatives of the United States at the recent Postal Congress in Rome, and I believe that our conversation will help materially in arriving at better arrangements. A further effort will be made on our part to point out that this, and other matters, might be placed on a very much better footing. There appears to be a disposition on their part now to meet us, especially as it seems that it would result in benefit to both countries. I shall give every attention to the further representations of the honourable member, and place the facts he has submitted before the American Postal Department, with a view to seeing whether something cannot be done to meet his wishes, and to supply'a convenience, not only to his constituents, but also to many other persons in the Commonwealth who desire to send parcels of greater value to the United States.
