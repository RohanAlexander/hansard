(FINANCE) BILL. Debate resumed from 5th October (vide That leave be given to bring in a Bill for an Act to alter the provisions of the Constitution relating to finance. [3.40] I have already dealt with most of the points I had in view, but there is one to which I should like to draw special attention, namely, the relationship of the problem to the development and progress of the Commonwealth generally. That is a phase which has very largely been lost sight of, but which should receive some consideration at the hands of honourable members. It has been presented to us by the honourable member for Darwin, in dealing with his proposal to establish a National Postal Bank for the arrangement of the proper financing of Government business, both here and in the Old World; and though it is of vital concern to the welfare of the Commonwealth, it has been, as I say, largely lost sight of in the negotiations between the Commonwealth and the States, and in the agreement placed before us. I do not intend to deal with the matter as fully as I at the outset proposed; but I desire to emphasize the fact that at present, and for some considerable time past, the Commonwealth has been at a standstill in regard to population. It matters not what the mineral wealth or other natural productiveness of the country may be, there must be population for the development of that wealth and for the purposes of defence, so that we may be able to take our stand amongst the peoples of the world. It would help very much to make my remarks clear, and save 'time, if I had permission to insert in Hansard phase of the question, without the necessity of reading them. see the statements. tabulated statement relates to settlement and agricultural development in New South Wales; and it shows that 49,901,837 acres of alienated rural lands are held by 81,732 settlers, but that of that total acreage only 2,362,590 acres are actually under cultivation, the rest being simply held for grazing purposes. If we desire to determine the extent of agricultural development we must have regard to the small holders. Of small holdings, from 1 acre up to 1,000 acres of rural land, there are in New South Wales 74,824, representing 91.54 per cent, of the total holders, and of the 12,120,462 acres out of the 49,000,000 odd, held by these settlers, 1,379,739 acres, or 44.29 per cent, are cultivated. able member connect his remarks with the question, before us? connect my remarks with the proposal for a State Bank as a means of controlling and managing loans and other financial business, all of which bears intimately on the problem before us. the connection. by settlement that we can develop our territory, and bring about those conditions of progress which will help us in providing for those claims which are pressed on us by the proposal of the Government. I desire to show that the Government proposal, instead of furthering development, tends in the other direction. ber has a perfect right to allude to the means by which the amount it is desired to raise should be raised by the Commonwealth, but I do not think he is justified in going into the land question in the way he apparently is now doing. spectfully to your ruling. Mr Speaker, but it seems to me that the phase which I am endeavouring to present has an important bearing on the question. Without population it is impossible to impose",15,Battalion Senior Cadets

In that scheme we have also relationship. Thirdly, the Braddon section a means of overcoming the land settlement was finally placed in the Constitution as a problem, which lies at the very basis of temporary expedient only, to assist the all these arrangements. I commend the honStates to adjust themselves to the altered orable member for the able manner in which financial conditions brought about by Fedhe has dealt with the subject. Throughout eration.

Fourthly, the percentage of cases the amount applied Government proposal, whilst it is a colorfor has been reduced. That is a phase able imitation of the scheme devised by the of the question which deserves the Brisbane Labour Conference in 1908, deearnest consideration of the House, beparts from it in some vital respects, and to cause it lies behind the problem which that extent is objectionable and much less we have before us, and its settlement will acceptable to the taxpayers and to all mean a better solution of that problem. patriotic Australians.

31,Mr Thomas Brown,"I shall dealSixthly, the Constitution provides for the Commonwealth taking over, consolidating, and handling the State debts as a national concern. of such a scheme are evident and far-reaching. The debts problem can best be dealt with by making the distribution of Federal surpluses a factor in its solution, but the Government proposals are in the nature of a divorcement between the disposal of the Federal surplus and the treatment of the State debts. In view of the fact that the States have maturing loans totalling ,£79,868,450 to meet within the next ten years, or ^127,607,243 within the next fifteen years, the urgency of Federal treatment of these allied questions, and the unwisdom of the Government's proposals, is manifest. Seventhly, the Brisbane Labour Conference contemplated the establishment of a national bank under joint Federal and State control to conserve the people's earnof the proposed amendment in the Conings, to deal with Government financial arrangements, including the handling of national debts, and to provide for the development of the agricultural and industrial life of the community. For this purpose it expressed approval of the national postal banking scheme proposed by one of its members, the honoraible member for Darwin. The Government proposals contemplate no change in present antiquated methods of handling financial arrangements, nor do they appear to favour the establishment of a national bank. Eighthly, the proposal for the embodiment in the Constitution of the Government's scheme is open to very strong objections. We have a total population of 4,275,306 souls in the Commonwealth, and under the Government proposals, if this scheme were afterwards to come, up for modification or reconsideration, it would be possible, under the referendum provisions of the Constitution, for 213,271 persons out of that total to nullify the wishes of the majority. In other words, 2,096,357 voters in the Commonwealth would have to submit to the will of 213,271 of their brethren. And finally, the Government proposals are a negation of Australian nationhood in that they sacrifice the Commonwealth interests to State advantages, which can be equally well provided for in other directions. The great national questions of Defence, an adequate system of old-age oensions, Northern Territory acquisition and development, trans-continental railways, "" All Red"" cable services within the reach of the people, post and telegraph development, and a Commonwealth system of penny postage, the establishment and equipment of the Federal Capital site as The advantages provided for in the Constitution, and the hundred-and-one avenues of national activities committed to the Commonwealth, these are all sacrificed by this Fusion Government on the' shrine of State needs, and only come, in for consideration after the States have drawn from Commonwealth taxation sources 25s. per capita of their population for purely State purposes. I desire the fair and equitable distribution of any surplus revenue that the Commonwealth may have. But the solution of this question requires the consideration of the State indebtedness, and the important banking scheme of the honourable member for Darwin should not be left out of account. The House will make a very grave mistake if it votes for the insertion stitution. The interests of both the Commonwealth and States will best be met by leaving the Constitution unaltered. Then, at the end of 1910, the matter will come up for review by this Parliament. The Senate is specially charged with the safeguarding of the interests of the States, and the Premiers of the States have to a large extent usurped the functions of that Chamber, which has thereby suffered in the eyes of the electors. The taxpayers can wisely leave it to the Senate to protect the special interests of the States. Of course, the representations of the Premiers will have fair consideration. In the end, both the Commonwealth and the State Parliaments have to. appeal to the same set of electors. If we provide for an elastic adjustment of the finances, much friction, trouble, and difficulty will be avoided, and therefore, while I shall be prepared to reasonably meet State needs, the proposal to embody the agreement in the Constitution will have my strongest opposition. not my intention to make a speech, or to deal with the merits or demerits of the Financial Agreement at this stage, but in view of the denials of the members of the Opposition that the scheme which has been proposed is largely on the lines of that adopted by the Brisbane Labour Conference of 1908, I think it well to,quote from a recent speech made by the Leader of the Queensland Labour party in the local Legislature.

In view of the increase in population, and of deductions 'which have to be made in consequence of legislation passed since, I am gratified to find that the figures I submitted coincide -remarkably with the proposal now before us. I went on to sayThe proposed method will admit of an arrangement for an automatic re-adjustment at any period or periods if rendered necessary by nny considerable change in the incidence of the population in the States or of the revenue derived from Customs and Excise. I , therefore, felt then, as I feel now, that it is undesirable for the Commonwealth to be what has been described as "" leg-roped "" and that there ought to be an automatic reconsideration of the situation, not only in the interests of the Commonwealth, but also in the interests of the States. people; the honourable member for Darwin, the honourable member for Dalley, and myself, are as much interested in securing an equitable arrangement for the States as we are in securing an arrangement of the kind for the Commonwealth.

The Ministry, with their wider knowledge, may feel that a referendum is absolutely necessary, seeing that they are in possession of the views of the various State Premiers; but I think there is a middle course which would relieve much of the existing difficulty, and enable the whole of this House -becaus e it is not a party question, but rather a family matter, concerning our own brothers and sisters-to come to an agreement universally acceptable. So far as I can gather, the amount of 25s. per head is not a serious matter of contention, but only the period for which the payment shall last. I think the Prime Minister succeeded in making a very excellent agreement in the interests of the Commonwealth, so far as the amount is concerned. I do not say that I can follow or admit the arguments in support of the general objections to the perpetuity of the agreement, based on certain inferences from what the Tariff is likely to produce in the future. These inferences may or may not be correct; but, after having been in intimate touch with a number of gentlemen, who have come from the Old Land and various parts of the Empire, to confer on matters commercial, I think that we are on the eve of an entirely new development. The great newspapers of Great Britain are taking a closer interest in our affairs, and, for the first time, those at Home are enabled, from personal contact, to understand our position. The representatives at the Conference of the Chambers of Commerce are going Home full of hope for the future of Australia, ready to tell every one that we really do not understand the possibilities of the country. I think that if the agreement able way. were limited to, say, the next ten years, we shall in that period have a development which will'surprise us all. There is much more that I should like to say, but I feel that I am unequal to the task. I repeat that if the Government insist on their scheme, I have so little apprehension that eventually the fair thing will.not be done, that, whatever the consequences, I am prepared to follow them; but, honestly, I think it would be a good thing if we could present a united front to the States. ten years ! but let us present a united front, and come A request was made at the time that the to an understanding acceptable to all. Honourable members will understand that I am making the suggestion rather by way of preference than by way of any opposition or obstruction to the attitude of the Government. ber for Calare quoted some tabulated figures, which he has since submitted to me with a view to their insertion in Hansard. The honourable member quoted nearly the whole of the tables, and, in accordance with the usual practice, I have to inform the House that I have given permission for their publication. -A t this stage of a most interesting debate, there is but little new that can be added, and I should not have spoken but for the fact that, as a former Treasurer, I naturally took a great interest in the financial question, and submitted a scheme which the then Prime Minister regarded as equitable, and which I thought would have been accepted by the States. I shall not, I think, take' more than an hour in placing before honourable members reasons why I ( formed that opinion. I went with the then Prime Minister to the Premiers' Conference in full expectation of good results. First, let me say that, in my opinion, it is an unfortunate coincidence that this question should be discussed on the eve of an election, because I know that that fact, whether intentionally or not, has had some effect on the minds of some honourable members. It is not wise to have a matter of this kind made a party question, but, in view of its importance, not only to the Commonwealth, but to the States, I unhesitatingly say that it would be little' short of criminal if the question were decided on party lines, because it is one that should be disposed of in a fair and reasonof day ! Sir WILLIA M LYNE -The proposed agreement was not made in the full light of day, and I regard that as most unwise. The Conference would have acted wisely it it had determined to admit the press, in order that the whole of its deliberations might take place in public.

50,Mr Hutchison,"And in the full lightConference should be open to the public, and I considered that it was a reasonable one. The Conference which took place in August last ought also to have been open to the public. A great deal of the discussion which has taken place on this motion has been due to the fact that honourable members are largely in the dark as to what took place. It must be admitted that the question has been ably debated, and that honourable members generally have given thoughtful consideration to it. It is surprising, however, that such a debate should have taken place on a motion for leave to introduce the Bill. If ever there was a measure which should have been discussed on a motion not for leave to introduce, but for the second reading, it is this, and probably when the Bill is submitted, honourable members will find that it ""contains provisions that will heed to be further debated at the second-reading stage. When I , as Treasurer of the Commonwealth, first took into consideration the question of the settlement of the financial relations of the States and the Commonwealth, the honourable member for Ballarat, as my leader, undertook to help me in the preparation of a scheme, and he certainly gave me material assistance. I looked first of all at the whole of the schemes that had then been submitted. It will be remembered that at that time there had been presented to the House schemes prepared by Sir George Turner, the right honourable member for Swan, the honourable member for Mernda, and the honourable member for Kooyong. orable member for Darwin. member for Darwin's scheme was presented at a later stage. It seemed to me that the best course to adopt in dealing with a question of such importance was first of all to carefully read and digest those schemes, ancl to select from them any proposals which would assist in bringing about a fair and definite settlement of the problem. Ultimatelv, the present Prime Minister and I came to the conclusion that the best that we could adopt as a basis for our scheme of settlement was that submitted by the honourable member for Mernda. With the consent of the Prime Minister, I altered that proposal in several unimportant particulars, arid I think it well to say at this stage that I also received great assistance from the honourable member for Mernda himself. gested to him the elimination from it of a certain proposal which I did not think was 1>5T] likely to meet with the approval of the Premiers, he expressed astonishment, and said that it was so liberal that he felt sure that the States would readily accept it. The proposal which I , with the Prime Minister, submitted to the Premiers, was that we should allot to the various States £""6,000,000 per annum. The difference between the amount allotted' to each State and the interest and expenses due on its transferred debts was to ibe paid annually by the State to the Commonwealth Government for five years, and was to be used in payment of interest to the bondholders. At the end of the five years' period, the amount payable by the States was to be reduced to the extent of one-thirtieth per annum for thirty years, and the Commonwealth was then to accept the responsibility for the payment of interest on the debts, amounting now to nearly £""9,000,000. The Premiers did not consider that a fair proposal. They desired a larger return to the States, one proposition made being that we should return to them, not £6,000,000, but £7,500,000 per annum. I have no notes as to thefigures,but the whole of the details are so stamped on my memory that I can readily recall them. I was proud of the robust attitude adopted by the Prime Minister in his defence of the Commonwealth at the Conference which we attended. I never thought more of him, or trusted him more implicitly, than I did then. Quotations have already been made from the report of the proceedings of the Conference, but there are one or two that I intend to place before honourable members as showing the attitude which the Prime Minister then took up. At the outset, we were met by a series of resolutions, the effect of one of which was such'that, if adopted, it would have destroyed the power of the Commonwealth, inasmuch as it would have allotted to us a too small proportion of ""the Customs and Excise revenue. view with the Premiers. to tell tales out of school, but I may sav that although there was a difference of opinion, I do not. think that the proceedings were stormy. The State Premiers again and again returned to the resolution to which I have referred, and to which the Prime Minister and I strongly objected.

That has formed the foundation of the prePrime Minister's statements on that occasent discussion. To show how strongly the sion.

If this agreement is embodied in the Constitution, however, it will exist really for all time. It is not likely that it will be easy Even at that time, I sounded a warning to secure an amendment of the Constitution note that we could not take as a basis the in respect of so important a matter.

In order that our people may compete we must reduce freights enormously, yet if we have no margin to go on, where are we? That was a most extraordinary statement to make. A State Minister actually wanted the Commonwealth to give the State enough money to allow it to reduce freights, possibly to a nominal sum. We know that in New South Wales nearly all the income tax and the stamp duties were taken off, and the Commonwealth was expected to pay for everything. The same thing seems to have been in the minds of some of the members of that Conference. on direct taxation if you do that sort of thing. If the States want to reduce freights and lose revenue thereby, they must find the money in some other way. I hope that is the course they will have to take in the future, instead of asking the Commonwealth to supply them with money in the extravagant way that has obtained in the past. I then saidDo you think we have no right to look out that we are financially sound at the end of this long period? . . . I can assure you that the proposal as I consider, and as the Prime Minister considers, is very liberal-the most liberal that was ever submitted from our stand-point. J say, again, that our proposal at that time was more liberal than the present one; but what commended, it, I think, to a large majority of the public, and certainly commended it to me, was that under'it we should deal with the State debts, take them over from the States, and bring about finality. I have said, on more than one [151]2 occasion, that the chances were that before we had paid the whole of the money required to deal with the debts, we would I may say that it is find it necessary to raise money from some other source; but that I was prepared, to do so, in order to have the matter settled in a way which I regarded as very favorable to the StatesI f we cannot do so, we will have to put on other taxation.

Mr Swinburne, I saidYes, as was stated by the Prime Minister, we are prepared to do that, and thought out a scheme to do it. Let me quote now what the right honourable member for Swan said at the Brisbane Conference. On page 50 of the report the following words of his appearIn regard to the State debts, I hope it will be agreed that the Commonwealth shall take over the whole. I notice that some one has taken some exception to the words "" take over."" Those are the words of the Constitution. says that the Commonwealth may take over from the States their debts as existing at the time of the establishment of the Commonwealth. AlthoughI am quite willing, and anxious, too, that the Commonwealth Government should take over the' whole of the debts as they exist at the present time, I have never been, personally, a very strong advocate of that course. I have personally thought that if we carried out the Constitution we would have quite enough to do. There is, however, a decided opinion against that view from those I have consulted in London, and those I have consulted here. Tliey all think we should take over the whole of the State debts. I am almost singular in my opinion that we might go on our way carrying out the Constitution, and leaving the forty odd millions in the hands of the States. arrangement in regard to taking over the debts as a whole at this Conference, it is, however, the intention of the Commonwealth to proceed to carry out its powers, and take over the .£202,000,000 which it has the right to do under the Constitution. The Prime Minister put a veto on that, and would not take over the one set of debts without the other. On page 57 the right honourable member for Swan is reported to have saidMy opinion is that taking over the State debts u>d the return of the surplus revenue to the States are two independent, questions. That is a most extraordinary utterance to have coi from the right honourable member at that time, seeing that at the same Conference he proposed tba*. the two questions allThey are really not mixed up at all. In the case of the debts, the State is liable for interest, and the only advantage I can see to a State would be the removal of the responsibility of providing for the debt as it became due, and also the management of the debt. . . . The two things could of course conveniently go together, but not necessarily under the Constitution. WhatI have quoted shows the opinions expressed by the right honourable member at the Brisbane Conference, and I shall show presently what his opinion is now regarding the State debts. I have a great objection to a scheme which alters absolutely and finally what has previously been in the minds of the Commonwealth Ministry, and I venture to think in the minds of the majority of. the members of this House. What was proposed then was a good arrangement, and I object to the Government turning round upon it and putting forward the present proposal. Since those Conferences were held, the Fusion party has been formed. I have tried hard to find out what sort of fusion it is, and how long it has been arIt ranged for. Statements have been made that it is to last for five years. On a question of this kind, the' House and the country have a right to know if any arrangement has been agreed upon, and for how long. We are told that tbe Fusion party have agreed to sink the Tariff question for five years. That is a serious matter, because very shortly we shall have to look very seriously to the question of revenue. However, for the present, I suppose we can only wait. We are now. asked to alter the Constitution by way of a referendum, and to bring about a new order of things. First of all, it must strike anyI f we should fail to come to some one who thinks calmly upon the question that two or three of the State Premiers who entered into the agreement now before us were very shaky in their positions, commanding majorities of only one or two votes in their Parliaments. I do not think, therefore, that they constitute a stable party to put forward such an important alteration of the Constitution as is now proposed. strengthened as the result of the Queensland elections. able member wait until the elections are over.

We have to look at the matter, in that light. I do not think that there is any need for an alteration of. the Constitution. It is competent for the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and of the States to make an arrangement which will be binding upon and respected by all parties. I do not think any one who read the debate on this motion could find evidence of strong opposition here to State interests, though honourable members are strongly opposed to the tying up of the Commonwealth by a proposal which will make it subservient to the States. In my opinion, the Commonwealth will treat the States even more liberally than it might be expected to do. A little while back, when I instituted two Trust Funds, I was attacked by the State authorities. WhatT did should have been done five or six years earlier, had it been possible, though, as a matter of fact, it could not be done under the Constitution until 1905. The result of my action was to accumulate a fund for the payment of old-age pensions. The estimated expenditure on old-age pensions for this year is about £""1,500,000, which is as much as I thought it would be. Incidentally, I would remark that many of the pensions which have been granted have been fixed almost at starvation point. I have received a large number of complaints, some of which I have brought before the Minister. should be lower under Commonwealth than under State administration. this expenditure will eventually increase to .£2,000,000. Of course, the Government is not paying invalid pensions. This and other likely expenditure must be taken into consideration in forecasting the future. The Prime Minister, speaking on the present motion-the passage will be found on page 3156 of the Hansard record for this session-said Beyond the limitation of the Commonwealth wrong. We must not allow the Commonto its one-fourth of Customs and Excise revenue wealth to become so short of money that for ten years, the question of finance was left the Treasurer will not know how to find open in all phases.

We should have to pay 25s. per capita to the States for all time, and, under certain conditions, the Commonwealth would not be able to do it, unless it obtained an increased revenue. The Treasurer stated that he attended all the meetings of the Convention. So did I , and most of us who were members of it. He said, too, that he took a prominent part in its deliberations, which is true. I believe, too, that he took a prominent part in the secret Conference of Premiers which was held afterwards, to whose methods I was opposed. He says that the Braddon section was intended by the Convention to be permanent, but I join issue with him there. During the Adelaide session, I made a proposal in the Finance Committee, which was discussed, its object being to protect the Treasurers of the States, though its form differed from that of the amendment afterwards proposed by Sir Edward Braddon in Melbourne. It has been asked, "" Why do I not stand up for the States now as I did when Premier?"" My replyis that I stand up for all their just claims, and am prepared to give them even more than they should reasonably have. It must not be forgotten that one State has received over £20,000,000 from the Commonwealth, while all the States have received more than .. £60,000,000, and over £6,000,000 more than their constitutional three-fourths.

It does not seem to be quite a fair computation, although it is certainly a ^possible result. Having looked through the figures for various countries, I cannot Avoid coming to the conclusion that there -will, at any rate, not be any great increase :in Customs and Excise revenue. There will certainly not be in Customs revenue, and we may fairly consider that there will be no serious increase over the figures for 1908-9 or 1909-10, because, in a country such as ours, where internal development, manufacture, and production are so rapidly -on the increase, the people are being supplied gradually, and will be supplied .greatly, if the Tariff is as effective as it is intended to be, with our own productions instead of with imported manufactures. With a country like this, one cannot make a proper comparison by means of the figures that I have quoted from other countries, because they are old countries, and their manufactures and production are not increasing in the. same way as ours are! For many years, the manufacturing industries in -most of our States have been, so to speak,' latent. I have been through a great many -of the factories in Victoria, and I know that they are increasing in number, and that their output is increasing; and, as a'natural result', imports and Customs revenue must decrease. I have also visited all the large factories in New South Wales lately. I know what they are doing, and I think that there will be in that State a great reduction in imports of various kinds, as the people become supplied with goods of local -manufacture. What, then, will be the result if a hard and fast division of the Customs and Excise revenue between the Commonwealth and the States is made permanent in the Constitution, in the way proposed by the Government? The result will be that ultimately there will have to be an immense increase of revenue duties, or the imposition of direct taxation, or both. I do not accuse the Prime Minister, or any other Minister, of knowing or foreseeing this; but I warn the people that if this agreement takes effect for any considerable time, it means saying good-bye to a protective Tariff. That is another reason why we should look very jealously at the proposals that are put before us. As I stated, I .arrive at a per capita return from Customs and Excise revenue for 1920 of about 33s. per head, which means, if the States receive 25s. per capita, that the Commonwealth will have only about 8s. per capita to carry on with. member looked at the basis upon which my figures are computed? Sir WILLIA M LYNE I have not, but I can assure the right honourable member that I am not making this criticism in any carping spirit. When I looked at the figures from other countries, it struck me that there must have been a mistake in the calculation, and that it probably lay in estimating that there would be a large increase in Customs revenue. I have held all through that there will not be. There may perhaps be a Customs revenue equal to vvhat we have now, or it may even go up to the figure for the first year in which the present Tariff operated, but I do not think that it will increase in any appreciable degree for the next four or five years; and I am sure it will only have increased very slightly, if at all, by 1920. Some time ago I ' quoted from memory the totals of a return showing the estimated expenditure in 1920, as prepared for me when Treasurer by my officers, and laid by me upon the table of the House. The honourable member for Parkes took exception to my estimate. At that time, I had not seen the estimate of revenue, which I since obtained from the ""Under-Treasurer. I find that I was, to some extent, wrong in regard to the estimated expenditure, and that the honourable member for Parkes was, to some extent, right, but not to the extent which he claimed. I have gone through thefiguresagain, and in quoting them now, I wish to point out that this can only be regarded, like any .other similar computation, as an estimate in the dark. I said at that particular time that it was estimated that the expenditure in 1920 would be ,£9,500,000. Since then, I understand that further increases of 'expenditure have been proposed. For instance, the Post Office expenditure will be increased by nearly ,£500,000 over the amount which I first gave. It is absurd to put down o r u v £^5°J0O0 for advertising and immigration for 1920. If we are going to do that work properly, it will cost £150,000 or ^£200,000. When I was in London with the Prime Minister, Canada was paying from ,£200,000 to ,£250,000, or more, for advertising. honourable member put down in his estimate for 1920 ?",33,Labour Members Hear Hear
137,Sir John Forrest,Has the honourable,34,Labour Members Hear Hear
138,Sir John Forrest,"Ho w much did thedown .£50,000. I felt very keenly when I was in England that we ought to advertise a great deal more, and, after a struggle, to have the matter settled and fixed for I got £20,000 provided on the Estimates, although only a part of that was spent. 1 am sure that in ten years' time our advertising will cost ,£200,000, and,_therefore, we must add another .£150,000 to the estimate. Then, again, only £50,000 is set down for further State services to be taken over. I have since tried to estimate what the lighthouses and other services that have been taken over will cost us.. I am sure that it will come to more than double £^50,000. That brings the increase over my -first estimate up to about £700,000. 1 also see that a statement is made that .£2,000,000 will have to be found for the Postmaster-General's Department. It was suggested that we should borrow for that purpose, but I strongly object to borrowing for matters of that kind. We have, therefore, £2,000,000 more to provide in the way of increased expenditure by 1920. I also read in the press a statement by the Minister of Defence that the Naval proposals of the Government would cost nearly £4,000,000. Where is The items I have mentioned would mean an expenditure of between £16,000,000 and £[17,000,000 in 1920, when the revenue from Customs and Excise duties will not exceed £11,000,000. then, can we pay 25s. per capita to the States for all time? There are one or two other matters to which I should like to refer; but I am suffering from a bad throat, and do not wish to make it worse. This question should not be considered from the stand-point of party. We should all do our best to bring about an arrangement which will benefit the whole people. Theories are all very well, but practical results must be' given first consideration ; and I think I have shown that we shall not be able to continue to pay the States 25s. per capita until 1920. If the Government deal fairly and liberally in this matter, it will give greater satisfaction to the people than will be given by the leg-roping of the Commonwealth for all time. I do not think any arrangement should be made for a longer period than five years. No one knows what will happen within that time, and at the end of it we shall be better able to arrange for the future than we are now. to settle the question then than now. all time now, and to find it impossible later to alter the arrangement. Parliament will act wisely in showing the greatest caution in dealing with this matter. with great diffidence to speak on this subject. Unlike some honourable members, I have not a scheme of my own to propound. I do not fear that we shall unduly hamper the Commonwealth by adopting the agreement. Whatever arrangement is come to must be fair to both parties. Judging from the debate, honourable members do not find fault with the proposal to return 25s. per capita to the States; but the Opposition seems to be of the opinion that we should not embody the agreement in the Constitution, so that the State authorities may know exactly what they will receive from the Commonwealth until the arrangement is altered by a similar constitutional amendment. To my mind, there ought to be something amounting to permanency in the arrangement-. The State authorities will always have very large that money to come from? financial responsibilities in connection with the development of their territories. The Commonwealth, too, will have large expenditure to make. Therefore, under any agreement, there should be a fair sharing How, of the revenue between the Commonwealth and the States. Various estimates have been made of the revenue of the Commonwealth in certain future years, but I do not pay much attention to them. So many conditions affect the revenue that it is impossible to make a reasonably accurate estimate for a time even five or six years hence. When the draft Constitution Bill was being discussed in New South Wales, the financial authorities of the State said that it would be impossible for the Commonwealth to raise from Customs and Excise duties more than about £6,000,000 a year ten or fifteen years after Federation; but nine years afterwards we are raising nearly double that amount. It will be possible, without affecting the protective incidence of the Tariff, to obtain by means of it more revenue than we are now getting. Therefore it is absurd to say that the adoption of the agreement will make the Commonwealth subservient to the States. The Commonwealth has at its disposal unlimited sources of taxation, direct and indirect, of which it can avail itself at need. I admit that",34,Labour Members Hear Hear

At some distant date it may need to levy direct taxation to pay for defence, but I do not think that that will be necessary in the immediate future. The Commonwealth possesses every source of taxation. shall not have control of the purse. 25s. per capita to the States, but, inasmuch as the Commonwealth will be able to raise as much revenue as it likes, it cannot be argued that it will not be able to fill its purse. of the debts. The moment we do take The honourable member for Hume contended that the Parliaments of the States could lessen their needs by decreasing their expenditure. No doubt the pre-Federation promises of economy have not been kept. Were they carried out, there would. be a considerable saving in the cost of govern-ment in the States, though that is a small factor in the present equation. The saving °f £ 4 ° : ° ° JC 5 ° I ° 0 0 r 0 0 a the State Parliaments is a trifle in comparison with the large issues with which we are dealing. I hope that the anticipated saving will be effected; but, in any ease, the States will need as much money as they can get to develop their resources by means of irrigation schemes, railways, and other public works. I join issue with the honourable member regarding the statement that the Parliament of New South Wales has been extravagant. It has spent a great deal of money, but the expenditure has been mainly on railways and tramways, and other reproductive works of permanent benefit to the State. member that a large increase of population will decrease the Customs and Excise revenue of the Commonwealth per capita should not carry much weight. population is increased by immigration, it will be increased by the arrival here of persons whose expenditure will increase rather than decrease the Customs and Excise revenue per capita. Most of them will be men and women in the prime of life; the increase in the number of the children will be smaller than the ordinary natural increase by excess of births over deaths. The only other question is whether the taking over of the debts should be incorporated in this agreement; and there is no reason why the debts should not be dealt with separately, or after this agreement -is passed. The constitutional right of this Parliament to take over the debts, as existing at the time of Federation, is not in any way altered by the agreement, and the proposed alteration of the Constitution would give us even greater power than we have at present. less inclined to hand the debts over. Constitution is that the Commonwealth Parliament can take over the debts without the consent of the States, if it so desire -that is, the debts as existing at the time of Federation-and , under the proposed amendment of the Constitution, the whole over the debts, we alter altogether the incidence of the financial agreement. Instead of the Commonwealth paying the -States money, the States will have to pay the Commonwealth money-the States will have to pay the difference between the amount represented by 25s. per head and the amount actually paid by the Commonwealth in respect of the State debts. .y. by of the Constitution is not carried, what then? power to take over the ,£200,000,000 odd debts at the time of Federation; and, even then, we shall have the balance in our favour, because 25s. per head would not be sufficient to meet the interest. more advantage in taking over the whole of the debts than we have now. altogether a. different question.

The honourable member for Hume rather unfairly "" took exception to the payment to the StatesI f our going on after this Parliament had taken over the debts. r If the Commonwealth takes over the debts under the Constitution, it acts merely as a sort of agent for the States, debiting them with the money paid, and, of course, the payment to the States will go on. If , however, while taking over the debts and paying the interest on behalf of the States, this Parliament at the same time creates a sinking fund out of its own money, the States will be liable to the Commonwealth for the amount so paid in respect of the debts, and to that extent the",35,Labour Members Hear Hear

On the other hand, if we create the sinking fund out of the 25s. per head due to the States, then the State debts are merely being paid out of the States' money, and we must, therefore, go on paying the 25s. There seems to me to be nothing unfair in such a proposal. have heard that proposition. debts; and it will not alter the States' remeet this year's obligations. One satisfactory sponsibility for the moneys represented by the principal and interest. the Constitution. will be that, instead of paying in London, the States will pay to the Commonwealth. I do not claim to be in any sense a financial authority; but I am guided to a great extent by the speeches during this debate; and it seems to me that the agreement is a fair one, and that we run no risk by incorporating it in the Constitution. We may alter the Constitution again, if necessary ; and we always have the whip hand on the States to the extent that we can, if necessary, duplicate their direct taxation; and if we were to threaten to take such a step, I think the States would always beready to meet us in a fairly reasonable way. I do not anticipate any danger to the Commonwealth by the incorporation of this agreement in the Constitution, and, as that seems to be the question at issue, I shall -vote for the agreement as it stands. might be concluded from the remarks of the honourable member for Hume, that it was intended to construct trans-continental railways, take over the Northern Territory, and carry out other expensive administrative works, and acts entirely out of current revenue. It is deceiving the public to permit such an impression to go forth uncontradicted. Q.uite a number of figures have been quoted in proof of various contentions. It has been said that figures cannot lie; but that, I suppose, is only because figures cannot .speak. Judging from the conclusions arrived at by those who quoted figures, it would appear that they can be made to prove almost anything. Speaking on the BudgetT intimated that I would oppose short-dated loans, and I am pleased that I did so, because I think that, owing to the attitude then adopted by some honourable members and myself, a beneficial influence was exerted on the Premiers' Conference held shortly afterwards. The States, I think, recognise that the Commonwealth has incurred liabilities which will relieve them of certain obligations; and, perhaps, a better agreement was arrived at than would have been the case, had the States representatives been under the impression that the Government could force any proposal through this Parliament, and might, therefore, be careless in regard to the revenue required to feature of the Conference is that, for the first time since the inception of Federation, the States and the Commonwealth have been able to come to an agreement-to reach finality. It is now for this House to ratify or reject the agreement; and, personally, 1 shall support it. I am prepared .to go even further and say that, if we cannot get this agreement, we ihould go to the people as soon as possible and ask them to ratify or reject it. This is a vital question; we cannot afford to treat it lightly; and, being of a Democratic turn of mind, I shall be glad to submit either myself or the agreement to the people. The unrest in regard to our financial relations, which has existed for some time, cannot be permitted to continue. Up to the present the Commonwealth and the States have been like two dogs fighting for one bone; and to this position there ought to be an end. It is only fair that the States should ask to be placed in a position of security where they may know, as they did before Federation, what they are to expect to receive from Customs apd Excise revenue. The proposed arrangement will achieve that end. and also enable the Commonwealth Treasurer to know where he stand's. He will have no trouble in estimating his obligations, and will have unhampered control of the balance of the revenue. The agreement may be regarded as a fair compromise, although I am rather disappointed that the sum agreed upon is not at least 28s a payment which, I think, the Commonwealth could have afforded, at any rate for a time. better arrangement for a term of years, but not permanently. better if the payment had been arranged on a sliding scale. 'A payment of 28s. is 8s. 3d. less than the present average, and would give the Treasurer an extra £1,829,450. On page 117 of the Budget",36,Labour Members Hear Hear

If the Treasurer's estimates of income and expenditure are realized the proposed capitation allowance of 25s. per annum will make available to the Commonwealth next year an additional sum of £2,438,440, provided that this agreement be ratified. That will not be the only gain. A still more important fact is that the Treasurer will be relieved of the obligation to return to the States' three-fourths of the Customs and Excise revenue, and that if we decided to increase taxation in any way, we should be able to do so, knowing that the Commonwealth would reap the whole benefit. It is desirable that there should be an element of permanency associated with the agreement. It should have at least that stability which is proposed. It should be embodied in the Constitution, so that it may be varied only by the consent of the people. We have at our disposal all the sources of taxation, if we find it is neceshonorable member for Wide Bay that there sary at any time to increase our revenue. member mention one of those sources? ber's leader has proposed a land fax; but that is a method of raising revenue which is hardly likely to receive my support. member suggest the imposition of duties on tea and kerosene? would favour the imposition of a duty on cotton piece-goods. We are entitled, not only to receive some revenue from that source, but to secure a modicum of Protection in regard to it. If Protection is, as I believe it is, the policy of Australia, it should have an all-round application. If this agreement is ratified, the present Government of the Commonwealth, and its successors, will hesitate to resort to extravagant expenditure, since that would necessitate direct taxation, which is not favoured in the country, and should not be resorted to unless it is absolutely necessary. I , therefore, think that it will have a steadying influence on the Commonwealth Parliament. The honourable member for Darwin has given this question considerable attention. I noticed that his proposals were favourably mentioned at the Brisbane Labour Conference, but the members of his party have apparently deserted him, since his proposals have not been very favourably reviewed by them during this debate. He considers that the proposed return to the States,' under this agreement, would be a first mortgage over our resources. If it were, it would be a lien that would make the security of our stocks much better than it is. We are not proposing to mortgage our resources to some foreign Power; we are simply undertaking to return to the States money which will enable them to meet their obligations in the way of interest. The honourable member for Wide Baytook the right honourable member for East Sydney to task for having dared to hesitate to allow the Federal Parliament to settle this question. To my mind, however, the right honourable member for East Sydney deserves all the credit, if there is any to be taken in this connection, for having made it possible for the Federal Parliament to deal with this problem at the present time, since he was instrumental in having inserted in the Constitution the ten years' limitation of the Braddon section. Apart from that, I would remind the are two parties interested in this question the honourable -the States and the Commonwealth-and that an agreement was arrived at by the people before they federated. The Constitution, which was framed by the people's representatives, and submitted to the people, was certainly accepted with the the honourable Braddon section in it, but it was only after considerable thought, and as the outcome of many Conferences, that the financial arrangements were settled, and when they were, the settlement was described as a blot on the Constitution. This has always been a difficult and complex question to determine, but it was never intended by the people or their representatives at the Convention that Ihe Commonwealth Parliament should have control of the whole of the Customs and Excise reyenue. Whether the agreement is a good or a bad one for the States, the amount returnable under it will be a known quantity, and the State Treasurers will thus be enabled to more accurately estimate their revenue. At the same time, the Treasurer of the Commonwealth will be able to estimate his liabilities to the States,, and those liabilities will vary only with the population.

169,Mr Fisher,"That is no news to theof opiniori. of opinion. The Treasurer has very definite opinions about certain matters, and frequently has the courage to express them. In fact, he sometimes shows a reckless courage in expressing opinions about other people's opinions. I believe that an enormous advantage would at once be gained by the Commonwealth dealing with the State debts-that as soon as one Commonwealth stock was created, the credit of the whole of the States would improve, and that as time went on, perhaps even the advantage of J per cent., indicated by the honourable member for Mernda, would be obtained. I have been unable to discover, from all the authorities I have read, how a gain of J per cent, would be possible, but I have always assumed that at least £ per cent, in the aggregate could be saved by the Commonwealth within a reasonable time. That saving will amount to an enormous sum in the course of half a century, and, on that ground alone, action by the Commonwealth is urgently necessary. I am anxious to press on with this Bill, but may I suggest to the Government that they should first submit it by referendum to the people, and ascertain whether they desire the Commonwealth Parliament to deal with the State debts question, and so save money for them, before they submit to a referendum the proposal in the other Bill, which cannot save money for the people? If this Bill is passed, and the people agree to give us the powers asked for with regard to the State debts, we can immediately begin to save money for them, which they cannot now save; but if the Prime Minister submits a complicated question to the people-the dual question involved in this and the other Bill-that most desirable result may not be achieved. The right honourable member for Swan says there is a difference of opinion as to whether the Commonwealth can save money by taking over the debts was a difference of opinion on that point. I said it was a matter of opinion whether it was useless for the Commonwealth to take over only £200,000,000 worth, instead of waiting to take over £247,000,000 worth. greatest advantage would accrue to the people through the Commonwealth taking over the whole, and not a portion, of the State debts j because, if we took over only a portion, we should have no controlling or guiding powers as regards future borrowing. orable member's view in regard to future borrowing ? in some degree by an authority appointed by this Parliament. power under the Constitution. do not think, as a layman, that we can prevent the States from borrowing; but we do not need plenary powers in a matter of that kind. If the Commonwealth improved the aggregate credit of the States, the people would soon demand that the State Governments should negotiate their loans through .the cheapest medium, which would be the Commonwealth. I am not one of those who declare that the States should be prevented from doing what they can do better than the Commonwealth. A little experience would soon show that the Commonwealth is the best authority to manage the renewal and conversion of the State debts, and the issue of future loans j and then the common sense of the electors will speedily compel the. States to borrow only through the Commonwealth, or through the body which the Commonwealth sets up. Does not that support my argument that the first duty of the Government is to proceed with this amendment of the Constitution before they put before the people the question of the distribution of the revenue? from the Treasurer. The honourable member for Moreton, one of the Treasurer's own followers, lauds the action of the Government in proposing tofixin the Constitution for all time a return of 25s. per capita to the States, but he also says: "" I tell the Government at once that they will not have my vote in this House, or my help in the country, to amend the Constitution with regard to the control of the State debts."" If that attitude is taken up by honourable members opposite, what position will the Commonwealth be placed in?

The money is returned as paid under circumstances that have proved futile. there is something not done by the person that is insured; and it would be contrary to all the principles of commercial morality if a man guilty of default were to have his premium returned. Besides, it might go against his interests in many cases, because the question whether the policy should be voided might be one of evidence. This is a very technical Bill, and one cannot see at once the bearing of the words. For instance, this clause speaks of a voyage policy "" a t and from"" a particular place, and that means that the risk has been incurred before the voyage started, and that, as the risk has been running for some time, the party would be returning the consideration for which the risk was taken. drafted by English experts, notably Mr ever, that under the bill of lading there Chalmers, who is celebrated in this connection ; and I hope the amendment will not be pressed.

Clauses-40 to 60 agreed to -wil l have such contingencies provided Clause 61 (Included and excluded losses)(c) unless the policy otherwise provides, the insurer is not liable for ordinary wear and tear, .ordinary leakage and breakage, inherent vice or nature of the subject-matter insured, or for any loss proximately caused by rats or vermin, or for any injury to machinery not proximately caused by maritime perils. -Does the provision as to "" inherent vice or nature"" alter the present law in any particular ? There was a ruling on '' inherent vice"" covering the case, I think, of some live stock; but, so far as I can see, the law has not been altered. If that ruling is going to be embodied in a statute it should be more clearly stated. Take, for instance, the words, "" inherent vice or nature of the subject matter insured."" In the case of Blower versus tke Great Western Railway Company, it was laid down as to ""inherent vice,"" thatThis principle involves the further proposition that the underwriter is not liable for a loss occasioned by any inherent vice in the thing itself, such as spontaneous combustion, disease, decay, or fermentation. "" By the expression ' vice' is meant only that sort of vice which by its internal development tends to the destruction or the injury of the animal or thing to be carried."" (Blower v. G. VV. Ry. Co., 7 L.R.C.P. 655, per Willes, J.). So the underwriter is not liable for the spontaneous combustion of flax put on board in a damp state (Boyd v. Dubois, 3 Camp. 133; In clause 48, however, Koebel v. Saunders, 33 L.J.CP. 310). That would apply to wool, wheat and coal. Very many actions have arisen owing to generation of damp in small coal leading to the decks of a ship being blown up.i Actions may also arise in regard to cargoes of dampened wheat or wet wool. An underwriter ought not to be allowed to be excepted from these risks. with the words "" Unless the policy otherwise provides."" policy will provide for such circumstances, but in others it will not. I remember a case in which a consignment of fruit was damaged owing to the temperature at which it was carried being allowed to go beyond This Bill was carefully or below a certain point. It was held, howwas no liability. ping company was not liable. the man who deals largely in these matters for; but a casual shipper might take out a policy, assume that he was completely covered, and find in the end that he was"" not.

It is absolutely essential, in connection witb the shipment of fruit, and particularly of apples, that the market should be reached within a certain period. A delay of fourteen, or of even seven, days makes a great difference to the shipper. This Bill is being rushed through at a great rate, and no. one seems to be giving much attention to it. The Attorney-General ought to provide asfar as possible for the assured. The insurance companies, I have no doubt, will look after themselves; but the assured, who have only two or three companies with which to deal, ought to be protected. I suggest to the Attorney-General that the scope of subclause c be restricted. [8.1] -The reason why I should be disinclined to alter the phrasing of the clauseis that it is highly technical, and that it is difficult for one to remember the points thatarrested one's attention on first examining the Bill.

[8.8] -This Bill will not do away with the stamp duty collected by a State. There is a section in the Act which protects the States. The actual contract is what is known as the slip-note. An underwriter prepares a memorandum, which is sent to the insurers, and is regarded as a binding contract, although it is not the real policy; but there is a declaration in the Act that that memorandum cannot be produced in Court. The policy itself must be produced, the object of this declaration being to prevent the evasion of the stamp laws. Clause agreed to. Clauses 81 to 84 agreed to. Clause 85 (Right of subrogation). Sydney) [8.9] I wish to draw the attention of the Attorney-General to a difficulty which has been experienced in at least one case to our knowledge, and possibly in more, in securing payment of insurance in respect of a policy issued by a company having an office but no assets within the Commonwealth. In one instance, after a claim had been sustained by an action in a State Court, the amount of the policy was not paid, and the office of the company was removed from Australia. I allude to the case of a Japanese company having an office in Australia which refused, on some technical grounds, to acknowledge a liability, and had no assets in the Commonwealth that could be attached. After a judgment had been given against it, it removed any sign of its presence in Australia by shutting up its officeI t is important that companies having business in Australia, wherever their head office may be, should have some attachable assets within the Commonwealth, The words This Bill may not, perhaps, be the one in which to introduce such a provision; it may be better, perhaps, to provide for it in a Companies Bill, as the Commonwealth Parliament is going to deal with that subject. now taking evidence with regard to insurance cases. question relates to other than marine-insurance cases.

This clause is taken from the English Act, which enacts thatWhere there is a duly stamped policy, reference may be made . . . . or covering note, in any legal proceeding. But the phraseology has been altered, in my opinion, needlessly, and the words ""or other customary memorandum of a contract of marine insurance"" added. It is most undesirable, unless for exceptionally good cause, to depart from the wording of the English Act, and, when we were dealing with a previous clause, which I thought somewhat ambiguous and unfair in its incidence, I allowed it to pass on the assurance of the Minister that it adopted the English phraseology. I assume that the English Act of 1906, in codifying the existing law, reduced the common law on this subject to statutory form, and that the words "" slip or covering note "" were taken to include, or expressly to exclude, "" other customary memorandum of a contract of marine insurance."" case, reference is made to the legal status of the ""slip."" clined to look at an unstamped "" s l i p .

Under clause 27, a contract is deemed to be concluded when the proposal of the assured is accepted by the insurer, and for the purpose of showing when it was accepted, reference may be madeto the slip or covering note or other customary embodied in a marine policy. memorandum of the contract. We repeat these words in'clause 95. from the English Act? not refer to stamping, because there is no Commonwealth Stamp Act. It is not for us to specifically protect the stamp laws of the States, though they are effectivelyprotected by the general conditions of the measure. In England, the slip is described as the memorandum of the contract. Arnould, the last and greatest An unauthority on insurance, speaking of it, saysThe memorandum called the slip is presented if the insurance is effected at Lloyd's. memorandum, but is obligatory on the brokers. If a man goes into Court, he must to the slip, produce the contract, which is the policy itself. It is the policy which, under the laws of the States, must be stamped, but we do not refer to the stamping, because there is no Commonwealth Stamp Act. Sydney) [8.33] I agree that there should be no unnecessary departure from the wording of the English Act. There is reason, however, for making no reference to stamping, because, while some of the States may require the stamping of policies, others may not. But clauses 27, 28, and 95 seem to involve a contradiction. Clause 27 says thatA contract of marine insurance is deemed to be concluded when the proposal of the assured is accepted by the insurer, whether the policybe then issued or not; and for the purpose of . showing when the proposal was accepted, reference may be made to the slip or covering note, In an early or other customary memorandum of the contract. In 1803, the Court deThen, clause 28 says thatSubject to the provisions of any Act, a contract of marine insurance is inadmissible in evidence unless it is embodied in a marine policy in accordance with this Act. The policy may be executed and issued either at the timewhen the contract is concluded, or afterwards. Finally, clause 95 declares thatNothing in this Act shall prevent referencebeing made in legal proceedings to the slip or covering note or other customary memorandum, of a contract of marine insurance. It would hardly be possible to prevent reference being made to the slip or covering; note, or other customary memorandum, which is declared, under clause 27, to create a contract, and yet clause 28 makesa contract inadmissible in evidence unlessject to the provisions of any Act"" prevent member has referred?",45,Marine Insurance Bill

236,Mr Roberts,"D o not the words "" Subknow that they apply to the measure under consideration. A contract is completed by the issue of a covering note. Goods so insured might be put on board a vessel which might sink while at the wharf, and when the insurer claimed damages, he might be met by the objection that no policy had been issued, and that, therefore, the contract of insurance was inadmissible. His remedy would be to sue for specific performance, but that might involve him in great expense. If the covering note is to create a contract, why should, it not be sued upon? seems to be to protect the stamp duties of the States; but that should be done in another way. I think that there is need for some amendment, to prevent insurers having to take action, not merely for loss, but to obtain specific performance of the contract. Clause 27 is exactly the same as section 21 of the English Act except for the words in the latter "" although it be unstamped,"" and our clause 95 goes beyond section 89 of the English Act inasmuch as it contains the words "" or other customary memorandum of a contract of marine insurance."" I take it that in 1906, in the greatest country in the world, so far as marine insurance is concerned there must have been literally thousands of cases, many of which came before the Courts, and in which .it was necessary to show a slip or covering note or other memorandum of a contract. The words "" slip or covering note "" were evidently considered sufficient. I conclude, therefore, that the words are quite sufficient for the purposes of this B ill ; and if we add anything it will only confuse the law and lead to the belief that there is some departure from the English Act, thus placing on the. Courts here the onus of determining what is a customary memorandum of a contract of marine insurance. The status of the slip note has been established after literally scores of cases; and I venture to say we shall gain nothing by any departure from the English statute, while it is highly desirable in commercial circles that there should be one law throughout the British Dominions. [8.45]I have not the slightest objection to adopt the suggestion made, because the words are only used for greater caution. "" Slip or covering note,"" in clause 27, are synonymous with ""memorandum,"" and according to the English Act they are the memorandum of the contract. If anything the words are tautology; but we thought it more correct to make the two sections refer to the memorandum; and my opinion is our drafting is the better. There is the right in England to sue for specific performance of the contract, and the memorandum or slip would be regarded as the basis; and if a person cannot sue without the policy, he is entitled to sue the company for a policy. Under the circumstances we, in effect, say that nothing in the Bill shall be deemed to take away the right to do that. The reason for clause 28 The English Act is more limited than ours, because, in England, they always think of the stamp and the revenue; a litigant may have a perfect right here against an agent or insurer on the slip. But he is barred in England in an action to recover for loss because the condition there is that there must be a stamped policy. That is, J think, a limitation of rights, because, as I say, in England what they first look to is the revenue from the stamp, while here we have no Commonwealth Stamp Act. The Attorney-General is responsible, and I do not say that he has not good reason for what he is urging; but I can find no record of any memorandum that would not be covered by the words "" slip or covering note."" "" memorandum"" has a highly technical meaning, whereas here it simply means a memorandum. words in insurance circles have a meaning of which laymen have no knowledge; and when men enter into contracts upon the basis of the technical meaning, one ought to be very loath to interfere in any way, because it opens the door to undesirable vagueness. I have not the slightest doubt that the covering note is the customary memorandum, though it may be that a cus* tomary memorandum is not a covering note. I can see no reference in the cases to anything except the slip; and, therefore, we must assume that it is the slip that is looked to, and that recourse to the covering note is very rare. For my part, 1 prefer to follow the English Act. [ -53]-8 1a m much obliged for the criticism offered, because this is a highly technical measure, and we are all very much at sea in regard to it.

[8.56] -Afte r a considerable interval we again approach the consideration of this measure, and I think that we should first of all ask ourselves whether we are in earnest in this proposal, and, secondly, whether we ought not, in connection. with it, to seriously consider the financial question. At the last general election many of us. dwelt upon the importance of the proposed transfer, because we recognised that under existing conditions the Federal Government had no opportunity to encourage immigration. The States reserve to themselves the right to look after their own lands, and any attempt on the part of the Commonwealth to encourage immigration would be thwarted by the action of the States Parliaments. We told the electors that the Commonwealth should take over the Northern Territory, and offer not only our own citizens, but white people from other, parts of the world, an opportunity to settle upon and improve it. We had in mind, not only the natural resources of the Territory, but the necessity of having it adequately occupied, in order that we might be able to resist an attack on that part of Australia by any Asiatic race. It seems to be. assumed that an-attack upon Australia would be made at that point, although, to my mind, an invader who sought to permanently .occupy the country would come further south than Port Darwin. I believe that the Prime Minister and the late Premier of South Australia, Mr Tom Price, had the interests of Australia at heart when they entered into this agreement. South Australia endeavoured to make the best possible bargain for his State, and the Prime Minister sought to do the best possible for the Commonwealth. As to whether the Government of South Australia were really in earnest in their professed desire that the Territory should be settled, or merely wished to make the best possible bargain for themselves from a financial stand-point, I am unable to say. I heard Mr Lindsay make the assertion, which has been .borne out by several honourable members, that South Australia was not very keen as to the proposed transfer, and that if the Federation would not take over and develop the Territory, she would proceed to improve it. South Australia is in a much' better position to do that than she was a few'years ago. Fortunately for the Commonwealth, South Australia has experienced some successful years. Her finances are now in good order, and she may be able to do more in the direction of! developing the Territory than she has hitherto found possible. Let us hope that if this Bill be rejected, the State will take action, and that her effortsto improve the Territory will be more successful than they have hitherto been. I am not quite certain that the people of the Commonwealth are willing that we should take over the Territory and expend upon it a lot of money. In respect of all these great questions the electors trust their representatives. They are also largely guided by the views expressed by newspaper writers, and the instructions they give through the ballot box to their representatives, as to what course should be pursued, are not always complete. I am not quite satisfied that those who have already spoken to this motion are earnest in the desire that we should come to a decision at the present time. If they are not, it would be better to allow the Bill to stand over, and not to waste further time in its consideration. The end of the session is rapidly approaching, and unless we intend to come to a decision now, it is useless for us to go further. There are a number of Bills on the notice-paper, and honourable members cheered loudly when we passed one this evening, which, since it did not raise party considerations, was expeditiously dealt with. We have recently been considering a measure which, dealing as it does with the financial relations of the Commonwealth and the States, is of great importance to Australia. . During the discussion of that Bill it has been made clear that the Commonwealth, although it has No doubt the Premier of not exhausted all its means of laising revenue, has no money to cast to the winds.",47,Marine Insurance Bill

245,Mr Mathews (Melbourne Ports),"It will take us all our time to finance other undertakings, apart altogether from the transfer of the Northern Territory. The State Governments feel that they are in the same position, and, having regard to the enormous expenditure which the development of the Territory must involve, we must seriously consider whether it would be possible for us to finance.this project. We talk lightly of millions, although we find it very difficult tofinancemany necessary undertakings. agreement is that too many conditions are imposed. to ask whether we are in earnest with regard to it. Under the agreement we shall take over from the States a liability amounting to about £4,000,000. shall not say that the Northern Territory is not worth that amount, but there is not £4,000,000 worth of improvements in sight there. South Australia has certainly held up her end of the stick very well; she has done good service to the Commonwealth in keeping the Territory white, and in preserving it from the "" land sharks."" It may be said that the fact that the ""land sharks"" have not monopolized the Territory is not a good advertisement for it, since, if the land were of first-class quality, they would have devised some means of monopolizing it. hard to do so. and the Government of South Australia have done well in resisting the attempts of gentlemen who try to make money at the expense of the rest of the community, to monopolize the lands of the Northern Territory. In order that it may be opened up, it will be necessary to construct a railway line through it. It would be useless to take it over unless we determined to construct such a railway within a reasonable time. years tangible action will have to be taken in that direction. Several routes have been proposed, South Australia claiming that a railway should be constructed from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek. South Wales, and, to some extent, Victoria are also interested in this phase of the question, and I am convinced that before it is settled we shall have some fighting from the stand-point of State interests. The desire of South Australia as to the route to be followed will, doubtless, be strongly contested. I rather question the action of that State in endeavouring to dictate to the Commonwealth the route to be followed, although it might reasonably have declared that such a route should be selected as would open up the Territory. I admit that the route suggested by South Australia is really a central one, and also that there is some force in the contention of that State that no railway canopen up the Territory properly unless it passes through, or close to, the MacDonnell Ranges. It is evident that, if there is any portion of Central Australia which is of any use for agricultural or pastoral purposes, it is the MacDonnell Range country; but, at the same time, the route suggested by South Australia is rather isolated. I do not know I whether there are any very great engineering difficulties to be overcome to the north of Hergott Springs. I know it is a great lake district, and I am told that much of it is below the level of the sea, so that it may be difficult to take the railway to the north from Hergott Springs. 60 miles wide. trouble. But for that, I think we could have arranged a reasonable compromise by continuing the line in an almost northerly direction from Hergott Springs to touch the western portion of Queensland, and then going across through the MacDonnell Range country. To a certain extent, that would have satisfied the eastern States by providing fof the possibility of the railway opening up their territory as well as that of South Australia. ber want to develop the eastern States or the Northern Territory. extent, selfish as regards the interests of our own States and our own constituencies, and, therefore, I cannot blame any South Australian for putting that rather pertinent question to me. My answer is that the railway is intended to open up the Northern Territory, but if the route can possibly be made to give access to the outlying districts of other States without interfering with the original idea of the CommonQueensland, New wealth taking over the Territory, a great advantage will be conferred. admitted under the agreement. difficulty.

257,Mr Mathews,"I quite recognise thatare agitating for other routes seem to want to take the line right on to the eastern coast of Australia, which would in no sense be opening up the Territory. I have great respect for the opinion of the honourable member for Kennedy, but his speech on this measure 'was certainly coloured by the interests of the district that he represents, although there was something in his contention that the most fertile portion of the Territory was that stretching from Port Darwin in a south-easterly direction, into Queensland. Still, my idea of opening up the Northern Territory is not to tap that portion only, and, therefore, I could not vote for an alteration of route in that direcsufficiently strong, and so continue it as to tion. South Australia might overcome a good deal of the opposition to -the agreement by not insisting on the railway going direct from Oodnadatta north to Pine Creek*. If Australia is willing to spend money in opening up the Territory, the line ought, «if possible, to be so constructed as to be of some utility to the other States, at the same time carrying out the original intention of opening up the Northern Territory itself. The line, however, must certainly tap the MacDonnell Range country, or it will not be a Northern Territory railway in any sense of the word. Some of the alternative routes suggested are rather peculiar. I can hardly think, for instance, that the individual who suggested a line from Bourke north to Cloncurry, and thence across to Port Darwin, through the country which the honourable member for Kennedy mentioned, was in earnest about opening up the Northern Territory. Another route which is of no use is that almost north from Hergott Springs, touching the south-western portion of Queensland, and following the meridian almost straight up; but if the railway, could be taken to the point where South Australia, the Northern Territory, arid Queensland meet, and thence across the MacDonnell Ranges, and on to Pine Creek, it ought to satisfy the eastern States, and certainly ought to satisfy South Australia. If we were all explorers, like the right honourable member for Swan, we might be able to form -a better judgment on these matters; but, as it is, we can only be guided by the information put before us by the experts, and they, like doctors, differ so much that unfortunate beings like myself find it hard to determine what would really be the best route. I do not want to be too hard upon South Australia, but I believe the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta is very light, and not now worth anything like the money expended upon it. ments to the contrary. it ? pay for axle grease now, I am willing to believe that it can be made payable in the course of time by continuing it to the north. It would be better if South Australia agreed to keep that portion of the railway and open up the district with it, while allowing the Federal Government to make it enable it to carry fast trains across the continent. If the line is to be used for carrying mails, a fast service will be necessary ; but, from .all I have heard, the existing line would not stand trainstravelling over it at more than 25 miles an hour. 45 miles an hour over it. ments to the contrary, but I accept the honourable member's assurance. The service on the existing line is very infrequent' at present, and necessarily a 'line which is seldom used is not kept in the best state of repair. I admit that South Australia intended it to open up the country, and did not expect it to be immediately payable. It is evident that, whatever agreement is come to, South Australia will have to keep, at any rate, that portion of the railway .between ' Hergott Springs and Oodnadatta. keep the MacDonnell Range country also. Australia takes up that attitude, but, witb all the advances that she has made in the last few years, I doubt if she can open up that country, and make the line payable; within the next thirty years. I quite expect that, if it is taken over by the Commonwealth, it will be a non-paying line for many years to come. Railways will not pay unless people are settled upon the land, and it will be a long time before there is any great settlement in that district, because it must be admitted that it contains a large amount of desert. Possibly Central Australia may be made a paradise in time to come, just as the Salt Lake district in America has been made to blossom like the rose by half a century of untiring effort on the part of the Mormons.

All the country from the MacDonnell Ranges to Pine Creek was equal to any country in Australia for cattle and horse-breeding. At present it was lying idle, because there was no provision for water supply, although it had been proved that water exists at very shallow depths, and only requires artesian boring to find a vent. Whichever direction the line ultimately took, it must be continued beyond Pine Creek to the Katherine, a distance of 60 miles, traversing as rich a belt of country as any in Australia. Minerals had been found in the whole length of it-gold , silver, copper, tin, wolfram, thorium, and other metals-and the land lay idle for want of a railway. The line would pass through the I have here a Cullen district, which had produced gold for several years. It might be asked why all the Federal members do not visit the Territory; but such a suggestion is ridiculous, because one trip would be of absolutely no value.

Unfortunately No Definite Route Was Inon The Opinion Of Men Like Mr Lind,"Australian boundary, elevated downs, well, watered and clothed with Mitchell, blue and Flinders grasses, on which are depasturing over 300,000 head of great cattle. This belt of country, containing over 40,000,000 acres, could carry ten times that number. It has a certain rainfall of from 20 to 30 inches. Lying between Powell's Creek and the Katherine, extending the whole width of the Territory, is a land with a rich soil and abundant rainfall, containing over 80,000,000 acres, which, according to the evidence we have been able to gather, is not only surpassed for cattle and sheep, but is suitable for wheat-growinga high, dry land, free from drought, with a fine climate, summer heat rarely exceeding n o degrees, and the winter temperature falling as low as 26 degrees. It would appear that there are about 80,000,000 acres fit for growing wheat, and, with the American dry farming process, which has been described to us by Senator McColl, there is opened vast possibilities of development. But railways must be built first, and then the people will follow. The honourable member for Wakefield told us' the other night how great has been the progress in the Pinnaroo and Port Lincoln districts, owing to the construction of railways; and, with such facilities, it is not beyond probability that in ten years we may see great changes, and in fifty years another Melbourne in the Northern Territory. And' I should like to point out that this great unoccupied country presents an eminently suitable field for the establishment of a military station in a healthy, productive climate, where the youth of Australia could be adequately trained for defence purposes. So valuable are the areas that, if either South Australia or the-Commonwealth desired to sell them at any time, they could at once reimburse their expenditure ; but I hope that the Commonwealth will take over the Territory and develop it on proper lines. I have no doubt that, if the measure be passed, we shall have honourable members advocating the establishment of a temporary Seat of Government in the Territory. was there the thermometer ranged from 88 to 99 and 102; that was in tbe shade in the middle of May. experienced in Adelaide or Brisbane.

It is the railways miles, at a very modest estimate. that made possible the utilization of the great wheat lands of Canada, and enabled the wastelands of that great country to become quickly settled. So it will be with our Northern Territory. Without the railways that vast countryof unbounded possibilities will remain uninhabited and an incubus on South Australia or the Commonwealth. Without railways, what can be done? Absolutely nothing. I should like to quote a few figures in reference to the wheat land in the MacDonnell Range countryThe wheat lands will be thrown open for selection at, say, £ 1 per acre, payable in 2o» yearly instalments of is. per acre; 1,000,000acres will be sold each yeai. This will realize £50,000 for the first year, treble this for the second year, and increasing in arithmetical proportion for the seven years. I hope, however, that the Commonwealth will not sell the land, but will deal witb it in the way I am sure we all desireThe production of wheat will necessitate thebuilding of a railway line into the Roper River, McArthur River, and Victoria River. An examination of the Roper River may show that water carriage to the shipping point can be made available, doing away with the necessity of-a railway line. Buti f it is found necessary to build the railway we find a distance of 130 miles will connect the trunk line with the head of navigation, through easy country, with noengineering difficulties, and abundance of timber for sleepers. This line would cost, say, £520,000. creeks, and lands of the Northern Territory. charge of the ""timber when I was there. are told that it will not be long before steel sleepers will be used for railway construction. As to the rivers, we are told that the Victoria is, perhaps, the most important, and that, 26 miles wide at the mouth, it empties into the Indian Ocean, near the Western Australian border. The proposed railway will benefit Western Australia as much as, if not more, than it will South Australia. It seems strange that the Western Australian gold-fields should be only just across the border, and we. hope that when some of the smart men from the West go into the Territory we may have some great mining developments..

In the Government Resident's report on the Northern Territory for 1908, some interesting figures are given as to the cattle and horses on stations having 500 cattle or over.

The returns in regard to a number of other stations are also given, but I think it unnecessary to make further reference to them. I hope that honourable members' will agree that the reports from South Australia in regard to the Territory are absolutely correct. Mr David Lindsay, in his reply to certain criticism, points out that the Surveyor-General gives the following clear estimate of the value of the land which would be traversed by a railway running from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek:The character of the country from Oodnadatta to Macumba, a distance of about 30 miles, may generally be described as fair pasture, comprising undulating stony table-lands, traversed by rough ranges, and intersected by numerous broad water-courses, and often extensive flats, splendidly grassed after rain, timbered with gum, box, myall, gidgea, wattle, etc. From Macumba to the latitude of Charlotte Waters, about 90 miles, the country is more open and well grassed, with salt, cotton, chell grass. It is watered with numbers of From Charlotte Waters to about latitude 24.30, on southern side of MacDonnell Ranges, the country generally comprises open mulga, fairly-grassed plains, and red sandhills, with patches of mulga and black oak scrub, and Along the course of the Hugh, and Finke, there is good timber-boxwood , gum, mulga, etc -part s well grassed, and occasional stony ranges. The MacDonnell Ranges, which extend east and west about 400 miles by 100 miles north and south, is a fine stretch of high tablelands and first class country. The climate is good, and water and herbage abundant. From MacDonnell Ranges to Daly Waters the country is generally scrubby with occasional grassy plains and rough ranges; portions sandy, fairly grassed, and well timbered along watercourses The whole of the country is well suited for pastoral occupation, and portions, including the MacDonnell Ranges, river flats .and mineral areas, would support a large population. That was the opinion expressed by the Surveyor-General of South Australia, and I do not think that there is in Australia a man more capable of giving an opinion on the subject, or whose word would be more readily accepted. Mr Lindsay points out that Mr Simpson Newland, a well-known pastoralist and public man of South Australia, writing to the press on 13th August last, said, in regard to the same stretch of countryI have traversed the country, and fail to see the "" desert."" The country called "" desert,"" in fact, contains stations annually sending large consignments of the fattest cattle and the best horses to the Adelaide market. Men and families are living there, doing well, and perfectly satisfied with their prospects and the future prosperity of the country. Numbers of cattle and horses from Crown Point, half way between Charlotte Waters and MacDonnell Ranges, and Bond Springs, in the MacDonnell Ranges, sold in Adelaide from 31st July, 1907, to 31st July, 1909. For year ending 31st July, 1908, 2,364 cattle, 107 horses; for year ending 31st July, 1909, 2,367 cattle, 108 horses. Henbury, and Todmordon stations, cattle (fat) sold during 1908, 2,962; 1909, 1,142. A draft of 52 horses from these stations, just sold, averaged £ 3 6 per head. This proves conclusively that the Northern Territory comprises some of the best land in the world for breeding first-class horses for which, at the present time, very high prices are obtainable. Mr Newland went on to sayI t is a splendid pastoral country. I see no reason why wheat and other cereals should not grow. I have seen splendid wheat plants, fully grown, in the MacDonnell Ranges. Mr Lindsay states furtherThe authorities for describing the country to be traversed by the direct route from Oodnadatta as a good, fair to first class pastoral country, fit in parts for agriculture-well-watere d (and none of whom use the word "" desert"")-includ e the following men, who have traversed the country more than once, and some who have lived in it for years, are the explorers and surveyors, J. McDouall Stuart, Cosse, Warburton, Winnicke, Barclay, Lindsay; stock-drovers and pastoralists, A. Giles, J. A. Giles, Simpson Newland, Taylor, Breadon, Harding, Wallace, Hon. John Lewis, Warburton, Chewings; telegraph officers, Sir Charles Todd, J. A. G., Little, Flint, Gillen. Had time permitted, I should have liked to refer to the splendid book written by Mr A. Searcy, in which he described the Northern Territory as one of the finest countries in the world. All these authorities cannot .be wrong. They have no special interests to serve. The late Mr timent, and help us in our national aspiraV. L. Solomon, who was a member of this House, also declared that the Northern Territory comprised some of the best country in the world, and another gentleman, now living at Mount Gambier, Mr J. J. Lawrie, who spent twenty years in the Territory, describes it as a beautiful country. Mr Allan Davison, Mr Mitchell, the Attorney-General for South Australia, who represents the Northern Territory in the State House of Assembly, and others, agree with him. These gentlemen would not lend themselves to any misrepresentation, and I have no hesitation in saying that before we are ten years older we shall hear in this House honourable members singing the praises of the Northern Territory, just as others are sounding the praises of the Pinnaroo District, and other parts of South Australia which have recently been opened up by means of railways. I hope it will not be Mr Livingston. long before this Bill will be carried, and that the Commonwealth Parliament will not allow this opportunity of acquiring the Territory to pass. fifty years in which to develop the Territory. toria a large tract of country, north of the town in which the honourable member resides, which is only now being developed, so that the honourable member cannot well complain of the lack of development in the Northern Territory. I hope to have the pleasure of seeing a railway line constructed between Oodnadatta and Pine Creek within a very short time. Such a line would be in the interests of Australia. We should then have a railway extending from the north to the south of Australiafrom the Great Australian Bight right across to the Northern Territory. I am sure that the Commonwealth would not object to Queensland tapping the trunk line with feeders, nor to the construction of similar lines by Western Australia. This is the mother Parliament-of Australia, and I am confident that it will be kind to the whole of its children. have listened with the utmost pleasure to the speech of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat. He approached the question with a breezy optimism, which shows that the new recruits of our Chamber are going to revivify our national sentions in a way that some of our older members are, I am afraid, almost now forgetting to do. The fact that this agreement is before us is a curious tribute to our Federal spirit. It is really instructive to see the honourable member for Fremantle, and the right honourable and gallant member for' Swan loyally standing by while a proposal for a transcontinental railway from Port Augusta northwards is allowed to take precedence over that from Port Augusta to the West. I do not wish at present to trench upon that subject; but I can realize the great sacrifices my. honourable friends have made in withholding their claim for the time being. I wish simply to address myself to the agreement as it stands-to the points which make it unacceptable, and to the direction in which, with the concurrence of South Australia, it might be amended.

It had a population in 1889 of 167,000, which increased to 263,000 in 1-907. Its lines of railway total 2,000 miles, running from the sea as far inland as, respectively, 353 miles, 379 miles, 604. miles, 186 miles, and 240 miles. The public railways have cost has been spent in postal conveniences, £3,000,000 in harbour works, and £3,000,000 ,£1,000,000 on the development of goldfields, £150,000 in constructing roads and bridges, ,£755,000 in the development of agriculture, arid £""30,000 upon immigration, or ,£18,000,000 in all, the whole of which was borrowed. That State is not yer connected by railway with the eastern States, so that in that respect the Northern Territory is no worse off. Neither is it worse off in respect to development than the northern part of Queensland. If the Territory be transferred to the Commonwealth, many millions will have to be expended in developing it. Instead of making a railway across the continent, we should run a number of railways inland from the coast. The Territory contains 531,600 square miles, and lies wholly within the tropics. It is about one-third the size of India, which contains 1,766,000 square miles, and can produce many of the products with which India supports a population of 300,000,000, some of the Indian States having as many as 436 persons to the square mile. India produces chiefly rice, wheat, sugar, tea, cotton, oil seeds, tobacco, and jute goods. The area irrigated there with river water is 23,000,000 acres, 7 per cent, being returned on the money invested in the irrigation works. watered from wells. As the water supply of the Northern Territory is less than that of India, it could not be expected to carry so large a population, but it could supplyAustralia with most of the productions which are now grown in India. We import over £6,000,000 worth of goods, the raw material for which could be grown in the Northern Territory. These imports include ,£64,000 worth of cotton; cordage and twine, £""522,000; £""248,000 worth of rice; £344,000 worth of india rubber goods; £'67,000 worth of wicker goods; goods, such as socks and stockings, towels [i5 l2 2 and handkerchiefs, and £[3,309,000 worth of cotton piece goods and linen. Among jute goods we import bran, chaff, and fodder bags, valued at £188,198; corn and flour sacks valued at ,£617,866; onion and coal bags valued at £12,038; ore bags valued at £17,154; second-hand bags and sacks valued at £ 2 , 4 8 7 ; and other bags valued at £28,983.

In the United States the growing and picking of cotton by white labour has been a success, and it would be a success in Australia if the area cultivated were large enough to justify the use of machinery. Mr Bottomley, an expert who has visited the Northern Territory, and knows every district in the world where cotton is grown, says that it is' the home of the cotton plant, and that nowhere can cotton be grown more cheaply than there. tralian Government make experiments which were unsuccessful? commercial scale, and subject to disabilities which will be removed by the proper development of the Territory. Not only is the Territory capable of producing such goods as I have referred to, but it could be used largely for dairying and stockraising. I travelled through the Territory, and saw the natural herbage, which is too Very large areas are also rank for the fattening of stock. To make dairying and stock-raising a success, irrigation is needed, and artificial fodder must be grown,' and to bring that about a large expenditure will be required. We know that a market is awaiting us in the Old Country, which will permit of an unlimited expansion of stock raising and dairying in the Northern Territory. The value of the imports of grain into Great Britain is £72,000,000 per annum, of which only ,£6,250,000 is grown in Australia. The imports of iriilk products are valued at £""32,315,949, and of £199,000 worth of cotton this amount, Australia, contributes only £""3,000,000.

Under this heading of importations into Great Britain, the total value per annum represents £187,000,000, of which amount Australia contributes only £10,319,000, or only 6 per cent, of the total importations reon the eastern and western coasts. ferred to. These figures show that we have an unlimited market in the Old Country for our products. They should encourage us to devote our best energies to the settlement of our southern districts by means of irrigation, and the development of agriculture generally; and they show that there will be an outlet for our best energies in the development of our northern districts in the production of tropical products, which we require for ourselves, and for which we might find an export market; and also in the development there of the dairying, poultry, and meat industries. It is scarcely the time now to discuss how far it is possible to open up the Northern Territory by means of irrigation, and large storages of water; but I am satisfied, from my perhaps limited opportunity of viewing the country, that it will not be possible to bring about anything like an extensive settlement of the Northern Territory unless a .very large amount of money is expended in the first instance on the conNorthern Territory which will in future struction of railways from the seaboard into the interior, and, simultaneously, in the construction of very large irrigation works and water storage works on the rivers. This heavy expenditure must be considered apart' altogether from the obligations involved in the proposed agreement. We should be making a huge mistake if we took over the Northern Territory saddled with such impossible railway conditions as are included in the agreement, requiring the expenditure of £7,000,000 or £8,000,000 on the construction of a trans-Australian railway in a Territory which is so far practically undevelopedI hope that the provisions of the agreement with respect to railway construction will not be varied in any way, but that they will be struck out altogether, and that when the proper time comes, this Parliament will itself decide the proper routes for the construction of railways necessary for the development Mr Sampson. of the Territory. When I consider the history of Australian development, and observe that Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia, have been independently developed by running railways from the seaboard into the interior, I see no reason why the Northern Territory should not be developed in a similar manner, up to the point at which we should be warranted in connecting populous settlements in the Territory with the large centres of population The northern portion of the Territory, from the coast to about 100 miles south, is the part which has the heaviest rainfall. It is mineral country with flats on which rice and cotton could be grown successfully. The Northern Territory differs from our southern districts, inasmuch as tropical plants can be grown on what in this part of the Commonwealth would be regarded as very inferior soil. Owing to the fertilizing effects of the sun on what we should consider poor country, tropical plants can be grown in abundance. There are flats in the district to which I refer along the Adelaide and Roper Rivers, where rice, cotton, and jute, could be successfully grown. The belt of country extending from 100 miles south of the sea-board for another 200 miles may be considered the middle of the Territory, and i.t is in this district that the rivers have their source. I consider that this is the part of the carry the densest population, because it is there that dairying could be most successfully carried on. Further south for 100 or 150 miles, we have country with a limited rainfall; and it is in this part of financial the Territory that the successful graziers are established. Here the natural grasses are more nutritious and fattening, and the bulk of the cattle are produced. It is in 'this country that the cattle-owners hold land on very long leases. It is the most productive part of the Northern Territory at the present time, but, in my opinion, must always be held in fairly large areas. 1 refer to the country about the source of the Victoria River, and extending in the direction of Cammoweal, in Queensland, the Barclay tableland. The rainfall is limited, and the district is subject to occasional droughts. Water has to be obtained 1 from wells; but the natural grasses are sweet and abundant; and, as I have said, the bulk of the cattle raised in the Northern, Territory are raised in this part of the country; though it will probably be found,in the"" future, to be the least valuable from an agricultural point of view. I hope that some agreement may be found possible, under which the Commonwealth will take over the Northern Territory, and that South Australia will prove amenable to reason in a matter fraught with such vital interest to the future of Australia. It is impossible that one State can deal with a Territory situated at such a distance from its centre of government, especially when the attendant expenditure is so great as to more than try thc limited resources at her command. South Australia should be prepared, at the proper time, to amend the agreement and hand over to the Commonwealth the administration of the Territory, not only in the interests' of defence, but for the furtherance of the general development of the Continent. adjourned.
