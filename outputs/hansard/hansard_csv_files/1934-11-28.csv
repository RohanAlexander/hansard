With the concurrence of honorahle members, I shall provide them with distinguished strangers' seats on the floor of the House beside the Speaker's chair. Messrs.

In my opinion, and in that of my colleagues, it is not competent for the honourable member to use the parliamentary institution for the publicity purpose proposed. We contend that, whatever may be alleged to have happened prior to his election to this Parliament it is not within the province of an honourable member to make imputations based upon such premises against any other honourable member. able member may not debate the question.

Honourable members have been elected to this Parliament from the period the honourable member that he is now debating the motion of privilege, of which notice has been given. I am prepared to give a ruling on the matter. ber for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) has given notice of a motion in which he refers to certain utterancesas "" blasphemous "". notice of motion which is to be placarded on the business paper, accusing an honourable member of this House of having made blasphemous utterances. If that is in order, there is nothing to prevent any honourable member from singling out others, and by notice of motion accusing them of having made blasphemous utterances, whether the charge be true or false. Thus this Parliament could be used as a vehicle for making charges without giving reasons or debating the question. If fhe honourable member for Barker may do that, so also may we, and the parliamentary papers may be placarded with unfounded charges of blasphemy against honourable members. ber for Barker is strictly conforming to the Standing Ordersi n giving notice that he intends to move a motion of privilege. In having named the subject that he in tends to discuss on that motion of p r i v i lege, his object apparently is to intimate its nature to honourable members, so that they may prepare themselves for the debate that is to take place.

The matter will be brought under the notice of the representatives of the State governments at an early date. representing the Postmaster-General inform me whether he has received any complaints that wireless broadcast reception in the Canberra and Goulburn districts, from both A and B class stations, is unsatisfactory. If so, will the Governanticipated, however, that employment ment, in view of the large population of this area, give consideration to the erection of an A class or relay station within the area? whether complaints of the nature referred to by the honourable member have been made; but the department has well under way the second stage of the programme for the installation of seven regional stations. If the honourable member will make further representations to the Postmaster-General on this subject, I am sure that when the third stage of the programme, which is to commence after next June, is being considered, his desire will be taken into account. On the 14th November the honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard) made certain inquiries with regard to the new wireless broadcasting station being established at Kelso, Tasmania. I am now in a position to inform him that the contract for the erection of the station has been let, and that the building is well on its way to completion. It is expected 'that the station will be cut into service about March or April of next year. On the 14th November the honourable member Green) made certain inquiries with regard less broadcasting station which is being established at Grafton, New South Wales. I am now in a position to inform him that the building contract has been let and the work commenced. It is anticipated that the station will be cut into service about the end of the present financial year. ber the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) asked a question, without notice, concerning the staffing of mail branches to cope with the extra work at Christmas time.

It is will be found for all applicants for temporary employment whose previous experience in the mail branch would make their services of value to the branch. a considerable number of Imperial ex-service men, who took part in the last war. have become incapacitated in Australia, and also the facts that the Imperial Government does not recognize claims for pensions unless they have been submitted within seven years of the cessation of the war, and that in some cases these Imperial ex-service men were paid a lump sum in lieu of pension, I wish to know whether the Government considers that it is fair that such men should be faced with the necessity of having to make application for invalid pensions in this country when the responsibility of their maintenance should be that of the Imperial Government?

64,Mr James (Hunter) [3.35],"When present, and at that conference the folthat, if the treatment of coal for the production of oil were carried out in conjunction with the supply of gas and electricity, Australia would be independent of oversea oil supplies, and the people would be able to obtain gas and electricity at lower rates than now prevail. All countries recognize that the success of the coal trade is dependent upon the progress made in the conversion of coal to oil. The procrastination of successive governments and their advisers is breaking the hearts of the miners, not only in the northern coal-mining districts of New South Wales, but also throughout Australia. Various Ministries have made a number of promises to rehabilitate the industry. As I remarked on Friday last, although the present depression in the coal trade may lift temporarily, the industry cannot permanently progress under the present methods, owing to the fact that fuels other than coal are now being largely used in the production of power. The replies that I have recently received from various members of the Government, particularly the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons), to the effect that it would be rather foolish to expend money for the purpose of experimentation at the present time until the results of inquiries now being conducted in Great Britain are known, show that Ministers are afraid to adopt a bold policy. Eveni f a few mistakes were made at the outset, a great deal of employment would be provided for our own people, and we should be encouraging Australian technicians, who, I claim, are second to none. Have we no confidence in them because they are Australians? It is claimed that £20,000 has been expended on experimental work by these people, but the policy of the Commonwealth Ministry is, "" wait and see what happens in England"". That is not the spirit which inspired the hardy pioneers, whose enterprise led to the development of this country. There is no doubt that a great deal of employment would be provided if tbe low temperature carbonization process recommended by Lyon brothers were put into operation on a large scale. In addition to the high cost of importing oil supplies, the Government is now faced with the cost of the dole, which is given to the miners who are idle. Last week I indicated the number of miners who were out of work in the northern mining districts of New South Wales. A similar proportion of the miners in the southern and western districts are unemployed. Dr. Rivett has admitted that Lyon brothers can extract oil from coal; his only criticism is that their plant is an experimental one, and not large enough to produce oil on a commercial basis. Since this firm can produce good oil from coal, why not give it the necessary financial encouragement to enable it to erect a large plant, by which it could help to supply the oil requirements of Australia? terprise take up the proposition ? £150,000 is required to launch the scheme on a commercial basis, and I claim that in view of the large number who could be employed in this work tbe matter should be sympathetically considered by the Government and some indication given as to the extent to which the industry would be protected against imported oil fuel. It does not hesitate to assist other industries. Many rural industries have had more nursing than any others; but what help has been given to the coal-mining industry, in which, in New South Wales alone, prior to the depression, 24,800 men were engaged ? In the other States, of course, there are smaller coal-producing centres. This was formerly one of the largest industries in Australia, and we should do all we can to rehabilitate it. The international situation is tense, and war clouds are darkening. This great world storm may break in the Pacific, and, in such an event, Australia might be unable to obtain oil for motor transport purposes. We should not be so ostrich-like as to refuse to face the facts of the situation. If, at some future time, our oil supplies are cut off, the blame will not lie with those connected with tbe coal-mining industry. Every deputation that has approached different governments has shown that, apart from the rehabilitation of the coal industry and the provision of",16,Budget 1934 35

66,Mr James,"It is stated thatemployment for our people, we have to guard . agaiust the danger of war. In such an event we would not be in a position to defend ourselves, because we should not be able to obtain supplies of oil. My electors do not advocate, nor do I , the restriction of attention to the one process. I am not so biased as to say that the low-temperature carbonization process is the best. Not a great deal is known by us about the hydrogenation process, which is claimed to be the most economic. But I do say, without fear of contradiction, that there is room in this country for both processes. Seeing that the low temperature carbonization process is already established in Germany and in other parts of the world, and has been proved to be an economic and a commercial proposition, why should not the Lyon brothers be given encouragement to develop it here? Different persons who have approached me have alleged that the major oil companies bring too much influence to bear upon governments and the servants of governments, with the result that a favorable report cannot, b'e obtained for the production of oil from minerals. that. We do not know what graft is practised. The maior oil companies obtain such good pickings from the Australian market that they would not stop at graft to safeguard their interests. We have to take our courage in both hands. Thousands of good citizens who are anxious to obtain a livelihood are debarred from doing so. At one time the coal industry was one of the best industries in Australia. It employed a large number of people directly, and indirectly many others were dependent upon it for transport purposes. To-day it is stagnating. For 30 odd years Kurri Kurri held the Melbourne gas works contract; but that is now lost to it because of the cut throat competition among the coal-mining companies for the little trade that is offering, and the town is in the throes of a greater depression than it has ever previously experienced. Those to whom I speak when I visit my electorate at the week-end ask me to give them some idea of how things are troing. The Government wishes me to take to them the message that prosperity will shortly appear. How can a man in my position hold out any promise to these people? There is no hope for them unless the Government is courageous enough to tackle the problem. I do not wish to be accused, as I have been by the Prime Minister, of never having placed before this Parliament a concrete suggestion. I have probably wearied the House by my reiteration of the request that something be done in this matter. While not desiring to do that, I recognize that I owe a duty to those who have sent me to this Parliament, and that I must fight in their interests. In doing so, I am advancing the interests of this country; because, in the event of war in the Pacific -whic h has been forecast-wha t possibility would there be of our defending ourselves if our oil supplies were cut off? I urge that serious consideration be given to this matter. The honourable member's time has expired. [Quorum formed.] The transcendent problem in Australia to-day is that of unemployment, and it is fitting that the debate on the budget should largely revolve around it. Many and varied speeches have been made, but one of the most remarkable to which I have listened is the speech that was delivered last week by the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker). After a recital of the names of certain men who are prominent in our national life, the honourable gentleman suggested that there is something sinister in their activities, and purported to make an accusation against success. Such an accusation would seem to denote the possession by that honourable gentleman of the form of psychology which would suppress and destroy rather than emulate. Reference has frequently been made to the number of bank notes which the late Sir Robert Gibson would have been forced to print had the Labour party during its term of ofiice from 1929 to 1931 been not only in office, but also in power.

I know that it was considered an awful thing by those irresponsible members who were anxious to indulge in the wild and mad printing of notes. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) particularly, and other honourable members, have suggested that the Government has been .guilty of procrastination in its handling of the problem of unemployment. .Government members also. reply briefly, not only to tbe accusation, but also to the contentions put forward by honourable members who sit on this side of the chamber. It has been said that, although the Lyons Government has been in office for over three years, not a great deal has been done to relieve unemployment. I suggest that that is not a fact, and previous speeches from this side that office of the 'Lyons Administration parts, the first of which involved the rehabilitation of the finances of Australia, the restoration of confidence, and the re-establishment of credit. Those three important undertakings were necessary as a prelude to the economic reconstruction of Australia in this, the second term.

It is the usual practice to allow at least a quarter of an hour to elapse before again drawing attention to the state of the House or the committee. last Parliament, I drew attention to the formed. A number of honourable members immediately left the chamber, which was again left without a quorum. I thereupon again drew attention to the state of the House, and Mr Speaker Mackay instructed the Clerk to ring the bells for a quorum. I regard that as a precedent. prepared to follow that precedent. There is, however, a quorum present. honourable member for Reid( Mr Gander) is to shorten the time at my disposal, because I am directing attention to the deplorable government which functioned in New South Wales until just on three years ago. When I was interrupted, I was pointing out.that the Lyons Government, in its first six months of office, was fully occupied in devising means to overcome the greatest menace to recovery in Australia and to the re-employment of the Australian people, that we have had for a number of years. At the end of the first period, honourable members who sit on this side of the chamber were able to claim that the of the House substantiate fullest measure of success had been statement.

77,Mr Hutchinson,"The aim of theI were asked to name the prelude to a world-wide attack on the problem, I should point to what has been achieved in Australia. Eirst, there are stability and sound government-government that begets confidence, stimulates investment, and sets the wheels of private enterprise in motion. I believe that a great number of the problems facing the world would be much more speedily settled if every country could achieve the same stability of government that we have in Australia. Stability of government is what I might term the prelude to any attack on this problem, and it is for that reason that I take this first opportunity afforded to me that in regard to employment Australia to welcome the fusion of the two parties forming the composite Government. It should guarantee to Australia at least six years of stable government. The question of employment is also inupon during this debate, and one to volved in any consideration of rural rehabilitation. If something can be done to set our rural industries on a firm and sound footing, to give them confidence, and to restore the purchasing power lacking in the secondary industries, something real will be achieved towards a solution of the unemployment problem. I come now to the question of trade treaties. If we can extend production, or if, by finding additional markets for our primary products, we can raise the level of commodity prices, again a real attack will have been made on the problem of unemployment. The Government has brought forward a policy of public works. It may be termed its short-range policy of tackling the unemployment problem. That the Government is in a position to embark on a real and comprehensive policy of public works clearly shows that the confidence of the investor is high. Honourable members complain that full details have not yet been given to the House. I understand that the matter is still under tbe consideration of the Government, but I am in. a position to assure honourable members opposite that a real and comprehensive programme is being evolved. I would like now to refer to a statement made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) about the employment position in different Mr Hutchinson. countries. The World Economic Survey, issued by the League of Nations, bears out the contention of the honourable memthat, within the last few years, the imE rovement in the employment position as been greater in Australia than in any other country in ithe world. A return compiled by the International Labour Ofiice also gives very comprehensive figures in relation to employment in the different countries of the world. Both publications are the latesit available, that issued by the International Labour Office being dated September of this year. The figures given in these publications show is leading the world. I now desire to speak on another matter which has scarcely been touched which I have given a great deal of thought. World conditions in all countries have altered very completely during the last 25 years. We have seen the abandonment of the old method of government, which operated in the 18th and 19th centuries, frequently referred to as the system of laissez-faire. To-day we have many forms of State control. We live in a world in which we see many new phases of State control. We have control of wages, control of output in many secondary industries, control of currency, and so on. I have often wondered whether or not in this evolutionary process this country has not lagged behind in not applying modern systems to modern conditions. No one nation to-day in the world can legislate as if it were a self-contained entity. Every nation is definitely a part of the economic world as a whole. In any plans we devise we must therefore take that important factor into consideration. In consideration of these changes can one ask: Is not some part of our Australian system obsolete, or, at least, behind the times? If so, is there any way by which we may correct it? For example, is there any root cause of unemployment inherent to the system under which we live in Australia to-day? I refer particularly to our industrial system. This matter was briefly touched upon by the Attorney General( Mr Menzies) in his fine maiden speech in this House a week or so ago;",19,Budget 1934 35
78,"Ber For Martin ( Mr Mccall) Last Week,","but a good deal of elaboration could be made upon it. I ask that an inquiry be made into certain aspects of our industrial system in tbe hope that some root cause of the problem of unemployment may be found. Take the questions of the machine, hours, and costs. I nstances of the effect on employment of the machine have been mentioned freely in this House, but no person in Australia can say authoritatively what effect the machine has had in relation to unemployment. The question is often asked: Is there any return to employment through the machine? I would answer "" that question definitely in the affirmative. at some process of reducing costs or of We know that as a result of mass-production methods commodity prices have in many cases been cheapened to such an extent that there has been made possible a wider dissemination of commodities to the masses. Perhaps the most notable exponent of the machine and its use as a factor in creating employment is Mr problem is diminishing. It is possible to Henry Ford. However, it is definite that there has been some return to employment by the machine. But is the employment which is due to the machine overbalanced by the unemployment created by the machine? My answer is that the loss of employment due to the machine is not outweighed by employment created through its agency. Does that mean that we must reduce working hours in order to lessen unemployment? We have to realize to-day that we are only in the stages of the transition from manual labour to the machine, and that unemployment will continue to increase due to the more extended use of machinery. To-day we hear of a machine capable of taking the raw wool at one end, scouring it, combing it, weaving it , and parcelling it, without it being touched by a single human hand. If such a machine is universally employed, we can visualize tbe thousands of textile workers who will be deprived of employment. We must realize, too, that as man progresses and devises new machines he also creates the data for some other person to improve them. Unemployment has been created by tbe machine and as time goes on and the genius of man still further mechanizes production, unemployment must continue to increase. Does this mean that the hours of labour must be shortened? It may do so; but can any person in Australia state authoritatively to what extent hours should be lessened? This opens up further consideration of the. costs that would be involved if such a system were adopted. No country can take action without considering the effect on every other nation as part of an economic whole. If , therefore, we decided upon a reduction of hours of labour, which inevitably would throw additional cost burdens upon the export industries in particular, it might react to the detriment of Australia. The question to be solved by us is whether we cannot arrive sharing costs in such a way as to make possible the further re-employment of our people. The next point is the problem of the unemployed youth and the excess of unskilled labourers. In Victoria the boy get boys of from fourteen to fifteen years of age placed in employment, but once a youth attains tbe age of eighteen to 23 years a difficult problem arises. Many parents are ambitious to educate their children to fit them better for the journey through life. If a boy is given a higher education he finds that when he leaves college at the age of eighteen or nineteen years there is no job for him. This is a very real problem which faces the country to-day. Then there is the problem of the excess of unskilled labourers in Australia. The Attorney-General mentioned that in some trades at least skilled labourers were at a premium. He mentioned the building industry. Here we have another phase of our national life that must become more apparent as time goes on. We meet here the effect of changes in the desires and activities of man. It may be said, perhaps, that the age of wood in the building industry has to a certain extent passed, and that the age of steel and concrete is with us. It may be that there are men willing and able to undertake the construction of wooden buildings, but not sufficient men able to undertake steel and concrete work. Undoubtedly, as time goes on, these changes, and other changes which the mind of man will devise, will affect us. Again the increased use of the machine) will tend to reduce physical effort, and this will undoubtedly show its effect in the ranks of unskilled labourers. I ask whether this problem, together with that of unemployed youth, is not in some way related to our apprenticeship system? thorough inquiry to be made into it. I am asking this and other questions, but not answering them, for I have not the data on which to base an answer. I want to know the facts. I believe that in our present apprenticeship system there is to be found a root cause of unemployment. I come now to the subject of women in industry, which was also mentioned by the Attorney-General. This is a phase of national life which has come into prominence in recent years. The employment of women in industry received a great impetus during the war. Our men were called away to fight and women stepped into their positions. When the war was over and the men returned, the women did not vacate their posts. They still hold them. I do not suggest that women should be debarred from competing with men-fa r from it. I rejoice at the degree of emancipation which women have achieved for themselves. The attainment of their independence, their desire to accept responsibility, and their proved capacity successfully to discharge responsibility, are worthy of high praise. I have no desire whatever to drive women back to the conditions of the Victorian era, when their lives were circumscribed and narrow in every respect. Rather do I desire that they shall be afforded every opportunity to make perhaps a greater contribution to our national life than they have made in the past. But while I acknowledge the right of women to compete with men, I also realise that in many instances the women have competed with men for similar work at lower rates of wages. This is probably the reason why they have come into industry in such great numbers. Here is another subject for inquiry, and the subject of costs again obtrudes itself. If ous to all concerned, for we should then wages are made equal for men and women in industry, or in certain forms of industry, then additional costs must be imposed. I realize, of course, that every large industry is seriously affected by its words, but in words that are equivalent wages sheets, and the question of costs must be looked into in a survey of this ifr Eultihinson. branch of the problem. I am enumerating these questions with the object of indicating the abundant scope for thorough inquiry into this vexed problem, of unemployment. I should like a The fourth point that I shall mention has relation to the conditions that apply in industry. In this connection I ask whether our industrial system can he simplified, whether it is too wasteful, whether its overhead costs are a substantial cause* of friction between employers and employees. Is there not some way,or are there not some principles, that could be adopted to make it run more , smoothly and more perfectly for all concerned? I consider that our whole industrial system should be more elastic than it is at present -We are a primary-producing nation dependent for our national income to a very great extent upon the sale of our commodities overseas. If the prices of these commodities fall, depression occurs in Australia; if they increase, we enter a boom period, with prosperity everywhere. When such a boom occurs employment is plentiful; but unfortunately employment on such a basis is not stable. We know from recent reports that a partial breakdown has occurred in. our industrial arbitration system owing to the failure of our numerous arbitration courts and wage-fixing tribunals of one kind and another to re-arrange our rates of wages so that they will be in keeping with our national income. I think every honourable member will admit that we should aim at a system of industry which will be stable and give continuous employment to the greatest possible number of people. Such a system would be far preferable to one that provides an abundance of employment in periods of prosperity and boom, but renders inevitable serious unemployment in periods of depression. If our industrial system and wagei-fbdng machinery were sufficiently elastic to adapt themselves to the variations of our national income, it would be advantageachieve a degree of stability which is most desirable. I have heard the previous Attorney-General, Mr Latham, express the opinion, perhaps not in these identical to them, that any stranger who inquired into our industrial system and used his powers of observation, would say that the whole thing had been designed by a lunatic. It must be conceded that Mr community in general. I suggest that a Latham had wide knowledge of the subject. He was Minister for Industry for many years and possessed a mind capable of formulating a sound judgment on the Bubject. My experience has not been sufficiently wide to enable me to pass judgment. Buti f it is a fact that our industrial system could be described as the work of a lunatic, it surely is right and proper that this Parliament, and other parliaments affected by the problem, should take steps to rectify the position. If there is here a root cause of unemploykeen analytical brain, which, of course, ment, we should be up and doing to meet it. The trouble is surely capable of correct diagnosis, and, given a correct diagnosis, there is more prospect of applying a permanent cure. The present Attorney-General mentioned some of these points in his speech, and stressed the need for inquiry into the whole subject. He went on to say that unfortunately Ministers of the Crown were so busy with routine work that they had no opportunity to make a close study of the subject. Are we therefore to leave the problem without thorough investigation because Ministers have not the time to devote to it? I do not think that that is the inference which the Attorney General desired us to draw from his speech. I quite agree that under existing conditions Ministers have not the time to devote to this problem that should be spent upon it. Therefore, I suggest that an exhaustive inquiry should be made into it by a committee of persons not coninitiative and ambition of men will nected with Parliament. If a report were made on it by the right men it would be accepted as authoritative. A report made by members of the Government, or even by a committee of members of any one particular party in this Parliament would, upon its presentation to the Parliament, become the centre of a first-class party political fight, and its value would be seriously impaired in the minds of the people. The discussion of the report in Parliament and elsewhere would tend to give a false impression as to its worth. For that reason, I suggest that a committee of men of proved standing in the community should be appointed to make the inquiry and present the report. If that course were adopted, the report would be regarded as of great value by the committee of three be appointed. I shall not suggest more than one name for membership of that committee; but there is one gentleman who, in my opinion, would make the ideal chairman of it. He is one who holds the respect and admiration of every honourable member of this House, and who, by his wonderful devotion to public life, and his proved record of valuable work for the welfare of the community, is peculiarly fitted for such a duty. He is a man with a particularly would be necessary in considering these problems. I refer to the former Attorney-General, Mr Latham. I believe that if he and two others were appointed to make this inquiry they could render an invaluable practical service to the Commonwealth. The other members of the committee could be, perhaps, a representative of Labour, and a representative of business and commercial interests in Australia who would be able from their experience to give valuable advice. I suggest, in all sincerity, that this committee should be set up at once, and that it should make a complete investigation into every phase of our industrial system, with particular reference to the points I have specified. The whole problem should be faced at the earliest possible moment. Though it may be vain repetition, I wish to say that I believe in the basic principles that underlie our form of government in Australia. I believe that the always be the driving force of progress. I would not suppress these qualities, as some honourable members wish to do, nor condemn success, as the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker) did. These driving forces, properly regulated and controlled,-are capable of doing a great deal for the benefit of mankind. If there is anything wrong in our industrial system or in the application of the fundamental principles which underlie it, honourable members on this side of the chamber are challenged to apply the remedy, and so do something which will be for the true benefit and welfare of the Australian people. This matter is urgent. Immediate action is essential. It is definitely necessary to the welfare after the interests of his company. He of Australia that any mistakes in our form of government should be rectified; otherwise anarchy and choas may overtake us and retard the genius and tbe prowas an adverse trade balance of £34,000,000, gress of man. The remarkable construction that has been placed upon the speech of the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker) by the honourable member for Indi( Mr Hutchinson), together with some of the desires attributed to members of the Labour party by candidates of the United Australia party and Country party during the last election, cause me to address the committee. During the election campaign, we were charged with desiring to rob the people of their savings. The honourable member for Griffith has been accused of suggestwho were members of the party to which ing that persons who have been appointed to positions of influence in this country are dishonest. gentleman said was that these gentlemen, through long occupation of their various positions, and the influence of their environment, have had their better judgment clouded by their own financial interests. We all remember that years ago we were told that when the present High Commissioner for Australia in London( Mr Bruce) became Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, he immediately surrendered all his commercial and business interests. It has since been proved positively that this was not so. Immediately defeated for the Flinders division by the present honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) he resumed the controlling interest that he had retained in the firm of Paterson, Laing and Bruce. The honourable member for Indi then went on to show how the unemployment problem was being dealt with successfully by this Government. The whole secret, according to him, was that the present Government had re-established the confidence of overcane to produce it and fewer men to do seas investors in Australia. I have here a typescript copy of an article which appeared in the London Chamber of Commerce Journal of January, 1933, in which there is quoted a speech made by Mr Bruce who, after his political defeat in Australia, went to London to look spoke on the 2nd of December, 1932, and this is what he saidFor the year ended 30th June, 1930, there but as a result of the steps taken, by the end of June, 1932, this had been completely wiped out and Australia had a favorable trade balance of over £30,000,000. These figures showed what a tremendous task had been accomplished . . . Faced with the heavy fall in the value of its export trade and the necessity of providing some £30,000,000 for interest overseas, Australia had ruthlessly to cut down imports and the curtailment effected was from £131,000,000 in 1929-30 to £44,000,000 in 1931-32. This curtailment was elected by prohibitions or embargoes, surcharges, and very heavy increases in all customs duties. No other course was open to the Commonwealth. What Mr Bruce did not say was that every member of the then Oppositionhe had belonged-oppose d the Labour Government's policy for the correction of What the honourable Australia's adverse trade balance. It was a Labour government that re-established confidence in this country, but it received very little credit at the time from anyone in Australia. Indeed, the policy adopted by the Scullin Government at that time, would, I have no doubt, have been opposed by Mr Bruce himself, had he been sitting in Opposition, just as it was actually opposed by his friends who remained here. The honourable member for Indi referred to the effect of machinery on that gentleman was unemployment, and admitted that it might, to some extent, be a factor to be considered. It does not need much imagination to realize that it is a most important factor. The area which I represent in this Parliament produces three-fifths of the sugar grown in Australia, yet there are fewer men employed there in the industry than ten years ago, when the quantity of sugar produced waa not nearly so great. There is more sugar being produced per acre than was the case ten years ago, though it takes less the work. Owing to improved agricultural methods, the use of fertilizers and the introduction of improved varieties of cane, the sugar content has been steadily increased; while the introduction of improved machinery, both on the farms an ! r",20,Budget 1934 35
79,Mr Martens (Herbert) [4.34],"in the mills, has resulted in the displacement of labour. The same tendency is noticeable in the dairying industry. A t one time any kind of old scrub cow was considered good enough, but to-day dairymen are striving to improve the quality of their herds. The introduction and improvement of machinery has displaced millions of workers throughout the world. I am not one of those who believe that we should destroy machinery because it is hurting us, or that we can put back the hands of the clock. Like .the honourable member for Indi, I believe that the use of machinery will be extended, but, unlike him, I have very definite ideas on the subject of workwas available with which to put the ing hours. I do not say that a curtailment of working hours "" may be "" necessary; I say that it is absolutely necessary. To begin with, we should shorten the working week to 40 hours. ""We should not worry about what is happening in other countries. It may be that if we shorten the working week, costs will be increased, but that is not in itself necessarily an evil. In other countries of the world costs are low, yet they cannot find a market for their produce. We read of enormous quantities of coffee and other foodstuffs being deliberately destroyed in order to keep up prices. It is not because the people have all they want of those commodities that there is no market for them; it is because they lack purchasing power. The honourable member for Marof money available was limited. That theory has been worn out long ago. If a war were to break out to-morrow there would be plenty of money with which to finance it. The honourable member for Indi unintentionally, no doubt, misconstrued a statement of the honourable member for Melbourne Points( Mr Holloway), who did not say or suggest that the honourable member for Martin was trying to mislead the House when he quoted certain figures. The fact is that the honourable member for Martin quoted from an official publication issued in September, while the honourable member for Melbourne Ports quoted from the same journal, but from the issue of a month later. That accounts for the discrepancy in the figures. The honourable member for Indi asked that a committee be set up to investigate the problem of unemployment, and report back to this House. Ever since the inception of federation similar inquiries on other matters have been made, and especially since 1915. The reports have been produced at great cost, but no good has ever come of them because no attempt has been made to carry them out. A few years ago a royal commission issued a report upon a proposal to establish a system of national insurance, and, according to what we read, the report was a good one. As usual we were informed that no money scheme into operation. It is always the same whenever a proposal is made to do anything which would be of real use to the people. For instance,"" in Northern Queensland, at the present time, a dangerous disease, known as Weil's disease has become prevalent. It has been proved that it is carried by rats, and already it has been responsible for the deaths of several sugar-workers. When it was suggested that active steps should be taken ""by the Commonwealth to combat the disease we were told that there was no money available, and that, in any case, it was a matter for the State Government. I maintain that it is the concern of the national government, because at any time it might spread to other parts of Australia. The disease is in no way peculiar to Northern Queensland, and might easily spread wherever there are rats to carry it. However, the cry always is, "" If only we had the money"". I say that money is the only thing tliat is made ou? of nothing. During the last election campaign honourable members opposite accused us of trying to rob the poor people of their savings. They know very well that in any scheme of credit expansion, the savings of the people would never be touched. More than 90 per cent., of transactions of the present time are settled in cheque currency. with that. credit in that sense amounts only to an entry in the books of the bank, and the Labour party merely intended to extend",24,Budget 1934 35

82,Mr Martens,"The creation of the system. The honorahle member for ludi said that there was a ""hell of a row "" in the Labour party room over the re-appointment of Sir Robert Gibson as chairman of the board of directors'of the Commonwealth Bank. I believe that a much better appointment could have been made, and that, I am convinced; was the opinion of the majority of the members of the party. However, he was reappointed, and he made some remarkable statements about what could be done in the way of finance. When a question was asked of the then Treasurer, M.r. Theodore, regarding the attitude of Sir Robert Gibson to the proposal for the export of gold, the present Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) ran out of the caucus room with his hands in the air so that the Melbourne Herald could see him; and cried that he would never-"" so help me God,"" he said-be a party to the export of our gold. "" Because,"" he Baid, "" if that happens Australia's credit will go by the board."" Yet within three months of his becoming Prime Minister his Assistant Treasurer, the then member for Flinders, Mr lion uwbs. There is room in the market for Bruce, introduced a* bill-and he supported it-with the gold backing to our notes to be exported, and he had the temerity to claim that because be had re-established the credit of Australia the export of our gold was permissible. What is behind the currency of any country except the wealth producing capacity of its people? Tho statutory authority given by this Parliament merely makes the note issue legal tender in Australia. Sir Robert Gibson declared that there was no danger to Australia in the export of the gold backing of the note issue, and that all that was required to enable it to be done was an amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act. It would have been just as easy for a Labour government as for this Government to print notes as they now stand; there is no. gold behind them. The promise to redeem in gold has gone. The bank merely gives another note in exchange. There is certainly a greater touch of loyalty about the present Australian note in that a water-mark picture of the head of the Prince of Wales is included, but debts outside Australia could not be paid with these notes. To do that it is necessary to export produce. Mr Martens. I listened with interest to certain remarks made in another part of this building to-day to the effect that restrictions should be placed on our exports because of the position of Great Britain. One might agree with that, but for the fact that the figures indicate an increase of imports into Great Britain from foreign countries, while our exports to Great Britain have been curtailed. I have suggested in this chamber, and in many other places that the only way in which we can meet our internal obligations is by the export of our primary products, and that if other countries would not accept those products they would have no chance of being paid in any other way. In its issue of the 3rd October, the Queensland Producer, which is not a representative Labour journal, but represents the primary producers of that State, published the following extracts from a book written by Lord Beaverbrook:It would be a lie to say that: New Zealand is damaging the British dairy farmer. Last year New Zealand sent us only 2 i million cwts. of butter, while foreign countries sent 3$ milboth the British farmer and the New Zealand the object of allowing producer, if we shut out the foreigner. New Zealand offers us Empire free trade. The British Government has rejected it . It would be a lie to say that: The British dairy farmer is threatened wit h ruin because of butter imports from Australia. Last year, Australia sent us 100,000 cwts. of butter less than the year before. But Russia sent 240,000 cwts. more. Holland sent 100,000 cwts more. It would be a lie to say that: The British dairy farmer is menaced by imports from the dominions. In the first three months of 1034 our import of condensed milk from British countries fell by £37,000 when compared with the same period of 1033. But our imports from foreign countries increased by £38,000. We took that sum of money from the British producers overseas and gave it to the foreigners. It would be a lie to say that: The British dominions are the enemies of the British dairy farmer. It is the foreign producers who are tlie enemies of the dairy farmer. In the six months September, 1933, to February, 1934, our imports of butter from British countries increased by (i9,000 cwts. over the same period in the previous year. But our imports from foreign countries rose by 169,000 cwts. Tlie British Government has in effect been offered Empire free trade by New Zealand, and could avail itself of that offer by diverting orders for butter from foreign countries to producers in Britain and the dominions. It would be a lie to say that: The Britisli dominions damage our pig producers. It would be true to Bay that we are buying more chilled and frozen pork-bu t we are buying a bigger proportion of it from foreign lands, tn the first three months of 1934 we took 70,000 cwts. more of this pork from British countries than in the same months of 1933. But we bought 103,000 cwts. more of it from foreigners. . . "" If you spend a shilling on Australian butter, every penny of that shilling comes back to this country in the form of purchases by the Australians of British goods or interest-payments on British money invested in Australia. If you spend a shilling on Danish butter, only 3id. out of your shilling will be spent by the Danes in this country. If you spend a shilling on Russian butter, only 2d. of the shilling comes back to Britain to give work to our people. Buy your butter from the Empire countries which buy from ua. Shun the butter from foreigners, who do not spend their money in Britain."" Effect could be given to that policy to a much greater degree than at the present time. stated this morning that the present position was due to Britain's financial obligations and its interests in other countries. As to that, there is not the slightest doubt. I have stated in this chamber on a number of occasions that the producers of Argentina receive trade preferences from Great Britain, so that Argentina's overseas indebtedness may be discharged. On one occasion the Consul-General for Great Britain in Argentina advised the British Government that, unless an army contract for beef supplies were given to Argentina, that country could not be expected to repay Britain the money lent to it. If foreign countries threaten that they will not meet their debts to Britain, it is only to be expected that in order to protect its own interests Britain will recognize that the only channel through which it can be paid is that which I have indicated. At the annual dinner of the Eastern Regional Conference of the National Savings Movement at Cambridge on the 21st September, Sir Basil Blackett, a member of tbe Directorate of the Bank of England, statedI have not disguised my opinion that in the present circumstances the Treasury have been unduly influenced by old-fashioned orthodox views regarding the wickedness of budgeting for a deficit. Sir Basil went ou to say that in normal times a balanced budget is a strong buttress for stability, but "" when it is unstable, as it a few bullock teams, but practically no has been of late years, rigid adherence to the doctrine of an annually balanced budget may have the effect, not of maintaining stability, but of maintaining instability. "" Instead of tightening up of the pockets of the governments, of a policy of cheese-paring and parsimony, Sir Basil advocated the opposite. What is wanted under present circumstances, he said, is ""a considerable government expenditure financed in a form which would not diminish the volume of individual spending."" Such a policy, he declares, "" offers the best means of constructive effort to escape from existing difficulties."" We were told by the honourable member for Indi that a committee of inquiry should be established to investigate these problems; but I contend thatosuch a body would waste"" a year or eighteen months in an effort to tell the Parliament what it should already know. Individual members have access in the Parliamentary Library to the definite opinions of the A visitor from Great Britain greatest world authorities on industrial and commercial matters as to the best means of solving our economic ills. Therefore it is unnecessary for a parliamentary or other committee to make peregrinations through Australia or any other country for the purpose of seeking advice. I should strongly object to such a procedure. It is patent to everybody that if it is now possible, in a certain number of hours, to produce twenty times more goods than it was ten years ago, something is radically wrong. Of course, this is due to the mechanization of industry; the machine has been put into use to do the work previously done by human hands. member mention one country which has solved the problem of unemployment? on the subject held by the world's foremost authorities are, as I have said, to be read in our library. Our primary producers complain of a loss of markets. On the Atherton Tableland machinery made in the United States of America is largely used by the fanners. They motor to the towns in American cars and most of their work is performed by the machinery, chiefly American, driven by American oil. A few years ago, 300 horse teams were employed on the tableland; to-day we see horses. Tractors are used for haulinp logs to the railways. The market for the maize produced by the farmers has",25,Budget 1934 35

84,Mr Martens,"No, but the ideasdisappeared, largely because tbe horse has gone out of use. I am pleased to notice, however, that, in some instances, the horse iB being reverted to in place of powerdriven machinery. The mechanization of industry has been adopted to such an extent that in some cases on the sugar and cotton fields ploughing is continued throughout the 24 hours by using the shift sugar and cotton districts, as well as in other localities, labour is thus being displaced. This process will continue, and the evil will become more pronounced. L read some time ago a book in which it was suggested that the only logical way to deal with the problem of unemployment was to exterminate those now unemployed. tively made, and that was the only inference to be drawn from the arguments advanced. more efficient and more widely used, the extermination of more men will presumably be required, and only one or two machines will be needed to do all the work necessary. That may seem a stupid statement, but it is based on sound premises. We must either provide the unemployed with means of access to the things that they require in the shape of credit, or reduce the hours of labour in order to enable them to obtain their share of the necessaries of life. To continue to distribute the dole is to demoralize the unemployed, particularly young people who are forced to live on charity, instead of cultivating physical and brain power. They are fast becoming human derelicts, and it is essential to put them back into industry. This cannot be done unless the present hours of work are reduced. before I entered this chamber I was associated with the Australian Workers Union along the Queensland coast, and did a good deal of fighting in connection with cases in the Arbitration Court. In that capacity the displacement of labour by machinery in the sugar industry was brought closely under my notice. To-day fewer men are employed in that industry than a few years ago, and not many years hence even a smaller number will be engaged in it, but no doubt as much sugar as at present, and possibly more, will be produced. . Mr Martens. policy is to be pursued it will be impossible to employ the same number of persons as at present for the hours now worked. I refuse to believe that over-production has occurred until every unit in the community receives all that it requires to live in comfort, and since there are 300,000 unemployed in Australia we have not yet reached that desirsys'tem. In the able state of affairs. Australia and Britain are the two greatest stick-in-themuds in the world in opposition to the reduction of hours of labour. Support of that statement is found by reference to the Geneva publications. When other countries have urged a reduction of hours at the International Labour Conferences, the Governments of Great Britain and of That statement, was posiAustralia, when representing the party now in power in either country, have invariably opposed such a proposal. Yet When machinery becomes the party opposite professes to be anxious to find a solution of the problem of unemployment. We have been told on many occasions that the present Government is anxious to find a way out. Al l I have to say on that point is that it works very slowly. As soon as the subject of the reduction of hours is mentioned, the member for Indi, who no doubt voices the views of honourable members opposite generally, says that that would increase the cost of production, a matter which had to be carefully considered, as Australia had to compete against other countries. I point out their that we have not the least chance of being able to compete with other countries in the matter of costs. We remember that thousands of tons of coffee have been thrown into the ocean. Extremely low For many years wages are paid to the sugar-workers of Cuba, Hawaii, and F i j i . In eastern countries the remuneration of workers is often not more than Is. a day, and in many instances it is as low as 6B., 5S., and even 4s. 9d. a week. Where do we hope to get under such conditions? How can we expect to compete with other countries? To do so, we should have to submit to much greater hardships than those from which we now suffer. Is it that there is a scarcity of those things which man needs? The conditions are so much If that better in Queensland, due to the administration of a Labour government, that many people are making their way to that State. In my electorate more than 1,000 men who are engaged on government works of different kinds do not belong to that particular part -of Australia. I do not blame people for going where they think that the conditions are most attractive. My only regret is that the provision made in other States is not sufficient to take off the unemployed market as many men as are being given work by the Queensland Government. If the provision in proportion to population were as great in New South Wales and Victoria, there would be a very considerable reduction of the number of unemployed, and the primary products which cannot now be sold would be consumed instead of being dumped. Every day one reads in responsible publications of the deliberate destruction of food that is needed by mankind. The continuance of that state of affairs will not help to solve the problem. The cost of production does not enter into the question. The goods have been produced and are available. The satisfaction to be derived from feeding tbe people is surely preferable to the dumping of goods into the sea. Last Sunday morning I was privileged to listen to a lecture delivered by the Bishop of Goulburn to tbe Church of England Men's Society. The statements of this responsible reverend gentleman were a revelation to me. Were he to make them in this chamber, the advocates of the continuance of the present system would squirm in their seats. His address is reported in last Monday's Canberra Times, and may be read by honourable members. It deals poignantly with the effect of the machine on the human family. A definite easing of our difficulty would be obtained by the reduction of the hours of labour by at least four hours a week. That would enable many of our people to obtain employment. Downs) [5.10] -The honourable member existing liabilities. The Commonwealth for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), in his promised to consider that matter and, if amendment, has practically charged the possible, to render assistance to achieve Government with undue delay in dealing the end desired. The committee had to with the two subjects of rural rehabilitaconsider the position of the farmers tion and unemployment. The Government made rural rehabilibankruptcy law, a petition presented tation a specific issue at the last elections, against a farmer in certain circumstanced and sought a definite mandate to deal with it. The problem really arises out of the condition of the farmers throughout Australia, and involves the question: What proposals should be instituted in order to give relief? There are two aspects of the matter: First, the position of the individual farmer; and secondly, the position of the farming community as a whole,particularly in relation to the commodities produced. With respect to the individual farmer the attitude of the Government was made very definite in the Governor General's Speech, which on this matter readsIn accordance with this policy, my advisers are entering into immediate discussions with the Governments of the various States in relation to the question of nnancial rural relief. It will be understood that, as the Constitution now stands, the Oommonwealth has not the power to deal directly with such domestic -matters as the tenure and financial security of the primary producer; it must accordingly act through the medium of financing existing or future State schemes. Consultation with the State authorities in order to determine the precise nature of proposals and the amount of financial assistance necessary, together with the terms upon which it should be provided, w ill at once be put in hand. Last year a committee of members of this House was appointed by the then Attorney-General, Mr Latham, to consider incidentally the position of the farmers of Australia so far as the States' schemes were affected by the Bankruptcy Act. The position presented itself in this form: It is highly desirable that farmers who are in reasonably good producing areas should continue the useful work upon which they are engaged. Owing to the depression and, in some cases, to governmental urging to increase production, many primary producers throughout Australia' are carrying on under most difficult conditions. Is it possible to devise some scheme whereby relief may be given and production may be continued? The real problem is to enable these men in relation to State schemes. It found that, under the existing Commonwealth",27,Budget 1934 35

The problem which had to be faced was the position of the farmer who, while practically insolvent, had yet some hope of success if his affairs could be adjusted in such a way that he could continue until normal times arrived. States took steps to deal with the matter. The first was South Australia, which in 1929 passed the Debt Adjustment and later the Farmers Relief Acts. object of that legislation was to enable meetings voluntary arrangements to be made, and financial assistance to be given, so that the fanners might continue The Farmers Debt Adjustment passed in Western Australia, the Farmers Relief Act in New South Wales, and the Unemployed Relief Act in Victoria. cases, the States were really menting. avenues for the giving of assistance to farmers who were in distressed stances, instead of resort being had to the extreme which in many means the winding up of a man's affairs and the distribution of his assets. object of bankruptcy ought to be the relief of insolvent debtors, with due regard to the rights of creditors. this legislation satisfy the demands of creditors as to enable the producing debtor to re-establish himself Sir Littleton Groom. law relating to rural relief. establish himself with wheat at such a low price? could order a stay who are' administering these acts have pointed to the success that has been might not be placed in the achieved.

The to assist the farmer to again become independent, to reduce his financial burdens, and to of dealing with this problem help him in preparing a good plan of operations which some farmers arc unable to do for They are themselves. The director has also been able to prevent harsh actions by the creditors, and to make them realize that "" Mercy seasons appropriate justice,"" and most creditors have co-operated They with their debtors to their mutual advantage. The object is to take some control of a man's affairs, thoroughly . examine his arrangefinancial position, consult with his creditors, and evolve a scheme that w ill assist him. The Government has found, it necessary to provide financial relief. A report that has been presented by the New South Wales Board readsFrom evidence at present before us we are production confidently of the opinion that the objects of Eour of the the act will be fully achieved resulting in the amelioration of the financial difficulties of those primary producers who seek the assistance provided under the act, thus creating a Act stabilizing influence in the affairs of the The farmers and an easier attitude on tlie part of the creditors until such time as the circumstances which gave rise to the act-whic h is of creditors to be called, essentially of an emergency nature-hav e ceased to exist.

It is necessary enacted to give those men who, under normal conditions, would have a reasonable chance of success, such assistance as will enable them to remain on the land. That is the problem, and it is a pressing one. So long as economic nationalism continues, that problem will exist and must be dealt with; but the amendment moved by the honourable member for West Sydney, which is simply an instruction to the Government to place on the Statute Book a measure designed to provide £12,000,000 for rural rehabilitation, does not provide the machinery to give the assistance which he is so anxious to provide. It is necessary to consider what methods it would be adequate and wise for the Government to employ. It was aware that its power was limited. It knew what the powers of the States were. But it had first of all to consider to what extent the States were adequately dealing with this problem, and if they were dealing with it' inadequately, to ascertain the cause for that inadequacy, and to what extent the Commonwealth could render assistance. reasonable for the Commonwealth Government to say that it will confer with the States to ascertain in what way it can help them, seeing that the Commonwealth's powers under the Constitution are, so limited. As a matter of fact, immediately this Government took office, the States were asked to submit stand that a scheme has already been submitted by New South Wales, and that other proposals are expected. From the Commonwealth point of view a federal scheme, involving the appropriation of moneys, should be uniform for the whole of Australia. The Government could not bring down to this House a request for a specific appropriation of moneys until a scheme submitted by the States had been considered at a conference with the States. That is only a reasonable way of dealing with the matter, States will be conferring in Canberra ing with farmers whose whole position next month. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM I wa>leading up to that. They have been asked to meet, but whether their schemes that legislation should be will be completed by that time is difficult to say. likely to be more successful than the/ have been in the last three years? Sir LITTLET ON GROOM I am dealing at the moment with the subject of individual farmers' debts, and in this connection the schemes which have bee* in operation in New South Wales ana in some of the other States have been able to afford considerable relief, though it has been found necessary by some of the States to revise or modify them. The Premier of New South Wales, Mr Stevens, is reported by the Sydney Morning Herald to have made the following statement at Holbrook in regard to compositions with creditors:I am satisfied that, with the provision of the requisite funds by the Government, an appreciable portion of the creditors of the heavily-pressed farmers would be willing to sell their claims upon the farmers at substantial discounts. Our first approach to the problem will be from this angle-that the Governments will provide the cash for voluntary debt adjustment in return for a cash settlement, the farmer becoming liable for the It is therefore amount paid in settlement, or part-settlement of his debts, and that on this liability he shall be charged only the low rate of interest at which the Government will be able to raise the money, plus perhaps a small amount of administrative charges. Legislation to this end has already been introduced by the State Government. We are forwarding this week to the Federal Government our detailed proposals to give effect to the plans, and I have every ground for assuring you that schemes, and I underbefore long a definite start will be made with this scheme. It is evident then that existing legislation will have to be widened in order to make it more inclusive and to provide a sum of money from the Commonwealth and States to permit of these adjustments. A voluntary arrangement between creditors and debtors will be facilitated by the granting of Government advances. heen doing that through the rural banks for some cousiderable time.

The New South Wales State Government feels that the undertaking will be of such a character that it will be necessary to have the assistance of the Commonwealth Government. Mr Stevens has suggested that the Commonwealth will have to assume some responsibility. In these circumstances, the Oommonwealth Government is not to be blamed for any delay in looking into ithe position which exists in the States, and for endeavouring to get the States into harmony before bringing any proposal before the House. In this respect, it is deserving of commendation rather than condemnation. The report of the Parliamentary comto assist in financing the State schemes, mittee in South Australia deals with a and give them a general application. most important subject.

98,Sir Littleton Groom,"Legislache State premiers together, and this problem will have to be considered in the light of the report of the wheat commission, and of the further information which will be contained in reports yet to be presented to the Government. The Oommonwealth has already departed from strict orthodoxy in this regard. First of all, it made an entirely new experiment in connection with the dried fruits industry and followed this later by legislation in connection with dairy products, thus rendering considerable assistance to both industries. In both cases those engaged in the industries are able to get a more reasonable price for their products. To any one interested in studying the methods of other countries, I would recommend a study of the methods employed by the United States of America under the operation of the Farm Recovery Act and other legislation of a similar character, although it is very difficult to get any decisive evidence of the result of those measures. Professor Edmund des Brunner, of Columbia University, in his book "" The Farm Act of 1933-Its place in the Recovery Programme "", saysI t is clear therefore, that the administrators of this law have turned their backs on the old philosophy of unconscious progress, of laissez-faire. They frankly declare that the law is a bold experiment in voluntary social control applied to what from the dawn of history has been one of the most individualistic of industries. The primary producers of Australia have been feeling their way to a more complete organization of their industry. In Queensland, for instance, the dairying industry has been completely organized in respect of both production and distribution. At first co-operative control was exercised throughout the industry by a voluntary organization, but the Commonwealth Parliament, by passing the Dairy Produce Act, put the coping stone on the structure. The whole industry is now working under the authority and in accordance with the legislative provisions. The tendency is undoubtedly for a more complete organization of production and distribution. We have seen the plight of the isolated farmers in Australia. I was born among farmers and have followed their experiences throughout my life. As Professor Brunner said, farming in the past was of necessity one of the most individualistic operations that one could imagine. Rut even the farmers have been forced to organize their industry. The dairy farmers, as I have said, have done remarkable things in this regard. By the application of science to their industry, they are now able to manufacture butter here which wins prizes in the great agricultural shows in other parts of the world, and which is appreciated highly wherever it is properly marketed. The whole world, as we are well aware, is in a state of flux, and it seems to me that the co-operative principle will! have to be applied to a greater extent if true progress is to be made. The Commonwealth Government is working along sound lines in seeking the co-operation of State governments, and in trying to evolve a plan of action, based on practical experience, which will beneficially affect all concerned. I come now to the grave problem of unemployment. The Government has been accused of laxity in facing this tremendous issue; but we have to remember that the many ramifications of the problem make it extremely difficult to deal with. There is, of course, the necessity to make immediate provision to relieve the existing distress, that should not, and cannot, be overlooked. I feel that the Government should put in hand suitable public works to meet this need. But there is also the need to consider the putting in hand of larger public works which will provide more continuous employment and enable our people who are to-day out of work, to live on a standard more in accord with the general standard of the Australian people. Immediate relief works should be financed out of revenue, while schemes for reproductive works are a fair charge on loan expenditure. A careful reading of both the policy speech of the Prime Minister and the Governor General's Speech will show that the Government desires to give a lead in the putting in hand of large public works which will provide employment not only for people of mature years .who are to-day without work, but also for the youth of the nation. Some of the public works which the Government appears to have in mind are afforestation, water conservation schemes, sewerage works for large country towns, more complete housing plans, and also the provision of electric light and power supplies in certain areas that are to-day without these facilities. An endeavour should be made to undertake enterprises which, upon completion, will be permanent assets to the Commonwealth and also sufficiently reproductive to meet interest and sinking fund charges. If the works are not in this category they will simply add to the public debt and so be an incubus on the people. Some honourable gentlemen have jibed at the Government because -the suggestion was made in the Governor General's Speech that additional research was necessary into the root causes of unemployment. My view is that there is room for a good deal of additional investigation. The Attorney General properly referred in his speech to the constitutional limitations to the power of the Commonwealth Parliament. monwealth Government has power to provide employment for the people in its own territories! Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -That is so; but the honourable gentleman knows sufficient about Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria to realize that it would be impossible for the Commonwealth Government to provide sufficient work in the Northern Territory and the Federal Capital Territory for the unem-' ployed people of any one of those States. member think that those people should be left unemployed? Sir tainly not. I have said that works should be put in hand immediately to provide for them. I am now elaborating the point that there is room for additional research into the root causes of unemployment I am aware that many books have s been written on the subject. Of writing there seems to be no end. But the investigation is still far from complete. The Development and Migration Commission presented a report to Parliament in September, 1928, on "" Unemployment and Business Stability in Australia."" I do not desire to quote from it, but I advise honourable members to read' it. They will then realize how intricate and complicated the whole problem is. The report deals, in particular, with business: cycles and the periodic length of deepdepression and high prosperity. There is not a complete statement of the situation in Australia; but the statisticsindicate the cycles in other countries^ What we need is undoubtedly more^ stability and regularity in our industrial enterprises, and I feel that useful scientific and economic investigations could, he made into this whole subject. Othervaluable reports were presented by the Development and Migration Commission.. If they were reviewed they would probably reveal various avenues of some activities that could be opened up with* advantage. unemployed. Sir LITTLET ON GROOM -When a, patient is sick the doctor makes a thorough investigation into his case, and. diagnoses the disease before attempting: to supply a remedy. That must be donein regard to this serious ill from which the body politic is suffering. It will beadmitted, I think, that scientific investigation has enabled man to make rapid progress in various directions. Production has been increased; transportsystems have been improved, and manynew pleasures and delights have been* invented for human enjoyment; But,, perhaps, the social sciences have not beerr investigated as thoroughly as someother branches of knowledge.

Other honourable members who also were returned to this House by narrow majorities, have adopted a like attitude. They have the power in their own hands to force the Government to do as they desire. Their votes are the weapons they must use. Personally, I do not think those honourable members will do very much in that respect. They had an opportunity the other day to give tbe unemployed people of this country a little relief for Christmas, but had to be content to let a proposal go through which amounts .to no more than a paltry dole. I know that there are many unemployed persons in Adelaide, and -the honourable member for Adelaide( Mr Stacey) also advocated Experience has that some relief should be provided for them, but he also missed his opportunity to compel the Government to do someUltimately thing practical.

They are too old at eighteen. Child labour is the order of the day, yet this Government makes no effort to improve those conditions. I myself have had some experience in tryhonorable ing to find employment for youths and young men. So bad are conditions at present that many young men leaving the universities with high qualifications The are at a dead end.

They returned to their former employment, but now, after the lapse of some years, the effects of their war service are becoming evident. In some cases their health has broken down, but they are finding it extremely difficult to have their claims recognized. I know of one man who was discharged from the forces suffering from partial loss of sight in one eye. For twelve years the department paid him a pension, but two years ago he was called before a medical board, and the medical officer stated the matter with his sight, it could not vice. The department harshly with many returned soldiers, who are entitled to more consideration than they are getting. induced to go to the war by promises made to thein by patriotic citizens, some of whom, though eligible themselves for war service, preferred to stay at home and make fortunes out of the conditions arising out of the war. The promises made at that time should be honoured. In some instances the promises were made by the leaders of the governments of the day, and it is repudiation on the part of Australia when those promises are not carried out. The present Minister for Repatriation ( Mr Hughes), when Prime Minister of this country, after the war, stated that he would make Australia a land fit for heroes to live in. He is not doing very much in that direction now. The position in regard to war service homes also calls for comment. There are many such homes in my district, and the position of some of the occupants is deplorable. I believe that the Australian people would be prepared to honour to ifr. Mulcahy. the ful l every promise made by past governments to returned soldiers. Not one citizen would quibble. Recently, a returned soldier, an occupant of a war service home, applied to the Repatriation Department for a pension, but he died before he could be medically examined. His widow was left with only her pension from the State Government, and on this she had to support herself and her two children. For several weeks after the death of her husband she continued to pay 10s. a week rent for the house out of however, she was notified by the War Service Homes Commission that it would no longer receive her money, and an ejectment order was issued against her. The case was heard in the Campsie court. I brought the matter under the notice of the Minister, and the case was adjourned for a month; but when it comes before the court again Parliament will be in recess, and the magistrate will have no course open to him but to order this woman and her children out into the street. I say that Australia has a duty, that, whatever was not only to the diggers, but to their dependants as well. Last Sunday afterbe attributed to war sernoon a meeting of the occupiers of war is dealing service homes in that district was held, and a resolution was passed condemning the action of the War Service Homes Many men were Commission in trying to evict this woman. If a bailiff is sent to turn this woman and her children out I am afraid he will accomplish it only over the dead bodies of the men who were the comrades of this woman's husband. If there is any of the spirit of ANZAC left in them they will not see this injustice perpetrated, and no one could blame them for defending the children of their mate. A meeting is to be held in the Canterbury Town Hall of all the occupiers of war service homes in the Lang, Barton, Dalley and Reid electorates. I know that the Minister for Repatriation will be invited to attend, and I hope that some good will come of it. This morning I received a letter setting forth the terms of the resolution carried by the meeting held last Sunday. The first request is for a re-appraisement of the capital value of war service homes, and a writing-down of those values by 50 per cent. Another request is that the rate of interest should be reduced to 2 per cent. That, I think, is a fairly modest request. Those who took up war loans were given tax free bonds, and, in my opinion, those who fought in the war should at least have the benefit of interest-free money for the building of their homes. A further request was that the power to evict persons from war service homes should be taken out of the hands of the War Service Homes Commissioner, and given to the Federal Government. I do not believe that any government would dare to evict the widow and children of a digger, but quite content to pass on the responsibility to officers of the Public Service. Occupants of these homes desire that their dependants shall have some equity in them.. I have a letter from the Minister in Charge of War Service Homes( Mr Thorby) who states, with regard to a lady against whom an eviction order was issued, "" It should be mentioned that Mrs. home."" Do honourable members know that if a ""digger"" in occupation of a war service home dies, and has paid about £700 off a house valued at £900, his widow has no legal interest in the equity in that home I equity in such circumstances. ment by the Minister that when a digger dies, after having put £500 or £600 worth of improvements into his home, the department can re-value the property, and charge the widow an increased rental in accordance with the higher valuation. done. vision not be made to prevent it from being done?

In the case to which I have futility of appointing commissions. Even specially referred, the department informed the widow, not only that she had no legal interest in the home, but that, in the ""Minister's opinion, she should take a house in keeping with her present position. In my opinion, and in that of many others, if it were not for the New South Wales Labour Government, many of these unfortunate persons would be housed in dog boxes. Any Australian Government should be ashamed to leave such an act as this on the statute-book, if returned soldiers and their dependants are to be treated in this way. It is time the Gothe present Government is vernment honoured every promise made to the men who, in most cases, were induced to go into the firing line overseas by the assurance that their dependants would be shown every consideration. Owing to unemployment, many of the occupants of these homes are unable to meet their obligations to the department, and I hope that supporters of the Government will endeavour to see that jushas no legal interest in the tice is done to them. During the regime of the Bruce-Page Government, a great number of royal commissions and committees were appointed, and, for the last seven or eight months, another commission has been inquiring into the price of petrol. I have taken an interest in politics for about 30 years, and I think that the chairman of this commission, Mr Lamb, has succeeded in obtaining so many appointments of this kind that he has lived practically on fees received from commissions, and for prosecutions conducted by anti-Labour governments, both in the New South Wales and in the Commonwealth arenas. It is high time an end was put to the farce of appointing commissions. What do we wish to know about the petrol industry that cannot be obtained without such a costly investigation? Can a royal commission tell us anything of which we are not already aware about tihe root causes of unemployment?

127,Mr Forde (Capricornia) [8.13],"I very greatly regret that the importance of this matter did not impress upon the Government the advisability of submitting the treaty to Parliament for ratification before it was entered into. At the outset I wish to say that I appreciate the difficulties which confront a Minister in an endeavour to negotiate a trade treaty with any country, particularly if it be a foreign nation. The Minister for Trade and Customs has the distinction that he is the first Australian Minister to negotiate a trade treaty with a foreign country. This treaty marks the initial instalment of the quota system on the part of Australia. The quota system is the commencement of a new movement for the regulation of trade and industry, and I submit that it is more provocative to other countries than the tariff protectionist policy formerly pursued. In a perusal of this memorandum honourable members will find that Japan, which buys more wool from us than any other country and which has a glass factory turning out glass equal to that produced in any other country in the world, is to be shut out altogether, while Belgium is to be given the substantial quota of 2,000,000 square feet on the basis of requirements of 7,500,000 .square feet. Other countries have to share a quota of 900,000 square feet. J apan to-day is sending window glass to New Zealand, and to other countries. I submit that the Government has blundered badly in not submitting the treaty to Parliament for ratification before it was entered into. I believe that all prospective trade treaties should be subject to parliamentary discussion and sanction before they are concluded. trade agreement, entered into by the Scullin Government with the Government of the Dominion of Canada, was preceded by a lengthy discussion in this chamber, and finally the proposed treaty was ratified. There was a special clause inserted in that agreement-claus e 9-whic h reads as follows:(1.) If at any time{a) His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth gives notice in writing to His Majesty's Government in the Dominion of Canada that in consequence of tlie importation into Australia of goods, of a kind specified in Mr Forde. the notice, being the produce or manufacture of the Dominion of Canada, the sale of similar goods produced in Australia is being prejudicially or injuriously affected, and (6) measures, sufficient, in the opinion of His Majesty's Government in the Commonwealth, are not put into effect by His Majesty's Government in the Dominion of Canada, within three months after the date of the notice, then, from a time and date to be fixed by Proclamation, goods of the kind specified in the notice shall, when imported from the Dominion of Canada, be subject to the rates of duty set out in the General Tariff. (2.) Upon the withdrawal of any notice given in pursuance of the last preceding subsection, goods of the kind specified in the notice shall, when imported from the Dominion of Canada after a time and date to be fixed by Proclamation, again become subject to the tariff which would have been applicable to them if the notice had not been given. That was fully explained by the Minister for Markets and Transport who was in charge of the House at the time. A similar proviso has not been inserted in the agreement which has been entered into between this Government and the Government of Belgium. In this respect the Prime Minister( Mr Lyons) has departed from his policy speech in which he saidThe Government proposed to ask the new Parliament to give the Minister power to negotiate trade treaties with foreign countries, and to put them into force immediately by proclamation, subject to the proviso that they must be ratified within a fixed period by Parliament. Parliament has not been asked to ratify this far-reaching treaty. It has been entered into by the Government, and the only opportunity afforded honourable members to discuss it is the limited one The Canadian-Australian of debating it on a motion for the adjournment of the House; with no opportunity to cast a vote upon the merits or demerits of the treaty. It is a distinct breach of the definite election pledge made by the Prime Minister. It is of paramount importance that the secondary and primary industries of this country should not be imperilled _ as a result of a trade treaty entered into behind the back of Parliament. In October of last year the Tariff Board made a searching investigation into the glass industry. I ask the Minister now if he has a copy of that report, and why he has not made it available to honourable members ? As a matter of fact it was the fourth investigation into glass since that made by Mr Pratten as Minister for Trade and Customs in 1925, when the deferred duty was recommended. That duty was further deferred from time to time, and it was that duty which the Scullin Government put into operation. It remained for the present Government to offend Belgium by bringing about total prohibition. Firsti t wiped out the deferred duty made operative by the Scullin Government, and then when importers had 3,000,000 square feet of glass on the water, it came down with a total prohibition. That was in September, 1932. This prohibition now stands, but under it imports are to be rationed. gesture to the nation. bungled in first taking the duty off, and then allowing the importers to order 3,000,000 square feet, only to find the Government putting a prohibition on and declaring that the 3,000,000 square feet should be rationed. Prior to the Scullin Government imposing the deferred duty in June, 1930, eighteen months' supplies were imported by importing agents, so as to make the starting of the Australian factory impossible. Wheni t was known that the industry was to be started in Australia, 19,200,000 square feet was imported in 1929-30 as against 10,200,000 square feet in 1928-29. These large importations were brought in so that they would be in hand in Australian warehouses and there would be no demand for the product of the Australian factory. The duty was taken off by the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Sir Henry Gullett) on the 1st September, 1932, and replaced by a revenue duty of 2s. and 4s. It was, however, readily seen that the Australian industry would be imperilled. managing director of the Australian actually has the report? company was irresistible, and a total prohibition was subsequently imposed and has remained in force for two years. I must have submitted the report because want to know what is the nature of the investigations were carried out twelve last Tariff Board report, and if that remonths ago. I know it is easy for the Goport is available. When the present vernment to say that until the GovernMinister for Trade and Customs( Mr ment has taken some action upon an White) was in opposition he was always very loud in his clamour for the latest Tariff Board report. He always asked why was not the last Tariff Board report made available to honourable members. He said ""Has the Minister something to hide, or has he got the report in his bag?"" I ask him now to be good enough to make available to honourable member! the last report of the Tariff Board on glass. The Tariff Board held its inquiry in October and November of last year and after over twelve months has elapsed surely honourable members have a right to know the board's recommendations. The reports that we have been able to obtain are dated 1925, 1932, and the 26th January, 1933, and in each case they were based on inquiries made six months previously. Surely the Minister will be good enough to distribute copies of this report before the House is asked to vote on this motion for the adjournment. If he does so, it will 'enable honourable members to study the report. I submit it is quite a reasonable request. The Tariff Board must have come to the conclusion that the Australian industry is an efficient one and that the price and quality of its product are quite satisfactory. Can there be something in the recommendations that the Minister does not wish us to see? I submit that this departure in tariffmaking is fraught with grave danger to the great industries of Australia. In this instance it happens to be a secondary industry; to-morrow it may be a great primary industry whose fate is at stake. Honourable members on both sides of the House are vitally concerned in this matter. If the Minister pursues this policy the protection policy of Australia may be bartered away overnight, without giving honourable members or the people generally an opportunity to prevent it. The case put up by the member suggest that the Minister",39,Adjournment Trade Treaty With Belgium

131,Mr Forde,"The Tariff Boardindustry pursuant to a Tariff Board report, it is unusual to make the recommendations of the Board available. But the Minister has taken very definite action upon this report, for he proposes to submit this industry to the imposition of a quota, and he is to restrict Australian production. He is to say to the Belgians: "" Y o u may exploit this market to the extent of 2,000,000 square feet,"" and to the other countries: "" Y o u may have 900,000 square feet."" But to the Australian manufacturers a market for only 60 per cent, or 4,500,000 square feet is to be available. We must admit that the action taken by the Government must lead the overseas countries one by one to threaten to prohibit the importation of goods from Australia. When the Government gives way to one country what logical argument can it put forward to refuse to give way to another? At the present time, Italy, Japan, Erance, Germany, China, and other countries are making representations to the Government and the outcome will be that, if it gives way, a substantial increase of unemployment in Australia must inevitably result. The protection policy of Australia is interwoven with its future prosperity. This is even admitted by men like Professor Copland, who cannot be looked upon as a high protectionist. In his work Is our Tariff a Handicap, he saysIn face of the growth of economic national28.7 por cent., and those of other counism throughout the world, and of the industrial and agricultural developments in Australia, I am unable to resist the view that our tariff policy has, on the whole, made a substantial contribution to our economic welfare. [Leave to continue given.] If treaties with foreign countries are to be entered into in this way, there will be increased pressure from certain agrarian gentlemen who belong to the Country party to force the Government to pursue the policy to such an extent that other great Australian secondary industries will be placed in jeopardy. The Minister, in a statement which he made on this subject on the 19 th November, saidI announce the successful conclusion of a provisional agreement with the Belgian Government, whereunder that Government, in return for permission to import into Australia a limited quantity of Belgian window Mr Forde. , 'E glass annually, has agreed first to remove all restrictions on the importation into Belgium of Australian frozen meat, and, secondly, to withdraw the threatened embargo against the importation of Australian cereals. I must congratulate the Belgian Government on the success which has attended its efforts to obtain a substantial percentage of the Australian market for its window glass manufacturers, but the Minister is deserving of censure for jeopardizing the future of a great secondary industry. The Australian window glass manufacturing industry has been made vulnerable to the attacks of window glass manufacturers in countries where wageB and labour conditions are much inferior to those of Australia. It must be noted that the Belgian Government has given no guarantee whatever that it will purchase any Australian meat. All that it has said is that no restriction will be placed upon Australian meat entering Belgium, and that the duty on Australian meat will not be higher than that applicable to the meat imported from any other country. The Minister informed .us that on an Australian annual consumption of 7,500,000 square feet of window glass, which was the consumption when the negotiations with Belgium began, the Australian manufacturers will hereafter have 60 per cent., those of the United Kingdom 10 per cent., those of Belgium tries 1.3 per cent. On any Australian annual consumption in excess of 7,500,000 square feet, the Australian manufacturers will have 50 per cent., those of the United Kingdom 12.5 per cent., those of Belgium 35.8725 per cent., and those of other countries 1.6275 per cent. Is it fair play to this great Australian industry that it should be denied the advantage of an increased Australian market to this extent? It is entirely unjust! This policy must inevitably retard the development of this industry and militate against increased employment in it. The Australian window glass manufacturers have spent £300,000 in installing a plant to operate the Eorcault system of manufacture, which they consider to be the best in the world for making window glass; their factory has a capacity of 12,000,000 square feet per annum, and for the last eighteen months they have supplied the whole of Australia's requirements, giving employment to 406 persons. That number is, of course, in addition to more than 3,000 persons employed by the throughout Australia. The window glass manufacturing company has lately been producing at the rate of 9,000,000 square feet per annum. This has supplied all our requirements and made possible the building up of reserve stocks. The restriction of the sales of the company to about 5,000,000 square feet per annum must inevitably havo the effect of adding to its overhead costs. If the volume of 1 production is reduced in this way, the price of window glass must inevitably be increased. If this happens, there will be an outcry from the public. The importing interests are hoping that they have the thin edge of the wedge and that they can capture the whole Australian market. I cannot agree with the statement of the Minister that the existing and proposed prohibitions of Australian imports by Belgium were brought about by the force of public opinion in that country. cry from the Belgian Government when the Scullin Government imposed the deferred duties, nor was there a protest in 1925-26 when the deferred duties were first provided for outcry has come from the importing agents in Australia who have been'very active. The effect of the policy that has hitherto been pursued has been that the price of window glass has fallen, as the following table will show:FOR THE BUILDINGS.

The increases shown by Mr Pratten. The only on the 23rd July, 1930, and the 31st January, 1933, were caused by the glass distributors and not the Australian glass manufacturers. As soon as the local glass manufacturers succeeded in effectively organizing their industry the price fell. I wish now to deal briefly with the great importance of large secondary industries to Australia. Most honourable gentlemen realize that the home market Before .imposition of is the best that our primary producers can have.

If the local market is fostered and developed by the establishment of great secondary industries, those engaged in primary production must reap real advantages; but, if the policy that has resulted in the giving away of a large percentage of our window glass market to manufacturers in foreign countries is applied to other secondary industries, how can the primary producers expect to build up a larger products? The granting of this concession by the Government to manufacturers in a foreign country strikes a blow at employment in a great secondary industry of this country. . I suppose that the Government is not likely to revoke its decision in this connection. The agreement will doubtless continue in force for twelve months. But in order that the severity of the blow may be lessened I hope that favorable consideration will be given by the Government to the suggestion made this afternoon by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) that the glass imported from Belgium shall be distributed in Western Australia and South Australia chiefly. Probably some of it could be sent to ports in Northern Queensland. The freights on glass from Belgium to Australia are the same, irrespective of the port of landing in this country, whereas the freight charges on glass delivered by the Australian manufacturers is much greater for some ports than for others. The freight from Sydney to Western Australia is practically the same as that from Belgium to Australia. the Government could well take into consideration. Something has been said about the shrinkage of our trade with Belgium; but those who have carefully examined the available statistical information realize that there has been a shrinkage of world trade generally. The following table shows the exact position in regard to our trade with Belgium:£ 192728 .. .. .. 936,804 192829 .. .. 910,797 192930 .. .. 985,005 193031 .. .. 312,023 193132 .. .. 282,131 ExPOBTS FEOM AUSTBAIJA TO BELGIUM. £ 192728 .. .. 9,320,508 192829 .. .. 9.044,614 192930 .. .. .. 5,536,231 market locally for their 193031 .. .. .. 4,195,186 193132 .. .. 3,579,143 I submit that Parliament has not been treated with the courtesy to which it was entitled.

What answer will the Government give to the glass manufacturers of Japan, Germany, France and Italy when they ask for consideration? One weak decision encourages other countries to make threats.

Any such proclamation not re-enacted by regulation within six months after the commencement of this section shall cease to have effect. If the embargo on glass is to continue, it will have to be renewed in the near future by regulation, and the regulation can be declared void by Parliament. We are very glad that we were able to have that amendment inserted. In the past the government of the day was able to prohibit tlie importation of goods by proclamation, and Parliament had no redress. It is doubtful whether, if the law had ever been tested, the Government really did have this power, because I believe it was meant to apply only to the prohibition of goods which might be deleterious to the health and morals of the people. It was never intended that the Government should be able to impose a general prohibition. We intend to use all the influence we possess, both inside and outside Parliament, to make it impossible for governments to continue to exercise this arbitrary power. I am afraid that this agreement will create a harmful precedent, particularly iu regard to our trade with other countries. altogether were it not for the fact that we are to get some little benefit for the What will happen if Japan adopts a time being.

Owing to the development of economic nationalism most countries are now giving marked attention to trade treaties and quotas. In the past, governments generally relied on tariffs to regulate international trade; but it seems that in the future tariffs will play a minor part compared with treaties and quotas. The new method will create difficulties, and will lead to retaliation, misunderstanding and loss. I agree with the honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) that the pursuit of this new policy will seriously affect the economic life of the community. A protective tariff imposed by any country is apt to be criticized by those overseas manufacturers who desire a free market for their produce, but if a tariff does not discriminate between countries there is little danger of retaliation. An agreement of this kind, however, by its very nature invites retaliation. When he laid the treaty on the table, the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) saidInternational obligations prevent the Commonwealth from granting an import quota exclusively to Belgium, and in order to meet this situation the Government has followed its policy of allotting import quotas among the different overseas supplying countries in I should strongly oppose it proportion to the imports from those countries in previous years. of Australia.

150,Mr Garden,"Hav e the meat andquota system represent the best that can be done to meet the difficulties with which agreement entered into with the people we are confronted? I believe that, had tbe.agreement been placed before Parliament for consideration, some better system would have been evolved. Let us briefly review tbe history of the threatens that, if we do not agree to its events that led up to the imposition of an embargo on the importation of glass. In the first place, the embargo applies only to plain sheet or window glass. It does not extend to plate glass or figured glass, nor to glass used for household purcome to its aid in a war in which millions poses or for lighting. Several years ago the Belgians developed what is known as the Fourcault process for the manufacture of sheet glass. An Australian company bought the rights for the Commonwealth, and afterwards had to buy the necessary machinery from the Belgian manufacturer. There was only one firm in Belgium which could supply the machinery, and it did so under license from the holders of the patent rights. The supplying of that machinery provided employment for Belgian workers, ancl profits for Belgian manufacturers. The machines, when they were brought to Aus-, tralia, were capable of producing all the sheet glass needed in this country. By selling the rights to an Australian company, and by supplying the necessary machinery, Belgium recognized the right of Australia to produce its own sheet glass, and Belgian interests accepted our Australian money for those rights and for that machinery. Now Belgium desires to go back on her bargain and, after having sold us the right to make our own glass, wants to compel us to continue buying our glass from her. pany sell exclusive rights? MrG ARDEN -Yes. It said that it had the workmen who could make the necessary machinery, and the Australian company would have to buy both the machines and tbe right to use them. Then it would be permitted to manufacture as much glass as it desired. Australia having paid in hard cash for the rights and machinery, Belgium now says, ""Wc desire to supply you w i i glass as v well."" It was declared that the world's greatest upheaval was caused by a nation breaking a treaty with Belgium, and now, by economic pressure, Belgium seeks to compel us to assist it in breaking an of Australia. proposal, it will place an embargo upon Australian meat, wheat, and barley. Similar pressure was exercised prior to the greatest turmoil in the world's history. Belgium, which asked Australia to of men were slaughtered, now desires to break an agreement made by it with this country. I have before me the following statement signed by the 300 workmen employed in the window glass industry in Australia:As our livelihood ie at stake, we earnestly make an appeal to 3'Ou to protect us, as most of us were unemployed before the window glass works were opened. We have now been at work for some time, with our numbers steadily increasing. Having mastered the difficulties connected with our part of the production of sheet glass, the thought of possible unemployment, with the consequent waste of our training in this skilled work, fills us with alarm. The first duty of tbe Minister for Trade and Customs is to resist any action that would mean the breaking of the agreement entered into by Belgium. ployees been dismissed? agreement will operate: they will all be kept on. works have been producing 9,000,000 square feet of glass a year, and the Government desires their output to be reduced to 4,500,000 square feet. 9,000,000 square feet. dow glass in store to-day is sufficient for the building trade for the next eighteen months.

If the tariff had not been tinkered with, there would not have been any trouble; but people who knew nothing about the business-importer s who were thinking only of their own profits-induce d the Government to remove the protection. The representatives of overseas manufacturers immediately booked up orders for large supplies of glass. The Government could not fail to realize that it had made a mistake which threatened to ruin the Australian glass industry, and throw hundreds out of work on the streets and on the -dole. The embargo on importations followed, and from then on there has been trouble with Belgium. [Leave to continue given.""] Now we have this agreement on the quota basis. Is Belgium entitled to it? If this agreement is ratified by this House, will not the granting of it be a breach of the much placarded Ottawa agreement, and an offence to Australia's larger customer, Japan? Such a differentiation between two countries is bound to create ill will. If , on the other hand, the quota of Belgium's requirem°nts in this protective duty originally provided were allowed to stand, there could be no opposition from any quarter. . The Australian manufacturers never asked for prohibition, nor have they sought the quota system. The fiscal policy of Australia ought not to be the subject of piecemeal treaties and quotas. "" Hats and macaroni for wool "", "" barley and meat for glass "", "" dolls and toys for scrap i r o n "" savour of the ridiculous. Where will it end? Discrimination between overseas countries and between local industries means offence to overseas countries, injury to local industries, and starvation for the employees. If Belgium can force this Government to sacrifice the Australian glass industry, what is to prevent Italy, Germany, and Japan each selecting its own pet line, forcing goods upon us, and demanding that the Government should enter into similar treaties ? It is usually stated that the Australian glass company is a monopoly; that is true, but what is the alternative? There Mr Qarlmt. is only one, and that is to buy from a monopoly overseas. Pilkington's now absolutely controls the whole sheet and plate glass industry of Great Britain. The Fourcault sheet glass factories in Belgium are a monopoly, and the Belgian glass monopoly is controlled by Libby Owens, of the United States of America. In 1925, when Mr Pratten, who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, introduced the proposal for a deferred duty on sheet glass, I understand he quoted from a Tariff Board report to the effect thatIt is very desirable to have established in the Commonwealth, industries whose products are in general demand by our population, and which permit of production on a large <<cale, as by this means Australia's capacity to absorb a larger population and to make possible greater immigration was considerably increased. In addition, there is the advantage of adding to the domestic consumption of primary and other products by the consequential greater population. Let me ask those who are being deluded into the belief that this agreement will mean greater activity in the Belgian market for Australian primary products, where.it is stated in the agreement that, if we give something definite to Belgian glass manufacturers, Belgium will agree to give Australian primary producers a direction. There is not one word in the agreement that guarantees acceptance of Australian primary products; the only statement is that Belgium will agree to waive all restrictions into Belgium of Australian meat preserved by a cold process, and not to enforce the embargo on Australian wheat and barley. clause of the agreement. tained in the next clause, and I have not time to read it now. The Government should be engaged in the problem of increasing the purchasing power of the home market, and developing Australia on the lines of the Monroe doctrine, which was adopted by the United States of America. Instead of worrying about treaties and quotas with overseas countries, which form the basis for future wars, the Government should be considering a policy for enlarging the home market, which will protect Australian industries, both primary and secondary.

161,Mr Garden,"No promise is conAmerica, in its early history, did not worry about finding a market for its goods in Poland, Germany, France, Italy, or Great Britain, but it did worry about getting the best manpower from those countries to build up its internal economy. Australia is a young eountry, a paradise in the making, abounding with all the gifts of nature; yet we have arrived at the sorry position in which we have to ask our own people to close down their industries, and dismiss their employees,, iu order that some other country may send in the goods it desires ito manufacture to keep its factories open and its employees working. What an anomaly! Let Australia give a lead and declare that it will not be entangled in quotas or treaties which are the breeding ground of wars and rumours of wars. By adopting this agreement as the easiest way out of a seemingly difficult position, we are definitely pledging ourselves to be involved in the present mad policy, in a mad world, of Bowing the seed of international discord. The repercussions of this insignificant agreement will have a detrimental effect upon Australia. Those who believe that .they are gaining something by it will be the first to rebel against ing a voice in tariff matters. Therefore, that into which they will later be led. They will find when cotton, bananas, and other commodities are affected, that they have agreed to a dangerous precedent, which has not only destroyed secondary industries, but also had repercussions on primary industries. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Gregory) has expressed disagreement with the policy of entering into trade treaties before their ratification by Parliament. Both externally and internally this agreement will have a devastating effect. I hope that the House will consider the points that have been put forward by the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Forde), as well as the suggestion of the honourable member for Swan. I am not criticizing the Government, because I realize that it is in a very difficult position. The whole world is faced with the same difficulty. In agreeing to quotas, however, we are undoubtedly planting the seed which leads to war. All wars are the result of trade agreements, because one country tries to get the better of another. Our policy should be to build up our internal economy, and so improve the conditions of both the primary and secondary worker in this country. In the interests of the people of Australia as a whole, I appeal to the House to repudiate the action of the Minister for Trade and Customs. amazed at the complaint of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde), that this treaty has been entered into without the authority of Parliament. I suppose that no man is equally responsible with him for having caused dislocation of trade in Australia without having consulted Parliament in any way. He has been instrumental in bringing down hundreds of violent increases of duty, which have made the Australian tariff the highest in the world, and in imposing innumerable embargoes. The glass embargo was imposed without the authority of Parliament. ment, not by me. without the authority of Parliament. For over two years the honourable member and his party prevented Parliament from havit is ridiculous and unjust of him to complain that this agreement has been made by the Government without having first obtained the authority of Parliament. The selfishness of the Opposition is difficult to understand. Australia is a considerable gainer in its trade with Belgium. This small agreement proposes to restore to Belgium an opportunity to trade with Australia in glass to an amount of something less than £20,000 a year. For the last five years our export trade to Belgium has averaged £5,250,000, while our purchases from that country have amounted to only about £750,000; consequently, we have had an advantage in round figures of £4,400,000 annually. Wherein, then, lies the justice of the complaint against this small restoration to Belgium, one of our best trade friends? Upon three items alone the result of this agreement will be to restore to Australia trade to the value of over £500,000 a year. Those are the primary items, barley, meat and wheat. It is true that there was no formal exclusion of barley from the Belgian market. Tha ''ireat",48,Imposts Into Australia From Belgium

164,Mr Nairn,"It was, in fact, imposedof exclusion, however, destroyed the Australian trade in that commodity. There was complete exclusion of meat by the Belgian Government, and that particularly affected the State of Western Australia. The meat industry is established at Wyndham, and handles the cattle of the Kimberleys and the western portion of the Northern Territory. The Belgian market was particularly valuable to the meat producers of those areas. A big trade, amounting lo about £80,000 a year, was worked up before an embargo was imposed upon the importation of Belgian glass into Australia. The result of the embargo was the withdrawal of that trade. During tlie last financial year we were able to send to Belgium only £10.000 worth of our meat, and even that small trade would be completely lost but for the negotiation of this agreement. FOT some years Western Australia has been selling to Belgium roughly two-thirds of the meat output of Wyndham. Last year, however, it could sell only one-tenth, the remaining nine-tenths being thrown on the already glutted British market. To those who speak about Australian industries, I Compare the position of the producers on the eastern coast of Australia with that of those who are engaged in the cattle industry in the Northern Territory. This year the industry has been so depressed that the average gross return to the growers in the Northern Territory and the Kimberleys has been only £2 17s. a beast. The beef producers in those areas work under terrible tropical conditions for a starvation return. They pioneered the industry, and at one time it was valuable to settling the open spaces of the North, let us try to appreciate the grave injustice that is done by embargoes or duties to those who are doing their best for Australia under conditions which are immeasurably experienced on the eastern coast.

It must be obvious to them that these embargoes produce retaliation, which is destroying one after another the -primary industries. I hope that honourable members will consider the effect of their extreme protection policy, and try to remember that if we are to hope for something like a restoration of employment we must first give primary industries a fair opportunity to live. am very much afraid that the expectations of the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) -with respect to this trade agreement will not be fulfilled. I am inclined to think that many of us are disposed to blame particular tariff measures for what is a world position. I recognize, probably as well as any honorwould say: able member, the importance of our trade with Belgium, and, indeed, with all countries. Particularly do I feel that Western Australia must preserve friendly relations with Belgium especially, and with the world in general. When I look at the facts, however, I discover that there is a very great similarity between the contraction of the trade done by Western Australia with Belgium during the last five years, and the decline of the trade done by the United Kingdom with that country in the same period. I think it will be admitted that the United Kingtliem. When we talk of dom has not imposed any very special disabilities upon trade with Belgium.

What has happened is that the volume of commodities of the same character which have been exchanged has greatly lessened. Western Australia has done a considerable volume of trade with Belgium, to the advantage of that State. In the last five years it imported from Belgium goods to the value, in English currency, of about £150,000. If we add 25 per cent, to make the figures comparable, we find that in Australian currency our imports have been valued at about £187,000. In the same period our exports to Belginro have been valued at £1,707,000. In the first year of the five-year period our imports, expressed in sterling, were valued at £50,000, and in the last year they had shrunk in value to £20,000. Our exports in the first year of the five year period were valued at £566,000 inAustralian currency, and in the last year, £245,000. It is therefore clear that our exports to Belgium shrunk by a little more than one-half in value, and that the imports to Western Australia from that country have also shrank by a little more than one-half. In 1932-33, the year before Western Australian meat was shut out from Belgium,, the exports of Western Australian frozen beef to the United Kingdom were valued at £94,000, and those to Belgium at £43,000. There was a little, trade with the East Indies,, valued at £199. ' Our main trade was with the United Kingdom and Belgium. We sold twice as much, to the United Kingdom as to Belgium.

Further, the agreement perpetuates the exclusion from the Australian glass market of countries other than Belgium. I refer to countries with which we have developed and maintained trade, and which probably will see in this agreement with Belgium, a means which they shall endeavour to emulate in order to make special agreements with Australia to secure monopoly rights so far asimports to Australia are concerned as against the world at large. There is, indeed, a very grave danger in such a policy. I find that countries which manufacture glass, are as follows:-Great Britain, Belgium, Italy, United States of America, France, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Russia, Japan, China and Australia6 export it. dictum that the pre-war dimensions of a country's export trade axe any criterion at all of itseconomic necessities. Something makes all previous comparisons entirely meaningless. Apart from questions of currency, which enter into this matter so importantly, there are other difficulties, in that countries have to find some way to dispose of their surplus production. Andi f it should happen to be glass in Germany, the United States of America, or Japan, what are we to say to those countries which are large buyers of our primary products, when they submit to this country an alternative similar to that which has been submitted by Belgium?

171,Mr Curtin,"I decline to accept thefeel most decisively that this agreement has been very hurriedly made without adequate consideration in a haphazard attempt to rectify blunders which the Government has made in the last three years in respect to the glass industry, because it is quite clear that no embargo was imposed against Australian meat until we placed an embargo on the importation of Belgian glass. The policy in operation hitherto in this Parliament was to treat all foreign countries upon an entirely identical basis, and no country had any trade grievance againsTAustralia until the present Government imposed an embargo against the importation of Belgian glass.

Every country is looking for markets. D the most favoured nation clause. tration to the Ministei. Suppose Japan3 says, "" We are large importers of Australian wool "", just as Belgium said, "" We are large importers of frozen beef"". Japan might conceivably say to us: "" In order that we may continue to buy Australian wool it is essential that we should have entry into the Australian market for our own products. We do not wish to sell glass, but boots or textiles, or silk "". Assume that Japan says, "" We wish to sell something to Australia which is subject to a high rate of duty or a total prohibition "". on its merits. in the way of a scientific adjustment of our trade relations. The honourable gentleman is buying into a policy which has many provocations involved in it, a policy the advantages of which may be far outweighed by its rep'ercussions in other countries. I submit that generally the question of Australia's trade should no longer be dealt with in this piecemeal fashion. I have very strong objections towards the piecemeal application of tariff duties to certain commodities. Such a policy is not wise. Any policy which ia put into operation haying for its object the betterment of people situated in one part of Australia to the detriment of those living in another part is unsound. We must look at the question in the interests of this country as a whole, regarding Australia as a unit with which we shall bargain with the world as a whole, giving preference to countries within the British Empire. We can thus build up our trade relations with the world generally. Buti f we make the mis-, take of singling out different countries outside of the British Empire and giving them rights denied to others, and advantages not shared with the United Kingdom, all hopes of preferential trade within the Empire must disappear. Furthermore, all hopes of reasonable appreciation of our position by foreign countries would seem to be greatly diminishing. I regret the procedure the Minister has devised. It would have been far better for Parliament to have had a proper discussion of this treaty. The Minister could then have given effect to such a policy in connection with this agreement as would fit in with the view which this Parliament holds of Australia's trade position. I welcome the removal of the embargo -imposed by the Belgian Government against the importation of Australian meat. In this respect a very desirable end has been achieved. In principle, embargoes are bad. There should be no failure on the part of governments to recognize that economic questions are now the major subjects of political wisdom, and every parliament should be the authority, ancl the only authority, to decide matters of this description. What happened three years ago is dead. Prowse) -The honourable gentleman's time has expired.

179,Mr Hawker (Wakefield) [9.43],"that at any rate is not true. I have here a copy of the Sydney Morning Herald, in which the shares of the Australian Glass Company are quoted. One pound shares to-day are quoted as, buyer 61s. 9d.; seller, 62s. Before the particulars of the trade agreement were published, the shares of this company were quoted at only a few pence below that figure. The bulk of its assets are represented by other types of glass. But the fact that the shares have not depreciated, I think, quite definitely disproves any allegation that an Australian industry has been sacrificed. In that fact also lies the hopes for world recovery. This agreeanswer to the second criticism put forward by honourable members, "" that, whereas this agreement permits Belgium a certain entry into the Australian market for something over 2,000,000 square feet of glass, it does not guarantee it will help to restore the value of some entry for any particular quantity of Australian product into the Belgian market"". The fact that Belgium receives a quota with a definite limit in itlarge proportion of that increase will self assures to the Australian industry the major part of the Australian market, and assures it in a rigid and It is that security which has maintained the value of the company's shares and the prospects of the men in the factory retaining their employment-and those prospects are far from poor. In the very nature of things, by the very fact that the Belgians are guaranteed entry for the limited quantity of 2,000,000 odd feet of their window glass, on which a tariff duty of 2s. per 100 square feet must be paid, there is an assurance of restriction of imports. The mere fact that even in the palmy days, when the Belgian glassmakers had the bulk of the Australian trade, Belgium was buying from us goods worth ten times the value of the goods that we were buying from Belgium, makes it quite evident that the interests of Auspoint which I consider to be most vital. tralia have been very fully safeguarded. The concessions now made in respect of the unrestricted entry of our goods into Belgium are of immense value to our primary industries. The third criticism offered of this agreement must, of course, have been considered by the members of the Government before the agreement was made. It has been said that the very fact that we have parleyed with another country in order to attempt to regain markets that had been lost, is an invitation to other countries to insist that we parley with them. World conditions, as truly described by the honourable member for Fremantle ( Mr Curtin), are such to-day that only by parley with countries with which we wish to trade and which wish to trade with us, can we hope to increase our overseas markets and improve the prospects of our exporters. It is on the basis of treaties and agreements with other countries that we must build our ment will undoubtedly reduce the market available for the Australian manufacturers of window glass, but it will also undoubtedly increase the market for other Australian manufactured goods, for of our primary exports. By doing that, it will increase the general purchasing power of the people of Australia, and a undoubtedly be expended on manufactured goods. absolutely unshakable way. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) says, by interjection, that we have no guarantee that Belgium will purchase our goods. I admit that no figure is specified in the agreement; but it is to be presumed, surely, that if Australian goods are allowed unrestricted entry into Belgium our primary producers will be able to place in that country the proportion of their products that they were able to place there before any restrictions were imposed. The Australian primary-producing industries mainly concerned in this agreement are the meat industry of North-West Australia and the barley industry of several States, but principally of South Australia. This brings me to the The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) said that we should do everything in our power to build up the home market for our primary industries, because this was the most valuable market. From the point of view of the Eastern States, that may be so; but no increase of the purchasing power of the factory workers of Sydney could compensate the cattle-raisers of North-West Australia for the loss of their market overseas. So long as the Navigation Act remains in force, it will be out of the question for beef to be sent from Wyndham to the Sydney market except at prices even more ruinously low than those to which the cattle-raisers have had to re-adjust their conditions in the last few years. and we should endeavour to settle every pan of ii that is reasonably fertile. A good deal of North Australia is poor, but much of the North-West Australia, and the Kimberley, in Western Australia, contains large areas of good cattle country. As the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) has pointed out. the value of those districts has been reduced by the loss of the Belgian market for our meat. The effect has been that the gross value of cattle per head has been reduced from £3 15s. to £2 17s. It must be remembered that cattle raising is in that paTt of the country the sole industry. 300 workers have been affected in the window glass industry by the making of this agreement. Some of these are storemen and packers who should be able to obtain employment in certain other directions. The census returns of last year show that in the Wyndham and Hall's Creek districts of North-West Australia there are 744 persons who are practically altogether dependent upon the caltlc industry. An additional number in the adjacent areas of the Northern Territory are also dependent upon this industry. As to the barley producers, I point out that only those of South Australia export barley, but the value of the barley produced in Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland is based upon the return obtained for the barley exported by the South Australian producers, plus the value of the freight from South Australia to Melbourne or Sydney. quantity of barley grown in Australia is greater than the quantity consumed here. The type of barley that we grow is suited foT making malt for beer agreeable to the continental palate, but, unfortunately, it is not for some reason agreeable to the English Efforts to change the type of barley grown in Australia have not been very successful. In the Yorketown, Minlaton, and Warooka districts of South Australia, where barley-growing is the principal inifr. Hawker. dustry, there is a population of 5,500 people. These are not solely dependent upon barley-growing, for a certain amount of stock-raising, wheat-growing, and salt-scraping is also done; but barleygrowing is the leading industry. In the districts of Yorke Peninsula, around We have a continent to settle, Maitland, where barley accounts for practically half the agricultural activities of the community, and in the Millicent district, there are 6,700 people; and around Clinton there are 1,530 people dependent, to a considerable extent, on barley production. This makes, in all, more than 13,700 people whose prosperity depends, to a large extent, upon the price that they can obtain overseas for the barley that they export. The value that the employment of a few extra workers in the window glass manufacturing industry may be to a few primary producers who market their garden products in 'Sydney, and to About a few tobacco-growers, could not possibly be regarded as a compensation for the loss of the overseas barley market to the thousands of people to whom I have referred. Honourable members are cruelly narrow if they consider that the extension of the-industries of two or three of our great cities will enable us to obtain greater security for the great bulk of out people, and to maintain Australian standards for tbe white race in this country. I do not pretend to make any scientific assessment, but I submit that every settler that we can maintain in NorthWest Australia is a definite defence of British and white standards for everybody elsewhere in Australia. It has been said that certain dangers will arise through the adoption of the quota system. Everybody realizes that those dangers exist, but the only basis upon which trade can be allocated so that people can see what the real effect will The be, is the quota basis. This advantage must be weighed against any disadvantages of the system. If the difficulties of the window glass manufacturing industry had been adjusted by a lowering of the customs duty on window glass, the Australian industry might have been compalate. pletely annihilated, and even then Belgium might not have obtained our trade. It might have gone to some other country. Certainly, it would not have been possible for usto accord Great Britain a larger share of any increased trade that might have developed. Admittedly, trading by quotas is an innovation.. It is not an Ausducts at a lower figure, we have no reason tralian innovation; it has been forced upon us by world conditions to-day, and is something that I fear we must face whether we like it or not. I commend the Government for having made a good bargain, and for having done something that will make it possible to maintain our White Australia and good Australian standards of living. I consider that this agreement will have the effect of increasing instead of diminishing the purchasing power of our people. I wish to comment, briefly, on the debate that has taken place this evening. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) has summed up the situation in such a way as to suggest to me that the whole question is one in which the struggle is now developing between various primary and secondary interests in this country. We shall have to wait to find out which will finally predominate and survive. The honourable member, of course, looked at the subject from the point of view of his own State. He was anxious that certain markets should be provided for Australian meat and barley in. Belgium. On the other hand, it has also been contended by certain other honourable gentlemen in industrial electorates that we must do our utmost to retain aiid develop the secondary industries of this country for the purpose of providing as much employment as possible for our people, and of increasing their purchasing power. It will be seen from, this statement of the case that there is undoubtedly a clash of interests in our own country. The honourable member for Wakefield quoted certain figures relating to the production of barley;, but I point out to him that we have no guarantee whatever that Belgium will purchase that quantity of barley from us. The agreement merely provides that the Belgian Government will remove certain embargoes that have been placed upon Australian meat importations into Belgium, and will, not restrict the importation of Australian barley. If the Australian producers are able to place these products on the Belgian market at competitive prices, the people of Belgium will probably buy them; but if other countries are able to market their proto believe that the Belgian Governmcci will be very disturbed about it ""or will feel any obligation to buy from us. We have to remember that other countries are producing barley under conditions which would not be tolerated in Australia. It may happen, therefore, that after all, the people of Australia will be required by the imposition of taxation to subsidize the barley-growers in some way, because even with this agreement they may not be able to market their products in Belgium in competition, with other countries. Whether we pay the taxes directly or indirectly does not matter, because the subsidies must be made up somehow. In any case, it is problematical whether the benefits claimed for agreements of this kind will ever eventuate. When the Ottawa agreement, was entered into w<were told that all sorts of benefits were to follow. Britain was to take more of our wheat and meat, but only a very short time had elapsed when Britain was seeking to cut down our quotas, particularly in regard to meat. Now the latest information is that the wheat quota is also to be reduced. So the struggle goes ou between the conflicting interests of one country and another, and between the various conflicting interests within each country. It is evident that agreements of this kind do not touch the root of the trouble. What is really required is to increase the general demand for our produce. Even in our own country the market could be developed. A great many families in Australia to-day, for instance, could do with more meat if they could afford it. and the same thing applies to families overseas. Honourable members must recognize that there is something fundamentally wrong with things as they are. aud that the matter cannot be corrected by any system of bargaining such as is represented by this agreement. Tho present agreement definitely injures one section of the community on the pretence that it will confer a benefit upon another section. The Australian glass industry is directly affected, and no one can. deny that that industry will, aa the result, be able to offer less employment than before.",52,Imposts Into Australia From Belgium
180,Mr Beasley (West Sydney) [9.57].,"The honourable member for Wakefield said that the displaced workers might be able to secure employment in other avenues, probably on the waterfront handling the increased volume of imports. That is poor consolation for those who will be thrown out of work, as any one must realize who visits the waterfront and sees how many men are there at the present time unable to find anything like regular employment. employment that will be provided at the Wyndham meat works? proof that any extra employment will be provided there. Other similar attempts to stimulate our export trade have failed. Every recent move seems to be in the direction of restricting output. The activities of the primary industries are being curtailed in every direction instead of being extended. Those who argue in favour of the present restriction say that production in the ordinary way should not be interfered with, but that the surplus products should be stored. What will happen when the restrictions are lifted? There will be an immediate glut on the market, and prices will fall to still lower levels. Are we to assume that the whole future of the Wyndham meat works is bound up with the attitude of Belgium towards our trade? It seems to me that Belgium is not a very large factor in world affairs, and that we are tending to place somewhat too great reliance upon her. Moreover, it seems now to be generally admitted that other countries will try to secure from us a similar agreement to that which we have made with Belgium, and if that be so,'it seems inevitable that our secondary industries, one after another, must be sacrificed on the altar of expediency. It is quite evident that that is the future envisioned by the honourable member for Wakefield. It is a poor lookout for those living in the industrial areas of our cities, who depend upon the secondary industries for employment. Those of us who represent such areas have a definite obligation in this matter. We are not unmindful of the needs of the primary producers, and wish them to receive a fair and proper return for their labour, but we are not prepared to go to the lengths that the Government has gone in this agreement by sacrificing a secondary industry. That course is totally unnecessary. The metropolitan interests are at least as important as those of the country, and we shall soon find ourselves in a very sorry plight if we destroy one secondary industry after another in order to placate the primary producers, particularly when we realize that in this case there is no guarantee that the primary interests concerned will benefit. to suggest that harm will overtake the glass industry in Australia as a result of this agreement. glass in Australia is limited owing to our small population, and the glass company has installed a plant capable of supplying the whole of that market. If part of the market is to be supplied by Belgium it is obvious that the Australian Glass Company cannot continue to produce at maximum efficiency. Its production costs will increase, and this, in turn, will place it in a still worse position to compete with foreign manufacturers. It has been said that the producers of barley and meat will obtain benefits which will more than compensate for any injury to the glass industry. Evidently the barley and meat have been put on one side of the scale and the glass on the other, and the beam has tipped against the glass industry. The Government said that only 300 or 400 men at most would be affected by this interference with' glass-manufacturing industry, and that they would be absorbed in other activities. The matter is not so simple as that, and this principle, once admitted, is likely to be extended very rapidly to other industries. In any case, what we hope to gain by trade with foreign countries may quite easily be offset in other directions. The Danes were quick to circumvent the provisions designed to give dominion butter preference on the British market. In order to offset the duty of 15s. per cwt. they devalued their currency, and even exported cream to Great Britain to be made up into butter there. It is natural for every country to conserve its own interests first, and even Britain is bein.c?",55,Imposts Into Australia From Belgium

I think it will be found after this agreement has been in operation for some time that the balance will be against Australia. pleased that the Government has entered into this agreement with Belgium, though it is not nearly so far-reaching as I should like to see it. The honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) said that he would like to see the primary producers obtaining a fair return for their labour, and so on; but such wishes do not help the primary producer very much. It is the preponderance of city interests in this Parliament, brought about by the growth of secondary industries, that has placed the primary producers at so great a disadvantoge compared with the fostered industries of the cities. This is proved by figures prepared by the Commissioner for Taxation. In one year the taxable income of Australia was £122,000,000, of which the primary industries, including the mining and pastoral industries, yielded only £5,000,000, while the secondary industries, including the glass industry, yielded £117,000,000. What would happen to the secondary industries of Australia if the great exporting industries were ruined, if they were wiped out altogether, as seems possible under our present policy of seeking to become self-contained! In one year Australia received from Italy, Belgium, France, Germany and Japan trade to the value of £40,000,000 more than that of the trade which it gave to those countries. head for export, whereas Western AusThis state of affairs cannot continue. The United States of America now realizes that its attitude of isolation has not succeeded and it openly confesses that it must reverse its policy, recognizing that placed at a tragic disadvantage. goods must be paid for with goods.

I think the AusA plea has been advanced on behalf of tralian company would not object. the unemployed, and those who receive the invalid and old-age pension, as gested that. though these are the only persons whom certain honourable members represent in this Parliament. Yet we now have them it. I agree with the honourable member speaking in defence of monopolies and profiteers. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) has shown that the shares of the Australian Window Glass Company, which was established shortly before the depression began, have increased in value from £1 to 61s. 9d. Compare that with the position of the meat producers in the north-western portion of Western Australia and the electorate of Kennedy in Queensland or that of the wheat-growers of Australia. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Fairbairn) recently named a score of companies whose shares have increased in value during the depression by up to 150 per cent. Do members of the Opposition ever realize that the economically unsound position of many Australian secondary industries is largely responsible for the prevalence of unemployment? No doubt there would be fewer men out of work if certain uneconomic industries had never been established in this country. We should be infinitely better off if we had concentrated on a number of industries that could be carried on economically and could sell at least a proportion of their products abroad. What would be the position of Australia if it were not for our exporting industries? It would become like a besieged city, and employment would be Unobtainable. Nothing should be done to prevent Australia from exporting its primary products. At the present time its exports amount to £15 a head of the population. The cities of Melbourne and Sydney do not produce one shilling a tralia's exports realize £37 a head. Yet the cities have a greater voice than the country districts in governmental affairs.

On no future occasion should a similar agreement be entered into without consulting the representatives of the people. I would welcome trade agreements with any nation that gives us such a favorable balance of trade as does Belgium. In one year Australia received trade from Belgium to the value of £9,000,000, compared with £900,000 worth of trade which Belgium obtained from us. It is not surprising that that country aud Japan expect Australia to do some business with them. We should show a spirit of reciprocity. Italy now proposes to exclude 50 per cent, of the wool previously purchased by it from this country. We cannot afford to lose such a valuable trade. We might well sift out some of our uneconomic industries for the purpose of increasing reciprocal trade with other countries. This policy would be advantageous to our people, and employment in Australia would be increased. I hope that the present agreement is only the thin end of a wedge that will enable similar treaties to be negotiated with other countries. ber for Capricornia ( Mr Forde) fears it, but I hope that it is so. -Some honourable members seem to suggest that .there is a clash of interests over the treaty with Belgium. AlthoughI am desirous that meat production in the north-western portion of Australia shall succeed, I should be sorry to think that such, a treaty would injuriously affect an Australian secondary industry. I shall refer in tbe first .place to the difficulties exported and placed in cold storage in with which meat producers in North Australia are faced. Some years ago the cattle produced in the Kimberley district found a market entirely in the southern portion of Western Australia. At that time, that State had comparatively few farmers, and its meat supplies had to be brought from the Kimberleys. Great trouble was then experienced because the small cattlemen could not obtain space for their cattle on the boats. It was mainly reserved for large cattlemen. Men who. had driven their fat stock for six weeks to Wyndham or Derby found that the space had been fully engaged by the large growers on Dalgety and Company's vessels. This led to the inauguration of the shipping service established by the Western Australian Government expressly for the purpose of meeting the needs of the small growers, who were given the first call on the space. Good cattle were subsequently produced by the farmers in the southwestern portion of the State, and thon the northern cattlemen bad to find a fresh market. No private company was prepared to risk its capital in the establishment of meat works, so a Labour government came to the assistance of the meat producers, and built freezing works at Wyndham. Although the large firm of Vestey's closed down its meat works across the border at Darwin, the Western Australian Government continued to carry on its works in the northern part of Western Australia, and it is now providing an outlet for cattle from the Northern Territory. If these works were closed down, ruin would overtake the growers both in the Kimberleys ' and in the Northern Territory. While fault has been found by every anti-Labour government in my State with the government meat works, no ministry there has had the temerity to close them. Their establishment has resulted in the opening up of a portion of the State which had not previously been developed. The employees in the industry at the works receive the best of conditions. Although the Belgian market has been lost to the growers for two years, about 230 men have been employed for from six to eight months each season, and the meat has been London awaiting a market. The cattle in these vast areas are half wild, and consequently no opportunity is presented for the selection of stock for breeding purposes. This inferior meat has been purchased by Belgium to replace the horse flesh formerly consumed. The Belgian meat market is thus the cheapest in the world. The State Government provides ideal conditions for its employees, and affords",57,Imposts Into Australia From Belgium

For onVy 25s. a week the men enjoy a splendid table, the equal of which is not provided for the same tariff in any capital city. The living quarters are first class, there is an abundance of ice and cool drinks, and an excellent water supply. In addition, there is a picture show for the entertainment of the employees, who are a credit to Australia. I have no wish to set one industry against another, but I do say that this House should regard as of supreme importance the opening up of the back country of Australia. The question is: Are we to have a densely populated white race only in the more fertile parts of the continent, denuding of population the more vulnerable parts by making no provision for employment in them? There is a disposition on the part of honourable members who represent city electorates to look after their constituents there is no provision for Belgium to take at the expense of the people of country districts. The honourable member for Kennedy and I have a bigger task than the average member because of the size of our electorates. I always endeavour to stifle any feeling of parochialism with which I may be assailed, and which is quite natural. For instance, although a representative of a ""Western Australian electorate, I have always fought for the sugar industry of Queensland. The point that I have always made is that it is established in the tropics and is responquantity. If the Minister can clear up sible for 180,000 members of the white race being settled north of the tropic of Capricorn. For the first time in the history of the world, white men have beaten the nigger at what was supposed to be his job. Therefore, it is our duty to stand up and protect them. But I want to see established in the northern part of Australia another industry that will remain there; and the cattle industry is the only one which at the moment has a possibility of doing that. Optimists may say that tropical fruits may be grown there, but considerable difficulties have first to be overcome. No one, however, can say what the future may disclose. I consider that the Government has not in the negotiation of this treaty exercised that vision which we might have expected. An examination of the document shows that when the annual consumption in Australia is in excess of 7,500,000 square feet the share of the Australian manufacturers is to drop from 60 per cent, to 50 per cent. As last year the Australian Glass Company made 9,000,000 square feet, of which 8,000,000 square feet was used in Australia, we may say that from now onward the Australian manufacturer will be entitled to provide only one-half of the window glass consumed in this country. the excess quantity; he gets 60 per cent, up to 7,500,000 square feet. the Australian manufacturer is to have a very small share of the trade. In my opinion a better bargain could have been driven. I cannot help remarking, as several previous speakers have done, that a quota of our beef or barley. Presumably, it has merely to l if t the embargo. That is a one-sided arrangement. The Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr White) may say that Belgium is bound to take our meat, but I am not certain of that and consider that he has been outmanoeuvred.

We shall see directly whether there is a catch. I believe that there is. I endorse what has been said by the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) in regard to the placing of Australian window glass in such a way that the Australian manufacturers will not have to bear the C03t of consigning it to distant parts such as Perth, Adelaide and Hobart. That would make for cheaper glass, and have, a tendency to keep tbe Australian manufacturer intact, enabling him to compete on better terms in the large centres of population, thus conferring a benefit on all concerned.",58,Imposts Into Australia From Belgium

Probably the fact that Belgium has not been buying our meat in the last year or two has had something to do with the extraordinarily low prices which have been ruling for our frozen meat. It seems to me that there are not two tenable sides to this particular question.

The honourable gentleman tried to convey to this House that the restrictions on the entry of Belgian glass to this country were imposed by a Labour Government. That is not a fact; they were imposed by another Government. It was the Bruce-Page Government, of which the Minister was a member, that provided for the imposition of the deferred duties. The duties imposed by the Scullin Government were the Bruce-Page Government's duties. The Scullin Government merely imposed the deferred duties, but the present Government placed a prohibition against the importation of glass, and it was this action which brought about retaliation by Belgium, which lost to the cattle-growers of this country a share in the Belgian market for the last two are restricted by the which they themselves had imposed.

210,Mr White,"What the honorablefollowing letter has been reeeived by all honourable members from W. J. Smith, managing director of the Australian Window Glass Proprietary Limited:We thank you for your courtesy in advising us of your intention to submit the AustralianBelgian provisional agreement to Parliament in time for our representatives to be present to hear your speech in the House. We were naturally very interested in the announcement and we had been anxiously waiting for an indication of the Government's intention. that it was my intention to speak on this agreement. quibbles when he says that they were invited to attend. the proposals of the Government discussed in the press before an opportunity is given to members of the House to debate them. Continuing, the director of Australian Window Glass Proprietary theThe Limited saysThe agreement, restricting as it does the output of our factory to about 0,000,000 square feet per annum, wili necessarily result in a severe blow to us. A factory designed and equipped to produce 12,000,000 square feet of glass cannot hope to keep costs down to a proper level on the quantity now allotted to us. Both the shareholders and workers must inevitably suffer. Employment w ill unquestionably be affected. The agreement has not been made without cost. We do not concur in your statement that employment in the glass industry w ill not be greatly affected. We do not propose, however, to spend time in criticizing tlie agreement that has been signed and put into effect. The Government merely bring3 t h is agreement before the House, and, in effect, says, "" T a k e it or leave it ; r i g h t or w r o n g it w ill be p a t in to o p e r a t i o n "" . duction that must follow its restricted output, H o n o r a b l e members m i g h t discuss thi s matter u n t i l to-morrow m o r n in g , b u t the M in is t e r has d e f in ite l y made u p his m in d t h a t w h i l e we m a y discuss it , no o p p o r t u n it y w ill be g i v e n to vote u p o n it . The letter continuesWe are simply forced to accept it . We w ill, therefore, mention only two points in this letter. The first is that the Government has not been fair to us in forcing a restriction upon our output and then blaming us for it . We must very definitely differ from you in your statement that"" the action of the glass company in requesting the imposition of the deferred duty prior to the date on which it had been deferred, and years before it was in a position to produce glass, has brought about the present position "". When we asked for the imposition oi the protective duties to stop the flooding of this market with imported glass the Government recognized such action to be necessary if wewere to be enabled to start this new industry. We gave an undertaking to have our factory in production before the stocks then in the Commonwealth were depleted, and we did as we promised, but, as your department well knows, we met with obstacles that hindered successful production for a few months (not years). There was, however, never any serious shortage of glass, and at the most a few hundred boxes imported under by-law would have got over the period of temporary anxiety. I merely informed them The cause of the hindrance to our production is well known and should have called forth a little sympathetic consideration from you The honourable member and not adverse criticism. It was not the imposition of the duty that brought about the present trouble-it was the removal of the duty that did it . If the Bruce-Page rate of duty on glass, which was imposed by the Scullin Government, had been left alone, there would have been no trouble from Belgium or any one else. second point we would mention is that Government could now lessen the damage to the Australian industry without a.ffecting the quota from Belgium, by directing the imported glass to certain Australian pnrts. In the past the Australian glass has sold, landed at each capital port, at the one price. This has meant that freight from Sydney to Fremantle. or to Port Adelaide, or Hobart, has been paid by the Australian manufacturer. If the imported glass were directed mainly to those ports which are farthest from Sydney the whole of the requirements of the three smaller States would be supplied without extra rnst to the foreign suppliers and without extra cost to the importers. Seeing that Western Australia is particularly interested in meat, and South Australia in barley, we suggest that they might have major portion of Belgium's quota of glass. This will leave more of the market in New South Wales and Victoria to the Australian company and save them the coastal freights to the distant ports. Tn view of the greatly increased costs of protho. Australian manufacturer must either reduce distribution costs or pass them on to the buyers concerned. Such an increase in costs may be at least partially avoided if the Government directs most of the imported glass to the States of Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. We would, therefore, urge you to lessen the blow to this industry and at the same time assist in keeping the cost of glass in the smaller States down to the level of the price in New South Wales and Victoria by dircctinj; the imported glass to ports that w i ll reduce the payment of coastal freight on Australian glass to a mimimum. As this letter is a brief reply to your speech in the House, in which we consider ynu did not put our case quite fairly, we are forwarding a copy to each member of the House of Representatives.",61,Imposts Into Australia From Belgium

213,Mr Riordan,"Onc e again we haveI n view of the cock-sureness of the Minisan equal purchase of meat for glasster for Trade and Customs on this subject, and for that matter on every other one that he discusses, I felt that it was proper I should read this letter so that it could bo incorporated in Hansard and circulated widely. It sets out the case clearly from the point of view of the company. The Minister, and also his colleague, the Minister for the Interior tried to saddle the Scullin Government, with the blame for the loss of our meat trade with Belgium. The fact is that the muddling of the Lyons Government, and its interference with the deferred duties provided by the Bruce-Page Government, were solely responsible for the loss that our meat producers have incurred in this respect during the last two years. Trade and Customs) [11.1] -Honor able gentleman opposite have shown clearly that they have been hard put to it to criticize this agreement. Even though the representatives from Western Australia who sit with the Opposition have drawn largely on their eloquence in the endeavour to fault tile agreement, they which he has just read in preference to have failed to do so. I ignore the remarks made by honourable gentlemen who have merely tried to be personal. In fairness to the window glass manufacturing company I directed the department to inform them on the day previous to the tabling of the agreement that our twelve months' negotiations with the Government of Belgium had reached finality. I regret that an endeavour has been made to make political capital out of that action. We must remember that the Government of Belgium had actually prohibited the importation of Australian meat into Belgium. The prohibition of the importation of Australian barley into Belgium was withheld only at the urgent request of the Government. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) should take that important fact into consideration. If be would prefer a straight-out agreement that Belgium should purchase £1S,000 worth of beef from Australia and that Australia should purchase £18,000 worth of window glass from Belgium-and Belgium at one time proposed let lum say so. I do not think that his constituents would be pleased with him if he did so. The Government has made an excellent agreement, for it has left open an unlimited market for certain Australian products in Belgium. We should do well to remember that for very many. years our trade to Belgium was worth ten times Belgium's trade to Australia. The barley grown in South Australia is of a type acceptable to Belgium. Our competitors for that trade are mainly Algeria and Turkey, and we found that we could not divert this barley to British or other markets. It is of course, impossible for me in the few minutes at my disposal to tell the ful l story of the twelve months' negotiation of this agreement. If honourable members opposite knew everything that had happened they would realize that the Government had acted greatly to the advantage of Australia. Had the honourable member for Kennedy( Mr Riordan) in particular known all tbe facts he would not have been prepared to accept ex parte statements such as those in the letter the statements of responsible members of the Government. The policy of this Government has been definitely beneficial to Australian secondary industries. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Forde) repeated to-night the story that we have heard so often from him that the Scullin Government's policy had resulted in the employment of many additional people in our secondary industries. But we know very well that the number of people in employment in Australia decreased month by month throughout the life of that Government. Since this Government has been in office the number of factory employees in Australia has increased by 68,000. The' Australian Glass Manufacturers Company Limited actually enjoyed the benefits of an embargo for two years, although it was not entitled to such consideration. The den) put his point of view with much more dignity than that shown by the honourable member for Kennedy. He was naturally alarmed at the prospect of the falling off of employment in this industry in his electorate. But the",62,Imposts Into Australia From Belgium

215,Honourable Member For Cook ( Mr Gar,"636 prospects of the industry have not suffered, for the honourable member for ""Wakefield ( Mr Hawker) was correct in saying that the value of the shares of this company had increased slightly since the announcement of the agreement with Belgium. The honourable member produced a list of names and said that these men were naturally afraid that they would lose employment. Naturally any individual would feel concerned if his job were placed in jeopardy; but when I asked the honourable member if any of these men had received notice of dismissal he replied: "" No "" . I think no one will be dismissed ; because the Australian industry has an assured market of 60 per cent, of the Australian trade, and 50 per cent, of any increase of trade that may eventuate. How many other industries enjoy such favorable conditions! This treaty was not just handed out to us by Belgium when we asked for it. It was only finalized after a great deal of negotiation. Over and over again in this HouseI was asked what progress was being made in these negotiations; and not being in a position to divulge such information, I hadl to bear tihe odium of the criticism levelled at me on such occasions and simply reply that certain progress had been made. Now that the treaty has come down I appreciate the fact that from the other side it has been commended more than condemned. Honourable members opposite find themselves hard put to it to criticize the treaty. works and put men out of employThe main point in the criticism is that a departure had been made from ordinary procedure in dealing with such matters. But the procedure followed by the Government was justified. If we follow the train of events leading up to the treaty the position was that in 1925 the Tariff Board recommended certain deferred duties of l ^ d . per lb. and 40 per cent. British or 2d. per lb., and 60 per cent, foreign, with an immediate revenue impost of 2s. British and 4s. foreign. Successive Ministers acting under the power conferred upon them under the act, published notices in the Gazette deferring the deferred rates which the Tariff Board had recommended should not be applied until December, 1930; but the Scullin Government put these deferred duties into If r . White. Adjournment. [EEPRESEI TATIVES.] Adjournment. operation on the 30th July, 1930. That was ithe beginning of all the trouble. The deferred duties were imposed before the industry was ready. At that stage it was inefficient, and' later it was reported as inefficient by the Tariff Board. I admit that it is now operating on an efficient basis. The embargo was re-imposed because of reasons put forward by the den). A delegation representative of both sides of the House and of employees in tbe industry waited on the Government, and the Government feared that if no embargo was imposed to counteract the flood of imports it might create unemployment. The embargo was subsequently continued, but it was only conditional on there being no scarcity in Australia. Honourable members who were in this chamber at that time are aware that there was subsequently no scarcity of window glass in Australia. The Australian company stood up to its obligations under this arrangement but recently for a while was unable to meet the demand. I cannot understand the honourable member for Cook saying that the company now has large stocks at its disposal. The honourable gentleman must have got that information somewhere. How can the company have such large stocks on hand when recently it could not meet demands! It made representations to the Government a year ago that if the embargo were lifted it would have to close its ment. In the interim an inquiry has been carried out by the Tariff Board, and in the interim also Belgium definitely put a prohibition on Australian beef, a large quantity of which comes from the Wyndham meat works, which are situated in the electorate represented by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green). The manager of those works, together with others, came here as a deputation to ask the Government if it could not do something to counteract Belgium's action. The Government has taken action with that end in view, but it has not achieved its object without having to face many difficulties. quotas which I oppose.",63,Imposts Into Australia From Belgium

238,Mr Makin,"Has the Government anySir HEN RY GULLETT -We have every reason to anticipate that we shall hold it under the most-favoured nation treatment, which we shall enjoy. I am not surprised that the honourable member should feel some apprehension on the point, because the South Australian export trade in barley is vitally aifected by an agreement which will enable us to continue the sale of our surplus production. Our great problem now is to sell a rapidly-increasing production in rapidlyAustralian barley. Tliere was a deferred contracting world markets. Unless we overcome this difficultyI hope that we shall as the result of trade negotiations with other countries-ou r chief concern will be, not the unemployment of a few score of workmen, but the lowering of the standard of living for every man, woman and child in Australia. On this point I present a few figures so that honourable gentlemen who are opposing the Government in this matter may realize the difficulties that confront us. The successful October, but unforeseen conditions must delay disposal of our surplus production is not a party political matter. As every one knows, on tbe measure and value of that surplus, depends the prosperity of every Australian industry. If we compare our exports for 1933 and 1934 with the average exports for the four years ended 1928-29, we shall find that our export of barley was doubled, that of mutton and lamb increased two and a quarter times, that of butter increased two and a half times, that of eggs increased by nine times, that of canned fruits by three and a half times, and that of sugar, raisins, and currants was doubled. These facts surely bring home to honourable members the folly of attempting to oppose an agreement of this kind. The honourable member for Cook( Mr Garden) has admitted that so far no one has lost employment as the result of this agreement, and, at most, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, the effect might be to throw a few score of men out of work. To-night the honourable member for Cook mentioned a petition from 300 workers employed by the Australian Glass Company, but did not suggest that any of them had either lost or were in danger of losing their jobs. I undertake to say if one went around Australia with a petition to be signed by those who will benefit from the improved export trade in barley, frozen meat, and other products affected by this agreement, one could quite easily obtain the signatures of thousands of farmers. It is desirable that I should direct attention to the particular action which caused exasperation in Belgium and induced the Government of that country to take drastic action against Australia, by threatening to place an embargo against the importation of duty on sheet glass in 1930. The Tariff Board bad recommended that it be deferred until the 30th August of that year, but the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eorde), when Minister for Trade and Customs, brought the date back to the 30th June. At the annual meeting of the Australian Glass Company five, days later, the chairmansaidUnder normal conditions, construction and installation of this industry was planned for its gettinginto production for an indefinite period. That was the response of this great company to the encouraging gesture from the Government! A year later, in June, 1931, the chairman of the company saidBuildings now are complete, furnaces are now ready. We are now installing the machines. Not until August, 1932, two years and three months after the prohibitive duty had been put on, did this company actually come into consistent production. Such favorable treatment is without precedent in the history of protection in Australia. The company produced glass intermittently before that time, but it brought about unemployment in the building trade, and the supply of glass was always short. Speaking from memory, I suspended the duties in the early part of 1932, to relieve the building trade and admit, under by-law, glass from overseas to the value of £3,400; but not a word against that action was said in this House. In the case of the present agreement, the House was informed of the Government's decision on the day on which the agreement was signed. The action of this company has exasperated Belgium, and has led to retaliation by that country. It is astonishing to hear the honourable member for CookO Mr Garden) speaking in a most sympathetic manner about great monopolies. It is novel to have my right honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Australian manufacturers. Scullin), after his campaign against the banks, supporting this extraordinary company which has misused protection and up3et Belgium, with which for years Australia has enjoyed a favorable trade balance in the proportion of ten to one. The company should have pioneered this new branch of its business, and not loafed on Australia. The Australian Glass Manufacturers Company Limited came into existence as the result of a merger in 1922. Since that date it has declared net profits to the amount of £1,750,000. business. tralian Glass Manufacturers Company holds 289,000 out of 300,000 shares in the Sheet Glass Company. The latter is a dummy company; in reality, it is the Australian Glass Manufacturers Company. of disclosed profits, that company has paid £1,250,000 in dividends, and has put amount of £500,000. Further, it has paid off £250,000 as depreciation on land and plant that had been greatly expanded during the years in which they were depreciated. Moreover, there is every reason to believe that it has supporters advocated during the election still further undisclosed reserves. Yet our friends opposite, who pose as the champions of the workers, and the opponents of monopolies, are now found supporting big vested interests. [Leave to continue given.] Honourable members listened a few nights ago to a long recital by the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Baker) of big vested allied interests in Australia, The last dividends paid by the company were 9 per cent, on debentures, and 9 per cent, on ordinary shares; but now, because it is asked to suffer some small setback after the enormous privileges it has enjoyed under protection and the amazing profits it has obtained, it is suggested that, owing to this agreement with Belgium, some of its employees may be put out of work. With great respect to Australian manufacturers, I have no hesitation in saying that if this agreement results in men being put out of work after all that has been done to assist secondary industries in this country, it will be a great blot on The discussion of an agreement already signed by the contracting parties demonstrates the farce of Parliament being allowed to function in its present form. ber is distinctly out of order. I have called him to order frequently for similar reflections upon Parliament. speak the truth within the limited scope of the Standing Orders. ber is again out of order. I remind him that the Standing Orders are the Standing Orders of this House. outside who review the situation that Parliament is reducing itself to a farce. Although this discussion may give the Out of the £1,750,000 protagonists of the Australian Glass Company an opportunity to defend it, and the alleged opponents of monopolies the by disclosed reserves to the opportunity to attack it, no tangible results will be achieved. The agreement having been signed, and Parliament not having an opportunity to amend it, shows that the policy now adopted by the Government is a negation of that which its campaign. I remember the right honourable member for Cowper (Dr. Earle Page) vigorously protesting against any form of restriction. The electors thought that when honourable members spoke of restrictions, they were speaking only of restricting the export of surplus production, and not of restricting the production of an Australian commodity required on the local market. The Government has stated repeatedly that the solution of the unemployment problem must have priority over all other matters, and that the only way in which unemployment can be reduced is by stimulating private enterprise. Yet, in this instance, we find that private enterprise, instead of being stimulated, is to be restricted, and the Australian worker is to have fewer opportunities to secure employment.",67,Imposts Into Australia From Belgium

252,Mr Thobby,"Does that apply to therithe glass industry as well as to other industries. I am not putting up a plea for the Australian Glass Company, because I have no doubt that it avails itself of every opportunity to slash the wages of -the workers and . lower their conditions, as is done by every private individual who controls an industry in this -country. The point I make is that this is a low-wage Government. It believes in the policy of reducing the costs of production. I have heard the honourable member for Calare( Mr Thorby) refer repeatedly to the burdens borne by industry. He has said that all rural awards should be suspended and that the conditions provided for by the Hut Accommodation Act of New South Wales should be abolished. shall read from Hansard the speech of the honourable member in which the statement occurs. He has opposed every piece -of humane legislation that Labour governments have placed on the statute books of this country. Yet he now talks about the preservation of white labour -conditions, and the existence in other countries of a form of slave labour! It can at least be said that in the old day3, when a chattel slavery existed, a -certain value was placed on a slave, and <;ven when he was denied employment, he was cared for because of that fact. Under the existing social system, however, so soon as industry cannot provide profitable employment for a worker it throws him on the industrial scrapheap. No consideration is given as to how he or those who are dependent on him eke out an existence. I am aware of the difficulties that confront the Government. As a matter of fact, they are -economic difficulties that will not be over-come by either this Administration or this Parliament, if an attempt is made to deal with them on the present basis of society. The same difficulty confronts -governments in every country of the world where there is a similar economic structure. I candidly admit that I believe in the complete reconstruction of society. I have no wish to protect monopolies such as the Australian. Glass Company merely in order that they might have an opportunity to exploit the Australian workers and consumers. Nor am I here as an advocate for overseas monopolies, to give them the right to exploit Australian workers and consumers. While the present order is allowed to exist, however, it is at least advantageous to preserve as much employment as we can for our own people, and to ensure that they receive wages that permit of their living in a decent state of comfort. Honourable members opposite, who are the champions of private enterprise, have said that one of the reasons for the reduction of taxation within the last couple of years was to give private enterprise an opportunity to expand and thus to reduce the number of unemployed workers. Here is a company which, at the invitation of the Government, extended its operations. It says that it is able to provide for the production annually of 12,000,000 square feet of this particular glass; yet its opportunities to produce are to be limited. Honourable members opposite may be able to tell us exactly in what way they intend to deal with tbe situation in relation to unemployment while believing on the one hand in restricting the exports of our primary products and intending on the other hand to -limit the opportunity of secondary industries to meet the requirements of the local market, and at the same time being opposed to the inauguration of government works. Only in those three directions may the unemployed be absorbed or their number lessened. The one conclusion to which this discussion leads us is that the unemployed) will receive no consideration whatever from this Government; they are to be mercilessly scrapped or passed over. If I am not permitted to make the statement here, I shall make it from every public platform-that the faTce of Parliament member's time has expired.
