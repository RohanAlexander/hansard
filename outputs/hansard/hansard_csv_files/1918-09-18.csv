Before we had recovered from theshock of this intelligence, a cablegram gave us the sad and unexpected news' of the death in London of the Right HonorableSir George Reid, at one-time PrimeM in ister of the Commonwealth, and our first High Commissioner in Great Britain. There is something peculiarly tragic in the coincidence that these two eminent,, and I think I may say unique, personalities, who for a generation were political foes but personal friends, and figured so* .conspicuously in the consummation and development of our Federal Union, should pass out into the Great Beyond almost simultaneously! The Government proposes to ask the House to mark the national sorrow in an appropriate manner by adjourning as a token of respect to the memory of these departed statesmen. As the first step, for the regretful, b u t unanimous, concurrence, of honourable members, I wish to submit the following; motion:That this House places on record its profound regret at tbe loss the Commonwealth' has sustained in the death of the late member able Lord Forrest, P.C, G.C.M.G., LL .

I propose to briefly mention some of the landmarks, of his remarkable life.

While regretting the occasion that calls for its submission, I second it with pleasure, because the longer I remain in the political arena the more faith I have in the sincerity of my political opponents. Our emotions at the death of the two distinguished statesmen whose services are thus to be placed on record are not quite of the same character as those we experience when a young and brilliant member, such as was the late Mr Alfred Roberts, passes suddenly away. perience, the in this case, because both Lord Forrest and Sir George Reid had lived beyond the allotted span of three score years and ten. Their lives were full and complete.' For over thirty years they had served in the public life of Australia. Premier of New .South Wales and of the Commonwealth, while Lord Forrest had beeu the first Premier of the State of Western Australia, and had held office as Treasurer of the Commonwealth. The Federal Parliament has been spoken of as a place to which State politicians bring high reputations only to lose them. That oould not be said of either Lord Forrest or Sir George Reid, since they both added lustre to the distinctions they had gained in their respective States. Both were bom leaders of men; but they belonged to the old, rather than to the modern school of politics. They grew up in the days of Parnell and Gladstone, of Sir Henry Parkes and Sir George Dibbs, when the political leader created the political party. For good or ill , in these modern times-it may be a permanent or a transient phase of public life -the political party creates the political leader. Both of these statesmen were democratically inclined, although Sir George Reid would venture further in experimental legislation, especially when supported by a strong party, than would Lord Forrest, who always believed in ""hastening slowly."" Both men had much in common,, and yet they were different-Lord Forrest always dignified, courteous, and kindly; Sir George Reid witty, good-natured, and benevolent. ""Both had their faults; though at the moment I cannot remember what they were. Whatever their faults, their great abilities and their achievements have placed their names on the scroll of fame, and in our school books, and in the histories of our land, their records will be placed for young Australia to try to emulate. They might have chosen an easier life. They worked for honour and distinction, not for monetary gain-for the love of their country and its people. As I have said, we felt no painful shock at the sad news,, but our hearts go out iu sympathy to the relatives, who could not We do not expart with such noble characters without same painful shock the most poignant grief. The fine qualities which attracted to their standards men of the world outsidej must have inspired, both for Lord Forrest and Sir George Eeid, the most passionate love .and . affection in the hearts of their nearest and dearest relatives. Sir George Reid had been We must all be especially mo fed when we think of that beautiful character, Lady Forrest, who was not only a devoted wife, but a constant. companion, now a lonely and pathetic figure, who will rarely, if ever, be seen again within the walls of this Parliament, where there is so much to remind her of her irreparable loss. The motion which we propose to place on the records of our Parliament will, let us hope, assuage the grief of the sorrowing ones, and make their sad loss a little easier to bear, since it will show' that we, on behalf of the public whom we represent, are proud to do lasting honour to the memory of their distinguished relatives. joining with the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) and the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) in.regretting the death of two eminent Australian",20,Setup

5,Mr Fowler (Perth) [3.19],"Whil ekind words are justly said of men after statesmen, I wish more particularly, as the senior Western Australian representative in this House, and as one who enjoyed the intimate friendship of the late Lord Forrest, to thank both honourable gentlemen for the sympathetic and appreciative tributes they have paid to the memory of deeply mourned son of the Western State. well as by political friends, the late Lord Forrest was esteemed, I might say loved, above all other members, perhaps, who ever sat in this Parliament. truly great men, he had a noble simplicity of character which attracted not only admiration, but personal affection. . The keynote of his public career was an in tense loyalty to his native land and to the Empire. cherished high and unselfish ideals, and to work for these was to him as the very breath of life. Warm-hearted, whitesouled, and clean-handed, Lord Forrest w ill take a foremost place amongst our nation-builders; and his example w ill , I hope and pray, inspire many other sons of Australia to follow in his footsteps. As one who knew Lord Forrest as far back as 1897, and had been associated with him in politics for about twenty-one years, I should like to make a few remarks, more particularly as I wish to prefer a request to theActing Prime Minister( Mr Watt) in regard to a matter he has mentioned to-day. I went to Western Australia so long ago as 1893. My first experience of Lord Forrest was when, as chairman of a progress committee at Menzies, where fever was very preva-. lent and the hospital accommodation very primitive, I wired a lengthy telegram to the. honourable gentleman asking for assistance. The next day, through the warden of the goldfields, advice was received that £500 would be available for the work we desired to do. I only mention this to show the care that Lord Forrest always took of those who went to Western Australia in the early days of the goldfields. It is noteworthy what the State Government and people of Western Australia did to help those who were pioneering the out-back goldfields at that time, when railways were rushed forward, telegraph lines set up, and water supply provided. I do not think that in the development of any new country under the sun so much work of the kind was ever done so rapidly. The conceptions of the deceased gentleman were as great as his courage in carrying them out. The great water scheme for the goldfields represented an enormous sum of money in view of the handf u l of people who were asked to expend this distinguished and it-a n expenditure, I desire to impress on the House, proposed by Lord Forrest By political opponents, as almost in opposition to the goldfields people themselves. I , amongst many others on the fields at that time, was opposed, to the expenditure, and the circumLike all stance is mentioned merely to show the great confidence that Lord Forrest had at that time in his country. A f t e r the deceased gentleman l e f t Western Australia, and came to the Federal Parliament, I am satisfied no member on either In both regards he side earned the same loyal respect and, I think I am justified in saying, the love of all members of the Chamber, and there is no man whose loss will be more generally regretted. We understand that the remains of Lord Forrest have been interred at Sierra Leone, and the request to which I have referred is that the Government shall at a later period consider the question of removing these remains to Western Australia. Nothing would please the people of that State more than to know that the Government had determined, when the opportunity permits, that the body of this distinguished statesman should be brought back and receive here, in his native country, that honour which his memory deserves. Monaro) [3.28] I endorse all that has been said, because I feel that in Lord ForrestI have lost the greatest and best friend I ever had. I thank the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt) and the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) for the kind words used by them to-day. No one more than myself knew or loved the late Lord Porrest, and I hope that the suggestion made by the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) will be carried out. When I look round the chamber, as one who came here at the inception of Australian Federation, I am reminded of the strenuous l if e that most of us lead. Although there are some sixty members present, I cannot see more than four who came here with the late right honourable member for Swan and myself. It has occurred to me that, while many",22,Setup

I have had considerable experience, and have seen some of the ups and downs of political life, and I realize that even amongst my strongest opponents there are some very good fellows. There is no necessity, when we are all aiming at the one goal of trying to achieve the best for the country we love so well, .to introduce any spirit of bitterness into this House. I have no desire to lecture honourable members, but I must say that of late there seems a disposition to make matters more personal than in the old days. When I look back to the captains of the first Ministry, of which I had the honour to be the Whip, I can recall the good feeling that then prevailed amongst us all. . As an example of this I may mention the late Sir George Reid, with whom I had been in Parliament here and elsewhere for nearly twenty-eight years. We both took an active politics, and yet we any cause for quarrelling; there was no necessity.
