7,Sir Robert Menzies,"Mr Speaker,Attorney-General concerning the action taken by the South Australian Government in the High Court eighteen months ago to compel the Commonwealth to proceed with the standardization of the railway between Port Pirie and Broken Hill under the act sponsored by the Commonwealth Government in 1949. I ask the honourable gentleman: What was the amount of the legal costs which the Commonwealth incurred in successfully resisting the South Australian that the honourable gentleman would not claim in the case in which the South Australian Government was ordered to pay the Commonwealth's costs? Speaker, this is not information which I have by me, but I will ascertain it and communicate it to the honourable gentleman. the Minister for Labour and National Service. It concerns the employment of juveniles. Can the Minister give the House any impression of the number of young people who left school at the end of last year and are now still unemployed, and the numbers that have become employed in the meantime? honourable gentleman all the ngures relating to juveniles in employment, but I can give the figures relating to school-leavers. In the six months period ended 31st March last, a little over 65,000 schoolleavers were registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service. There are now fewer than 11,400 of these on the register. Of the latter perhaps 3,800 or 3,900 are young male school leavers. I think this is a remarkable performance on the part of the Commonwealth Employment Service. There were 82,000 school leavers registered last year, and 65,000 through the Christmas period and up to the end of March. There are now only 3,900 male school-leavers registered as unemployed. I think the Commonwealth Employment Service is doing a remarkably good job, especiaUy in applying its talents to ensuring that school-leavers are placed in employment as quickly as possible. to the Minister for Territories.

As a statement on the potential of Queensland rivers, made by the Minister for National Development in Cairns recently, indicates that the Australian Water Resources Council has now reached a stage where some results of its studies are available to the public, can the Minister say at this early stage whether it is intended to produce a regular publication of these results for the public use? If it is not so intended, what method will be employed to make the results of the council's work available to a vitally interested community and particularly to those organizations and individuals in the drier inland whose future hinges so much on a well-conceived water policy? which is administered by my colleague, the Minister for National Development.

Is he aware that the steel pipes being imported from Japan to convey oil from the Moonie field in Queensland are made of Australian pig iron? Is he aware that this has been made possible because the Government lifted the embargo on the export of pig iron from Australia? Does the Government's policy of processing Australian resources overseas and importing manufactured articles contribute to Australian development and the protection of our overseas funds? expected the honourable member to know that for very many years there was a prohibition on the export of iron ore from Australia, based on the proposition that we must conserve our own resources of iron ore. At the time when this prohibition existed our resources were regarded as being quite limited. Recent finds have disclosed enormous additional supplies of iron ore in Australia, and under these circumstances the Government felt that it was possible to permit a limited export of iron ore, which would help in the development of certain fields. It has done. so. I had not understood until now that the honourable member or the Labour Party criticized this decision. to the Minister for Labour and National Service.

Some time ago the honourable gentleman said that the officers of the Department of Immigration would inquire into the reasons why immigrants eligible for naturalization, numbering about 250,000, had not applied for naturalization.

I think the barefiguresmentioned for the Brunei rebels against the proposed by the honourable member do not give a true Federation of Malaysia, for the Viet Cong picture of the situation, because many more persons are engaged in actual trade work in our mission in Japan. In addition, the comparison between the numbers of trade representatives in Japan and in New Zealand does not give a complete picture because of the difference in the kind of trade carried on between Australia and those two countries. In Japan we are concerned mainly with bulk commodities like wool, wheat, metals and coal, whereas in New Zealand we are concerned principally with a wide variety of manufactured goods. In fact, I think about 40 per cent, of our total exports of manufactured goods goes to New Zealand. Basically, therefore, there must be a difference in representation in the two countries. However, consideration is being given at present to the establishment of a further trade post in Japan and also to an increase in the total trade representation there. In addition, arrangements are now being made for further trade publicity in Japan, and those arrangements will be finalized in the very near future. the Postmaster-General.

In pursuance of its statutory obligation the Public Accounts Committee examined in detail the comments of the Auditor General in his reports for the financial year 1961-62. Following that examination a series of public inquiries were held relating to certain of the comments made by the Auditor-General and the results of those inquiries are recorded in this sixtyfirst report of the committee. We were pleased to note that the incidence of critical comment by the Auditor General was less than in previous years. This situation indicates the value of the annual investigations the committee has been conducting and it is gratifying that the Auditor-General's adverse comments have become less numerous. In this report we refer to the delay by the Department of Customs and Excise in furnishing covering instructions to the Attorney-General's Department for the amendment of certain regulations. However, when investigating this matter, the committee was pleased to note that the necessity to amend those regulations had arisen from commendable action by the department to improve its administrative procedures. The committee would like to think that all departments maintain continuous reviews of this nature. The committee has commented also in this report on the somewhat disturbing situation which exists in the office of the Parliamentary Draftsman from the shortage of specialized legal officers. As the functions of that oflice are vital to the efficiency of governmental administration, as well as to the adherence to essential legal forms, the committee trusts that the staffing problem involved will receive urgent attention although it appreciates that there is no immediate solution.

The general basis of the legislation is a requirement that insurers maintain deposits with the Treasurer which are available to satisfy any final judgment obtained by a policy-holder in respect of a claim made Lung Cancer-Wa r Service Homesunder this policy, or to distribute to such claimants in the event of the insurer going into liquidation. The purpose of this bill is to remove a weakness in the existing legislation which provides in effect that claims for refunds of premiums as well as claims in respect of risks insured may be paid from the deposit. In recent cases of insurance companies which have gone into liquidation claims for refunds of premiums, individually small, have in total represented substantial amounts. The sharing of the deposit with Britain by the Royal College of Physicians persons with such claims considerably in London dealing with the connection reduces the amount of the deposit available between smoking and lung cancer.

In reply the Treasurer saidThe honourable member raises some interesting policy questions which rather get outside the range of normal Treasury decision and advice. Looking at this very interesting and highly controversial matter from the viewpoint of the Treasurer, if there should be a general disposition throughout Australia to give up the. smoking of cigarettes, then I am afraid the Treasury will have to look to other sources of revenue to make up lhe loss of revenue involved. That was the negative reply given by a member of the Menzies Ministry to a positive suggestion for maintaining the heallh of future generations. If you study my question, you will find that I referred to the future health of our youth. I am going 10 emphasize and re-emphasize to the Government the utterly scandalous situation that exists in the community. Company executives who are greedy for wealth, dishonest and corrupt, because of their actions through advertising in enticing the youth of our nation who is so pious, a supporter of the Government who says he is very concerned about the youth of this country. I repeat that these people are greedy, dishonest and corrupt people who are using the advertising media to entice the youth of our nation to take up smoking. According to the advertisements, it is the fashionable thing to do. If you remain at home and look at television you will see advertisements showing young people at parties taking cigarettes and saying: "" This is the thing. Be gay. Be in the mood."" Not just one manufacturer of cigarettes but all manufacturers are using the powerful medium of television to entice our youth into smoking. These people know that smoking will affect the health of future generations. Not only is television being used to advertise cigarettes, but so also are newspapers, radio and posters. Even though the warning of the wise people of the Royal College of Physicians was given over twelve months ago, no restraint has been shown in the use of the advertising to influence our young people to smoke. The Treasurer and other members of this Government are concerned only with the revenue obtained from cigarettes. This is a responsibility, not only of the Federal Government, but also of the State governments through their educational systems. Let me be frank about this, however. The real power lies in this Parliament. interjecting. I hope that when we on this side of the House are in control of the Parliament and the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is the Treasurer, he will take steps to see that the costs of advertising cigarettes are non-deductible for taxation purposes. If that measure will not curb this advertising madness, we should go further and impose a sales tax or a super-sales tax on advertising to make sure that the tobacco monopolies do not impair the health of the youth of our nation. I am a non-smoker. I do not want to be pious about this and say that because I do not smoke other people should not smoke. I am not trying to say to people, "" You should give up smoking because it is wrong and evil "". I was a prisoner-of-war during the last war. We were locked up and confined in certain places. I saw intelligent men, even though we were on starvation rations, give away their food for cigarettes. One of the doctors in our camp a marvellous man-use d to give away his breakfast every morning for a packet of ten cigarettes, because he thought he could get a certain satisfaction from the cigarettes. It is very difficult for smokers to give up the habit, although I know it is possible for some to taper it off. My call this morning is not confined to people who already smoke, although I think they should show restraint. I am concerned mostly about the youth of the nation, who should not be influenced by television in this so-called affluent society, to take up smoking. In picture theatres, also, when the lights go out after the intermission, and members of the audience expect the main film to come on, they see a five-minute wide-screen advertisement in colour, the climax of which is the appearance of a certain brand of cigarette and a statement that it is a good smoke, one which a man can be proud to enjoy and to offer to others and that the smoker is a manly man.",20,Supply Grievance Day

I wish to refer to one aspect of the war service homes legislation. I would like first to pay a tribute to both' the Government and the responsible Minister for the manner in which this act has been administered. This period of administration has been one of achievement. During this Government's term of office more than 170,000 ex-servicemen have been assisted to obtain homes. The amount of the individual advance for this purpose has been increased from £2,000 to £3,500. During this period also the total amount of money provided under the act is in excess of £400,000,000. This Government has extended eligibility for assistance under the which I have referred. I know that the act to nurses who served with the Australian forces in time of war. This is a very progressive step. Even more importantly, it was a just step, because these women served their country in time of war just as surely as the men did. In my opinion the amendment to the legislation did not go far enough. It limited the eligibility to nurses with dependants or those about to marry. War widows, quite rightjy, are entitled to The additional finance which would be war service homes finance, whether they have dependants or not. A number of the nurses are unmarried and others have no dependants, but they still require homes. In my opinion they have qualified, through service to the country, for housing finance at the lowest rate of interest available. This, of course, is war service homes finance. The Returned Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia has consistently supported the proposition that the prqposal which has already been sponthese women should be eligible for assissored by a number of members in this tance. The Government's point of view, which I think is reasonable, is that while there are ex-servicemen with dependants still awaiting assistance, it is not logical to give priority to single people with no dependants. Although nearly 250,000 ex-servicemen have already been assisted, applications are still coming in and there is no indication that this trend will not continue for a considerable time. If we are to wait until the needs of all ex-servicer men with dependants have been satisfied, assistance. It is already too late to assist the nurses of World WarI , because those who are still living are either 70 years of age or approaching that age. World War II has been over for 18 years and a number of nurses and ex-servicewomen who served in that war are already 50 years of age. Those who have reached that age have not a great many .working years ahead of them. If we postpone assisting them much longer they not be in a position to pay off their homes. I believe that now is the time to help them, while they are still young enough to appreciate homes of their own and are still able to go to work. There are not a great many women in the categories to organizations to which they belong would greatly appreciate the Government making available only a few homes in each State each year, in order to show in tangible form its appreciation of the service rendered to Australia by these gallant women in its hour of need. Earlier this year the Government increased the annual allocation for war service homes from £30,000,000 to £35,000,000. required for twenty homes for nurses or other ex-servicewomen without dependants and who may not be. covered by the existing legislation-in order that ex-servicemen with dependants may not be prejudicedwould be only £75,000.

73,Mr Fox (Henty) [11.32],"Mr Speaker,House. The proposal is that the Commonwealth Government should assist charitable organizations which are prepared to provide accommodation and workshops for physically or mentally handicapped people. These people are prepared to help themselves. At present, if they do nothing at all, the Government has to support them and pay them either the unemployment benefit or the invalid pension. They thus become a charge on the Commonwealth. Most of these people have some earning capacity. In effect this is a capacity to relieve the Commonwealth Government of some of its financial commitment, so I believe that common sense demands that they should be helped. I referred previously to organizations in Victoria which are known as special schools. They may exist also in other States. They cater for children whose I.Q. is not up to normal standards, but is not low enough for them to be classed as mentally retarded. The result is that they exist in a political no-man's land. When these children reach sixteen years of age they cease to be the responsibility of the Education Department. As I have said, their I.Q. is too high for them to be brought under the wing of the mental hygiene department or the Department of Health. At the normal schoolleaving age of sixteen years they register for employment. If the Commonwealth Employment Service is unable to find them suitable employment, they have to be paid the unemployment benefit. With extra training many of these children could obtain and hold jobs. At present the financial responsibility for them falls on the parents. Some people may argue that is fair enough. But if the parents choose to do nothing for these young people the Commonwealth has to bear the financial responsibility. It has to pay them either the unemployment benefit or the invalid pension. In order to qualify for the invalid pension the young people must be 80 per cent, incapacitated, and many of them would not have much difficulty in proving that degree of incapacity. We can argue, with some justification, that these people are the responsibility of the State. But from a business point of view, if not from the point of view of political expediencyif we are not prepared to regard this matter from a humanitarian point of view-w e should do everything we can to reduce the number of these persons registered for employment and who are a charge on the Commonwealth purse. I take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the House the plight of some 4,000 or 6,000 pensioners in my electorate. Those people are very concerned over the directions that have been given to their doctors by the Government's medical service committee of inquiry. The doctors have been told that they are attending many of their pensioner patients too frequently. In many cases in which the doctors have been advised by Macquarie-street specialists or by hospitals that their patients need treatment, say, twice a week, the committee has ruled that treatment once a week is sufficient. It is all very well for the doctors who are members of the committee to adopt that attitude. They sit in a comfortable room and give the orders. They should come with me and see some of these pensioners whom they say are receiving treatment too often. I think that if they did so they would change their attitude very quickly. The Minister for Health (Senator Wade) is fully acquainted with this matter because I have sent to him a large volume of correspondence that I have received from sick patients in my electorate. This practice about which I complain has been going on for six or eight months. The committee of doctors appointed by the Government calls in general practitioners at random and gives them directions about the manner in which they will treat pensioner patients. Possibly this problem does not occur in the blue ribbon conservative seats, where you would not find many pensioners at all and where almost everybody would be able to pay for medical attention. But in West Sydney, where there are thousands of pensioners, the doctors have been told to cut down on their visits. The pensioners may, of course, visit the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital or the Sydney Hospital and receive, free of charge, the treatment that the doctors are not allowed to give. The pensioners have been told to have this treatment.",22,Supply Grievance Day

Nobody can claim t&M doctors are making money out of the pensioners because the doctor that I have m mind has a waiting-room full of patien:s at all times. He is a well-known doctor. He is not running after the 9s. that he gets for visiting a pensioner patient. If that patient could afford 25s. and the cost of prescriptions he could ring up a doctor and get treatment whenever he wanted it. I have given plenty of evidence about this matter to the Minister for Health and I hope that he will do something to remedy this defect in the national health service. It is disgraceful that pensioners, who are living in rooms into which the sun rarely shines-payin g £2 or more a week in rent-shoul d be deprived of Government assistance when they need medical attention. This is a scandalous state of affairs and 1 hope that it will soon be rectified. I am glad that the Minister for Social Services( Mr Roberton) is in the House because something should be done for the civilian maimed and limbless in our community. I was glad to hear the honourable member for Henty( Mr Fox) say that something should be done for these people. I recall that during the first week of this sessional period the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) placed on the notice-paper a motion calling for action in this regard. The intentions of the honourable member for Mackellar and the honourable member for Henty are good, but what do they do to give effect to their intentions? over £100 each.

In Camperdown, which is in my electorate, Mr and Mrs. Bedwin run a factory in which they employ a large number of physically handicapped persons. Mr and Mrs. Bedwin have been to Canberra seeking assistance to employ more of these people. Every handicapped person who inquires for work at the factory is put on the road to full employment. These people are taken honourable member's time has expired. off the Government's dole and are enabled to earn a decent living. What the Government should do now is provide money to build flats or other dwelling units close to the factory so that the physically handicapped employees will not have to travel long distances to work. I commend the Government for waiving sales tax on motor cars purchased for use by physically handicapped persons, but it should once again come to the aid of these people. Special housing should be provided for these people close to their workshops. They are desperately in need of assistance of this kind. The Commonwealth Government will not assist sheltered workshops to obtain contracts. If it did so, it would be rendering a great service to the physically handicapped. But the sheltered workshops must sell their products privately. The Government should be able to buy or arrange for the sale of the goods produced by physically handicapped people. I urge the Government to follow Sweden's example in this respect. In Sweden £7,000,000 a year is spent in assisting physically handicapped people to do useful work. The matter that I now propose to raise has left me almost at the end of my tether. It concerns a constituent of mine whose case I have referred to many times previously. This man had been working for about nine months in a Sydney club when unfortunately he met with an unusual accident in which he injured his privates. He was taken to hospital on two occasions. On the first occasion he lost one of them and on the second he lost the other. If he had lost twofingersor two toes he would have received £600 or £700 compensation but the Government has wiped him, the insurance companies have wiped him and every one else has wiped him.

I think that over the long term the plans that it has to work in co-operation with the States, to make available the facilities of the Repatriation Department and to provide in Australia the skill necessary to give full and adequate treatment tp these unfortunate children, will prove to be the proper plans to adopt. However, in the one or two cases where the child is in the higher age bracket and needs treatment urgently, as the facilities which we hope will be available in Australia are not presently available, perhaps we might go a little further than is now proposed. This would not create a precedent, and only one or two children are involved. We have to admit that, all over the world, the treatment of these cases is a matter of experiment. We still do not know exactly the right kind of treatment to give. But, as I have said, particularly in Germany, new artificial limbs, and especially new artificial post office facilities, the department was hands, are being developed. I am sure that, when they are readily available, action taken by the Commonwealth Government will result in their being available not only overseas but also in Australia. I commend what has been done and I hope that it will be followed up.

Yet the Postmaster-General has made no attempt to provide a suitable building in the Newstead suburb where there has been a tremendous growth of both population and commercial activity since the existing building was first placed on the allotment for use as a post office. I intimated earlier that various questions had been directed to the Minister on this subject. He dismissed them all with answers couched in terms that indicate that he has no interest in this matter. He knows that quite recently a petition on the subject signed by a great many residents of the area was presented to this House. Whether he knows of the petition and has been prepared to study it, I am not sure, but the fact remains that, so far as I can see, it has been completely ignored. I point out to the Minister that although the post office faciliby all honourable members, from the Prime ties in the suburb of Newstead have been allowed to remain at the sub-standard level that I have described, other interests in the suburb have been prepared to construct buildings designed to meet adequately the needs of this rapidly developing area. The Minister must be aware that as far back as 19S6, after I had made representations on the matter, the Postmaster-General's Department agreed to make provision in its estimates for the replacement of the existing building. For some unknown reason-probabl y the reason is known only to the Minister-thi s provision was later taken out of the department's estimates. If there was need for a new building in 1956, obviously the need is far greater in 1963. Yet the Minister has never been prepared to intimate why provision for the new building was taken out of the departmental estimates. He has merely said that the business passing through the Newstead post office does not justify a new building. The Minister's approach is completely wrong. He ought to know that the existing building does not attract the volume and kind of business that would normally be attracted if the structure were suited to the purpose and adequate for the provision of the facilities normally available at any post office. I believe we have reached the stage at which this procrastination should cease. The Minister should be prepared to say F.2954/63 -R -[35 ] whether it is lack of finance or lack of business that is preventing the erection of a new post office to replace a sub-standard building that has remained there for about seventeen years. I believe the Minister has a case to answer and that, in fairness to those who have made representations to him over a long period, he should give this matter the careful consideration that it deserves. time to time, over a period of six or seven years, I have mentioned in this House that, as part of our programme for rehabilitating physically handicapped people, we were arranging to hold a sports meeting in Perth, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Games, which would be open to physically handicapped people from all the Commonwealth countries. Support and encouragement was given to these games Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) down to the humble back-bencher, and I feel that it is incumbent upon me, as chairman of the organizing committee, to report to the House concerning those games, which were held in November of last year. This is the only opportunity I shall have to do so. In the course of the next few days I hope to be able to distribute to all members copies of a supplement to the journal of the Royal Perth Hospital giving a report on the games, and I hope that honourable members will read that supplement with interest. I have some copies of the journal with me, and if there are any honourable members who would like to look at them and see the report contained therein, showing winning competitors and so on, I shall be happy to let them have these journals. I am very pleased to report that the games were a success. Many members of the House gave financial as well as moral support to the games, and I believe they are entitled to know how the games turned out. The total cost of organizing the games was about £14,000. On the final day I made an appeal for the establishment of an endowment fund to ensure that the games would be held at regular intervals in the future and that Australia would be able to send a team to any Commonwealth country in which such games were held.

82,Mr Bryant,"Yes, it has. I support represent electorates near universities andin the State secondary schools in Victoria to the matriculation level is now nearly double what it was four or five years ago. All the evidence points to the fact that we will need two new universities catering for about 8,000 students every three years for the next ten or fifteen years. But nothing appears to be being done about it. At the Monash University the position is one of great urgency. Only last Saturday the dean of the faculty of medicine, Professor Andrew, had some words to say about it. He pointed out that the approaches that the university made to the commission only a month or so ago were rejected. I think the university wanted about 20 per cent, more seating accommodation in the faculty of medicine. That approach was rejected. Who is to say what the requirements of the faculty of medicine ought to be? Should it not be the faculty of medicine itself? Should it not say what its needs are? Who are the members of the commission, that they should reject that kind of submission? Is the community in such a position that it can afford to let the commission reject such an important submission from such important people? The result is that the faculty of medicine at the Monash University will suffer. Yesterday we heard the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer) say that the Army cannot get enough doctors. We know that is the position throughout the community. Yet there are student quotas and the faculties are over-strained. Professor Andrew has pointed out that any reduction in the facilities available will produce a lowering qf the standards, with an almost continuous irreversible chain reaction in the lowering of professional and technical standards not only in medicine but also in other professions. The position in the faculty of medicine is extremely serious. Another point is that the commission has not got down to producing its general recommendations for the next triennium. The universities cannot even plan their staffing. If they want to bring staff to Australia from overseas, arrangements have to be made now. They have to know exactly how much money they will have; otherwise they cannot import their staff. So staffing for next year and subsequent years is endangered. One only has to look at the statistics on university libraries to see how many library books universities need. At the moment the Monash University has, I understand, only about 90,000 volumes; the University of Sydney has about 647,000; the University of New South Wales has about 151,000; the University of New England has about 107,000; and the University of Melbourne has about 292,000. In the establishment of a university such as Monash, particular consideration has to be given to the equipment of it. In this respect also the planning of the commission is inadequate. The commission regards equipment as a recurring expenditure instead of making it the subject of a special grant. Consequently, many faculties are unable to get the appropriate equipment, particularly library equipment. A university cannot be established without a wholehearted approach to library equipment in the first stage. The Monash University now has 1,600 students. Originally it was planned to have about 2,400 students at this stage. That position is not due only to the inadequacy of accommodation. It is due partly to university education being so extraordinarily expensive. Parents just cannot afford the fees of £140 or £150 per annum. I hope the Minister for Air( Mr Fairbairn), who is at the table, will take this matter up with the Prime Minister. I trust that the Australian Universities Commission, the Prime Minister and other members of the Government will realize the urgency of the need to provide adequate funds immediately for the new university in Victoria. In Victoria people are talking of a third university. This is an indication of the money that is needed. A total capital investment of £44,000,000 will be needed to enable the Monash University to cater for 12,000 students. That represents about £3,800 a student. So far about £8,000,000 has been spent. An amount of £55,000,000 will be needed to enable it to cater for 16,000 students, and £66,000,000 will be needed to enable it to cater for 20,000 students. We must have a system of priorities. We have Boeings at £3,000,000, lakes at £3,000,000 or £4,000,000, national service at £150,000,000 and the St. Mary's project at £30,000,000. University education is fundamental to our national and individual development. Honourable members should read the article appearing in the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" this morning. It shows us what is being done in other parts of the world. We must face the problem and give the highest priority to education. The most expensive part of the education system is university education, and the responsibility for universities is directly on this Parthe shops owe their employment to the proliament and directly and personally on the Prime Minister. have been very concerned recently with the general tendency throughout the countryit has been reflected in the Parliament-to under-estimate the value to Australia of our primary industries. On many occasions I have mentioned in this House the great value to us of primary industries. I have shown that they are the very basis of our economic stability. NowI find that certain people in the community who write letters to the press or whose statements are reported in the press are saying that certain other industries are taking toe place of the primary industries. I believe that this is quite wrong and that we must give proper emphasis to primary industries. Recently, two members of the Parliament who are generally opposed to each other agreed-thi s is reported in "" Hansard ""that we must not exaggerate the value of our export industries. I said then that it is very hard to exaggerate the value of the primary industries, and I think the more generally this idea is accepted in the Parliament the better for Australia, particularly when we are considering propositions that will assist the primary industries. I said in a recent debate that our primary industries are the very basis of employment. The honourable member for Phillip( Mr Einfeld) interjected, "" They cannot employ many people "". The fact is that primary industries are responsible for the employment of ever-increasing numbers of people. Years ago, when farmers used horses and comparatively primitive machinery in the production of wheat, they were not responsible for the employment of a great many people. With our increasing population, the part of the primary producer in providing employment has become more significant. The community generally does not seem to realize how many people are kept in employment by the efforts of primary producers. The wool industry, for instance, is responsible for the employment of shearers, classers, transport workers and those engaged in the selling of wool and in the manufacture of all classes of woollen goods. If we go to the extreme, we can say that the people engaged in selling woollen goods in duction of the wool from which the goods are made. Let us take the wheat industry. The manufacture of tractors and machinery used by farmers gives employment to workers in all cities. Others are engaged in the building and maintenance of silos. Bakers and pastry cooks would not be able to make their goods without the production of wheat. Workers engaged in the production of superphosphate and other fertilizers owe their employment to wheat-growers. I hesitate to itemize all the people whose employment is dependent on primary production. No matter how many I mentioned, it could be said quite rightly that I had omitted some important people whose employment is the result of primary production. Many people in the Postmaster-General's Department owe their employment to primary production. The farmer generally has to make trunk-line telephone calls to purchase the goods he may require or to make arrangements for the selling of his goods. Then we have mail deliveries. Countless men are employed as a result of the activities of primary producers and they are paid by the primary producers. I want to speak now about transport-by rail, road, sea and to a lesser extent air. When the farmer sends his goods-wheat , wool, potatoes, dried fruits, tobacco and so onto market, he pays freight on them. When the goods are made up by people engaged in the manufacturing industries and are sent back to the country areas for sale, the primary producer pays freight again. It would be very hard to exaggerate the amount that the primary producer contributes towards transport costs and the number of people who are employed in transport services through his efforts. Let me deal with fuel and oil. Oil has only been used to any significant extent in the last few decades. When the farmer used horses, he did not need oil. But now",29,Supply Grievance Day
83,Mr Turnbull (Mallee) [12.31],"Ithousands upon thousands of men are engaged in the distribution of petrol, diesel fuel and oil, not only for motor cars in the cities but for the down-to-earth production of primary products in the field. Tractors to-day are everywhere and it is most unusual to see a team of horses. I think we must give due recognition to the part played by primary producers in Australia. I often hear Opposition members speak about wharf labourers. Where would the wharf labourer be if the primary producers did not produce the goods for them to handle? wharf labourers did not handle the goods? the very basis of our industry, of our prosof automatic telephone services. It is perity and of our employment. There is a pronounced tendency in this House to under-estimate the primary producers and those who represent them. It would seem that many Opposition members believe it is far beneath their dignity to speak about the Mallee. But the Mallee electorate produces vast amounts of wool, wheat, dried fruits and all classes of primary products, and it must be recognized as a vital unit in the prosperity and stability of this country. Some people may by chance unconsciously under-estimate the value of primary industries, but when this is done deliberately, it is unpardonable. My purpose great credit that, despite their surroundings, in speaking to-day is to try to raise the recognition of primary industry to the level helpful and efficient in operating the out-ofat which it should be.

We know that when the gold petered out or became unprofitable to mine the people turned to something more stable -to the primary industries.

If he is really sincere, dates are coming up because' it is only then perhaps he will be quite happy to lend his that members of that party are prepared to talk about our primary industries. The first matter which I wish to raiseand very shortly because my speaking time has been cut to five minutes-relate s to telephone services in the city of Ipswich. The people of Ipswich feel greatly aggrieved at the persistence of the telephone branch of the Postal Department in continuing to adopt in this jet age methods suitable to the horse and buggy days. Ipswich is the third largest provincial city in the State of Queensland, and therefore, on the basis of size alone, apart from its very great importance as an industrial centre, Ipswich is deserving of high priority over the less important provincial cities in the installation deplorable that the department should persist in operating in three different centres of Ipswich manual exchanges with their attendant confusion and frequent dislocation of services. There are more than 4,000 telephone subscribers in the city of Ipswich. About 1,500 of them are connected to the central magneto-controlled telephone exchange in the main Post Office building. A great deal of the equipment in the exchange was installed in 1913 in dingy and depressing surroundings. This must have a very bad psychological effect on the girls who are compelled to work in the exchange. However, it must be said to their they remain cheerful, courteous, everand annoying to the many people who use the telephone services regularly-especiall y business people-to find their conversations cut off by the operator from another centre in order to connect a call from another line. That is a regular occurrence. On a number of occasions when I have been having an important telephone discussion my conversation has been cut short and another call has been put onto the line.

When they are out culling stock and moving round their properties, they run the risk of meeting with a serious accident, and while they have to rely upon an unreliable and unsatisfactory manual exchange service, they are exposed to great danger. If they could be connected to the Murrumba automatic telephone exchange, a great service would be done to them as would be done to the people of the Mount Archer area, which is situated not far from Kilcoy. The people of the Mount Archer area are also engaged in primary production. At the moment the majority of them are without a telephone service at all because the people who previously operated the manual exchange at Mount Archer relinquished control of the equipment. Now, only about four out of a total of something like twenty subscribers have a service, and it is both intermittent and unsatisfactory. Further, owing to the recent rains in Queensland, these people have been flooded out and cut off from road communication by the rising headwafers of the Stanley River.

Debate resumed from lst May (vide page 944), on motion by Mr Harold HoltThat the bill be now read a second time. Speaker, the first matter to which I desire to more general, it came before Mr Justice refer relates to the present disputes on the Ashburner. Before the union could get Sydney and Melbourne waterfronts. I say the matter beyond the point where it was quite definitely that the responsibility for taken to the arbitrator, there had to be the trouble on the Australian waterfront at a dispute. Otherwise Mr Justice Ashburner the moment rests entirely on this Governwould have never been involved in the ment and the shipowners. In order to show where the responsibility lies it is necessary to go back to some of the more recent disputes and to indicate to honourable members what has actually happened. Some little time ago a cargo ship called the "" Riederstein"" arrived in Australia, carrying oil in tanks, and the waterside workers claimed that the work of unloading this vessel belonged to them. That claim was disputed by the shipowners, but eventually the view of the men was accepted. They had been engaged on the work of unloading this vessel on its previous visits to this country when it had brought oil in 44-gallon drums. The men involved in this dispute were suspended. They were penalized although they were eventually proved by the recognized authorities to have been correct in the attitude that they adopted. However, before they had an opportunity to work out their period of suspension, another dispute occurred which is referred to generally in the industry as the woo] dispute. This wool dispute arose when a Japanese vessel arrived in Australia to load wool and a man engaged on stacking was injured. The members of the Waterside Workers Federation immediately demanded that the number of men working on the wool stack should be increased from two to three. This request was denied by the shipowners and a dispute occurred. The dispute was referred to a board of reference, which decided in favour of the shipowners. The waterside workers then exercised their right of appeal to an arbitrator, but the arbitrator of reference which had heard the matter, so that he was sitting in judgment on his own decision. As would be expected, the Workers Federation. Before the dispute had concluded, although it involved only a relatively few men at the outset, 571 members of the Waterside Workers Federation suffered",32,Supply Grievance Day
87,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [2.15],"Mr suspension. After the dispute had becomematter. When it was necessary to get a settlement, Mr Justice Ashburner heard the case and found in favour of the men. As a matter of fact, he regarded the men's request as being of such a moderate character that he gave them more than they had originally sought. I would remind honourable members that initially there were two men engaged on the wool stack. After a man was injured, the men had asked for three to be placed on the stack. Mr Justice Ashburner decided, after hearing the matter, that where wool was stacked four bales or more high, there had to be four men engaged on the stack. So the men had conceded to them more than they had originally sought, which shows that their application must have been fully justified. However, in the meantime, large numbers of men were suspended by the authority and the union was savagely fined by the Commonwealth Industrial Court. Although the union and the men were finally proved to be right, both the union and the men individually were savagely fined. I now pass to the "" Lake Eyre"" dispute, the precursor of most of the disputes which are at present occurring on the waterfront of Australia. In the "" Lake Eyre"" dispute, the men were engaged in discharging bags of clay. This was a very filthy cargo to handle and the men asked to be provided with industrial clothing. I think that any organization or any member of a union would recognize that as a justified claim. However, the request was denied, a dispute occurred and the men suffered suspension. Before their sentence was concluded, a new gang was engaged to discharge the clay. Strangely enough, the men in the new gang engaged to replace the gang originally engaged to carry out this work were granted industrial footwear and aprons, were allowed washing time and were conceded 6d. per hour penalty rate. These concessions demonstrate that this was a very objectionable cargo. Had the shipowners been reasonable in their treatment of the waterside workers in the first instance, there would have been no interruption of the work whatever. Here is another case where the men's claim was eventually accepted as being justified, yet both the union and the men were heavily penalized. Before the men from the ""Lake Eyre*' who were suspended could work out their suspensions, a new dispute arose on a vessel called the ""Port Aylmer"". The cargo to be loaded was meat carcasses, and the dispute involved six men. It was a dispute merely as to the distribution of the men on the work of unloading a railway meat van. The men engaged on this work thought there should have been a certain distribution of the work force to help the smooth working of the loading of the vessel. However, the shipowners would not agree, and a dispute occurred. The men were suspended. This dispute had nothing whatever to do with the "" Lake Eyre"" dispute, which was an entirely different dispute on an entirely different matter. Under the system now being operated on the waterfront, if men become involved in a dispute and are suspended by the authority but have not worked out their suspensions before another dispute starts somewhere else in the port, even if it involves only a few men, the period of that dispute does not count as a part of their period of suspension, because those days are not regarded as normal working days. There have been many cases on the waterfront where men have been suspended for one or two days but, because another dispute arose before they had completed or worked out their period of suspension, it was actually six and seven days before they could return to work, although in many cases the port was in need of labour. Let me now tell of a more recent dispute. A vessel called the "" City of Sydney"" was berthed at what is known as No. 22, Pyrmont, in Sydney. This dispute was somewhat similar to that to which I have made reference regarding the working of railway trucks bringing cargoes for the loading of vessels engaged in the export meat trade. Again a dispute arose and again the shipowners refused to concede what the men requested in regard to the distribution of labour. To show to what lengths the shipowners will go in order to defeat the legitimate requests of the Waterside Workers Federation and what extreme provocation is offered to the men in these matters, I point out that the shipowners then had the truck taken elsewhere. It was unloaded by two members of another union. Four lorries were engaged, I understand, at a hiring cost of 32s. an hour. The meat was loaded into those trucks, taken back to No. 22, Pyrmont, and eventually loaded into the vessel. This operation must have cost considerably more than it would have cost to concede what the men were asking. As a matter of fact, there was no cost involved in the men's request. It would have meant smoother operation and probably quicker loading of the vessel if the viewpoint of those men, experienced in this business, had been accepted, but the 1 shipowners were determined that the waterside workers had to be defeated. It would be interesting to know whether the exporters of meat-w e hear a great deal about the need to encourage export industries-were charged this additional cost. Let us come now to the latest disputethe ANZAC Day dispute. This was a most disgraceful incident and when I relate what really happened and what the position is, everyone will recognize that the Minister, retiring behind his old argument about Communist-controlled unions, has no reason or argument to advance against the requests made by the men. There were 32 men involved originally in what is known as one of the hostages disputes. One honourable member on the Government side of the House referred, in an earlier debate, to the word "" hostages "" being an invention of the Communist Party. It is a very apt description of what is happening, whoever invented it, because on the waterfront to-day men who are suspended are held as hostages for the good conduct-accordin g to the reasoning of the shipowners-of all the waterside workers engaged in that port. So, while they are under suspension they are held as hostages. There is no way to describe it except as the waterside workers have described it. There were 32 men involved in this dispute over hostages, which occurred in the period preceding the ANZAC Day holiday. On Tuesday, 23rd April, there was a general port stoppage as the result of the earlier dispute and all the men suffered suspension. But, of course, it does not pay the shipowners or the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority to suspend men on every occasion. When labour is required to discharge or load vessels it does not pay the shipowners or the authority to suspend men. So there is a provision under which the authority can use its discretion and, if a port dispute occurs, as it did on this occasion, the authority, instead of suspending the whole port or preventing the men from returning to work, imposes a penalty of the loss of four days' attendance money, which has been accepted by the tribunals as the equivalent of one day's work. On the Wednesday, when the men would not have been working had the suspension been continued, the men were permitted to go to work. As I have said, the penalty of the loss of four days attendance money was substituted for the suspension, but the men actually worked. The next day was ANZAC Day, which is a no-work day generally, except that some men are provided by the union for the loading and discharging of passengers' luggage, for which they are paid two and a half times the normal rate. The men who stand off on ANZAC Day, which is regarded generally as a public holiday, are paid on the basis of what is called a six-hour minimum. On the Friday following ANZAC Day the port again worked normally. Here we have the condition, which is accepted in every other industry in Australia, that where the men work normally on the day preceding ANZAC Day and on the day following it they shall be paid for tbe holiday. Yet the authority decided that because of its interpretation of a provision contained in the award the men had not satisfied the requirements because they would have been under suspension on the Wednesday, except for the application of section 52 (a) of the act and the substitution of the loss of four days' attendance money in lieu thereof. Does this not constitute a double penalty in any case? The tribunal has already accepted that one day's suspension is the equivalent of the loss of four days' attendance money. The men still lose the four days' attendance money, but, according to the decision of the authority, they are to be doubly penalized by the loss of pay for the ANZAC Day holiday. It is a disgraceful situation. Let me show how vicious the penalty is. If the men were paid for ANZAC Day, as they should be, they would get £3 9s. 6d., which is the six hours' minimum pay, and for the four days' attendance money they lost £5 13s., so the total loss which every waterside worker in the port of Sydney suffered was £9 2s. 6d. It is a double penalty and, of all holidays, it involved ANZAC Day. Sixty per cent, or 70 per cent, of members of this union are ex-servicemen. If anybody in this country is entitled to the ANZAC Day holiday, surely it is the men who served in World WarsI . and II.! Surely they are more entitled to it than is anybody else in the country! But they are denied it because they were involved Australian waterfront. At times when they in a dispute which occurred some days prior to the holiday itself. There is not another industry in Australia in which it is the recognized practice that if the men work the day before and the day after a holiday they are not paid for it. The purpose of the introduction of the attendance money provision was said to be to benefit the waterside workers, but in certain respects it is now being used to reduce their industrial conditions. Had there been no provision for the substitution of the loss of attendance money in lieu of suspension and had these men worked normally the day before and the day after ANZAC Day, they would automatically have received their pay for the ANZAC Day holiday. Let me tell the Minister, because it is not only the waterside workers who are end of the matter. Every trade unionist involved, that he always tries to get away in Australia and every reasonably minded from the real issues in respect of these citizen are satisfied that the waterside disputes by saying that they are deliberately workers have right on their side in this engineered by the Communist officials of dispute. the Waterside Workers Federation. Mr When Her Majesty the Queen and His Fitzgibbon, whom even members of the Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh Government will not classify as a Comvisited the various States during the recent munist or a Communist sympathizer, has, royal visit the Commonwealth and State only in the last few days, warned the Gogovernments took steps to declare approvernment of the possibility of major induspriate public holidays so that the people trial trouble on the Australian waterfront would have an opportunity to participate if something is not done in regard to the in the celebrations. However, I recently savage penalties being imposed on the men discovered that although permanent Comin this industry and on their organization. monwealth public servants were paid for I have since been informed that the exvants were denied pay for the holiday. I servicemen members of the Waterside recently placed on notice a question about V/orkers Federation have now sought the this matter, to which the Prime Minister co-operation and assistance of the Returned( Sir Robert Menzies) answered in this waySailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia. Mr Yeo, who is workers president of the New South Wales branch These awards also provide for a loaded rate of of that organization, has already expressed strong disagreement with what the Government has done in depriving these men, many of whom served during the war, of their just rights. Sub-branches of the league have carried resolutions supporting the attitude of the men in support of their demand for what, in their opinion, is their right and that of other trade unionists in this country. The Minister cannot argue that the union has not genuinely endeavoured to co-operate in preserving peace and continuity of employment on the have considered that certain legislation should be given a fair trial the waterside workers have carefully refrained from doing anything that would hinder that course. In recent years more cargo has been handled on the Australian waterfront with less labour than ever before in the history of the industry. I will not weary the House with ngures relating to the amount of cargo handled because I have given this information on other occasions. Those figures prove conclusively that the Government has no case to put against the requests of these men. The Government must rectify this matter and see that these men on the waterfront are paid for the ANZAC Day holiday. If they are not paid I am sure that the Minister for Labour and National Service and the Government will not have heard the the day, casual Commonwealth public serRelevant award conditions prescribe that casual are paid only for the work performed. pay to compensate for the fact that casual workers are not granted receation leave or sick leave or public holidays with pay. Let us examine that answer for a moment. Of course, the matters referred to by the right honourable gentleman are taken into account when rates of pay are fixed for casual public servants but it is not every year that we have a royal visit. The tribunal that fixes rates for casual public servants undoubtedly took into account only the normal statutory holidays that occur year after year. This occasion was a special holiday. The States and the Commonwealth were in some way supposedly making a gesture to permit the ordinary citizen to participate in the celebrations. If you happened to be a casual or a temporary Commonwealth public servant you got the day off to participate but you lost a day's pay. That decision by the Government is outrageous and the position should be rectified. Let me show how this anti-Labour Government discriminates against the workers whenever it gets the opportunity. The privileged few who were invited to attend the royal visit celebrations in Canberra were provided with free transport and, as far as I know, they did not suffer any loss of a day's pay. Certain of the guests were actually paid a fee of £4 a day to attend the celebrations. If you are a casual public servant you may take part in such celebrations and lose a day's pay, but if you are on the privileged list and you attend the celebrations in Canberra you get free transport to the National Capital and you also receive a fee of £4 a day to attend. That is outright discrimination and the situation should be rectified quickly by the Government. Another matter that I wish to raise concerns the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt). We have received some peculiar statements lately from the Treasurer regarding delay on the part of the Government in doing something to implement the decisions of the committee appointed to inquire into taxation, which was presided over by Mr Justice Ligertwood. The committee's report has been in the Government's hands for some considerable time now. Recently, I placed on the notice-paper a series of questions addressed to the Treasurer. I direct the attention of honourable members to the replies given to those questions. Those replies are typical of the replies that members of the Opposition receive to question placed on notice. I asked a series of thirteen questions. In reply to the first six questions, the Treasurer referred me to the committee's report, which was tabled in the House on 17th August, 1961. The Treasurer saidCopies of the report were made available to all members. My seventh question to the Treasurer wasDid he state when tabling the report that legislation arising from the committee's recommendations would be introduced and made retrospective to that date? That question called for a simple, "" Yes "", or "" No "". Either the Treasurer made the statement or he did not make it. In answer to that question the Treasurer saidWhen tabling the committee's report I made a prepared statement, the full text of which may be found in ""Hansard"" of 17th August, 1961, at page 182. The Treasurer could have answered that question with a simple, "" Yes "", or "" No "". He knows that he made the statement but he is now embarrassed by the fact that he has not acted as he said he would on that occasion. I further asked the TreasurerDid he in the following November, at a time when the Parliament was not in session, announce that no amendment of taxation laws based on the committee's report would affect income earned or received in any year before 1962-63? That, too, was a simple question which could have been handled by a direct, ""Yes"", or "" No "" . But what did the Treasurer reply? He saidI made a statement on lst November, 1961, a copy of which can be made available to the honourable member if he does not already possess one. Would any honourable member regard that as a proper answer to a question directed to a Minister? My concluding question contained a request that I be informed definitely when the amending legislation will be introduced. The Treasurer completely avoided answering my question and saidAs stated in my answer to a recent question without notice (""Hansard"" of 10th April, 1963, page SS2) the committee's recommendations, covering as they did practically the whole field of income tax, raised issues of great variety and complexity. Moreover, the comments of tbe Commissioner of Taxation were, in view of the nature of the subject matter, necessarily voluminous. The numerous questions which arise for consideration need close study and to assist in this matter the Government has appointed a former commissioner, Mr J. D. O'Sullivan, as special consultant to the Treasury. Mr O'Sullivan has already commenced his studies of the problems raised by the committee's recommendations. We still do not know when the Government intends to bring down the promised legislation. Do not forget that although the Treasurer earlier gave an undertaking to introduce legislation which would be retrospective to 17th August, 1961-the date when the report was first tabled-ther e is also a later and amended commitment to apply the legislation as from the taxation year ending 30th June next. Unless the legislation is brought down very soon it is most likely that a further reprieve will be granted by the Government to those people who were referred to by the committee as tax dodgers. Those tax dodgers are not the ordinary workers in industry, because the worker is covered by what is known as the pay-as-you-earn system. The worker cannot defraud the Taxation Branch because his tax is taken from him at the source-by his employer. The tax dodgers to whom the committee was referring are the wealthy interests in this country. According to the committee, they have been deliberately evading their responsibilities to the extent of £14,500,000 a year, so that every year they can get this Government to co-operate and to delay the introduction of this legislation means that they are saving at least £14,500,000 and defrauding the Commonwealth of its just tax returns. What are the complexities to which the Treasurer now refers? Evidently they did not exist on 17th August, 1961, when he tabled the report in this Parliament, because on that occasion he saidThe committee has drawn attention to several parts of our income tax law which are being exploited to the serious detriment of the revenue . . . The Government shares the concern of the committee that ingenious taxpayers should make use of the existing provisions in a manner not intended by the legislature, thus obtaining advantages at the expense of their fellow taxpayers . . . The Government will in due course bring down amending legislation which will be operative from to-day's date; that is, the date of tabling the committee's report. At that time the Treasure was perfectly satisfied with the committee's findings. There were no complexities. In fact, he referred to the clarity of the report and the precision with which the committee members had been able to approach the matter. The complexities arose later. There is no doubt in the world that the Treasurer has been approached by wealthy interests in this community and asked not to introduce the legislation or at least to delay its introduction. The present state of affairs warrants the closest examination by every person in this House who believes in clean government. Labour and National Service) [2.47] -May I reply first to the last statement by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) which was, in effect, an accusation that the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) was refraining from introducing legislation relating to some taxation reforms recommended by a committee because pressure had been brought to bear on him by outside influences. The honourable gentleman's statement is not correct. As the Treasurer has announced already, he has appointed the former Commissioner of Taxation to consider some of the more difficult problems which have been raised. As soon as that gentleman has considered thoroughly all the problems involved and has reported on them to us, we shall be only too happy to consider his report and to make a decision on his recommendations. Having made our decision we shall tell the House what we propose to do. Having said that, let me turn now to the much more interesting things that the honourable gentleman said about the waterfront. Two weeks ago my colleague, the honourable member for Bruce( Mr Snedden), proposed for discussion in this place a matter of urgent public importance, for the express purpose of flushing out the Opposition and ascertaining where it stood in relation to the Communist element on the waterfront. The Communist element found a very conscientious advocate for its cause in the honourable member for East Sydney. To that extent we achieved our purpose. We found where the honourable gentleman stood as between the Communist element and the remainder of the community. To-day in the House he continued his activities on behalf of the Communist element. On the waterfront there is a division between administrative responsibility and",33,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside
88,Mr Mcmahon (Lowe,"Minister forarbitral responsibility. First, there is the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority which is responsible for manning the waterfront and for seeing that ships have a proper allocation of waterside workers. The authority, along with the employers, is held responsible for the efficient handling of cargo. In other words, it has the responsibility of seeing that efficiency on the waterdeals with matters affecting the waterfront front is kept at the maximum practicable level. Then there is the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which has the responsibility of settling industrial disputes or, to state the position a little more accurately, of preventing disputes from arising and, when they do arise, of settling them. We have the mechanism for settling disputes. In my opinion, it is an effective mechanism, which, if applied and used by the Waterside Workers Federation and by the shipowners, will prevent strikes. The award made by Mr Justice went to arbitration and obviously received Ashburner contains a clause which enjoins what they regarded as justice because there the Waterside Workers Federation from has not been a strike or evidence of any being a party to strikes on the waterfront. dissatisfaction over this issue since then. Mr Justice Ashburner has told the waterside workers that they have access to the board of reference. If they feel the need been killed if the matter had not been to appeal, they can approach him and he decided in their favour. will listen to their representations. The mechanism which now exists, if properly the actual operation, you will admit that a applied, will prevent strikes from occurring. lot of this work can be done by one person. If the men feel such a step is necessary, I have noted your statement about the they have access to the Arbitration Comsnottering and dismantling of bales. The mission. I am prepared to say in relation point is that the mechanism was there to to the Arbitration Commission, and particube used. There was no need to hold up larly of the presidential member concerned cargoes. The honourable gentleman's arguwith the waterfront, that whenever I have ment is a perfect argument for a ban clause considered a dispute that has gone before in the award. If the workers want justice, him and in relation to which he has made they should go to the commission. It has a decision, whether for or against the waterproved itself in the past to be impartial and, side workers, I have come to the conclusion as to the wool bale dispute, its decision was that, by and large, he has given due conso just that no similar problem has arisen sideration to the claims and has dealt with since. them on the basis of justice and fairness to the waterside workers. He has treated them fairly. The proof of the pudding is in the means of obtaining the federation's objeceating. As mentioned to the House thc tive, I am certain that not only would the other day, the total average weekly earnings waterside workers receive far more subof waterside workers have increased from stantial wages than they have received in £16 10s. in 1953-54 to £21 10s. to-day. In the past but also that there would be a much addition, as honourable members know, faster despatch of cargoes from the ports of waterside workers do not work exceedingly Sydney and Melbourne. Why do the men long hours. The honourable member for East Sydney then dealt with the wool dispute. This matter illustrates perfectly why it is unnecessary to have a port stoppage and to hold up cargoes. The honourable gentleman said that this matter was taken first to the board of reference and then on appeal to the commission. The presidential member who decided the dispute substantially in favour of the Waterside Workers Federation, and varied the award. He stated that in certain circumstances, when the bales are more than three high and a fork-lift truck is used, four men will man the breaking down, snottering, hooking on and the clearing of the cargo. I can think of no better illustration than that of the way in which the mechanism should be applied. The men had the right of access to arbitration but the Sydney officials of the Waterside Workers Federation preferred to pull on a strike and hold up the operation of the port for some time. They finally If the regular procedure were followed instead of strikes being used as a direct not go to arbitration? I think that the",38,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside

90,Mr Mcmahon,"If you have ever seenreason they do not go to arbitration is that some of the officials of the federation do not want them to do so. ber says, "" Rubbish "". He is a little out of contact with Norman Docker. Apparently he is receiving his advice from another official. During the last two weeks, there have been reports that Norman Docker has said that the policy of the Waterside Workers Federation is not to resort to arbitration. I do not think that that is the policy of the federation. That statement has been made by Docker, not by the president, Mr Beitz, not by the general secretary and not by Mr Roach, the assistant general secretary. Docker is the industrial officer of the federation. Formerly he was not an elected official, but he now is. We must remember that when he states that the federation does not want arbitration but wants direct action. That is the method that the Communist Party of Australia wants to adopt in order to promote class disputes, thereby hoping to create industrial chaos in this country. Communist? so far as t'o say, on the floor of this House, that Docker is a Communist. I think that many recognized him as a Communist. But he was not until recently an elected official of the Waterside Workers Federation. As an industrial officer of the federation, Mr Therefore, the logical conclusion is that a Docker was not elected as are the other officials. As an individual, he does not quite fit into the waterfront scene, because he is a type of intellectual who is a different type to Roach, and his ilk. SoI do not want to apply the term "" Communist "" to Docker at the moment. close to doing so. close to doing so. The second point that I want to mention relates to port stoppages and the forfeiture of holiday pay by a man who has been involved in a port stoppage or who, if you like, has been suspended from work the day before or the day after a public holiday. attendance money. The honourable member for East Sydney knows that for a long time the rule was that if a man was suspended the day before or the day after a public holiday he did not receive pay for that public holiday. I think honourable members will agree that that is a just penalty in the waterfront industry. No other industry in the whole of Australia is so indisciplined as is the waterfront industry. Last month, 150,000 man-hours were lost. In the preceding four months, as the honourable gentleman has recognized, the maximum loss in any month was 16,000 man-hours and the minimum fewer than 3,000 man-hours. That proves two things. It proves, first, that there is no need for strikes, and, secondly, that the men do not want them but are pulled out on strike by the officials of the Sydney and Melbourne branches of the Waterside Workers Federation. I am certain that if it were not for the penalties, the mavericks in the Communist Party and on the waterfront would run riot and that cargoes would not be cleared throughout the Australian waterfront. Referring to the ANZAC Day issue, the honourable member for East Sydney used the expression "" hostages "". I agree with my colleague, the honourable member for Bruce, that that is a typical Communist term. It has no sensible meaning. As I have said, a man who was suspended the day before or the day after a public holiday would not receive pay for the holiday. However, owing to a change in the law, a man can now lose his attendance money for four days instead of being suspended. man who, because of a port stoppage, has lost his attendance money, but not been suspended, the day before or the day after a public holiday should not receive pay for the holiday. The Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority is responsible for the efficiency of the waterfront. That organization, not guided by, and not in consultation with, this Government, but acting as an independent authority, decided in its wisdom that in this instance those men who forfeited their attendance money on either 24th April or 26th April should not be paid for ANZAC Day.",39,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside

98,Mr Mcmahon,"They forfeited theiron the public holiday. The point that 1 want to make here is something that has been known since 1961 to every sensible person and every sensible official on the waterfront: A man who is suspended or who loses attendance money the day before or the day after a public holiday is not paid for that public holiday. The loss of holiday pay on this occasion is due to a palpable error, as I said yesterday, by the ofncials of the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Federation. The strike was, unfortunately, called on 23rd April-tw o days before the rublic holiday -and the men lost their attendance money on the 23rd. Normally, that would not occur, because the officials know full well that they dare not pull the men out on a frivolous strike if the men are likely to lose £9 2s. 6d -£ 3 9s. 6d. in pay and £5 13s. in attendance money. The fault in this instance was that of the officials and of no one else. I want to make one point clear, because I think that it is of critical importance. On the waterfront, the men do not, after all, usually lose money in this way. They make good their apparent losses at a later stage, and sometimes better their apparent losses by working at two and one-half times normal rates of pay on Sundays. This is because cargo that is not cleared to-day has to be cleared soon after. Therefore the men get their pay, although the period taken to earn it may be a little longer than otherwise woud have been the case. The point of critical importance that I want to make is that although the men may appear immediately to lose money, they do not lose it in the long run, and there are secondary effects of great importance on the waterfront. The actions of the men are driving cargoes, particularly interstate and intra-state cargoes, from the waterfront to the airlines, the railways and road transport. This represents a real threat to the existence of the Waterside Workers Federation as an effective and viable organization. The honourable member for East Sydney mentioned what is sometimes described as the increase in productivity on the waterfront. Let me tell him precisely that the increase in performance-w e shall hear more about this in the next few weeks and I do not want to compromise in any way the discussions that are to take place-ha s come mainly from mechanization and the adoption of roll-on, roll-off techniques, palletization and container packaging. The improvement has been due more to those factors than to other causes. I believe that the men themselves must get some of the benefits-and perhaps substantial benefitsfrom mechanization and the handling of cargoes by the new techniques, but I cannot admit that, in the existing conditions on the waterfront, the men ought to receive substantial benefits until they prove to the satisfaction of the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that they are entitled to those benefits. I emphasize that point, Mr Deputy Speaker. I wish to mention only one other matter. I know of no other industry that is as turbulent as this one is. I have told the House that I believe the existing machinery is satisfactory. Arbitration should be permitted to work. If the leaders of the Waterside Workers Federation will allow arbitration to work, two things will happen. First, the men will receive better wages and work under better conditions, and, secondly, our cargoes will be cleared much more quickly. Lastly, Sir, I want to answer the final argument put by the honourable member for East Sydney, who said that I cannot argue that the men have not abided by the decision that they made in June of last year, I think, to co-operate and not to strike. My answer to that statement is in clear terms: The Waterside Workers Federation gave me an assurance that it would cease the stoppages if there was conciliation on the waterfront and that differences between the men and management, if they could not be settled by negotiation, would be settled by recourse to arbitration. That assurance was given by both the federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. For four months, the federation lived up to its promises, and there is no reason why it should not live up to them now. The conditions of its members have been improved. They now get their long-service leave without any tags. I personally believe that the A.C.T.U. has a responsibility to compel the Waterside Workers Federation to stand by the assurance that it gave to me in June",40,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside

100,Mr Mcmahon,"They did not worklast year. However, I am glad to see the honourable member for East Sydney flushed out. He obviously obtained his information not from Mr Charlie Fitzgibbon, the secretary of the federation, but from some other members of the federation opposed to the rank and file, opposed to the Australian Labour Party representatives within the executive of the federation. I think the honourable member for East Sydney displays a deplorable state of mind in being prepared to support constant stoppages on the waterfront and to do his best to see that cargoes bank up and that our international trade is disrupted. Minister for Labour and National Service dodge of trying to divert attention from the merits of the case put forward by the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr it is not so very long since the waterside Ward) on behalf of the most victimized set of workers in Australia, the waterside workers, by dubbing the honourable member a Communist. Nothing could be more disgraceful than for the Minister to adopt such tactics. the chamber. courage to stay and listen to what I say. Instead, he walks out of the House. Nothing could have been more contemptible than the attitude adopted by the Minister after he had listened to an authentic account of what goes on on the Sydney and Melbourne waterfronts. Those members opposite who jeer have probably never taken the trouble to go to the waterfront and see what is actually done there. All that tbe Minister did was to attempt to divert attention from the case put forward by the honourable member for East Sydney by dubbing him a Communist or a fellow traveller. These were the tactics adopted by many honourable members on the Government side before the last election, but the only one of them who came back here-and only by virtue of Communist preferences-wa s the honourable member for Moreton( Mr ments or persons of the same political Killen). Those people who resorted to character assassination, not only of individual members of the Labour Party but of the party itself, fell by the votes of the electors. The electors would not stand for the filthy kind of character assassination indulged in by those people who to-day are conspicuous by their absence. The honourable member for Moreton can only agree that he remains here by the grace of Communist preferences. A good deal has been said about ANZAC Day. ANZAC Day is an occasion which is honoured by every section of the community. Yet the Minister rises in this House and attempts to make excuses for people who have deprived the waterside workers of their pay for that day and have imposed penalties on them. Suffice it to say that if there had been no merit in the waterside workers' case the president of the returned servicemen's league in New South Wales would not have come to their assistance. He saw merit in their case. Let me remind the House that workers and other members of the community were called heroes for what they were doing when they offered their lives in defence of this country. On both the home front and the war front there were no people who made greater contributions than the waterside workers. There was another noticeable feature of the way in which the Minister tried to destroy the value of the arguments of the honourable member for East Sydney. He was asked: ""What was Docker? Was he a Communist?"" He said-oh , so sanctimoniously"" I would not like to say that about Docker. He is not a member of the Waterside Workers Federation, but he may be a Communist."" At the same time the Minister is prepared to suggest-althoug h he was not game to say it outright-that the honourable member for East Sydney is a Communist because he rises in defence of the workers. This is the kind of tirade that we always hear when any one stands up, whether in this House or on the hustings outside, and puts a case for the under-privileged, for the workers. The policies of this Government have never given anything to the worker, nor have those of any other governflavour. The workers have had to fight tooth and nail for every privilege they have obtained. The Minister talked about what the Australian Council of Trade Unions",41,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside

104,Mr Mcivor,"Yes, he has not theshould do, but let me tell him that the great majority of the unions in Australia look upon the fight that the waterside workers are putting up as their fight. At one time it was the coal-miners who were always referred to as Communists and disrupters and destroyers of the economy. They were the ones who were always under attack. Today it is the waterside workers. The trade unions of this country realize that if the waterside workers' union is pauperized by the penalties which this Government is prepared to impose upon them because they are putting up a fight for their rights, and if they are thus beaten, then each and every one of the other trade unions will be beaten too. Do not get it into your heads that the waterside workers stand alone in the trade union movement. Every trade unionist who values his rights, who values the privileges he has had to fight for over the years, is behind the waterside workers, because he realizes that if they are beaten he is beaten too. I wish now to make some reference to housing. Among other things, the measure before the House refers to an amount of £300,000 as being available for eligible organizations for the construction of homes for aged persons. It also mentions an amount of about £2,500,000 for immigration purposes. I wish to direct my attention to matters relevant to these items. This debate has been notable so far, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the unwillingness of honourable members opposite to discuss matters of great concern to this country, and particularly to the man in the street. As I have said, mention is made in the Additional Estimates of an amount of £300,000 as a contribution towards the construction of homes for the aged. No doubt the Government regards this as a magnificent contribution, but let us examine the position. In Victoria the Housing Commission is holding applications from more than 2,000 elderly persons for housing accommodation. There are also more than 500 applications from married couples, principally pensioners. These applications were lodged as long ago as 1956. In other word's, the applicants have been waiting for as long as seven years. I understand that the position in Sydney and in other capital cities is similar or even worse. The majority of the applicants are receiving age pensions, which are their sole source of income, and, to the discredit of this Government, they are living in conditions which should not be tolerated in any civilized community, and are paying for that accommodation rentsthat are beyond their means. Every honourable member on this side of the House believes that the Commonwealth Government is disregarding the pathetic circumstances of these people and that the Department of Social Services is shirking its responsibility. In order to try to overcome this problem and to assist those aged people, the Victorian Housing Commission has appealed to municipalities. To their credit, they have responded particularly well to that appeal. The policy is that a council should donate an area of land and agree to maintain the gardens and to donate each year a sum of money equivalent to half tbe municipal rates applicable to the property. The Housing Commission builds Darby and Joan units at a cost of £2,500 each, and units for single people at a cost of about £2,000 each. The commission manages the estate and charges a rental of 14s. 6d. a week for a single unit and 29s. 6d. a week for a double unit. The full economic rental of those units would be between 50s. and 65s. a week. So the commission is subsidizing the rentals by about £100 per annum per unit. In order to induce councils to cooperate, the commission gives councils the right to nominate the tenants, who are usually selected from applicants resident within the appropriate municipalities. It is interesting to consider just how far this additional appropriation of £300,000 will go and what a magnificent contribution it is. The Victorian Housing Commission has already constructed approximately 1,850 units for pensioner couples and single women. The subsidy on the rentals of those units exceeds £100,000 per annum. In order to house the people on the long waiting list at present, 2,500 units would be required. Those units would involve a capital cost of £5,250,000. That would also increase the annual rental subsidy by £250,000. Of course, that is conditional on the councils providing the land on which the units could be erected. So, you will see, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the £300,000 that the Government is providing in these Additional Estimates will pay for only the rental subsidy in Victoria. When the amount is spread over the whole of Australia it is infinitesimal. Appeal after appeal has been made to the Government on this matter without success. The Government has an arrangement with church and like bodies which raise money by public appeal. It subsidizes them on the basis of £2 for £1. But that assistance hardly makes a ripple on the surface because the religious and similar bodies have a limited capacity to handle the maintenance and management of such aged people's institutions. On the other hand, investigation reveals that a number of elderly people like to be free from religious tags and do not like to be bound by the rules and regulations that are customary in institutional housing. Furthermore, elderly people have not the money that is needed to acquire a flat or unit from the institutional authorities. It is true, as the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) said yesterday in his contribution to this debate, that a person needs between £1,500 and £1,800 to obtain one of these units. Elderly people, including pensioners, have not that sort of money. Consequently, they cannot participate in the scheme. The worse feature of this matter, Mr seekers have no alternative but to seek a Deputy Speaker, is that under the Victorian Housing Act accommodation must be allocated first of all to people with a number of children. In effect, preference must be given to families. In addition to the 2,500 elderly people wanting homes, more than 12,000 families are waiting for accommodation. So, if the act is complied with, elderly folk cannot receive much consideration until the families have been housed. The information that I have given highlights and exposes just how little this Government is doing in regard to housing the aged people. The amount of £300,000, if given to Victoria alone, would be insignifithe wages of the homebuyer go in paying cant in comparison with the £5,250,000 that is needed to erect homes for elderly folk. In fact, the distribution of £300,000 throrghout the Commonwealth for homes for tiie aged is an insult to the people on the sunset trail. It is a classical example of thc cs ilous attitude that the Government has to (ho plight of our unfortunate aged citizens. Tnis is the thanks that they receive in their declining years for their contribution to the development of this nation. Tbey are a section of the invisible poor to whom my colleague, the honourable member for Parkes( Mr Haylen), referred last Tuesday evening. The basic human needs of the government-created, invisible poor, such as shelter, food and clothing, are things about which the Government desires not to know or worry. The Government is trying to create an image that in this country there is prosperity unlimited. It tries to create that image in order to hide the poverty that exists not only among the aged, the sick and the unemployed, but also among the young folk who are trying to buy homes. The financial impost of buying a home these days places such a strain on the economic resources of young people that they are forced to deny themselves many of the necessities of life that they and their children must have. One has only to look at housing costs to realize that. To-day a modest brick veneer home costs approximately £4,900 or £5,000. Ten years ago a deposit of 10 per cent, of the purchase price enabled a person to secure a home. To-day the deposit required is in the vicinity of 35 per cent, of the purchase price-a n increase of 25 per cent, in ten years. Therefore, the great majority of homesecond mortgage. Let us consider second mortgages. The average loan is about £800. At the prevailing interest rates, a person would pay about £1,400 to redeem that loan of £800. That is an impost of about 80 per cent. Only this week I spoke to a homebuilder about this question. He revealed that his company is lending up to £1,500 at an interest rate of 10 per cent, flat, over fifteen years. That gives the company a return of £3,750. I was also informed that a survey revealed that half rent and hire purchase commitments. Thus, because of the responsibilities that people are compelled to accept in order to obtain a home and the responsibilities that they are compelled to undertake in order to raise a family with respect and some degree of human decency, they enter the ranks of the invisible poor. Strangely enough, the glory of all these high prices and of this prosperity unlimited is not reflected in the world of the home-builder, because in Victoria home-builders are going broke or folding up at the rate of two or last. A report from Adelaide had this to three a week. In the newspapers on Wednesday, lst May, we were told that the number of houses and flats begun in the March quarter of this year was the second highest figure for March quarters in the history of Australia. That reads very well, but I think all decent-minded people realize the self-sacrifice to which most people will commit themselves in order to get a roof over their heads. Let me pause to look at the other side of the picture. Let us ask ourselves this question: If that rate of commencements can be obtained from the ranks of the desperate home-seekers, what would the rate be if the price of a home was reduced to a level within the human economics of the pay envelope of the worker? Only recently I visited a new estate adjacent to my electorate. ThereI was shown roads and footpaths that had been constructed by a home-building company at a cost of £2,000,000. In some cases water, electricity and sewerage had also been supplied at the expense of the company. Of course, in the past those amenities were provided by the local government authority through the medium of loan funds. The cost of construction was repayable to the councils by the ratepayers over fifteen years at the ruling rate of interest-whic h to-day would be about 5i per cent -and on a sliding scale. But what is the position to-day? For the provision of those amenities the home-building company charges 10 per cent, flat in addition to the building costs. Those facts reveal the plight of the stems entirely from the fear of the homehome-seeker. They reveal that a married seekers to involve themselves in high price, couple, in order to purchase a home, must high interest rate homes. Indeed, it is true enslave themselves for 40 years and pay an to say that finance is available if you can amount of interest that is more than the afford to buy it. However, many people principal of the loan. The older they afford it. get, the lower their earning capacity becomes. The best authorities in the homebuilding industry believe that in future tioned literature that I brought back from years a terrific number of homes will be West Germany. A perusal of this literature vacated. As people grow older and find reveals just how puny are the efforts being they are unable to keep up the payments, made in this country to overcome the housmany homes will revert to the housing ing shortage. It reveals how little is being authorities. Let me read from an article done in Australia to induce people to build. in the Melbourne "" Herald"" of 29th April In West Germany marriage loans of about sayInadequate housing finance remained a major threat to the happiness of thousands of families, the chairman of the Australian Hire Purchase and Finance Conference, Mr J. H. Partridge, said to-day. Mr Partridge 6aid Australia risked being labelled a country without a conscience unless it made an immediate and revolutionary approach to the problem of home finance. "" Thousands of young couples face almost insurmountable barriers in their desire to own their own homes"", he said. "" Present Government and commercial lending organizations are fully extended by the demand, but there is a need for a much wider source of housingfinanceat reasonable rates. ""The gai) This is the deposit gap that has been mentioned by the honourable member for Parkesbetween the present limits of finance and the ever-rising costs of home-building is one of the key problems facing the young married couple."" Who should know the position better than Mr Partridge does? Yet in the face of all this criticism, the Government attempts to create the image of prosperity unlimited ..nd tells the people that all is well in the building industry. But these are the undeniable facts. In Victoria, building and construction employment was lower in February than it was a year earlier. Employment in the Victorian building industry was at the lowest ebb for five years. It is true to say that building activity began to improve in the last few months, but this improvement was in non-residential construction. In fact, the rate of housing construction has hardly changed in Victoria in the last six months and is still at a level lower than that in 1958, 1959 and 1960. This stagnation who want to buy this finance cannot The honourable member for Parkes men£A.400 are given to couples who want to build. The loan is redeemed on the arrival of the third child. In this country under this Government, the reverse position applies. The Government's only consideration is hard cold cash, with an interest rate that cripples the home purchaser. Compare our interest rates with the interest rates of 2 per cent, on loans for home building in West Germany. Compare the efforts of the Government of West Germany, which grants marriage loans in an attempt to increase the population of the country, with the efforts of the Australian Government. increased even child endowment. ask ourselves what the Government has done about child endowment increases or indeed about any other measures designed to help the man in the street. Such is the insignificance of the Government's endeavour in this regard that the research to find what it has done would not be lengthy. It was very noticeable that in West Germany there was prosperity unlimited. There was a shortage of 600,000 tradesmen. There was a great movement of labour from Italy and Spain to West Germany in particular. This brings me to a consideration of our immigration policy. The"" Daily Telegraph"" of 19th February last contained the following reportItalian tradesmen who migrate are choosing Common Market countries rather than Australia, an Italian diplomat said yesterday. . . . He said there were now plenty of jobs in Italy. ""For those who cannot get jobs in Italy, the other Common Market countries offer employment whith does not mean moving so far from family and home. . . . The conditions prevailing in Australia now have become known throughout the world and in consequence people do not migrate here. We commit a sin against intending migrants by exaggerating the good conditions that can be found in Australia. To ask a person to come to Australia from West Germany and to live in the hostels we provide would be an insult. The answer to most of the problems of this country can be found in the revival of the building industry. Good housing promotes good citizenship. Action must be taken to bridge the deposit gap. Interest must be brought to the level of the pay envelope and land prices must be reduced. The home-building industry is the hub upon which our economy revolves and not until this industry is revived to its fullest capacity will this country show any marked recovery from the drastic and damaging economic measures of the Government. The clearance of slums and the building of flats is a great step forward, but to the slum-dweller it is a tragedy in many respects. Not able to meet the rents of the new buildings, the slum-dwellers are compelled to look elsewhere. They become, as the honourable member for Parkes said, a section of the invisible poor. For them and for others I have mentioned to-day much could be done if only the Government had the desire and the will to do it. It is true that we have our invisible poor, the forgotten people. They are the recipients of the down-grade standard of living which the policies of this Government engender. A glaring example of this is the penalties the Government allows to apply against the most victimized group in Australia, the waterside workers. debate on bills to provide funds to make up excess expenditure in this financial year and to provide supply for the first five months of the next financial year, honourable members may discuss many matters. I wish to speak primarily about the Postmaster General's Department and briefly about taxation. The telephone system suffered during the war years because of a shortage of materials and the need to throw every effort into the war machine. After the war, it took the department a number of years to overcome the backlog of telephone installations. I do not cast any blame on any previous administration for that state of affairs. It resulted from the situation in which we found ourselves at the end of the last war. I pay great credit to the department, the departmental officers and the various Ministers .vho have been in charge of the department since that time for the remarkable growth that has taken place, for overcoming the backlog of telephone installations and for tackling a very much greater problem that resulted from the improved financial position of the people and the",42,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside

107,Mr Failes (Lawson) [3.32],"In thisimproved economic condition of Australia as a whole. The department has tackled the problem of meeting a demand for telephone services that probably was not even thought of in pre-war years. Figures will show that in the last decade remarkable progress has been made and we will soon have a telephone service that will be the admiration of other postal departments throughout the world. I direct the attention of the House to the ""Financial and Statistical Bulletin"" produced by the Postmaster-General's Department and dated 30th June, 1962. The figures give an indication of the amazing growth of the department's services, but in spite of that amazing growth there is still a very strong demand for telephone services in both metropolitan and country areas. From 1952 to 1962 services to telephone subscribers virtually doubled. Trunk line channels brought into operation have more than doubled. This means considerably more to country people than would be appreciated by persons living in cities and big towns. Some years ago one of the great problems we encountered related to trunk line services. If one wanted to ring a country town, a wait of two or three hours was not uncommon. I venture to say that to-day within a quarter of an hour virtually any town within a State can be contacted, so the department is well entitled to be proud of what it has done. A problem arises from the proposal that within a reasonable period one will be able to telephone, by automatically dialling, any subscriber within Australia, and probably overseas. Some persons say: "" We do not particularly want that. We want to have good contact in our own locality."" That is fair enough, but it is fine that the departexchange. These people said that they did ment is looking to the provision of automatic connection between all telephone subscribers in the Commonwealth within a comparatively short time. To achieve this, it is first necessary that individual telephone services be automatic. While some of the larger towns and cities are entirely served by automatic services, other large towns are only partly served by automatic telephones, and some smaller towns are not so served at all. An important link which remains to be provided is that with the individual subscriber who lives out of town. Speaking as the representative of a country area, I know the great problem associated with this. We have many old telephone lines, many party lines and many manual exchanges, and until these can be brought to the stage of automatic working it will be very difficult to provide completely automatic installations in the towns. It is necessary that town exchanges have both an automatic section and a manual section, which naturally is inefficient. Until all exchanges in country areas can be brought to automatic working, the ideal that the department has in view cannot be fully realized. In the meantime, it is doubling up-in some instances, trebling-o n trunk line services, and introducing more efficiency into their operation. The House should give high credit for what has been done, not only to the Minister and the department but also to every one connected with this gigantic undertaking. A problem arises in relation to non-official post offices in country areas, which depend upon some person who has other means of livelihood to keep open a telephone service for eight, ten, twelve or fifteen-probabl y not very many moresubscribers who are dependent upon him for their contact with the towns where they do their business and from which they receive medical attention. They rely upon this service for contact between their homes and the parent exchange in the town. As long ago as 1949, before I entered the House, people came to me to say that the exchange operator at such and such a place was giving the job away and that it was proposed to move the telephone lines a couple of miles away to another property, the owner of which would take over the not like it and would like me to see whether I could do something about having them connected by individual lines to the parent exchange. My impression at the time was that the man who proposed to take over the new exchange would not last twelve months. I expressed that view to the department, but it went ahead and shifted these lines 2 miles away to the other property. It then ran a trunk line from there to the town. Within twelve months, this man had given the game away and the department had to do what it might have done in the first place, namely, run individual lines to the parent exchange. This is all too common. Unfortunately, where non-official exchanges are 15 or 20 miles out of town, it becomes a very expensive matter to provide individual services, so departmental policy is to connect people to a non-official exchange and run a number of trunk lines to the parent exchange. I have said in this House before, and I repeat, that this is going back to the horse and buggy days. Only the other day I had a complaint from people who had had individual subscriber services for more than 40 years and been forced, because of circumstances such as I have mentioned, to join a party line with three other persons, system of the old horse-and-buggy days in one instance with four others. It is just one of those things that I cannot live with and I do not intend to live with it. The department's reason is that the automatic exchange which would serve these people is not ready for operation. In some cases there is a very good reason for transferring persons temporarily to a party line service. A few days ago I had a case in which a telephone attendant was giving up the job and subscribers were confronted with the proposition of joining a party line. The explanation given to me was that in that locality the rural automatic exchange, when established, would be in another direction, and that if the department built individual lines from the non-official exchange to the parent exchange, there would be duplication when the automatic exchange operated, because a line would have to be built in the opposite direction. The department therefore proposed to connect the subscribers temporarily to a party line, which would overcome the problem until the rural automatic exchange was installed. That is fair enough, but the fact remains that these people may have to wait four or five years before the rural automatic exchange is installed. The reasons lie in the shortage of money at the command of the department for increasing rural automatic exchange installations in country areas. This causes a reaction along the line. Not only is the local, non-official exchange not replaced by a rural automatic exchange, but also the town to which the rural automatic exchange should be connected is not being provided with an automatic exchange, although in some instances a building has already been provided for it. I know that some of my colleagues can cite instances from their own electorates of buildings being ready for automatic exchanges, but it is not sensible to install the exchanges until full automatic working can be provided. This difficulty arises at a number of small country exchanges. At this time, just before the Budget is to be considered, I make a strong plea that the Postmaster General's Department be provided with adequate funds to put these installations in country areas and so give people who are battling so hard against adversity of many kinds a communication facility of a satisfactory standard instead of the party line which I had to put up with for many years. for Kingsford-Smith says, ""The poor old cocky "". I do not think he says it with much sincerity. I point out that he is not backward in coming forward with requests for wage justice for the workers, for social justice, and so on. Of course, that is his job. I am simply asking that reasonable communication facilities be provided for people who live in the outback parts of Australia. Those people contribute so much to the wealth and prosperity of Australia by increasing our export potential, and they are thus responsible also for so many of the imports that we enjoy, because they are prepared to live in the outback parts and put up with the disabilities from which we all know they suffer. This is a very simple matter. It would not cost a great deal. For obvious reasons, I am not able to say what the cost would be; but in view of the few centres involved in each electorate the cost would not be great. Rural automatic telephone exchanges should be installed immediately in those places where the present telephone exchange officer is likely to go out of business. Often, when we complain about these things, the department says that it is open to any subscriber connected with the particular exchange to take over the running r of the exchange. That is quite unrealistic.",46,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside
108,Mr Curtin,The poor old cocky.,48,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside
109,Mr Failes,"The honourable memberTo start with, the exchange is usually on private property. The individual who owns the property lives there and sets aside a room in his dwelling for use as a telephone exchange or post office. He cannot very well make that room available to somebody else to use during the hours when the exchange should be working. If the exchange is to be removed to some other subscriber's property all lines connected to it must be moved to the new situation; and it is possible that in twelve months' time the new exchange keeper might decide to give up the job, in which event further alterations would have to be made. The only solution of the problem appears to be the establishment of more and more automatic telephone exchanges in country districts. That brings me to the Treasurer's part in dealing with this problem. When a new telephone exchange goes into operation an attempt is usually made to build up the standard of the line and give better service. As evidence of this I need only refer to the line that I did not enjoy but had to put up with for so many years. Not only did we find it difficult to hear, but, if a tree fell anywhere near the line or near r>. post, the service would probably be disrupted for a day or so. The idea to-day is to install telephone lines in accordance with high standards so they will not be affected by interference from power lines running throughout the district, which was another disability we had to put up with in the past. The aim to-day is to build the lines to such a standard that the automatic exchange will not be subject to the same failures and difficulties that were experienced with manual exchanges in the past. In many cases the cost of installing a line is expensive. First, the line itself must be of copper and the posts used to support the line must be durable. The whole job has to be done in a workmanlike way. I have no quarrel with that, but I emphasize that the individual who has to erect a line beyond the distance to which the Postmaster-General's Department is prepared to erect its section finds the cost very high. required. But there is a great problem Some people have told me that they are faced with a cost of from £400 to £500 for a telephone line. My colleague, the honorcombe), tells me that some of his constituents find that it will cost them £1,000 to install a new telephone line. Perhaps that is not a great cost compared with that of other forms of communication, such as motor cars and so on; but it is the accumulation of all these various items of cost that really ruins the man on the land. Let me qu3te my own experience in connection with the installation of an automatic exchange not very far from my property. In the first place, I was required to give away the old line, which I did willingly for the benefit of being connected to a rural automatic exchange. I think it cost four of us between £500 and £600 to be connected to the new exchange. We get no consideration from the Taxation Department for that expenditure at all. We are not allowed to claim any depreciation allowance for that type of thing, and I now ask the Treasurer to give consideration to granting a depreciation allowance in respect of the installation of telephones in country areas. reasonable proposition. The people are dependent upon the telephone for their dayto-day needs. They depend upon it for their communication with a doctor and for the conduct of their general business. Often there is no other way by which they can do these things, and it is only reasonable to suggest to the Treasurer that he give serious consideration to my proposition. I sincerely hope he will agree to it. While speaking of taxation, I should like to bring another matter to the Treasurer's notice. It relates to the assessment of provisional tax on mixed incomes. With straight incomes, whether they be salaries or wages, or whether they be income from business, there is no great problem, although I do understand that there is more collected by way of provisional tax than is ultimately levied in normal tax at the end of the relevant year. I have heard of many people who are always receiving rebates of tax, which would indicate to me that they have paid more provisional tax than is really associated with mixed incomes. First, the department makes an assessment of the provisional tax which shall be paid, and I understand there is virtually no appeal",48,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside
110,Able Member For Maranoa ( Mr Brimble,,49,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside
111,Mr Einfeld,I think you are quite right.,49,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside
112,Mr Failes,"That is a perfectlyagainst that assessment. The commissioner is given a discretion as to how he shall assess provisional tax, and I have been given the formula he uses. When it is carefully analysed, the formula does mean something, but it is not very clear at first glance. The formula used is to deduct from the provisional tax and the final assessment for gross tax payable on the total taxable in the year. In addition, he was required to come an amount equal to the tax due in pay provisional tax amounting to £185 for respect of the net salaries and wages after the following year. These are matters deducting concessional amounts. Let me try which the Treasurer should look into. to clarify that provision. It simply means Admittedly they are matters of administrathat in the case of a person in receipt of a tion, but this is a suitable time at which salary or wage, the provisional tax is laid to bring them to his notice. down in a schedule, but where he has an additional income a further process is involved. I suppose every honourable member might come within this category, although I emphasize that I am making no appeal on behalf of honourable members. I simply mention them by way of illustration. Where the mixed income consists of income from a wage or salary plus some additional income, the rate which would normally be to the problem of paying death duties, parthe basis of the provisional tax for the salary ticularly on the estates of deceased farmers. or wage is increased because of the addiIn most cases the entire estate is vested in tion in income.

The department should be allowed to be more flexible in its approach to such cases. Another assessment which was sent to me showed that the taxpayer had to pay a difference of £95 between the amount of The payment of death duties is always a matter of great concern. I refer to not only Commonwealth death duties but also State probate duties. I have nothing to say about State probate duties because they are the responsibility entirely of the State governments. The Commonwealth Government should give a lot of consideration some cases the effect is even worse. I have Although this matter is a hardy annual months old were left. The whole property had to be sold to pay Commonwealth death duties and State probate duty. I hope that the Postmaster-General's Department will be accorded the greatest consideration when the Estimates for the next financial year are being prepared. I hope that efforts will be made to increase the number of rural automatic exchanges so that ultimately we shall have a telephone service in Australia of which we may be proud. Really, we are proud of the existing service, but it is in need of that extra assistance to which 1 have referred. honourable member for Lawson( Mr Failes) has raised a rather plaintive cry about the problems of the Postmaster-General's Department and, in particular, the provision of telephones and country telephone exchanges. I think the honourable member has overlooked the fact that the Postmaster General( Mr Davidson), who has the responsibility of ensuring the provision of these facilities for the public, is a member of the Australian Country Party. I suggest that the honourable member for Lawson should first make representations to the Postmaster-General and ask him to submit these matters to the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) when the Estimates are being prepared. There is a shortage of telephone services not only in country areas but throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Wherever you go you find that people have been waiting for many years for a telephone to be installed. I have applied for automatic exchanges in towns in my own electorate. The town of Richmond, which has more than 460 subscribers, still has a manual exchange. It is a shocking thing that to-day, seventeen years after the last war, when surely all shortages should have been overcome, we still lack these telephone services. I again suggest to the honourable member for Lawson that he should see the Postmaster-General, who is a member of his own party and is responsible for the existing state of affairs, about In some other instances there is more than having the matter rectified. To-day the Government and the various departments are considering the Estimates for the next financial year. I should like to take advantage of this opportunity to make an appeal on behalf of civilian widows. Of all the social problems which face this country and which this Parliament has a responsibility to remedy the plight of the civilian widow is tbe most serious. A widow with three children has to live on only £7 a week. This is the most distressing of all the problems which come before me. I realize that this matter is not a votewinner, because the number of civilian widows is very small indeed when compared with the total number of pensioners and the population as a whole. Nevertheless, it is a problem which affects the social conscience and which this Government should face up to. Quite a lot of good would be done if we, as men in our thirties, forties, or fifties, were to visualize what would happen if we died and left a widow with a number of children. Let us visualize what the position would be if, during our lifetime, we had been in receipt of a comparatively small income of £20 a week, perhaps £15, or even £30. Naturally, when one is bringing up a family on that income there is very little opportunity to put aside anything for a rainy day. Accordingly these women are suddenly faced with a situation that they had no possible reason to anticipate. Keep that in mind. They are widowed without any warning, so they are suddenly faced with a very serious financial problem. Aged people are aware of approaching retirement and usually endeavour to take some action to safeguard their future, but civilian widows usually have lost their husband3 unexpectedly. There is virtually no warning of the domestic tragedy, nor any opportunity for them to take measures to guard their future. At the death of her husband, a widow might have five or six children. Immediately this family is faced with an extremely difficult financial problem which, after a period of time, becomes also a very serious social problem. We should also keep in mind in the case of a civilian widow that there is usually only one pension coming into the house. one pension. I was very pleased to hear yesterday from the honourable member for McMillian( Mr Buchanan) the statement that the situation regarding war widows and civilian widows is basically the same, yet there is this disparity in their pensions. I raised this point and made a similar remark",49,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside
113,Mr Armitage (Mitchell) [4.1],"Th eduring the last sessional period. I am a returned serviceman who is more than happy that the needs of the war widows have been assessed on the basis that they are required to provide for themselves and to feud, educate and raise families. I cannot understand the logic whereby a war widow with three children receives £13 11$. 6d. a week and a civilian widow with three children receives only £7 a week. In other words, we accept our responsibilities as a government in respect of war widows, but we are not prepared to accept our responsibilities regarding civilian widows. We give a woman with three children £7 a week upon which to live! Is it any wonder that women so situated are finding it more and more necessaryparticularly with the increasing costs that have occurred and are occurring under this Government-to go out to work and leave young children-sometime s very young children indeed-to look after themselves? A very serious social problem is involved because the children not only are deprived of their father and his influence upon the home, but also through economic necessity and the refusal of this Government to face up to its responsibilities, are deprived of their mother at a time when she should be with them, but has to go out to work. We should look at this as a matter of social conscience, not as a vote-winner. It is not a vote-winner. Out of our population of 10,000,000, class A widow pensioners totalled only 24,584 at 30th June, 1962. ClassB widow pensioners as at the same date totalled 32,157. Thus class A and B civilian widow pensioners totalled 56,741 nearly twelve months ago, a very small section of our population. The matter I have raised is a very serious social probare also many superannuated persons and lem which must be faced and corrected by this Government. It seems to me that we have reached the income. So there is a very real need for stage where Australia is one of the most a national survey on poverty in Australia. backward Western countries, in terms of I ask the Government to give serious consocial services, and particularly in the field sideration to this aspect. We need to set of family benefit. There is an urgent need up a committee of inquiry so that we may to-day for an increase in family benefit, obtain information about the poverty that particularly child endowment. This is exists in this country and awaken our the only method which can be employed national conscience on the matter. If that to assist the family man. To-day far too were done, we also would know what many family groups are living in poverty. action we should take to correct the We cannot overcome the problem of their position. poverty by awards. We cannot grant a higher wage or salary to the person who has a family. The problem can be solved only through social service benefits. We have to realize that if we wish the Australian people to have families, if we wish to ensure that those families have adequate opportunities for decent standards of living and of education, if our standards are to progress instead of declining, we must face up to our responsibility to assist civilian widows, aged people and the family by increased family benefits. Australia is one of the most backward countries of the Western world in the provision of family benefits and social services generally. We have reached the stage where a national survey on poverty is needed. This is being done in the United States of America to-day. We do not realize the poverty that exists in this country. The"" Sydney Morning Herald"" of 29th April, 1963, reports that a national survey carried out in the United States to establish the extent of poverty there found that poverty affects one in every five people of that nation. 1 believe that if a similar survey were carried out here to-day we would find a similar situation. For example, the Commonwealth Bureau of Census and Statistics stated that in October, 1961, adult males earning less than £18 per week totalled 127,873. I do not believe that any breadwinner earning £18 a week or lessparticularly if he has children-is not poverty-stricken. I believe we should add to that total the age and invalid pensioners who, at 30th June, 1962, totalled 691,258. We should also add the civilian widow pensioners who, at 30th June, 1962, totalled 56,836. There other groups in this community who are not receiving a salary, wage or allowance of some kind to give them a substantial weekly that thefindingsof a committee of inquiry would cost it too much money. Government would be both surprised and shocked by the findings which such a committee would make. These are problems which require careful consideration by the Government, as it faces the coming Budget session. I wish now to refer to the subject of defence. The Australian people have never in the past commenced an arms race, and I do not think they will do so in the future, but we must endeavour to be realistic, as we were in the past, particularly under Labour governments. ments? Chifley Labour Governments. The Menzies Government had to abdicate its responsibilities in the middle of a war because of its inadequacy and inability to prosecute the war effort. As I have said, we must be realistic about this problem. If other countries near Australia are indulging in arms races we must take adequate precautions. It is to be hoped that the Government's defence plans which are to be announced will provide for proper strengthening of our defences and place emphasis upon the Air Force and the Navy, the provision of adequate communications, industrial build-up and apprenticeship training, as the very basic necessities of any defence planning. A few moments ago the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon) asked, by interjection, which Labour governments had been realise about the defence of Australia. He is' rather young and has still to learn many things. It may be educational for him if I quote a statement made by Mr Chifley, a previous Prime Minister of Australia. On 2nd March, 1951, Mr craft were delivered even if orders were Chifley saidAfter having weighed all the aspects, I think must be faced realistically. This Governthat compulsory military training is economically ment has not yet faced it, but it must do so unsound. I think that Australia should build up its forces, particularly the Royal Australian Air Force, and in the Navy, submarine and antisubmarine vessels, having regard to the present trend of atom warfare by submarines. Expenditure on the Royal Australian Air Force is justified, particularly because of the relatively low drain on ouj resources and because of the flexibility of airborne strength. Mr Einfeld Who said that? Mr Chifley, a former Prime Minister of Australia, on 2nd March, 1951. To-day, more than twelve years later, this Government is beginning to come round to a similar kind of thinking, with the realization that emphasis must be placed on the Air Force and the Navy. It has taken the Government twelve years to realize that that is the only approach which can be made in providing adequate defence for this country. Emphasis must be placed on strengthening the Air Force and the Navy in view of the Labour governgeographical position of Australia and the difficulty of protecting such a vast country, with a huge perimeter and a small population. We must become a highly technical nation, with effective modern striking weapons. I have within my electorate, Mr Speaker, the air base at Richmond. Having had some association with the base, I cannot help but admire the dedication of the Air Force personnel there, but at the same time. I can appreciate their frustration because, apart from the Neptune, they have no contemporary aircraft and they have none on order, apart from the Mirage fighters. They have the obsolete Canberras, which lack the speed and range of contemporary aircraft. The Canberra bomber should have been replaced years ago. Despite three questions by me in the last year and questions by other honourable members in this House, the matter is still being investigated. To-day, we have not a bomber aircraft whioh can be considered modern and which is not obsolete in terms of modern requirements for bomber aircraft. The Canberra bombers must be replaced, and it is the responsibility of this Government to get on with the job now, because some years could elapse before airplaced to-day. This is a problem which in the very near future if it is not to leave our country once again, as it did before the last war, in a completely undefended state in terras of modern-day equipment.",51,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside

118,Mr Armitage,"That was said byTo my mind, there is a lack of logic in the decision of the Government, or of its employees, to dismiss female personnel at the St. Mary's filling factory, at the time of need of review. You have only to peruse the proposed defence build-up. I find it hard to understand why these dismissals are taking place at the munitions filling factory at a time when the Government is saying that it intends to increase defence expenditure. should like to hear from the Minister for Supply( Mr Fairhall) on this question and to have his explanation of such a contradictory set of circumstances. I hope, Mr Speaker, that our defence plans will place emphasis on strengthening the Air Force and the Navy. Australia may never be invaded-le t us hope that it will not be-bu t we might well be surrounded by hostile forces. We would be unable either to import or export goods unless we have adequate air and naval defences. We have to beware of the suggestion that we cannot spend money at this period on both defence and social services. of them. I said that we must beware of the very point you are making. I think we can do both, under the present economic set-up. Let me give my reasons for saying that. We have to-day a buoyant revenue. Our revenue is increasing. Marginal increments have just been awarded, and no doubt there are more to come. That will mean an increase in revenue. Also, for the first time for many years, because this Government has placed such a severe restriction on the economy, many members of the business community no longer have confidence in investing in the private sector of the economy. another way what I mean. Recently, we mittee to inquire into the possibility of saw the first really successful Commonestablishing a national disaster insurance wealth loan for many years. I believe that, fund to insure farmers and other persons under these conditions, the bond market is likely to be affected against bush fires, steadily improving and will continue to floods and other national disasters. This do so. It is to be hoped that increased idea is not new. Something along these revenue, together with the extra finance lines is being done in other countries. In available from the bond market, will the United States a fund of this kind is enable the Government to provide adequate defences and to increase social service benefits, which are urgently in the latest statistical surveys to see that what I have said is correct. In a few months' time it will be apparent that receipts from revenue and loan raisings have increased. SoI do not accept the suggestion that Australia cannot increase her defences and at the same time improve social services. While dealing with this subject. I should also direct attention to the lack of logic on the part of many Government supporters who suggest that the statutory limits imposed on savings banks so far as investment in housing is concerned should be raised. At present the banks are required to invest 30 per cent, of their funds in housing or similar types of securities. The remaining 70 per cent, of their deposits either has to be lodged with the Reserve Bank in the form of notes, bullion and coin or be invested in Commonwealth, State or local government securities. Honourable members opposite suggest that the limit of 30 per cent, should be increased to, say, 35 per cent. That argument is without logic because even if the limit is raised to 35 per cent, there will be no significant impact on the housing shortage. The truth is that the savings banks to-day are lending considerably less than 30 per cent, of their funds for housing purposes. The highest figure is 22i per cent, and many of the banks are lending less than 20 per cent. The reason for this condition is that the banks must support the Commonwealth loans, which in the past have not been very successful. So, the suggestion that has been put forward by honourable members is not very practical. During the last week vast areas of New South Wales have suffered from floods. Many areas in my electorate have been affected. Districts such as Windsor and Richmond have suffered severely. This Par-",53,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside

124,Mr Armitage,"I shall explain in liament should consider setting up a comfinanced directly by the government. Such a fund exists in New Zealand and in 1961 it had £24,000,000 to its credit. That fund is financed by a levy of ls. on every £100 of all insurance policies. The money is set aside to meet disasters such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods and bush fires. European countries have tackled this problem and Australia must also tackle it because severe losses are inflicted on people in this country whenever there is a flood. There are severe losses of income and property, quite apart from the fact that in some instances unfortunately there is loss of life as well. I urge the Government to consider setting up a committee to inquire into the possibility of establishing a national disaster insurance fund. The committee could inquire into ways of financing the fund and the types of disasters to be covered by the fund. I appeal to the Government to consider, when the Budget is being prepared, all the urgent problems that I have mentioned here to-day. I particularly urge the Government to give consideration to the very serious problems confronting civilian widows, families and aged persons. Remember the civilian widowl She is not a great voting force, but she faces one of the greatest social and economic problems that can confront any section of the community. It is the duty of every member of this Parliament to face up to this problem and earnestly to endeavour to ensure that civilian widows are given every opportunity to raise their children in reasonable comfort and to provide them with a good education. We must ensure that future generations of Australians will be able to look forward to living in a great Australiaa country of which they may be proud. dealing with the matters that I wish to scientific research and newer and more raise to-day I must first advert to one of efficient equipment, combined with the the matters dealt with by the honourable training of the people engaged in those member for Mitchell( Mr Armitage).

However, I think the Federal interesting one. It would have been a shame Government could show a great deal more to let the truth spoil the honourable memfinancial interest, rather than academic ber's prepared speech. The honourable member said that if this Government does not do something about Australia's defences the country will be left in the same shocking state as it was before the last war. I would like to quote some remarks of Mr Curtin, that great Prime Minister who took office on 2nd October, 1941. Those of us who knew Mr Curtin knew him as a man who never dodged the truth. Commenting on 20th October, 1941, on what the honourable member for Mitchell calls the shocking state of Australia's defences, Mr Curtin saidSince assuming office, the Government has made a broad review of the situation with the Chiefs of Staff and the Commander-in-Chief, Far East. The Navy is at the highest pitch of efficiency, as demonstrated by the notable exploits of some of its ships overseas. The home defence army is well trained and its equipment has been greatly improved. The strength of the Air Force has been greatly increased, both in respect of home defence squadrons and the training resources for the Empire Air Scheme. The equipment of the Air Force has also been much improved. Finally, ammunitions production and development of production capacity over a wide range of classes, including aircraft, is growing weekly. That comment was made by Mr Curtin only eighteen days after he took office. Obviously, the statement made by the honourable member for Mitchell is untrue. Accordingly, it is hard to know how much of the rest of his speech may be relied on. I want to bring to the notice of the Government an important aspect of the progress and development of our great primary producing industries. This is a subject which is referred to under many headings, but mainly it is referred to as farm management clubs. For hundreds of years expert opinion throughout the world has been that primary producing industries interest, in extension services.",54,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside
125,Mr Holten (Indi) [4.31],"Before must be prepared to use the results ofI want to refer to a report that was compiled by the Department of Primary Industry on the subject of farm management club». I should like to compliment the d-/partment on the standard of this report, which was compiled only this year. Before dealing with the report I should like to meation briefly the background of farm management clubs. They were first formed in the United States of America and are at present operating in at least five States of that country. The clubs in that country have many more members and are much larger than those in Australia, and the results obtained from their formation have been very good. New Zealand was the first country to follow suit and to encourage the formation of farm management clubs, and there are now in New Zealand eighteen clubs and 23 groups of farmers in them. The membership of the groups there is as high as it is in Australia, each group having between 35 and 50 farmers. The Australian movement began at Bombala in 1956-onl y seven years ago. Since then five clubs have been formed in New South Wales and another four are in the process of formation. South Australia has three clubs, but Western Australia has fourteen and several others in the process of formation. According to the report I received, Tasmania, Queensland and Victoria have no farm management clubs. Other figures I have show that there are 22 clubs, plus seven or eight in the process of formation, making the expected total number of 30 clubs in Australia at the end of this year. LaterI shall mention some of the results that these clubs have achieved. I have a record of the results achieved by members of the Bombala district organization and I shall enumerate a few of them. One farm-propert y A as it is referred to in this report-o n an area of 6,000 acres in 1952, before the establishment of the farm management club, carried 6,000 sheep and 200 head of cattle, and produced 150 bales of wool. In 1961, that property carried 10,000 sheep and 900 head of cattle, and produced 400 bales of wool. Another property of an area of 1,100 acres, in 1962, carried 1,500 ewes for fat lambs and 300 cross-bred ewes, compared with 1,600 sheep in 1952, and it also carried 100 head of cattle compared with 40 in 1952. One other property to which I would like to refer has an area of 650 acres. Ten years ago it carried 700 sheep and 20 head of cattle, but now it carries 1,300 ewes and 60 head of cattle. These results all follow one pattern. Since the formation of the farm management club in the Bombala district some properties have shown considerably more improvement than others, but all of them have shown some improvement. The farmers say that the advantages are a continuation of farm management advice, an immediate application of research findings, and immediate attention to problems and working out of solutions, technical and otherwise, of a seasonal or long-term nature. They say that consultants get to know the farms very well and that often a phone call is all that is necessary to solve some problem. The farmers say that they are able to plan for their present and future family security and that they get great assistance from their adviser in presenting a factual case to financial institutions for further short or long term advances. So it will be seen that the farmers are appreciative of the results obtained from the formation of these clubs. SinceI have been a member of the Parliament I have quite often heard criticism of the farming methods and the general set-up of primary industry in the United States of America. The most common criticism has been of price support programmes, over-production and huge surpluses in that country. We must all bear in mind that many factors can give rise to these problems in the United States of America, and I feel that sometimes people speak in a far too general manner about the state of American primary industries. The United States has an enormous primary producing industry, and my studies have shown that many of the standards and improvements achieved have resulted often in great benefit to the primary producers of Australia. The important thing to remember about these improvements, particularly in respect of machinery-no t so much in respect of chemicals, because we owe more to Europe than to America on that scoreand increased production in America is that these standards have been achieved with considerable government assistance over the past 100 years. Just as Australian farmers have followed the improved machinery and technical developments of the United States of America, the Australian Government should be prepared to study the legislation that has been introduced in America not merely over the last three years but over the last 50 or 70 years to see if it cannot or should not be applied to the primary producing industries of Australia. I agree that none of us wants to see the enorAdermann) each year receives a budget mous price support that is given to the farmers in America, but surely, if countries other than America recognize the principle that it is necessary to support or subsidize some primary producing industries, the Australian Government must take this fact into consideration. Let me renew the plea that I have made for the re-introduction of a subsidy on superphosphate. Many honourable members, including the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Nixon), the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr King), the honourable member for Mallee( Mr Turnbull), the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes), the honourable member for Wannon( Mr importance of the clubs, as the United Malcolm Fraser) and others of my colleagues have referred to this matter. They all recognize the importance of assisting the primary producers to counter the cost-price squeeze from which they have been suffering for many years. 1 hope that the Government will agree this year to the re-introduction of the subsidy even if it is only very small. a pretty reasonable amount. Labour Party's policy speech? Party policy we never heard of it before increased by 25 per cent, whereas last year, whereas, in my experience alone, the net income of the 50 farms which did we have been raising this matter for four not employ a consultant decreased by 20 years. We agree that the Leader of the per cent. That is pretty conclusive proof Opposition ( Mr Calwell) mentioned a that the information of farm management subsidy on superphosphate in his policy clubs should be encouraged and that the speech, but he also mentioned everything Commonwealth Government should take else that he thought would be acceptable to not merely an academic imerest but also the Australian people and would strike a a financial interest in the movement. If harmonious note with them. In fact, his the Commonwealth Government did this policy speech included everything except the primary industries would benelit, the Labour's attitude to the naval communicafarmers would benefit and Australia aa a tions base at Exmouth Gulf, and that was whole would benefit. not included because his bosses, the 36 faceless men, had not had time to decide what Labour's attitude would be. Let me deal now with Commonwealth assistance to the farm management clubs. The Minister for Primary Industry( Mr allocation of £50,000 which he may allot to special projects. Perhaps the Minister would consider sympathetically my request for a small donation, if I may call it that, to the existing farm management clubs. There are only 30 such clubs and if the Minister allotted £200 to each for a trial period of three years the total allocation would be only £6,000. That is not very much money. I suppose the clubs would devote the allocation towards meeting the salaries of the expert advisers that they employ. The strength of my request lies in the fact that if the Government made such an allocation to the farm management clubs it would show that it recognized the States and New Zealand do, and was prepared to show its interest in them in a practical way. At the end of the trial period a report could be prepared showing the results of the clubs' operations over the three years. I recall hearing about four years ago on Mr Douglas's Australian Broadcasting Commission programme, ""The Rural Hour "", that 50 farmers who were employing an expert consultant and 50 farmers employing an expert adviser were selected by the United States Government for obtained on the two groups of farms were examined.

129,Mr Holten,"If it is part of Labour 50 farms which employed an expert adviserHouse is indebted to the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) for his speech this afternoon in which he pointed out how unjustly the members of the Waterside Workers Federation have been treated by the Government, and how the disputes that have taken place on the waterfront clearly have been the result of extreme provocation by the Government and its supporters. The Government seems determined to cause trouble on the waterfront in the hope that it can lay the blame on the Waterside Workers Federation. To-day the honourable member for East Sydney exploded the Government's plan. He traced the history of the waterfront step by step, dispute by dispute. He showed clearly how the waterside workers have presented a just claim which the ship owners have rejected, how waterside workers were suspended and how, when the case finally -ame before a judgeMr Justice Ashburner in one instancetheir claims were upheld. It is sad to think that to-day the great record of our conciliation and arbitration system is being sabotaged deliberately by this Government which tries to shift the blame on to a section of the trade unions.

We are interested in the trade union movement which has been closely allied to us. Not only are we interested not any pressure. in the labourers and tradesmen but we are vitally concerned with the white collar workers. They can rely upon our support Miss Russell said it. The true report of in the struggle against this Government. The this matter appeared in the Melbourne honourable member for Grayndler ( Mr Sun News-PiUorial"" this morning.

The white collar workers brought to bear on her not to stand as an almost unseated the Minister for Labour and National Service in the last general election, but they will unseat a lot of honourable members opposite at the next general election because they are determined to get justice. They are determined that their rights will be given to them. They have realized, at last, that the political weapon is their best weapon to achieve this result. They are making it clear by protesting throughout the length and breadth of Australia that honourable members opposite who are denying them wage justice, be it at the wage level or the salary level, will face their organized attempt to unseat Government supporters at the next general election. I now want to refer to the great publicity stunt that took place in this Parliament this morning when the honourable member for Sturt( Mr Wilson) rose in his place with great indignation. It was a great act. He said that he was concerned about some press report and referred to a most false and misleading article which had' been published by that most unreliable newspaper, the ""Sydney Morning Herald"". This article stated that certain members of the Australian Labour Party had gone to interview Miss Russell. Mr Jeff Bate -D o you deny it? honourable member who, this morning, asked a question of the Minister for the Interior( Mr Freeth). It may be that the Minister sponsored the question. I do not know.

132,Mr Galvin,"I did not say it, butindependent. Yet a great stunt was organized in this chamber this morning in order to try, once again, to create a certain feeling in the Grey electorate in the hope that the Government might be able to catch a few votes and make it appear that its position in the country is better than it is. Unfortunately, the by-election in the division of Grey has been brought about by the death of a very respected member of this Parliament, Mr E. H. D. Russell, who, over the years, had served his electorate exceedingly well. He fought valiantly for rail standardization in his electorate. He never missed an occasion to lead the fight of other members of the Labour Party for this greatly desired improvement in the railway system. Eighteen months ago the South Australian Government began litigation against the Commonwealth Government to try to force it to carry out an agreement which the Chifley Labour Government had made to complete rail standardization in the division of Grey. The present Government opposed the completion of the job. It defended the case in the High Court of Australia. It is true that the High Court gave a verdict for the Commonwealth. But the fight over this rail standardization costs thousands of pounds of the people's money. No action would have been taken by this Government to standardize the rail gauge between Broken Hill and Port Pirie, it is sad to say, but for the death of the honourable member for Grey. During his lifetime, the Government would never accede to his request, but he continued to fight for this great work. When the Government thought that there were a few thousand votes to be gained it became prepared, overnight, to implement the plan. We all hope that the Government will implement the plan. But it can be said that, in life, Mr Russell worked resolutely to have the plan implemented and in death achieved the objective. I want, now, to speak on a matter that has given me some great concern. It is the latest take-over. I am Lot referring to a take-over by big business. I think that probably the most serious problem that the Australian nation has had to face is the take-over of West New Guinea by F.2954/63 -R -f36 ] Indonesia-the final walk-in by Indonesia. We all remember, over a comparatively short period, the threats of invasion and the actual invasion that led up to Indonesia's taking over Dutch New Guinea, West New Guinea or West Irian as it is now called. I suppose that we ought to call it by that name. On lst May, yesterday, the Indonesian Government took over that portion of New Guinea which used to be known as West New Guinea. At this stage, Indonesia is taking over this territory in an administrative capacity. Plans have been made for a plebiscite of the people to be taken in 1969. I think we can take it for granted that Indonesia intends to stay in that section of New Guinea irrespective of what the native inhabitants of the country may think. The historic act of the Indonesians taking over West New Guinea occurred on lst May. This means that for the first time Australia has as its close neighbour, with a common border, a nation which, in a very few years, has welded itself into a very mighty and formidable military power. From now on, Indonesia and Australia will have a common frontiera frontier that will in future be marked by border posts instead of merely a line on a map. In the past, we have not worried over-much about that border, but now we shall have on the other side of it a countiy of about 100,000,000 people which, as I have said, has great potential military strength. We could almost say that it faces us across our common border. Mr Jeff Bate -The potential strength is really Russian. the honourable member about that. Indonesia's strength has been built up by Russian arms. Perhaps this is all the more reason why we should be very serious about this matter. The fact is that to-day this mighty power is right beside us. We shall not easily become accustomed to this new situation. We have to co-operate with Indonesia, of course. We have to hold out the hand of friendship and we must give mutual assistance. We have to live with the Indonesians in New Guinea. There will be problems, of course. We plan to hand our section of New Guinea to the natives ultimately. We plan to educate them and",58,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside
133,Mr Galvin,"I do not disagree withtrain them to lead and to govern, and then let them decide for themselves how they shall be governed. We plan to let them control their own country. But I think it is not unfair to say that Indonesia will remain in control of the other part of the island of New Guinea. Even before the United Nations flag was hauled down in West New Guinea and the Indonesian flag raised, we witnessed the first act of friendship, if one may so describe it, by Indonesia. The Australian people were told in no uncertain manner that their overseas airline, Qantas Empire Airways Limited, could no longer fly over West New Guinea. Let us hope that this action was not meant to be a slap in the face. It is not a very friendly approach. It is not the sort of approach that wins friends. under Indonesian control, as well as twenty For years, Qantas has enjoyed the right to fly over that territory and, indeed, has enjoyed the right to fly over Indonesia itself. But the Indonesians now say that Qantas must fly round their newly acquired territory. In the Sydney"" Sun"" of yesterday's date, it was reported that the Austrathink that Australia can stand idly by and lian Embassy in Djakarta on 24th April had handed over a request concerning the flight of a Qantas Boeing aircraft over West New Guinea, but that no reply had been received. The report went on to state that the Minister for Civil Aviation (Senator Paltridge) had said that because no reply to the request had been received a reminder had been sent We want to be friendly with Indonesia, and we should be friendly. Indeed, we are friendly disposed towards that country, because, under the Colombo Plan, we are holding out the hand of friendship. We are doing something to help the Indonesians. But surely we are entitled to expect friendly acts in return. Surely we are entitled to expect that our overseas airliners will be allowed to travel over the Indonesian part of New Guinea. students. ber's interjection reminds me of the seven students from West New Guinea who are training in Port Moresby to enter the medical profession. Because of some criticism of the Indonesian Government, they have been ordered to return home, and it is reported that they have asked the Australian Government to allow them to stay. Yesterday, the Minister for External Affairs( Sir Garfield Barwick) said that he hoped that these students would be able to complete their studies in Port Moresby. They certainly should be allowed to do so. I hope thaf, even if they did criticize the Indonesian authorities, we would not order them to return to West New Guinea as requested. We have given asylum to some very strange people. We have had Petrov wandering about this country. Surely we can deal with these students in a spirit of humanity. It is interesting to note that already there are 15,000 troops, and may even be 30,000 troops, in the part of New Guinea battleships, Russian-built long-range bombers, supersonic fighters and submarines. Maybe they are there only for a display of might on the occasion of the taking over by the Indonesians of this poor section of New Guinea. However, I do not say: ""Take no notice of all that. It does not mean anything."" These forces are in West New Guinea for a purpose, and we may learn more about it in the future. It has already been reported that President Soekarno of Indonesia refers to the Australian section of New Guinea as East Irian. Maybe that does not mean anything. But that part of New Guinea has never before been known as East Irian. The section of the island that the Indonesians have taken over was never known as West Irian until they decided that they would take it over. It has been reported also that President Soekarno describes Khrushchev as the ruler of Europe and President Kennedy of the United States of America as the force in the Pacific area, and states that Indonesia will be the force in South-East Asia. What are we to do about the situation? What is our policy to be? It must be friendly and co-operative. We must do all we can with the Indonesians to provide mutual aid. This aid must be on a giveand-take basis. All the giving cannot be on our part. We cannot forever hold out the hand of friendship and expect nothing in return. We are helping Indonesia under the Colombo Plan, and we hope to be able to increase our help. But can the",59,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside

135,Mr Galvin,"The honourable memAustralian taxpayers, as well as taxpayers in other countries, be expected to pay high taxes to assist the Indonesians if they spend four-fifths of their budget on military preparations? The Indonesians have to be reminded that if they continue to spend such huge sums on military preparations they cannot expect us to contribute more and more to help them in other ways. We hope that the Indonesians will be friendly. We want friendliness. We have to be friendly in our attitude to the Indonesians, but at the same time we must be firm. We have to let them know that we will not tolerate any ventures or any wanderings over the border into the part of New Guinea under our control. Australia can no longer afford to say: "" Defence does not matter. Any threat against which we need to defend ourselves exists on the other side of the world."" We now have right on our doorstep, only a few hundred miles from the shores of our mainland, a very strong military power. Let us not say that that is not something to worry about. Unfortunately, we cannot do much about the existing situation with respect to our relations with Indonesia. I think it has been brought about mainly by this Government's short-sightedness in having part-time Ministers for External Affairs. I do not blame the present Minister. Earlier we had the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) as a part-time Minister for External Affairs, and before him Lord Casey was Minister. Had they continued the policy laid down by Dr. Evatt under the Chifley Government, we may have been able to prevent the partition of the island of New Guinea and to bring together both parts of the island under the administration of the United Nations. That should have been our objective. Partition is no good anywhere. We showed no foresight in this matter and, in the final analysis, the United States and the United Kingdom were not much concerned about it. It was our problem. Because the Government has been lazy during its period of office and has not looked to the future, we have now the accomplished fact that right on our doorstep is a neighbour with which we want to be friendly, but which is a mighty military power just the same. We could have had a nation governed by its native people, united under one banner and administered in the early years by the United Nations. I pass now to our defence policy. The Prime Minister yesterday was asked a question on defence by the honourable member for La Trobe( Mr Jess), who is, I think, interjecting. The honourable member for La Trobe asked the Prime Minister whether we could expect a statement to be made on defence. Sir Robert Menzies repliedI am certainly hoping, and indeed expecting, that a statement on this matter can be made before the House rises. In the meantime, I just want to say that I have read with great interest some of the rather dogmatic statements in the newspapers. They are all pure speculation and I would advise all honourable members to wait for the official announcement before forming any opinions on this matter. Well, the Prime Minister is hoping! He is expecting! He should be in a position to say definitely that the statement will be presented to the House. The Prime Minister himself could make that statement. It is not good enough for him to talk about expecting. It is not good enough for him to be telling us that the newspapers should not be saying these things. This Parliament should be saying them. The Minister for Defence( Mr Townley) is ill and we are all sorry about it, but that does not excuse the Prime Minister and the other members of this Government for not presenting a statement on defence to let us know where we are going in this matter. I know that it is said that we have nothing to worry about and that we should not take any notice of this huge build-up; it does not mean a thing. I remind this House that another great peace-loving nation, India, a few years ago, and a few months ago for that matter, thought that on its borders was a neighbour from which it had nothing to fear. There was mighty military strength, but nothing to fear. But overnight the peace-loving nation of China, in an aggressive manner, marched into India and attacked that country. We hope hostilities do not break out again, but if they do break out, and if they develop into a global war, where would we stand? Where would the countries near our shores stand? If we ever needed a defence policy, we need it to-day. We want a statement to be presented in this House quickly to let us know what the Government has in mind about defence. The Australian Labour Party has never criticized the amount of money the Government has spent on defence. It has certainly criticized how the Government has spent the money. The Australian Labour Party has a proud record in defence. Consider its record in the last war, the bringing to birth of the Woomera rocket range, and, in earlier years, the establishment of the Royal Australian Navy and the Royal Military College, Duntroonl The Australian Labour Party through its governments has been in the forefront of defence planning in Australia. It has never shirked the fight on defence. To-day we should be looking at defence more than any other problem with which we are faced. Defence is something that we can no longer brush aside. During the last war we were pleased to not know. Those are the only facts which have the assistance of a great ally, the stand indisputably on the record at present. United States of America. Before that war, Let us see how this matter develops. we may have thought we could stand alone, but we found that we could not. One thing is certain: If we are ever involved in a conflict again it will be impossible to fight Broken Hill to Port Pirie line was altogether alone. The Labour Party's policy is close factual. I hope I will not be named as one co-operation with the United States of of the people who have been luke-warm America. Together with the United States, about this line.

The Minister for External Affairs said yesterday that these thousands last December a select committee of the and thousands of troops are engaged on the South Australian Parliament made a report work of government. I think these nations which came before the Federal Government ought to be educated to know that you do in the early months of this year. That report not carry out administrative work with was the real genesis of the decision to rerifles, bayonets, bombs and fighters. We construct the line at this time. I think that hope that we can achieve friendship with should be placed on record. The House our near neighbours.

I regretted to hear what he had to say about events in the electorate of Grey. It is true that he did not directly criticize Miss Russell, but he was laying the foundation for an attack upon her which could eventuate in certain circumstances. AllI know about this matter is that Miss Russell was a loyal daughter to her father. During his illness she did a great deal to run the electorate. I know that she had ambitions to succeed him. I know that people from the Labour Party in South Australia interviewed her recently in relation to those ambitions. Whether they succeeded in forcing her to withdraw, I do I do not think that the honourable member's reference to the standardization of the I remind honourable members that only I was indeed pleased to hear the honourable member say that he backed a more jer sources.",60,Appropriation Bill No 2 1962 63 Arbitrator Found Against The Waterside
136,"Mr Wentworth (Mackellar) [5.21]. Vigorous Defence Policy, But I Was A Little","Labour has frequently criticized the amount spent on defence -I s the honourable member prepared to The honourable member referred to the proud record, as he called it, of the Labour Government in regard to defence. Let me remind him of the salient fact, which is this: Labour has had no quarrels with defence programmes when the Communists have been in favour of those programmes. In the early days of the last war, from 1939 until June of 1941, when Hitler turned on his ally Stalin, sections of the Labour Party in this Parliament and outside it endeavoured to sabotage the war effort in the interests of Russia. They bad not a proud record. I am not impugning the loyalty of all members of the Labour Party -ver y far from it-bu t I do say that during the early days of the war, when Russia and Nazi Germany were allied, there was considerable disloyalty incorporated in the structure of the Labour Party, and that led to the virtual sabotage of the defence effort. It was not until after June, 1941, that Labour came to power in this Parliament, and at that time Russia, which had previously tried to sabotage our war effort, was attacked by her ally, Nazi Germany, and it then threw all the weight of the Communist Party behind the war effort. Labour had no difficulty then in backing a defence policy, because the Communists were onside. But what is the position to-day? The position is that our only possible enemy in the world is a Communist enemy, and in any conflict the struggles which divide the Labour Party must make it incapable of forming a government and carrying out a defence policy at all, because a considerable section of the Labour Party is on side with our enemies and is against us. These are facts. Mr Deputy Speaker. I think that ff there i's anything that could be considered offensive in this House it is to suggest that any member, on this side or anywhere in the House, could be on the side of Australia's enemies.

There is, in fact, no parallel between the allegation made concerning Communist preferences cast for the honourable member for Moreton and the allegation made by the honourable member for Mackellar. If it had been alleged that the Liberal Party was infected with communism, and a ruling had been given that that was a permissible allegation in the House, then you would be entitled to say that the same ruling should be applied to an allegation that the Labour Party was infected with communism. But the earlier allegation was not that the Liberal Party was infected with communism. The allegation was that the Liberal Party holds office here because in the most narrowly contested seat in the 1961 election its candidate received Communist preferences. You would be entitled, Sir, to apply the same ruling to an allegation about the Labour Party if the allegation was that the Labour Party had received Communist preferences. But, Sir, you are comparing two disparate allegations. With all respect, I submit that the circumstances are not the same, that the allegations are not on all fours, and that you should reconsider your ruling.

We withdrew one of the Standing Orders which referred to discourteous references to the judiciary and other matters of that sort. Honourable gentlemen opposite argued that they should be free to make comments critical of members of the judiciary and the monarchy and to refer to other matters which are not normally regarded as falling within the Standing Orders. In other words, honourable gentlemen opposite were arguing most vigorously yesterday that members of the Parliament should be given the widest possible freedom of expression in this place. A very relevant question in the political life of this country is whether or not one or more of the political parties in Australia is subject to influences-whethe r they be Communist influences, as the honourable member for Mackellar has said, or pressures from particular groups, as I have heard honourable gentlemen opposite allege against us. Only earlier to-day, as I was listening, thanks to the mechanical device in my room, to the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), I heard him say in a most direct and specific way that I had allowed myself to be pressured into withholding legislation.

It is also beyond question that those same unions pay affiliation fees to the Labour Parry, of which they are constituent members, and that they have a hand in the selection of Labour Party candidates.

The honourable member for East Sydney is out of his place. election time contribute to the funds of the Labour Party and their contributions are gladly accepted by the Labour Party at that time. the Opposition has said he wants more trade unionists on the Labour side of this Parliament. He wants a bigger proportion of trade unionists amongst his members. He is not satisfied with those he finds around him at the present time, and undoubtedly if he had more trade unionists with him, the bigger proportion of them would come from those very unions to which I have referred. member for East Sydney will come to order. He must cease interjecting, and so must all other honourable members. great concern to the people of this country to establish for themselves what are the facts and what are the conclusions to be drawn from the facts. Only yesterday, honourable gentlemen opposite were vehement in their claim that even if their views reflected on a member of the judiciary, on the monarchy or on the representatives of friendly powers, they should have an untrammelled right to offer those views. The honourable member for Mackellar has made no allegation, as I understand it, against any individual member of the Parliament. What he has said is that this political party is, on the facts, subject to the charge that in its policies, in the resources available to it fpr election purposes and in the support it obtains from affiliation and other forms of membership, it is infected by the influences of communism. That is what I read into the remarks of the honourable member for Mackellar. On the facts, I think there is substance behind those remarks, and the country itself, having heard the argument, will be in a better position to judge. two questions before 'the House. One is whether it is proper for one member to be insulting one question before the Chair. member will resume his seat. The question before the Chair is, ""That the ruling be dissented from "". ruling was that the remarks of the honourable member were not offensive within the terms of the standing order and therefore the honourable member did not have to withdraw them. So the first question which has to be decided is whether this type of remark from such a person is offensive or worthy of this Parliament. We on this side of the House say that it is offensive, unworthy and, of course, untrue. The second question which has to be resolved-thi s has been introduced into the debate by none other than the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt), one of the persons who on occasions have acted as Prime Minister -is whether this House is to put the stamp of its approval on an Australian brand of McCarthyism-somethin g that reduced the American political system to its lowest level in the century and a half of the American republic, and something that earned the disapproval and contempt of people ail over the world. The point I make, in which I say the people of Australia would support me, is that the Treasurer, in supporting the honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) in this, has been unworthy of his high office, has been insulting to members of this House and has been offensive in terms of the Standing Orders. I say that, and I will challenge him anywhere on it. He cannot prove that the honourable member for Mackellar was truthful in his assertion that we are disloyal and that we are seditious, nor can he make such assertions about the Australian Labour Party",66,Pairs

Of those 36 men, at least one-the honourable memHouse. Let the Treasurer go outside and say that. Let him say it in the electorate of the honourable member for Braddon.

The chair will be resumed at 8 p.m. Sitting suspended from 5.58 to 8 p.m. suspended we were discussing a motion of dissent from Mr Deputy Speaker's ruling with relation to the remarks of the honourable member for Mackellar Any debate on a motion of dissent in this House is a very important one or it results in the f laying down of principles which become part of the precedents and established practices of the House. So when we are considering whether the remarks of the honourable member for Mackellar were offensive within the meaning of Standing Order No. 77, we have to weigh the position very carefully. It is not a question of whether the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) should choose that moment to come here and support the McCarthyist tendencies of that honourable member; it is a auestion of how this Mouse shall comport itself in discussions between fellow members of the Parliament. I believe that the honourable member for Mackellar has demeaned the Parliament, offended us and mortally offended all those people in Australia who chose to send members of the Labour Party here. We on this side of the House represent more than half of the people who voted at the last election. At that election Labour Party candidates polled over 250,000 more votes than did all the people allied against us. We hold 62 seats in this House and the Government holds 62. We speak on behalf of an established majority of the people of Australia, and those who choose to say that we are seditious, treasonable and the honourable member for Mackellar-ar e offending the great body of responsible people in Australia who sent us here. Therefore I say that the honourable member for Mackellar has offended against the very essence. of the standing order relating to Deputy Speaker's ruling should be disagreed with. In support of that contention I want to emphasize the significance of the remarks of the honourable member for Mackellar. In doing so, I want to remind the House of one of the most disturbing episodes in recent political history and to refer to a junior United States senator for Wisconsin, McCarthy, who besmirched American politics and dragged them into the ground. The activities of McCarthy made that particular era of politics offensive to the name of decent democratic political thought, and the remarks of the honourable member for Mackellar to-day are offensive to the Parliament under the Standing Orders. I remind you, Mr Speaker, of the terms in which the honourable member for Mackellar brought his evidence before this House. He was challenged to name the people to whom he referred. He was asked: ""To whom do you refer? Do you mean anybody in this House? "" He said, "" No, I mean groups of them"". He meant a particular party. He did not mean its membership. When he was penned and driven back into his corner he did exactly the same as that miserable senator from Wisconsin did when he was challenged. This is what Senator McCarthy said, according to the book,"" Senator Joe McCarthy ""While I cannot take the time to name all the men in tbe State Department who have been named as members of the Communist Party and members of a spy ring, 1 bave here in my hand",67,Pairs

How many did he name? How many could he name when he was challenged? None at all.' The book goes on to sayNot many sentences spoken in this century have been subjected to quite so much exegesis and controversy as this one. And not many have been less worthy of it. For what McCarthy was reported to have said was not only untrue-it was, on the face of it, utterly preposterous. That is exactly what any sensible thinking person who understands the ramifications of the Australian Labour Party would say about the remarks of the honourable member for Mackellar. Why could he not have taken the time to name a few on the list? Why does he not say to whom he refers? Does he mean the honourable member for Braddon who was a delegate to the federal conference of the Australian Labour Party? If he does mean the honourable member for Braddon, let him say so to all those people who supported the honourable member for Braddon at the last election when he polled the largest majority any candidate has ever polled in that electorate? I think the honourable member's majority then was 8,000 and support for him has increased during the three years for which he has been here. What miserable hypocrisy this is! It is offensive not only to us but to all members of the Labour Party and to all the people who sent us here. If we want to bring it down to individuals, then grain of truth in anything that the honourable let us bring it down to the electors of member for Mackellar said. That will be Braddon who sent the honourable member the day when there is any truth in what he for that electorate here. The honourable member for Mackellar ment has alined himself with one of the most of the House.

The question before us as Socialists, Communists, uprooters of law and order, and everything else for which a vile name could be found. The clan was no different 111 years ago; it has brought this type of politics to this nation. The honourable member's clan is the very genesis of this type of politics, and it is a great misery to the people of Mackellar that they sent here a man whose principles are no higher than that. The same applies to the Treasurer. What manner of man is this? Just before the last election the Treasurer was saying that three members of the then Senate team, the present Senator Cohen, the present Senator Cavanagh and the late and very respected Senator Poulter, were under Communist domination. He brought their names into this Parliament. He had their names circulated throughout Australia. He said he would repeat the statement outside the House. But he never did! The Treasurer, who is the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party-the one-time, some-time Prime Minister of this country-ha s uttered words and behaved in a manner offensive in the extreme to the Parliament and to the Standing Orders. This is a disgrace to the Parliament. The right honourable gentleman's remarks in support of the miserable philosophies of the honourable member for Mackellar are offensive to this Parliament and 1 believe it is the duty of the House to consider this when contemplating its decision on this issue. It is not a question of whether there is a says! It is a question of how this Parliaought to conduct its business and of the relationship between equals on the floor There are a great many members oppowould defend to the death the same printo-night is not a purely political one. It is one that must be decided in the light of the principles, traditions and history of this Parliament. We have to meet here as equals. We have to meet with respect for one another and we have to agree to abide by rules, written and unwritten, some traditional and some newly established. In deciding this question to-night we shall be laying down a principle. We shall be determining whether this insult offered to one of the great parties of this country is to be tolerated. Unfortunately, on various occasions in the past remarks such as those made by the honourable member for Mackellar to-night have been allowed to pass unchallenged. To-night a challenge is offered to every honourable member opposite and I hope that every elector in the constituencies of honourable members opposite is watching their actions, because if they support the remarks of the honourable member for Mackellar they will be alining themselves with the miserable senator from Wisconsin, lately departed. I hope that all honourable members opposite will face up to their responsibilities and realize that when they cast their votes to-night they will not be voting for or against Mr Deputy Speaker but for or against a principle of parliamentary democracy, decency in public life, and a proper conception of the manner in which this Parliament should be conducted.

Motion (by Mr Hasluck) proposedThat the house do now adjourn. Mr L. R. JOHNSON (Hughes) [9.22] Mr Speaker, Opposition members take the opportunity afforded by the debate on the motion for the adjournment of the House to discuss in an uninhibited way matters that concern the welfare of the Australian people. make a one-man invasion of Australia by We believe that members of this Parliament have a sacred privilege in this respect and should be afforded the opportunity to speak in an uninhibited way. We have seen recent examples of the way in which this Government has denied honourable members an opportunity to speak. This evening, we have seen a classic example of the way in which the Government avails itself of the Standing Orders. It has done so this evening to deny even one of its own supporters an opportunity to express his views on matters that he regards as important. The honourable member for Mackellar ( Mr Wentworth) has been the subject of controversy in this House to-night. There are in this place some people who would describe him in words that could well be unparliamentary. In tbe lobbies, in the dining-room and elsewhere in the precincts of this building, we have heard attributed to suggest that that contention is not accurate, the honourable member characteristics that, at best, can be described only as un-Austraunreasonable. I do not think that there is lian. I know that some honourable members -eve n some who sit on the Government side of the chamber-hav e described the honourable member for Mackellar as one who has Fascist tendencies. phrase that the honourable member should not use, even if somebody else used it. I ask the honourable member to withdraw. Mr L, R. JOHNSON 1 withdraw it, Mr L. R. JOHNSON I withdraw it, Sir. member also that he may not revive a debate. Mr L. R. JOHNSON -It is not my intention to revive a debate. I respect your ruling, Sir. I want to take this opportunity to express to the people of Hughes my appreciation at being afforded the opportunity to represent them in this place. Not so long ago, during the 1939-45 war, the honourable member for Mackellar set out to make a one-man invasion of what is now the electorate of Hughes. The beaches of Cronulla were then marked off with barb-wire entanglements and the searchlights were directed towards the ocean to detect the approaching foe. The honourable member set out to way of the Cronulla beaches. We remember this so very well. He surreptitiously sneaked through the entanglements and the barricades and destructively dealt with some of the leaders of the defending force. Having done that, he moved into the local railway network and, by destroying signal apparatus, dislocated the whole railway system in the Sydney metropolitan area. As if this were not bad enough, the honourable member then put fhe fire station out of commission and moved down into the area that is now Royal National Park, where units of the Army were then in camp. He caused considerable havoc and confusion there as well. Some of the honourable members who have been interjecting have contended that there is some doubt about the sanity of anybody who indulges in such activities. I Mr Speaker. Indeed, I think it is most any doubt at all that such behaviour is not becoming to a member of Parliament. I am aware, of course, that the honourable member was not at the time responsible as a parliamentarian. member is now implying that another honourable member is not responsible.

Although we hear derogatory remarks made about them sometimes, I beUeve they were probably inspired by decent principles and instincts, but to-day we have seen a departure from those. Those honourable members opposite who have been led by the nose down the political garden path to-night by this sort of extremism stand indicted and condemned in the eyes of the Australian people. They are denying fundamental principles in which we all should believe. This Government, in a precarious position, is now reaching in desperation to the bottom of the barrel in order to find something to lift its political stocks. able member's time has expired. comment I make to the honourable member for Hughes( Mr L. R. Johnson) about the recent proceedings is that the Opposition can give it but cannot take it. That has been obvious to-night. I wish to deal with something that is associated with the sort of thing that has been done to-night. It reveals the same desire to stifle free speech, the same desire to banish decency from our proceedings, and the same lack of respect for normal human values. I feel impelled to say a word or two about the electorate of Grey and the forthcoming by-election there. I want to say something about the Australian Labour Party's candidate and the party's activities in the electorate. I am not going to talk about the pressure which habeen applied to the daughter of the late Mr Edgar Russell to induce her not to stand as an independent Labour candidate. People will make up their own minds about that. The honourable member for Kingston( Mr Galvin) to-day denied that there had been any pressure in that case. I leave it to honourable members and to the people of Australia to make up their minds whether pressure was applied when a special visit was made to this lady by three great hulking men-the leader of the Labour Party in the South Australian Parliament, the president of the Labour Party in South Australia and the secretary of the party in South Australia. Did they make a round trip of 300 miles just to wait on and talk with, as they put it, this poor unfortunate that, but I am going to speak about something which I think is equally reprehensible. The honourable member for Kingston this afternoon genuflected to the memory of the late Edgar Russell, and quite rightly, as honourable members from both sides of the House have done. The honourable member said that the late Mr Edgar Russell had served the interests of the Grey electorate well for twenty years. But, Sir, I want to point out the discrepancy between the theory and the practice in this matter. Honourable members opposite are prepared to genuflect to the memory of the late Mr Edgar Russell. That is the theory of the matter, but what happens in practice? How do they respect the memory of this man who gave so much of his life to serving the electors of Grey so well? It is well known that it was his wish-h e told dozens of honourable members on thiB side of the House, let alone members on the other side -that his daughter should succeed him as the Australian Labour Party member for Grey. It is also well known that for many years Miss Russell has, to all intents and purposes and except in name, been the member for Grey, because, as her father's secretary, she had provided the services which meant so much to the people of that electorate. The honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Kelly) reminds me that that was because the honourable gentleman was too ill to perform those functions himself. That is one of the reasons why the late Edgar Russell wished his daughter to succeed him. Now, Sir, what happened? Not unnaturally, she submitted herself for preselection as the Australian Labour Party candidate. A special conference of the Australian Labour Parry in South Australia was called. It was the South Australian equivalent of what we had in Canberra a few weeks ago. It was the South Australian equivalent of the 36 faceless men-the presidium, as one of my friends has remarked. It was not an electoral committee based on the electorate of Grey, as was the case in the selection of the Liberal and Country League candidate for the by-election. Most of the members of the special conference came from outside the",78,Adjournment

Did they mark the good work done by Miss Russell in serving the electors of Grey? Did they respect the wish of her father? Of course they did not. Instead, they chose a person who, by his association and by his occupation, is anathema to those who are the lifeblood of the electorate of Grey. They insulted the sensibilities of the electors of Grey by choosing a waterside worker. waterside worker? munist control, of subjection to a foreign power and of the declining position of the Australian primary producers in recent years. Waterside workers have pushed up their costs on the waterfront. This selection is a gratuitous insult to every farmer in Grey. Instead of choosing this able woman or one of the many other able candidates who presented themselves, what did they do? They exercised their power in a centre away from the electorate to choose a party hack and a representative of a union which has done so much to harm Australian primary production-and primary production means much to the electorate of Grey. These people feel that the Grey seat is a safe seat for Labour. They believe they can do what they like. They feel they can afford to offend the sensibilities of the primary producers of Grey. They feel secure in the industrial vote that has been built up in Grey. Well, Sir, we will see what happens about that when the election is held. The final point I want to make is this: want to take this opportunity of saying Net only have they deliberately chosen a something about a matter I have had in person associated with the waterside mind for two weeks.

There is a requireParty as safe. It would have been a very ment, of course, that the industry shall be different matter if the members of the economic and efficient. That is beyond Labour Party had thought of Grey as a marginal seat. They would have been very careful about choosing their candidate. They would not have insulted this devoted woman as they have done. They would not have passed over many other peoplepeople who did not have the symbolic association with industrial lawlessness that this chosen candidate has. They would not have done these things, if they had thought of Grey as a marginal seat. They displayed arrogance in the belief that it was a safe ALP. seat. By their actions they have brought down on their heads certain consequences which I hope, and feel sure, will follow. They will find that Grey is not a safe seat; that the electors will do what they should have done many years ago, and return to the fold by providing an honourable member for this side of the House. Speaker, there must surely be an election in the wind. If there were not, I could not imagine the shabby, tattered old effigy of communism being dragged into this House in the way we have seen to-night. I was thinking, as we crossed the floor time after time, how much more satisfactory it might have been had we been at Westminster 600 years ago, when every member wore a sword and scabbard in the chamber. We might have settled matters far more satisfactorily. manently also.

270,Mr Clay,"Yes, probably more perdoubt. But to-night 1 propose to tell the House of one of the devices used by overseas manufacturers to defeat the written word by which the Tariff Board and the Department of Customs and Excise must work. I have with me to-night a piece of fabric which reveals itself to my eyes as having been made from what the Tariff Board refers to as man-made fibres. I would say it is all rayon, and probably it is an acetate rayon. It is a beautiful fabric, a beautiful piece of cloth. I can find in it not a single flaw. The yarn quality is high, the weaving is par excellence, and the finish is perfect. It could be used as a dress the House would be as confused as the material, as a lining for men's suits or as a shirt material. One would imagine that since it is an imported fabric it would be dutiable as such, at 2s. Sid. a yard, the same as any other imported fabric made of man-made fibres. But here we see the curious difficulty caused by the Tariff Board's compulsory reliance upon the written word. This piece of material, strange to relate, is not a piece of fabric, tt is embroidery. I would like the House to inspect this piece of embroidery. Any normal person who thinks of embroidery visualizes such things as doilies, tha foregoing reference when in the following lace tablecloths or even the material in formsMr Speaker's lace cuffs, or perhaps the fringe at the bottom of a lady's slip. But this fabric, in the eyes of the Department of Customs and Excise, is embroidery. At intervals of nine inches down one selvedge it has a small, inconspicuous embroidered cross-eas y to add after the weaving of the cloth, by the use of high-speed machines. The cost of adding a tiny embroidered cross at such intervals down one selvedge would be slight. Then an amazing metamorphosis takes place. twinkling of an eye all is changed. The cloth is changed into embroidery and becomes dutiable at 17id. per cent. Any protection for Australian manufacturers vanishes forthwith. One cannot be sure in what country this was made, although it bears identification marks. The cloth may have been made in one country and the embroidered cross added in another, the material then being shipped to Australia. However, knowing the high quality of almost every Japanese product nowadays and the insistence of the Japanese Government that all goods exported from Japan shall reflect credit on that country, I would say, from the quality of this embroidery, that the identification marks are true and correct and that it was made in Japan. When and where the embroidered cross was added is anybody's guess. I would like to read to the House the attempt made by the Department of Customs and Excise to define embroidery and distinguish it from other materials. No effort has been spared in the attempt to make this definition. As I say, I would like to read it, but at the end of the reading unfortunate customs officer must have been when he was confronted with this remarkable example of just one of the devices used to defeat the Australian tariff. This is just one; there are many others in the field of textiles. I could wish for some means of ensuring that just good, sound, plain common sense would be used instead of the maze and mass of words to be found in the document which is before me. This is the attempt made to define what is embroidery and what is not(a) All varieties of embroidery are covered by (1) In the piece or in strips of various widths which may bear a series of identical designs, whether or not intended for subsequent separation to be made up into finished articles (e.g. strips or embroidered labels for marking articles of apparel, or pieces embroidered at regular intervals intended to be cut up and made into bibs). (2) In the form of motifs i.e., individual pieces of embroidered design serving no other function than to be incorporated or appliqued as elements of embroidery in, for example, underwear In the or articles of apparel or articles of apparel or furnishings, They may be cut to any shape, backed or otherwise assembled.

312,Mr Clyde Cameron (Hindmarsh),"Dumas to that of Mr Warwick Fairfax and his friends. I said that the campaign of the Liberal Party had been commenced with the speech of the honourable member for Barker. The campaign was actually commenced a week or more ago when the Prime Minister announced that at long last the Government would honour its legal obligation under the 1949 Chifley railway agreement to convert the railway line between Port Pirie and Broken Hill to standard gauge. But this was only an announcement of something that would be done in the future. When I asked whether the Government intended to continue buying narrow gauge rolling-stock for this section of line the Minister concerned told me that it proposed to do so. This heightened my suspicion, which is evidently shared by the Premier of South Australia, that the Government's promise is only a stunt to try to get support for the Liberal Party candidate and to bolster the waning stocks of the Menzies Government in the Grey by-election. Actually, this promise by the Government is not likely to be given effect forfiveor six years. The Premier of South Australia has had to come to Canberra specially in order to check up on rumours that the promise would not be given immediate effect. I find it rather remarkable that all day to-day Sir Thomas Playford has been moving about among Liberal Party members and has been talking to Ministers. I saw him having lunch to-day with the Minister for Labour federal president of the Liberal Party, Sir Philip McBride, was also brought over here, presumably because of the suspicion they evidently share that this rail standardization selection of their candidate, nor did the proposal will not be given effect as quickly as the South Australian Government would like.

The honourable member for election. He thinks, "" We may as well get Barker complained with a certain amount of mock indignation that the Labour Party had passed over the daughter of the previous member for Grey when making its selection of a candidate. Does he forget whom the Liberal Party passed over when he himself gained the selection for the electorate of Barker? It passed over Mr Ian Cameron, the son of the previous Liberal member and the late Speaker of this House, Mr Archie Cameron. He was passed over when the Liberal Party selected the honourable member for Barker. He also spoke about the Labour candidate not living in the division of Grey. The facts are that the Labour candidate lived in the division of Grey for more than 30 years, and for twenty years of this period he was a farmer. He left the district ten weeks ago to arrange school accommodation for his child!en. He has a house at Port Lincoln and is living in that house. This is the kind of rubbish the honourable member for Barker deals in. The honourable member made two efforts to get into the Parliament before he eventually succeeded, and on neither occasion did he live in the district. He did not live in the district of Kingston where he was given the thrashing of his life by the honourable member for Kingston( Mr Galvin). Neither did the honourable member for Barker live in the division of Barker when eventually he first contested it. He spoke about the method of selecting Labour candidates.

So he did not intervene. One indication of what the people in Barker think of the honourable member who has just had so much to say about the Labour candidate for Grey can be found in the vote that he got at the last election. His Waterside Workers Federation branch vote in Barker dropped more than did the vote of any other Liberal candidate in the whole of South Australia. cannot hear what the honourable member Speaker, but by all appearancas he is endeavouring to intimidate you. ber for Mackellar is in order. distinction also of being the only Liberal member from South Australia whose majority was lower than the Senate majority that his party received in his own district. His majority was 1,000 fewer than the majority which the Liberal Senate team got in the same area. This is the same man who once poohpoohed Sir Thomas Playford, saying he knew nothing about schooling or education, when Sir Thomas Playford quite rightly criticized this Government for its failure to carry out its obligations in regard to edutherefore cannot stand and speak for cation. The honourable member regarded him as a cherry picker who knew nothing about education. It is true that Sir Thomas Playford has not been to the university. He has not been to Cambridge or Oxford or wherever it was the honourable member acquired his accent. But one thing about Sir Thomas Playford is that he does know something about cherry picking. The people of Barker wish that the honourable member knew something about cherry picking. It is quite clear that he has no interests in common with the people of Barker, whereas the Labour candidate for Grey knows a great deal about farming, because he has been a farmer for more than twenty years. Never has any member representing Grey -includin g the late revered Edgar Russellhad greater first-hand personal knowledge of the problems of the farmer than has the selected Labour candidate for Grey, Mr Jack Mortimer, a man who has served his country well on the land and on the waterfront. No port in the Commonwealth of Australia has a better reputation for industrial peace than Port Lincoln has had since Mr Mortimer has been secretary of the there. Mr Mortimer, I venture to say, is the most knowledgeable man that the Labour Party has ever selected to contest Grey, and I bar no one. He is a man who not only understands the problems of the industrialpopulation comprises industrialists-bu t also he is one of those rare combinationsa man who understands equally well the problems of the man on the land. I want to return, if I may, to something else that the honourable member said. He pretended that he thought a great deal of the late Edgar Russell, but having pretended to praise Mr Russell he had the hide to say that Mr Russell's daughter had virtually been the member for Grey for the past six years. He was virtually saying that the late Edgar Russell had not been doing his job for the past six years. It was a most shameful thing to say in relation to a man who is no longer with us, who is dead and himself. The honourable member for Barker had the hide to stand there and say that for the past six years this great representative of the district for twenty years had so neglected his work that his own daughter had to do it for him; and that she was, in effect, the member for Grey. The honourable member should be thoroughly ashamed of himself.

His unrestrained attack upon the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) indicates that many of the statements made by the honourable member for Barker hurt him to such a degree as to lead to this outburst. This is just a reflection of what one might call the psychological reactions of the Lahour Party earlier this evening. References by honourable members opposite to the Grey electorate indicate that they can see and feel the turn of the tide in the Australian thinking, and they will see it more clearly on lst June. Honourable members opposite know that they have made a very grave mistake in selecting a candidate from the waterfront, the record of which these days is not such as to inspire any confidence in the Australian public. That is the first aspect. The second is the unfortunate incident concerning Miss Russell. They know that another error was made in revealing the application of the iron fist in what they endeavour to show as a velvet glove. The announcement in regard to the rail standardization caused bitter disappointment to a party which has said right throughout that we have no intention of carrying out this work. I want to clarify the matter on behalf of South Australian members, who were bringing to my attention for a considerable time, long before the death of the late highly regarded member for Grey, the need to standardize the line from Broken Hill to Port Pirie. As the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward), who is on the other side of the table, knows, plans and costs of these projects have to be dealt with a considerable time beforehand. gave to me a couple of days before the announcement was made? You must have been lying then. honourable member to restrain himself. House for a considerable time. When the honourable member for East Sydney savs that to me I take it rather as a compliment. made about that when all the details have He is so used to that type of thing himself that he cannot imagine anybody telling the burst from the Labour Party. Unquestionably, honourable members opposite feel that the public will not extend to them anything like the confidence they enjoyed in the past. They have managed to pull the wool over the eyes of the public until now. The honourable member for Hindmarsh referred to the fact that Sir Thomas Playford has been here to-day. This was not because of any doubt concerning rail standardization. The honourable member also referred to diesel locomotives and rolling-stock ordered for the railways, which will be ready by the middle of this year. Obviously,, the rail standardization will not be completed for a number of years. The fact is that these diesel locomotives are convertible to a gauge of 4 ft. 84 in. and they will be absorbed when the rail standardization is completed. Perhaps that will satisfy the honourable member on that point. In order to clarify the situation further, I read the announcement made by the Prime Minister( Sir Robert Menzies) to-day. It statesAgreement which will allow an early start to be made on initial work on the Port Pirie-Broken Hill railway standardization was reached at a conference in Canberra to-day between the Prime Minisiei Sir Robert Menzies, the Premier of South Australia, Sir Thomas Playford, and the Commonwealth Minister for Transport, Mr Opperman. In a statement after the meeting, the Prime Minister said thai the Railways Commissioner for South Australia and the Commonwealth Railways Commissioner had already reached agreement on the standards of construction to be observed in the works. Honourable members opposite are saying this is only a stunt. The commissioners met last Monday. Australia. The Opposition is trying to say that it is doubtful that the standardization work will be carried out. Of course, it will be carried out.

The House will recall that in 1949 the present honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) and the Premier of South Australia, both of whom are in the precincts of the House to-night, signed an agreement under which the Commonwealth undertook to provide the bulk of the finance to build a standard gauge rail link death of the Honourable Mick O'Halloran, between Broken Hill and Port Pirie.

I have asked many questions over the years on this subject. Last NovemberI was told that the provision of £50,000 to the South Australian Government for the purpose of surveying the route was approved by the Commonwealth in October, 1S58, and that up to 30th September, 1962, expenditure amounting to £18,502 had been charged by the State against this advance, ler.ving a balance of £31,498 still available for survey work approved by the Minister. We have the extraordinary position that 41 years ago we appropriated £50,000 for the survey, which would be useful whenever the work was put in hand, and that six months ago only one-third of that amount had been spent. I hear some one refer to window dressing. between Melbourne and Geelong. That is Sir Thomas Playford is an astute politician. He can window dress as well as anybody else, particularly on the eve of a by-election or a general election. The last time this matter was before the Parliament was in October, 1961-jus t before the last general election. The last bill passed by the Parliament before that election was held was the Railway Equipment Agreement (South Australia) Bill. This provided for the purchase of wagons and diesel locomotives. They have been ordered and will be delivered. If the railway line had been standardized when it should have been standardized, if the survey had proceeded promptly when the first moneys were made available for that survey and if the South Australian suit in the High Court had succeeded we would have been saved all the expense of converting those 3 ft. 6 in. gauge profit organization which is doing splendid locomotives to 4 ft. 8i in. gauge. there is nothing to that. It is mere chicken feed, a mere few hundreds of thousands of pounds! Some thousands of pounds have been wasted in court costs and some hundreds of thousands of pounds will be wasted in converting these wagons and diesel locomotives, all because the Minister for Shipping and Transport has done no more than his predecessors in the Menzies Government did to carry on this proposal. As recently as 4th April, in answer to a question by the honourable member for East Sydney-the joint father of this proposal with the Premier of South Australia-and again on 10th April, in answer to the honourable member for Stirling( Mr Webb), who was a member of the Opposition committee ivhich reported on the proposal in 1956, the Minister saidAny decision to proceed with the standardization of railways in South Australia within the provisions of the agreement, will be dependent upon confirmation that the tangible benefits obtainable are commensurate with related expenditure, and will be governed by respective priorities within the overall capital works programme of developmental projects. That was the formula which the Minister used during the last Budget session when I asked whether he would proceed with the standardization of the railway gauge his order of priority. Three weeks ago he still thought that the standardization of the railway gauge between Broken Hill and Port Pirie was of no higher priority than the standardization of the gauge between Melbourne and Geelong. Only when byelections or general elections are imminent do Liberal Ministers carry out their obligations under statutes or contracts. wish to bring up a matter that I have raised before just prior to the preparation of budgets. There is not the slightest doubt that very soon the Cabinet will be working out the details of the next Budget. I ask that donations to the Murray Valley Development League be made deductible for taxation purposes. The league is a nonwork in the field of decentralization. The league envisages a population of 1,000,000 in the Murray valley. Since its inception approximately eighteen years ago, this organization has amassed a tremendous amount of information which is available to any person or organization that wishes to use it. Shire councils along the Murray River have benefited from the information they have been able to obtain from the league on different occasions.",88,Adjournment

332,Mr Whitlam,The Minister says,89,Adjournment
333,Mr Turnbull (Mallee) [10.31],"IThe league is interested in all kinds of progressive moves in the Murray valley. This valley is a fertile, decentralized area which has the prospect of getting an increassuccess it is necessary that the population ing amount of water from the Murray River consequent upon the development of the Snowy Mountains scheme, and it is necessary that as much money as possible be made available to assist the league in its work of attracting a greater population, and so to increase production in the area. People make donations to the league to assist it in its work. All persons who assist in the work performed by the league, with the exception of the secretary and one or two others, do so without receiving any pay whatever. They give their labour and the benefit of their experience to the league for the good of the area and Australia as a whole. Therefore, it is not too much for me to ask again this year-that the Treasurer ( Mr Harold Holt) consider allowing donations to the league to be regarded as deductible for taxation purposes. The granting of this concession would assist considerably in encouraging the giving of donations and would be in the best interests of the whole of the States concerned. It must be remembered that the Murray Valley Development League operates not only along the Murray River; its activities extend far into New South Wales and far into Victoria. I have in my hand a copy of the "" Riverlander"", which is the official publication of the league. The head office of the organization is at Albury, and the organizing secretary is Mr G. V. Lawrence. By dividing its activities into regions, the league has been able to bring added prosperity to the area that it encompasses. It has successfully striven for a greater conservation of water, it has helped the dried fruits industry and the citrus industry, and also has been responsible for pasture improvement along the full length of fhe Murray valley. As I said earlier, the Murray valley is a fertile area; it is an area of which Victorians should be proud. PerhapsI should go further and say that all Australians should be proud of it. I was rather astonished' to hear an lionorable member ask, by way of interjection, where the Murray valley was. Anybody who knows anything about Australia and its great productive areas must haye some knowledge of thi9 great valley,"" even though he has only read about it in the press. Australia is dependent to a large degree upon our primary industries, and to ensure their be decentralized and not concentrated in Sydney, Melbourne and other cities along the coastline. The attraction of population to the Murray valley area would be of distinct advantage to Australia as a whole. To make this small plea that donations to the Murray Valley Development League be made deductible for taxation purposes is not to ask too much, because if the concession were granted it would be in the interests of the area concerned but most of all in the interests of decentralization, primary production and the general welfare of the Commonwealth of Australia.

Has his attention been drawn to a statement by Professor J. H. Green, Professor of Nuclear Radiation and Nuclear Chemistry at tbe University of New South Wales, expressing concern at the alarming increase in radio-activity in New South Wales which he attributed largely to the industrial use of radio-active materials? 2. Did Professor Green also issue a warning that Australia would receive fall-out from any nuclear tests carried out by the United States of America at Christmas Island and from tests conducted by tbe Union of Soviet Socialist Republics? 3. Is Professor Green accepted as a responsible authority in these matters? 4. If 60, has the Government taken, or does it propose to take, any action to restrict the industrial use of radio-active materials? 5. Did the Government make any official protests to the Governments of the Soviet and the United States at the resumption of nuclear bombtesting? Sir Robert Menzies -The answers to the Harding, E. W. honourable member's questions are as Hayden. W. G. follows:Johnson, L. R. 1, 2 and 3. My attention has been drawn to Jones, C. K. several conflicting newspaper reports in March, Kearney, V. D. 1962, of a statement on this subject, attributed to Makin, N. J. O. Professor Green, Associate Professor of the DeMcGuren. F. W. partment of Nuclear and Radiation Chemistry in Mclvor, H.

Atomic Energy Commission which, before meeting Pollard. R. T. requests for radio-isotopes, takes all possible steps Reynolds. L. J. to ensure that no hazards will arise from their use. Riordan. W. J. F. Detailed control of the actual use of radio-active Stewart, F. E. materials is exercised by the individual State Uren, T. governments. The industrial use of radio-active Ward, E. J. materials is kept under review by the National Webb. C. H. Radiation Advisory Committee and by committees Tellers: of the National Health and Medical Research Coutts. W. C. Council as well as by the Australian Atomic Duthie, G. W. A. Energy Commission. The technical advice available to the Government from these bodies is that the industrial use of radio-active materials in Calwell, A. A. Australia has made no detectable difference to Clark, J. J. general background radiation levels. The Government sees no present need to restrict the industrial use of radio-active materials except as provided under existing arrangements. 5. No. The Government's attitude to nuclear weapon testing has been made clear in numerous statements. I refer, by way of example, to my own statement in the House of Representatives on 13th September, 1961, concerning the Soviet Union's breach of the moratorium on nuclear testing and to the Minister for External Affairs' press statement on 3rd March, 1962, concerning the proposed resumption by the United States of atmospheric testing in the Pacific. Construction Works at Amberley Air Base. Mr Hayden asked the Minister for Works, upon noticeWill he arrange for future construction works at the Royal Australian Air Force base at Amberley to be carried out by the day-labour system in preference to contract labour? able member's question is as follows:It is the policy of the Commonwealth Government to invite public tenders wherever practicable for the execution of work. However, certain classes and types of work are carried out by day labour and this also applies where the execution of works by this system is considered to be in the best interests of the Commonwealth. Mr Hayden asked the Minister for Works, upon notice1. What is the capital cost of the larger bituminous plant at present located at the Royal Australian Air Force base at Amberley? 2. How long has it been based there? 3. On how many days has it been in productive operation during that period?",90,Adjournment
335,Mr Freeth,"The answer to the honor4. What is the estimated value of loss of production for each day that the plant has been idle? 5. Will he consider making available the sale of the product of this plant to interested local authority bodies so that all or some of the loss brought about by idleness of the plant might be recouped? able member's questions are as follows:1. The original cost of the bituminous concrete plant at Amberley was £65,706, including essential associated equipment. 2. The plant has been used at Brisbane Airport and Townsville RAAF. Station. It was transferred to the Amberley base for erection there on 2nd February, 1960. 3. Up to the end of March, 1963, the plant has been in productive operation at its present location for 283 days. 4. The plant has an average output potential of approximately 250 tons per day, the value of which is in the order of £1,400, including the cost of materials. This figure, however, would only be indicative of the value of lost production if works were available within economical trucking distance of Amberley that could continuously absorb this output. 5. The plant will be required by the department for periodical use on current works in its present location until the end of 1963, after which it may be needed elsewhere for other programmed works involving the construction of high grade airfield pavements. While in its present location, the department would consider supplying bituminous concrete to interested local authorities provided the quantities involved were of sufficient size lo warrant continuous operation of the plant for a reasonable period and provided the service could not be given from commercial sources. Working with a high capacity plant on a stop-start basis, o'r for small quantities of a particular mix, could the employees of the department? not be considered as it would be quite uneconomical to do so under such conditions. Department of Works Employees. Mr Hayden asked the Minister for Works, upon notice1. How many employees of the Commonwealth Department of Works at Amberley are eligible to be members of unions? 2. How many of those employees do in fact hold union tickets? 3. Of those who do not hold union tickets is be able to give details of the periods during which Interior stationed in the Port Moresby area. The they have been in the employment of the department when they have been unfinancial with a union? able member's questions are as follows:1. There is no reason known to the Department of Works why any of its employees at Amberley should not be eligible to become a member of a union. 2. This information is not available to the department. 3. This information cannot be supplied-se e answer to 2. Housing at Royal Australian Air Force Bases. Mr Griffiths asked the Minister for 1. How many dwellings were transferred from Rathmines Air Base to the Williamtown Royal Australian Air Force base during, (a) the financial year 1961-62 pnd (b) the presentfinancialyear? 2. What was the removal cost of each unit? 3. What was the cost, including the cost of carpentry and paintwork and water, sewerage and electrical installations, of restoring each unit to a habitable standard? 4. What was the cost of road and footpath construction? 5. What was the cost of each unit when originally built at Rathmines? able member's questions are as follows:1. (a) Nil. (b) 16. 2. The contract price was £675 each. 3. £2,312 10s. each (estimated). 4. Total £2,000. 5. Cost of each house and block improvements £4,070, but excluding road and sewerage works to serve area. Social Club, Port Moresby. Mr L. R. Johnson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Civil Aviation, upon notice1. Has the Department of Civil Aviation granted a peppercorn tenancy to a club in Port Moresby called the Aviat Club? 2. Was the Aviat Club established to cater for 3. Has this club recently taken action to exclude indigenous people, including departmental employees, from membership in the club? 4. Does this practice involve racial discrimination. If so, what action will be taken to discourage it? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Aviat Club, Port Moresby is a private social club for male and female employees of the Department of Civil Aviation and the Aviation Meteorological Branch of the Department of the department does not charge the club rental for the premises occupied. The club is responsible for improvements and internal maintenance of the building in question and has spent considerable sums of money in this respect over the years. The club has spent £2,000 in the past twelve months on improvements and anticipate expenditure of an additional £1,000 in the near future.

Restrictive Trade Practices. Mr Reynolds asked the AttorneyState Governnient? General, upon notice1. In his examination and consideration of the growth of restrictive trade practices has his attentionbeen drawn to the letter written by Mr C. S. Turnbull of Harvard Business School, United States of America, in the ""Australian Financial Review"" of 19th February, 1963, advocating greater official encouragement of small businesses in line with the Small Business Administration Act passed by the United States Congress in 1953? 2. Has the Government any proposals in mind to give specific assistance financially or in an advisory capacity to small industries in Australia in respect of administrative and technical matters? Sir Garfield Barwick -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1. I have noted the letter referred to in this part of the honourable member's question. 2. The matter to which this part of the question relates is not one. that falls within my own administration, and is, indeed, in some measure one for the States rather than the Commonwealth. My colleague, the Treasurer, has, however, referred me to the functions performed by the Commonwealth Development Bank. These functions include the provision offinancefor the establishment or development of industrial undertakings, particularly small undertakings, in cases where it considers the provision of finance is desirable and that the finance would not otherwise be available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions. It is also a function of the Development Bank to provide advice and assistance to its customers with a view to promoting the efficient organization and conduct of their businesses. It subsidizes research into industry problems and has assisted training in industry by providing scholarships. State governments industrial development divisions or departments also provide assistance of many kinds for new or expanding enterprises. Mr Ward asked the Attorney-General, upon notice1. Did the Parramatta Municipal Council request him to conduct an investigation into the existence of a petrol supply cartel which fol2. Did he advise the council that State governments had constitutional power to deal with any price-fixing by companies supplying councils with fuel and other materials? 3. Does the Commonwealth possess any legislative power in this field? 4. Did he subsequently discuss with the State governments the advisability of them taking action under tbeir existing powers to deal specifically with this situation? 5. If not, has he taken any action in an endeavour to meet the wishes of the Parramatta Municipal Council, other than furnishing information as to the constitutional powers of the Sir Garfield Barwick -The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:1 and 2. Similar questions covering precisely the same ground were asked by the honourable member for East Sydney on 6th December, 1962, and I have nothing to add to the answers given to those questions by the then Acting Attorney General as set out on page 3181 of ""Hansard"" dated 6th and 7th December, 1962. 3, 4 and 5. As the honourable member well knows, my proposals for comprehensive legislation in tbe field of restrictive practices were outlined to Parliament on my behalf by the then Acting Attorney-General on 6th December, 1962, after a number of discussions with the Attorneys General of the States. In so far as the question seeks an opinion on a matter of constitutional law, I am not prepared to answer it. Company Law. Mr Ward asked the Attorney-General, upon noticeIs he able to say whether it is an offence under either Commonwealth or State law for companies to continue to invite the public to invest moneys, without revealing all the facts regarding the companies' trading and financial position, particularly at a time when such companies are financially unsound or sustaining losses? Sir Garfield Barwick -The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:As I have explained before, it would not be in accordance with the practice of the House for me to give a legal opinion in answer to a question, particularly upon the basis of a hypothetical set of facts, and I do not propose to do so. Sections 37 and 47 of the Companies Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory, a copy of which is in the Library, are relevant to the point raised.",92,Answers To Questions
