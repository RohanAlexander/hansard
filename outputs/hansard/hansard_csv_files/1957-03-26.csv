Debate resumed from 21st March (vide That the following Address-in-Reply to the Speech of His Excellency the Governor General be agreed toMAY rr PLEASE YOUR EXCELLENCYWc, rhe House of -Representatives of tlie Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to express our loyalty lo our Mosl Gracious Sovereign, and to thank Your Excellency for the Speech which you have been pleased to address to Parliament. Upon which Dr. Evatt had moved, by way of amendmentThat the following words be added to the Address:"" but add1. That the Government is censured for the statement of Housing policy made by the Prime Minister on 7th March last and for the acute 'social ills caused by its continued failure to establish, m conjunction with the States, a Nalional Housing Plan. 2. This failure has been largely caused by the provision of inadequate finance for home building for(a) State Governments; (b) War Service Homes; (c) Co-operative Building Societies; (d) Australians seeking lo build their own homes. 3. The National Plan 'should have regard to(a) the immediate reduction of migrant intake; (b) employment of the maximum work force in the home-building industry; -(c) availability of materials. 4. It should also provide foT(a) priority to home building over less essential private investment; (b) provision of sufficient finance to promote home ownership at low rates of interest "". I rise to support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). I should like to touch on a few points in the Governor General's Speech. First, I wish to refer to the attitude of the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) towards home-building. Speech. , . my Government regards the problem of home-building with sympathetic and active mind and as far as it is concerned will do what it n -[7 ] can to ensure that the arrears are overtaken as rapidly as possible. The matter will be treated as of outstanding importance, proper attention being paid to material supplies, labour availability and costs of construction. BeforeI proceed any further I should like to quote from an advertisement which appeared, under the name of the Prime Minister, in the Sydney"" Truth"" of Sunday. 17th November, 1949. In that advertisement the Prime Minister saysWe give this firm promise to young couples. Another one of his promises, of courseThe Liberal party, when returned to office, will regard as its permanent and most vital responsibility the stepping up of the housing programme. We will not allow any other public works, other than those of the most extreme urgency, to be given priority over home-building. The Liberal party gives a firm undertaking to the many thousands of young engaged couples in Australia who are forced to postpone their marriages, and possibly throw away the happiest years of their lives, because they cannot get a home of their own . . . and to couples already married who are suffering the same penalty. This is the Prime Ministeri n 19491 He went onYou are penalized to-day by the Chifley Government, which gives priority to extravagant building plans for Government departments, which fails to check restrictive, go-slow tactics in the building industry or to increase production of many essential building materials. In other words, the very Government which claims to be the champion of the average man and woman is the Government that is depriving you of a home and, by starving the State Governments That is important in the light of current events. He claimed then that Mr Chifley starved the State governments of funds "" preventing even your State Government from helping you "".. He went onWe will not allow any public works, except those of extreme urgency, to be given priority over home-building. I wonder whether fhe Prime Minister remembers those words now. There are still thousands of young couples awaiting finance to buy homes. There are still many thousands of people sharing meagre accommodation, who are in need of homes. I have here quotations from two Sydney newspapers which state the problem. They are from the "" DailyM i r r o r "" and the "" Sun "". No one, even by the greatest stretch of imagination, could believe that the The Governor General said in his Sydney"" DailyM i r r o r "" and "" Sun"" were Labour supporters, but on Sth March the "" Sun"" said in a leading articleThe Prime Minister has a masterly way with . words and theories but, as the present argument",6,Setup

Minister is right when he speaks of the private bankers being expert in their own line of business. They certainly are! It is also appropriate to say that sometimes they are very shady as well. I have in mind the co-operation between our respectable bankers and the hire-purchase vultures, which produces murderous interest rates in that field. One would be safe in saying that the prominent private bankers and the hire-purchase vultures are partners in crime. and 20 per cent, interest is charged. Some one is putting money into the hire-purchase Let us look at the housing horror. The ment has no answer to the problem. Beyond making long-winded speeches and quoting offer.

At the moment I shall deal with the Real have, and which has continued over the last eight years. I refer to the present Minister Who will deny that all who receive accounts for council rates on their property The Prime are complaining about the increase in rates? It is due only to the activities of these predatory gentlemen who are forcing values up in every way they can. Housing is now a question of great moment. It has reached the emergency stage, and it requires immediate action. We cannot escape tbe fact that 250,000 families in this great Australia of ours need homes of their own. Another 200,000 are paying rents that they cannot afford-u p to £10 10s. a week. That is what large families are paying to agents in different districts on the "" holiday the natural increase of the population? lt home "" principle.

These people called emergency accommodation. Responare not getting the living space or the facilisibility for all this must be laid at the door ties necessary for the happy home life that of this Government owing to its alleged they need.

There is Crown land in abundance made available to people who need money all over the country which should be cut for the construction of homes. up into blocks, ballotted for and given to the men and women who desire land for the building of their homes. I point these facts out in reply to a long ment that desire this state of affairs to press statement issued by the pathetic continue?

He plays about with statistics of hire-purchase finance companies. But from time to time and makes breathtaking young Australian men and women who have statements like the one I have just mensaved perhaps £1,000 for a home, and who tioned. It is my opinion, Mr Speaker, that if house, find that no help is forthcoming from something is not done quickly we shall be the banks, which say, "" We are sorry that faced with a housing shortage for the next we cannot help you. The Prime Minister 50 years. Has the Government lost sight has restricted finance and will not let us of the ever-swelling total of immigrants and help you "". At the present time bankers It is time the people of Australia had something to say about these matters. Who are the hidden forces behind the Governapproach a private bank for a small advance to enable them to build even a very modest have small respect for long-term loans, and this includes housing loans. They know that they have nothing to fear from their good friend the Prime Minister. He will probably have them knighted at the end of the year for withholding credit from the ordinary man and woman. Since 1950 this Government has spent home building, which is finance. £1,200,000,000 on defence and what has Australia to show for this? Not even our experts in Canberra-ther e are thousands of them here, a plague of them-ca n tell us its advice and skill to grapple with this where the money has gone. During that problem, the greatest in Australia's history. period also, Canberra's Ministers have conThese are not Canberra experts; they are tinually urged that we increase the flow of trade unionists, the men who work in these immigrants. That would act, they said, industries. A thriving building industry as a defence precaution. No mention was reflects the wealth, prosperity, and prestige made, of course, of the housing of these of the nation. When home building ceases people. The Government has declined from the nation goes into decay. That is happentime to time in this House to make an alloing to-day. On all sides we see a demand cation from the defence vote for housing, for homes. The domestic unhappiness of although it agrees that immigration is tied up thousands of young families due to the with defence. Our lop-sided Government housing shortage is laid at the door of this muddles on. It must be mentioned that Government. In New South Wales alone Commonwealth trust funds now amount to 150,000 homes are needed. The last census the staggering total of £750,000,000. This showed that 106,000 family units were should activate the minds of the Australian sharing accommodation. We all know how people-£750,000,00 0 in trust funds. Why that breeds unhappiness in the home. New should these millions be frozen?

7,Mr Failes,"I am, no doubt, entitled national housing plan in conjunction withsocieties, whether the homes shall be for rent or for sale, and so on. At a later stage in the same debate the Minister saidThe Commonwealth Government has no power in regard to the construction of houses in a State, becoming vocal at last. They have been and can act only by agreement with a State. I have not heard that disputed in this House. In fact, I think all honourable members who are properly informed agree that this is not a Commonwealth problem at all, and that it is a matter entirely for the States. We do not make it a national matter simply by calling it a national matter. A person does not create a housing crisis merely by saying that there is one, and we have been arguing here for a day and a half only on the name of something. We have been engaged in this argument because it has been said that there is a crisis in housing. It might even be said, and equally well, that there is a crisis in the position of the States' hospitals. Opposition Members -S o there is! in the States' schools. Opposition Mcmbers -S o there is! in road construction in the States. Opposition Members -S o there is! agreement of the Opposition, but do not forget that all those matters, hospitals, schools and roads, are essentially State activities and not activities of the Commonwealth. The sooner that fact is thoroughly driven home to the public the better, because I find that members of the public are being misled, as my electors are being misled. The director of a hospital board in my area made a statement at a meeting -and sent me a copy of it-to the effect that he felt that the whole onus of hospitals finance should rest on the Commonwealth. might suggest to Mr Cahill that the whole onus of hospitals finance and administration should rest on the Commonwealth, and see what Mr Cahill's reaction would be. members opposite put it to Mr Cahill that the whole responsibility for schools should rest with the Commonwealth. Opposition members interjectine. tionists talking, the men who want the whole of the power in the Commonwealtii concentrated in one parliament. They are trying to come in under the mat and get their unificationist ideas adopted in this Parliament, by arguing that the whole responsibility for these domestic matters, lies with the Commonwealth Governmeni. when they know full well that under the Constitution, and until that Constitution h changed, the responsibility for these matters lies entirely at the door of the States, and it is up to the States to pick up their own babies and nourish them. It has been said by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) that the Commonwealth Government has failed to establish a national housing plan in conjunction with the States. I am glad that he did not say. "" In co-operation with the States "", because, since I have been in this House, very little co-operation has been shown by any State government in matters that are the joint concern of the Commonwealth and the States. The basis of federation is that the Commonwealth and States should work together as a unit. But what do we have? Every time the States are asked-and I am referring particularly to New South Wales -to get on with construction of their dams, water supplies and all the other projects that they have on hand, they say, "" If the Federal Government will give us more money we shall be able to complete them "". I even heard one State Minister say that if the Commonwealth would give New South Wales £10,000,000 from the defence vote. New South Wales would be able to build the Burrendong dam, but that that could not be done until the Glenbawn dam was completed. The Glenbawn dam has been in course of construction for eight years already and is not nearly completed. One of the complaints laid at the door of this Government relates to finance for home-building. The position in this respect is the same as that in relation to the construction of schools, hospitals, roads and everything else with which the State governments muddle. It has been said time and again in this House and will bear repeating that every penny that comes from the Australian Loan Council is given to the States",14,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

It is lent to the States, just as other money is lent to them for the benefit of the people. The honourable member is right in saying that the money is not given to the States in the strict sense, but the fact remains that the Commonwealth Government has had to use revenue moneys for its own public works. We have had complaints from the Opposition to the effect that the Government should not do that. How inconsistent can this Opposition be! Then the Opposition complains that there are insufficient funds for war service homes. 1 do not think 1 need dwell on this subject, because the record of this Government in relation to war service homes is that it has provided finance for more homes than has any other government since the inception of the scheme. There may be a shortage of war service homes, but one of the main reasons for the rush for such homes is that the States have not been providing houses under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. Naturally, there has been a tendency for people to go somewhere else to try to obtain homes. As I say, however, this Government has a proud record in respect of war service homes. Then we have a complaint that we have not provided adequate finance for the cooperative building societies. Heavens above! When we proposed last year that some of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement money should be diverted to cooperative building societies we met the greatest opposition from New South Wales, and it was only after the respective Ministers had debated the matter for a long time that New South Wales was persuaded to take it up. It adopted the proposal late in the piece. Another charge is that we have not made sufficient finance available for Australians who are seeking to build homes. What a change of face this is! We have the Leader of the Opposition saying, in one part of his speech, that we must get back to the purpose of the original agreement, which was, as honourable members will recall, put he was not going to turn the workers into little capitalists, for which statement he will go down in history. The purpose of the agreement then was to provide housing on a rental basis. Much of the speech of the Leader of the Opposition was devoted to the need to provide money for people to buy homes. Yet, in the same breath he said that we should get back to the purpose of the original agreement. I suggest there is every justification for people writing to the newspapers and saying that the speech of the right honourable gentleman was the greatest muddle that he has delivered in this House. The Opposition contends that there should be an immediate reduction of the intake of immigrants. In other words, the Labour party wants to accept all the things that the immigrants have done during recent years and then to say to them, "" We have had enough "". I wonder how many houses the immigrant population of Australia has been responsible for, and for how many of the components that go into a house and for how many of the builders. I think it would be found that the immigrants had provided us with the necessaries with which to build a sufficient number of houses to house not only themselves but other people as well. We have seen ngures from time to time, which f do not propose to cite again, showing the number of sheets ot galvanized iron, bags of cement, and so on, that have been produced by immigrant labour. If we were to take the proportion of immigrant labour employed in big factories such as those of the Australian Iron and Steel Company Limited and the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, it would be seen that the immigrants had contributed in very large measure to the work force of this country and in providing those things which are essential to a housing project. So we go on. These complaints are nauseating. Reference has been made *the need to employ the maximum work force in the home-building industry. I think it was the Leader of the Opposition himself who said, in the course of his speech, that there was tremendous unemployment. I do not say that advertisements in newspapers are any criterion in this",15,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

17,Forward By Mr Dedman,"the man who saidmatter, but I looked through the columns of the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" on Saturday, and I think the ngures are rather interesting. That is the Sydney newspaper in which people who want employment advertise, and it is also the newspaper to which people who want employees refer. In the "" Positions Vacant"" column, there was one carpenter applying for work, whereas there were 29 situations vacant. Those included situations with companies which were advertising for "" carpenters "", without saying how many they wanted. One carpenter and joiner had advertised for work, and there were two who required week-end work. Apparently, they are fully occupied during the week but wish to earn a little more over the week-end. Good luck to them, but they probably want time and a half for such work. There were three persons who were prepared to carry out renovations, additions and repairs. In other words, in all those categories there were seven men applying for situations, whilst .29 advertisements appeared for situations vacant. We find also that although there were thirteen vacancies for brickworkers advertised in these columns, only one brickworker applied. The State Tile and Brick Works was advertising for men also. What are the trade unions doing in not getting in touch with the works in respect of these vacancies? What is the State Labour Government doing in not getting in touch with the unions to point out to them that there are vacancies. As against that position of the lack of men applying for advertised vacancies we have the statement by the Brick, Tile and Pottery Workers Union that it had 5 per cent, of its members out of work. Yet none of these men is advertising for a job. They are apparently living on their fat, as we say in the country. The Leader of the Opposition says that 12 per cent, of painters are out of workbut only five painters advertised for work, and one of them wanted £5 a day. He was apparently not very anxious to get work. On the other hand, 21 situations vacant are recorded in the same paper. Opposition members interjecting, needle the Opposition. Honourable members opposite talk of the great unemployment that exists, but the actual facts put a different complexion on the matter. There is claimed to be a great shortage of work for plumbers. The"" Sydney Morning Herald"" advertised nine situations vacant for plumbers, and only one plumber was seeking work. No electrical fitters were asking for work. I am not, surprised at that, because some years ago the trade union representing these men did its level best to keep apprentices out. I am -speaking from first-hand knowledge of apprentices who served in the forces during the war and on their return to civil life tried vainly to get into the trade union again so that they could work as electrical fitters. We have firms such as Australian Iron and Steel Limited advertising for electrical fitters. They may not want many, but they certainly want more than one. The Public Service Board and other public instrumentalities are also, advertising in the press for such men. The New Soutb Wales Maritime Services Board also wants electrical fitters, as does the repatriation general hospital. No applications were received for eight situations vacant for builders' labourers. The Leader of the Opposition claimed that there were 100 plasterers out of work. This really rocked me, because the Commonwealth Employment Service was advertising in the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" for plasterers-a t a time when there were supposed to be many out of work, according to the right honourable gentleman. What is the Commonwealth Employment Service for, if not to help to find work for people who are out of work? I do not need to go any further in that particular direction. Now as to the availability of houses. There were about six pages of advertisements of houses for sale, with about 400 houses advertised on each page. It will be found that a great proportion of those houses were for sale with vacant possession. The Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer) gave us the facts of that position last week. The actual position accords with what has been already said in the debate, to the effect that this is not a housing shortage arising from the insufficient number of houses available for people who want them. AlthoughI quite agree that there is a housing shortage, I must point out that there are a great number of houses vacant to-day which would be occupied if we were not hamstrung by such things as the New Soutb",16,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
18,Mr Failes,"Thos e figures certainlyWales Landlord and Tenant Act. What does the Premier of New South Wales say? He says, "" We will have a look at it "". Yet the Opposition in this House accuses the Government of ignoring the housing problem, and for years the newspapers have accused the Government of ignoring the facts. The New South Wales Premier has said, "" If the Landlord and Tenant Act is causing trouble, I will have a look at it"". trouble? logical effect. People are frightened to rent houses that they own. Can anybody blame them, because if they let tenants in they would be unable to get them out if they were unsuitable tenants or if the landlords needed their homes for their own purposes. Not only would the landlords face the possibility of not being able to get the tenants out, but they know that they run the chance that the tenants would take them to the Fair Rents Court, which might award rentals that would be, in effect, peppercorn rentals, with which the landlord would have to be satisfied for all time. I say that people who own houses will rent them if they are given a fair go, and that people will also build houses for rental if they do not have a solid fear that they will lose as a result of so doing. As a matter of fact, I am in that position myself. I have a house which I am not prepared to let because I do not know whether I would get a satisfactory rent or a satisfactory tenant. IfI sold this house I would buy another one. But that is the position. I will not rent the house and take the risk of getting either an unsatisuse for which would defeat the object for factory rental for it or an unsatisfactory tenant in it whom I would be unable to get out of it. I should say that there are hundreds and hundreds of people in the same position. In my own home town there would be at least twenty houses for sale, but not for rent, because of the provisions of the New South Wales Landlord and Tenant Act. In the bigger towns there would probably be from 100 to 150 such houses. Anybody would find it impossible to jump over the piles of books in estate agents' offices in Sydney containing details of houses for sale. That is the problem that Mr Cahill says he is willing to ""look at"". The amendment moved by the Leader with the Commonwealth Government? It of the Opposition is, in effect, an indictment is just a case of the same old red herring of the New South Wales Labour Government if ever there was one. The housing shortage is a problem for the States to solve if they will only face up to it. And the first thing that the States have to do is to deal with such legislation as the New Soutb Wales Landlord and Tenant Act. They have to give people the courage and the will to rent vacant houses in their posses-sion. There is a very important personage in this House who owns three houses. I shall not make any further reference to that? because all honourable members know who he is. There are a great number of people with more than one house who are afraid to rent them for the reasons that I have given. I would be willing to take somebody into my home in the country while I am down here in Canberra, but if I did, I could easily find that I was unable to get them out when I needed the home for myself. Many people are in the same position, so it is obvious that some proper amendment of the New South Wales Landlord and Tenant Act might get us somewhere along the road to providing more accommodation for people who need it. As I have already mentioned, there U no doubt that if finance is to be made available, it cannot be made available, under present circumstances, through the Australian Loan Council. It could be made available, no doubt, by easing credit restrictions on the private banks. If this is done, it must be a condition that the money so released is to be used for housing alone, and not allowed to be used for other things, as in the past, such as hire-purchase, its which the restrictions had been eased. But why should it be used for housing entirely, when rural producers are crying out for money to enable them to improve their properties? I want now, as my time Is running out, to make one reference to a statement of the Leader of the Opposition, echoed by the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Curtin), the absurdity of which requires an answer. They referred to expenditure on commercial and industrial buildings as luxury expenditure. They mentioned the building of hotels, picture theatres, one-brand petrol stations, and so on.

IfI have not satisfied the House that the Commonwealth Government is not solely responsible for housing, but that it is a matter for the States, I have been wasting my timebut I do not think that I have wasted my time. [3.20] I am very pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the very important debate in which the House is now engaged. BeforeI come to the main matter of my speech I desire to extend my meed of congratulation to the mover and seconder of the Address-in-Reply, the honourable member for Barker( Mr Forbes) and the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Bury). I listened very attentively to both of those honourable members. I want to congratulate them on the temperate and well-thought-out speeches that they delivered and say that in my opinion they will, in the years to come, be an acquisition to this Parliament. 1 listened very carefully to His Excellency's address, and I have also read it since it was printed and distributed to honourable members. In my long parliamentary career I have never heard or read a more futile Speech made on behalf of any government. It 'contained no promises, no suggestions, and no gleam of hope for the future. Housing, the most important issue of all, was passed over by the Prime Minister with the assurance that there was no crisis. Despite what he said, there is a surplus of both materials and labour. I wholeheartedly support the amendment which has been moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) because I believe, sincerely, that the Government is deserving of the severest censure for having failed to honour promises that it made as long ago as 1949. This afternoon the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith( Mr Curtin) read to the House an advertisement, inserted in the press as long ago as 1949, containing promises by the present Prime Minister on this matter of housing, which is one of the most serious and important problems confronting the people of Australia, especially those who cannot obtain a home because of this Government's failure to give adequate financial support to State building programmes. The Prime Minister, in replying to the Leader of the Opposition, said he was satisfied that there was no crisis in the building industry, and that it was a question not of money but of materials and labour. The Prime Minister must know as well as we on this side of the House that that is not in accordance with fact. During the last two or three weeks this has been proved beyond doubt by the building industry of every State. If ever a Government deserved censure it is this Government, for its lack of sympathy towards these unfortunate home-seekers, and for the way in which it is treating the States. Though the Prime Minister said that he was satisfied that material and labour alone were holding up the housing programme, one of his own Ministers-who , incidentally, is personally interested in this phase of activity-admitte d on at least three or four occasions in his speech last week that there was a serious housing crisis in Australia. He made certain suggestions with a view to overcoming that crisis, thus contradicting his own Prime Minister. He said-and this has been referred to by the honourable memSouth Wales thousands of homes were occupied by only one person. The only inference one could draw from that observation was that this should not be allowedthat no one should be permitted to live alone while other homes held five, six or perhaps seven families. He implied that some law should be brought down to compel such persons to take others into their homes. Yet he assures us that he does not believe in controls! In short, his only suggestion for solving the problem was that it was wrong for one person to occupy a home. Further proof that the Prime Minister has made an untruthful statement is provided by the fact that last week the State Housing Ministers of Australia, at a lengthv conference in Melbourne, were unanimous that there was a housing crisis. The Liberal Premiers of Victoria and South Australia-wh o ordinarily support this Government-were loudest in censuring it. They agreed that the crisis was attributable to the attitude of this Government in refusing to allow the States sufficient money to carry out housing programmes.

This is reported fhe Treasurer. Is it not a fact that at the last meeting of the Australian Loan Council the Queensland Government asked that £2,750,000 be made available for housing purposes? Is it not a fact, also, that that sum of money was £250,000 less than the Australian Loan Council's allocation for housing in the previous year? Does not .the Treasurer consider that this request for a lower sum for housing would indicate the Queensland Government's determination to discredit the new Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement? Further, does the Treasurer not consider that every circumstance and sign would indicate that Government's intention to disguise from the Commonwealth Government its record of monumental stupidity in the housing field? The Treasurer's reply was, ""Yes"". Subsequently, the honourable member for Lilley tried to discredit the Queensland Housing Commission and the Queensland Housing Minister. He said that the Queensland Government had asked for £2,750,000, which was less than it had asked for during the previous financial year. That is absolutely untrue. According to a reply given by the Minister to a question asked by the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Whitlam), the Queensland Government asked for much more than £2,750,000. The honourable member for Lilley argued that that was true, and that they had not asked for more. The Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) has used the same argument.

Housing is a subject on which a considerable proportion of the members of tbe Parliament can speak with some feeling, as I am able to do from my own experience. When I for £11,937,000, received was discharged from the services, after having married, I had no home, and I had received £10,000,000. first-hand experience of housing problems in 1946. 1 fully realize the tremendous urgency and importance of the housing problem in 1957. However, it is sheer nonsense to say, as the Opposition does, that the problem can be solved simply by the provision of more funds for housing. There are two inseparable problems in the present housing situation. One is finance, and fhe other is the excessive cost of homebuilding. Any government that really sets out to overcome our housing difficulties must solve both those problems. I consider that high costs have now become the more urgent of the two. Prices have been soaring ever since the end of World War II . Indeed, they have increased so much that a man who bought a house in 1946, and now wishes to add a garage to it, as likely as not finds that the garage will cost him more than the house cost him ten years ago. It now costs so much to build homes that many people cannot afford the necessary repayments, even if finance is available to them. Even though the homes built by the much-vaunted New South Wales Housing Commission are heavily subsidized by the taxpayers, the rents are frequently more than people can afford. It is becoming obvious that the discussion on this amendment has back-fired on the Australian Labour party, and those whose faces are red now are Mr Cahill, the New South Wales Premier, and Mr Landa, the New South Wales Minister for Housing. I think this debate has shown conclusively that, in housing, New South Wales is a delinquent State. Its population has increased in smaller proportion than that of any other State has done, but it is still in a worse housing situation than any other State is. Figures published by a Sydney newspaper after wide investigation show that the population of New South Wales has increased in the last few years by only 19 per cent., or one-third less than the increase in South Australia, and not much more than half the increase in Western Australia. Yet South Australia and Western Australia have solved their housing problems, and the position in New South Wales seems to be getting steadily worse!",21,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

49,Mr Wheeler (Mitchell) [3.45],"I nFor the whole of the period in question, South Australia has had a Liberal and Country League government, and for part of the time Western Australia has had a liberal government. New South Wales complains that it has received from the Commonwealth insufficient funds for housing. It is a much bigger State than South Australia is, but the indications are that the South Australian Housing Trust will complete more houses this year than the New South Wales Housing Commission will complete. I am grateful to the Opposition for submitting this amendment, not only because the debate has exposed the complete inability of Labour to handle the housing situation in the States in which it holds office, but also because 1 believe that we needed a full-scale debate on housing. Naturally, finance has tightened up as costs have skyrocketed, because many prudent people are afraid of the high cost level. In effect, this fear is a natural regulator which, in time, will force costs down, fn fact, it is doing this at the present time. But the restriction of finance has gone too far at this stage, in my opinion. Money must be provided for housing, and the amount available at the present time should be increased. However, it is just not enough. It is one thing to make large advances, but the money should be increased in a manner that will keep industry working at its proper level but not revive those over-demand conditions which have caused the present inflation. To provide sufficient money requires skilful control, ft is a job that can be done only by a central bank, and we have not a proper central banking system. That, I believe, is the immediate cause of the present trouble in home finance. I have been warning this House for years of the dangers which are likely to arise from this serious defect in our banking structure. IfI wanted an instance to prove this point conclusively, I could not have had a better one than this housing situation, although I am sorry indeed that it is one which is so disastrous for so many people. There has been, of course, an attempt to regulate the amount of money available for housing so as to restrain cost inflation. I am not in the confidence of those in control, but that situation is obvious to anybody. It is obvious, also, that unfortunately this control has been clumsy. The regulation intended only to diet the patient as a precaution againstfinancialobesity has in some localities reduced him to starvation. The natural question is: How did this happen? I have been making some investigations along this line and it seems a sorry tale of misunderstanding, lack of confidence, and lack of co-ordination between the trading banks and the man who, in effect, controls the trading banks, Dr. H. C. Coombs, the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank. Also, I regret to say that there are some indications that the Commonwealth Savings Bank, the so-called people's bank, cut its allocation for homes just at the time when it could and should have increased it. Dr. Coombs made a statement to the Labour party in which, by implication, he threw the blame for lack of housingfinanceon to his competitors, the trading banks. His control of the private banks, I should hasten to state, is exercised through a branch of the Commonwealth Bank, which calls itself the central banks. If ever there was a case in the commercial world of misdescription this is it, because our so-called central bank is, in fact, a wholely owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth Banka subsidiary though which it is able to harass and control the other trading banks with which it competes. It was, in fact, given its present powers by the Labour party, mainly as a means of putting the private trading banks out of business. I think it is self-evident that a true central bank must be above and completely unconnected with any trading bank. It must control the trading banks, therefore there is a complete need for impartiality. In addition it must be able to get their co-operation, because it cannot supervise directly all the myriads of transactions which these banks conduct; but our so-called central bank has none of these qualities. Unfortunately, however, Parliament has given it the authority of a central bank. The statement which Dr. Coombs gave to the Labour party a fortnight ago shows how impossible our present banking structure is, because the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank played party politics in a very big way and was quite unfair to the private trading banks. Dr. Coombs is in a unique position. He has been given so much control in his dual position that he is a big factor in the Government of this country. As he is not elected to his position it may be thought that he should be exempt from criticism. but any claims he may have had to immunity in this direction I submit have certainly been removed by this statement. He has, of his own volition, precipitated himself into the political sphere. The statement was made to the committee set up by the Labour party preparatory to this present censure amendment. This committee was called a fact-finding committee, but everybody knew that its real purpose was to obtain political material with which it could embarrass the present Government. said that the committee could have had a more benign chairman, but that is a matter of opinion. The committee heard what it called "" evidence "" from State Labour politicians and from fellow travellers, including members of the Communist controlled Building Workers Industrial Union. It added as a scalp to its belt this statement from Dr. Coombs. He was, of course, within his rights in making it, but one might challenge his wisdom in making the statement to this committee. His actual words, as reported, leave him very much open to criticism. One of his statements is grossly unfair to his private competitors and another is highly questionable. As related by the Labour party to the capitalistic press, this statement readsThe Commonwealth Savings Bank will advance less money in 1956-57 than each of the two previous years. This is because the growth of private savings banks has meant a considerable reduction in the rate of increase in the deposits The private savings banks have given very of the Commonwealth Savings Bank. Private savings banks, however, are now making loans for housing and aggregate advances by all savings banks seem likely to be higher in 1956-1957 than in 1955-1956. That statement shows one of the causes of the shortage of housing finance; but why is the Commonwealth Savings Bank cutting back its finance at this critical time? Dr. Coombs's excuse is that there has been a reduction in the rate of increase of deposits. But take note that he has not claimed a reduction in deposits. Indeed he could not do so, because on the bank's own figures, from the beginning of June, 1956, to the end of January, 1957, its deposits increased by £15,500,000. the figures since January have not been published. Surely, even if the deposits only remained steady, without any increase at all, the bank should have been able to maintain its rate of advances for housing. It has been making these advances for housing for many years, and the figures have been steady at around £1,000,000 per month over the last ten years. Repayments should finance the new advances, which is the whole idea of the Credit Foncier system. Mark you, the deposits actually increased! There was a very good reason why this cut in housing advances was undesirable. We can show that the private savings bank will contribute much to housing, but there is a lag in arranging these things. It was therefore incumbent on the Commonwealth Bank to take up as much as possible of the slackduring the runningin period. Dr. Coombs was well aware of this situation, because he said in his annual report of August, 1956A sudden contraction in this lending before now savings banks were ready to take up their share of the responsibility could have produced some economic disturbance. His own savings bank's contribution to housing was then at the rate of £1,000,000 a month, but that is not a very large amount when one considers that the Commonwealth Savings Bank's assets total £740,000,000. That bank has very large liquid assets. Surely it would have been able to find a little extra for housing during this critical period. What happened to th? drop in advances? It is a baffling problem and, unfortunately, except for Dr. Coombs's vague statement that the banks will advance less during the year, we have no information. specific and very encouragingfigureson how much they will advance for housing, but since June nofigureshave been given by the Commonwealth Bank. On inquiry from the bank, I have been advised that the current rate of advances to co-operative building societies and to individuals is at the rate of £10,000,000 per annum. That is. in effect £2,500,000 less than the amount advanced last year. All this points to the fact that advances in the first half of the year were low. That in itself contributed to the shortage of finance. If in the last quarter-April, May and June -afte r the favourite has bolted and the situaiion is as it is now. the Commonwealth Bank has a sudden desire to grant more and more advances, the very purpose of these t funds will be destroyed Money should bc advanced in a steady flow throughout the",22,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

51,Mr Wheeler,"Well, I have heard itwhole of the year. We should have more information about housing advances made by the Commonwealth Savings Bank. I feel sure that there, is a need' for a real factfinding committee, which will examine the Commonwealth Savings Bank housing advances and find out why it has reduced advances at this time. Maybe that will give us the key to the riddle of the, sudden contraction of housing loan moneys. I said also that Dr. Coombs made a statement which was unfair to his competitors. The position is that private trading banks, as distinct from the new saving banks, have reduced their housing advances by £18,000,000 in the past eighteen months. Apparently Dr. Coombs was asked hy the fact-finding Labour committee whether the central bank has directed the private banks to do this. He replied 1 The Central Bank has not issued any directive on advance policy for trading banks on loans or advances for home building purposes. The trading banks were free to make loans at their discretion, efficiently the supply of money for housing, subject to broad principles which emphasized restraint in advances to finance large items of capital expenditure for import and to provide preference to projects which would significantly benefit the balance of payments. That statement is correct as far as it goes, but it is very misleading. He should have added that the trading banks have been discouraged from making long-term advances, and housing advances are long-term. He should have said also that he had reduced the amount of money the trading banks had available for advances by the continual callup of the funds and that, by the very act of giving preference to primary and secondary industries which produced export goods or replaced imports, as directed by him, they were left without sufficient money to finance their additional responsibility of housing. That the trading banks carried out his directive is shown in the very substantial improvement in the trade balance position. Yet for this very act of helping him and giving him co-operation, Dr. Coombs has, by implication, criticized them. Housing loans, in any case, have become a dangerous form of advance since the Chifley Government introduced the form of special deposit call-ups. They tie up money for long periods of years. If, during any part of such a long period, a socialist government should come into power-whic h Heaven forbid-it would call up this money and, because a bank was unable to obtain it from the borrower, it would be at the : mercy of the central bank and consequently might, be forced out of business. It might have been said that the trading banks could be granted exemption from the call-up into the special accounts of some of their money if they agreed to use that money for housing advances, but a prudent banker would probably have grave doubts about accepting such a proposition. Dr. Coombs might have said all of those things, but he said none of them. As it stands, his statement represents, by implication, a very unfair indictment of the private banks. I should say that, by this one act, he has shattered any hope of real cooperation in the future between his central bank and the private banks while he continues in control. Yet an efficient banking system is impossible without that co-operation. Assuming we get a proper central banking system, which I hope we shall get in due course, we shall be able to regulate and the home finance problem will be solved. The other problem is one of costs. This is a much more difficult question, because both sides in the building industry, the employers and workers, have been living for so long in an atmosphere where costs do not matter that it is difficult for them to get back to reality again. However, I am pleased that the idea I put forward in this House in 1953 for large-scale project building is receiving increased attention. That is the means by which America and Great Britain dealt with their housing problems, and I think it could help Australia. We have large-scale construction by State, housing authorities, but unfortunately the economies achieved by working in large quantities are mainly nullified by wastefulness in government administration. Some large scale construction is being carried out by private companies quite successfully. But the trouble is that they cannot be sure that their prospective purchasers will secure finance. This is the time for an imaginative and experimental approach to the problem so that we shall be able to cut through the delays. We might invite organizations with proper equipment to submit their propositions to us, showing their designs, what they can construct and their prices. If any one quoted a figure which would show a really big saving to purchasers and everything else was satisfactory, the Commonwealth could give a guarantee that it would find the finance for eligible purchasers. One thing is certain, and that is that present methods, at least in New South Wales, are not good enough. I am all in favour of any new move which will break this deadlock, but it must be one which will give us homes, quickly and at a lower, price. In New South Wales, labour and materials now available are not being used to the best advantage. It has been a hard job up to the present to get co-operation from the New South Wales Government, but I think the present controversy has taught every one a good deal, and that the climate is right, for corrective action to be taken. support wholeheartedly the amendment to the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt). I am of the very definite opinion that honourable members on this side of the House have dealt with the subject of the shortage of homes in a manner that proves beyond a shadow of doubt that a crisis does exist, despite all the political pot-boiling, excuses and subterfuges that have been indulged in by supporters of the Government. I do not intend to speak at length on the housing question, but I wish to say that percentages, figures and past performances do not produce a pay envelope, a meal or the money to build a home, nor do they alter the very salient fact that Victoria has a shortage of 32,000 homes, about which the Government is apparently determined to do nothing. The subject that I now wish to discuss is one that is causing considerable concern throughout this and many other countries. I refer to nuclear radiation and air pollution by the agency of what is commonly known as smog. Research has established that pollution of the atmosphere, once no more than a minor nuisance, has become, in the last fifteen years, a disturbing threat, and blighted areas, smoke and air with an overtone of deadly menace. The vast industrial growth and expansion of chemical industries have made air contamination more difficult to deal with and potentially, if not actually, more damaging to the health and property of the inhabitants of the industrial communities than all other industrial hazards put together. Now there is a new and general threat, that: the air may be poisoned by radio-activity, possibly with disastrous long-range effects, if nuclear test explosions are continued. In the United States of America concern regarding air pollution has grown to such an extent that President Eisenhower, in a special message to the Capitol, urged Congress to step up research on air pollution. The President saidAs a result of industrial growth and urban development, the atmosphere over some population centres may be approaching the limit of its ability to absorb air pollutants with safety to health.. As a result of this statement action was taken to increase the appropriation to the Public Health Service for studies seeking necessary scientific data and more effective methods of control, and for the fiscal year 1956 an amount of £370,000 was granted for research. Discussion in committee on this question revealed that the build-up of air pollution was now approaching a critical stage, especially in the industrial centres. Public reaction to this development is one of great apprehension and demand for prompt corrective measures. It was recommended that studies be initiated on the health effects of air pollutants, on the relationship of air pollution to weather phenomena, on the evaluation of air cleansing procedures, and the extension of medical intelligence in the field of air pollution. This matter has caused so much concern in the United States of America that more than a dozen bills have been introduced in Congress to meet the problem. In order to induce industry to install equipment to prevent air pollution, a bill was introduced authorizing the American Government to guarantee low-interest loans for the purchase or construction of facilities to cope with this menace. During the debate on this measure it was said that it was useless to spend large sums of money on slum reclamation unless at the same time something was done about "" one of the most important contributory causes of our slums pollution "". In the past, in our own country, before the atomic tests were held, air pollution was more a matter of discomfort than a danger to health, but as more and more soot drifts down on the houses, house furnishings and clothing, and with the prevalence of lung cancer;, the people are reacting and demanding that industrial plants should be located",24,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
52,Mr Mcivor (Gellibrand) [4.9],"Iaway from residential areas, and that councils and governments take measures to abate the nuisance. The nature and volume of air pollution have changed radically in recent years. The volume of industrial production has more than doubled and trebled, and new types of noxious materials, sometimes hard to identify and often unaccompanied by visible fumes, are escaping into the atmosphere or are being hurled into the atmosphere. Population has become more concentrated in the metropolitan areas that include large sections of heavy industry. Hence the burning of fuel oil to heat houses, hospitals and other buildings, to fire incinerators and to operate motor vehicles adds to the density of the total contamination. As in the United States of America and Great Britain, air pollution has become a menace in Australia, and is already causing grave concern in Melbourne and other capital cities. The vast open spaces, coupled with the extensive residential sprawl of the metropolis of Melbourne, make it almost impossible to banish industry to the fringe areas. These conditions are common to other big cities throughout Australia. fact, few locations are now available for heavy industry where good transportation facilities, raw materials, power and other economic factors justify the moving of an industry into an undeveloped area, away from a community. It is true to say that the community rapidly encroaches on the industry. England has accepted smog as an industrial nuisance of the gravest kind, and has set up the Beaver Committee to bring down a report on its elimination. As far back as 1920 the Newton Committee in England reported:There is no doubt that smoke associated with research report to an air pollution congress fog has a serious effect on the elderly and the in the United States of America, it wa< chronic bronchitic in precipitating a bronchial stated that installation of air pollution equippneumonia. Part of the excess of deaths in the poorer classes may be accounted for by their living in a more heavily smoke polluted atmosphere. The Newton Committee was also of the opinion that air pollution was, to a great degree, the cause of lung cancer, the incidence of which they found to be much higher in towns, and particularly the smokier towns, than in the rural areas. In 1953, the damage to property from air pollution in England was estimated at £150,000,000 a year. Add to this the damage to health, and the wastage of fuel, and the national and economic loss is staggering. Investigations revealed that even in the cleaner rural areas in England systematic measurements of deposits from pollution showed a fall-out of four tons a month. In towns and industrial centres the average tonnage is 75 a month, and it is estimated that every year 2,400,000 tons of smoke go into the British air. Half of this is from open domestic fires, one third from industrial chimneys, and the rest from railway engines and electricity generating stations. It is interesting to note that, arising out of the investigations to which I have just referred, legislation came into force in Great Britain at the beginning of this year giving local authorities power to create zones in which the emission of smoke from buildings can be curtailed or banned. This act, known as the Clean Air Act of 1956, aims to eliminate the worse of the smog in ten to fifteen years. The part of the act that came into force with the new year gives local authorities power to ensure that all new furnaces installed, apart from domestic boilers, burn smokeless fuel, and to control the height of all new industrial chimneys. But the most important part of the Clean Air Act, banning the emission of smoke, grit and dust from industrial chimneys, will not come into force until early next year. In the United States, it is estimated that the loss to the nation annually from ait pollution amounts to one and a half billion dollars, in the Los Angeles oil refinery area smog is considered a continuing plague, and the California Air Pollution Foundation Commission states that it will cost 100,000,000 dollars to eliminate it. It is interesting to note that in an editorial ment in one oil refining district would result in the recovery from sour gases of 1,000 ions of sulphur daily. This'equipment would also reduce by 2,000 tons a day the volume of sulphur dioxide going into the atmosphere. This statement shows also the horrifying fact that, in recent years, smog has demonstrated its power to kill. In October, 1948, one-half of the 7.000 inhabitants of the City of Donora, in the United States of America, suffered acute illness, and 21 of them died. In London, in 1952, smog, with a heavy ground-level concentration over three days, was responsible for the death of 3,000 people over and above the normal mortality rate for the same period. In my opinion, it is therefore necessary that the Government should bring down legislation to combat this menace. It is urgently essential that money should be provided for research in this field, and also that inducements such as those offered in the United States of America be extended to industries in Australia to enable them to install grit and fume arresting appliances. In fact, the matter is one of such vital importance that all industries should be compelled to install such appliances. Admittedly, there are ordinances in operation in some cities and municipalities, but they are, at the very best, limited, and it is far beyond the resources of local government to enforce them. Municipal budgets could never meet the cost of erection and maintenance of the scientific laboratories that are necessary for the sampling and analysing of air. One cannot deny that industry demands power in enormous quantities. Power generation, for the most part, requires the burning of fuels, and it is no exaggeration to say that the volume of smoke from millions of tons of combustible products which burn all over Australia staggers the imagination. and radio-activity conspire with this effluent, described by Dr. D. L. G. Thomas in the is it any wonder that the public demands action to abate the nuisance? In the City of Sydney, a scientist is permanently employed testing the incidence of smog, because it is such a menace to public health in that city. In Brisbane, also, there is a growing apprehension of this menace, with its attendant physical disaster and smog sickness. In Newcastle, New South Wales, it is estimated that 500 tons of soot fall on each square mile c?cY. "" r^ -J rapid residential and industrial growth is resulting in increased polkirioo of the atmosphere. The discharge from thousands of industrial smoke-stacks and household chimneys and incinerators, coupled with the discharge of petroleum gases from motor vehicles, makes air pollution a vile menace which must be tackled on a national scale. Measured in terms of economics, the cost of air pollution to Australia must be tremendous, especially when one considers corrosion of structural metals, discolouration of paint, soiling of buildings and wearing apparel, damage to foliage and crops, and devaluation of real property. The most dangerous element in this pollution is sulphur dioxide, millions of tons of which are being poured into the atmosphere annually throughout the universe. Add to all of this the very real danger of radio-active contamination and it presents a fearsome prospect to any community. It bears a death threat for individuals and the possibility of doing irreparable physical damage to the human race as a whole. In the Latrobe valley, which is the main coal-production centre of Victoria, dust precipitation is considered to be the heaviest in the world. This precipitation is due to the incomplete combustion of coal, which scientists all over the world blame for the terrific increase of lung cancer. This prompts me to say that air pollution is not confined to the outdoors; it is also prevalent inside the factories, as is shown in a report headed "" Dust Hazard in Industry "", from which I now readThe danger of dust in industry has been exposed by an extensive X-ray survey of 3,800 Victorian workers in dusty trades. The investigation disclosed 360 cases of serious lung diseases, mainly silicosis and asbestosis, which "" turn young men into old"". Results of the survey, conducted by the industrial hygiene diviWhen climatic conditions sion of the State Health Department, are latest issue of the "" Australian Medical Journal"". Many of those found suffering from the diseases were already grossly disabled, and others, in whom the condition was less advanced, were suffering from shortness of breath. Dr. Thomas said most of the cases had been unsuspected. Before the survey the number of cases known to the division was 522, comprising 343 among miners and 179 in industry. The X-ray survey brought the number to 1,126, with 587 in miners and 539 in industry. ""No doubt there are many more cases, either symptomless or undiagnosed "", he added. I wish to refer now to nuclear radiation. The statement that I have made concerning the effects of air pollution and dust in industry should cause us to consider most gravely the effects of industrial pollution and nuclear radiation and the fall-out of radio-active strontium 90, which can be active for 30 years. It can have terrible effects on the human body and, indeed, on plant life, drinking water, crops and soil. This radioactive strontium is so easily absorbed and stored in the body that it gives rise to bone tumours, aplastic anaemia and leukaemia, and it can have disastrous genetic effects. In support of this statement, I read from a report by Sir Ernest Rock Carling, consultant adviser to the British Home Office and the Ministries of Health and SupplyThe list of uses for radio-active sources in ' industry lengthened month by month; this meant that more and more people were being brought within its range. Genetic scientists feared a deterioration of the average intelligence, an increase in mental disorder, and a considerable increase in thefinancialburden that would fall upon the healthy in maintaining the unhealthy in hospitals. It was surely obvious that mankind «hould strive to minimise any and every source of radiation. There must be provision for educating every person in whom the radiation hazard had existed. All potential parents ought to take the utmost care lo avoid the accumulation of the smallest dose of radiation lest menchildren pay the penalty. Taking this question further, let me read statements of General James Gavin, Chief of Army Research and Development in the United States of America, when giving evidence before the Symington Senate Committee. General Gavin was askedIf we got into a nuclear war and our strategic air force made an assault in force against Russia with nuclear weapons so that the weapons exploded in a way where the prevailing winds would carry them south-east over Russia, what wouid be the effect in the way of death? He repliedCurrent planning estimates run on the order of several hundred million deaths. That would be either way depending which way the wind blew. If the wind blew to the south-east they would be mostly in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, although they would extend into the Japanese and perhaps into the Philippines area. If the wind blew the other way they would extend well back into Western Europe. General Gavin's statement bears out the finding of the committee, which readGiven a sufficient number of bombs, no part of the world would escape exposure to biologically significant levels of radiation. To a greater or less degree, a legacy of genetic damage would be incurred, .and an increased incidence of delayed effects on the individual would probably be induced. Dr. Edith Summerskill, in a debate on this subject in the House of Commons in July, 1956, saidApparently only the wind will determine whether the same bomb will destroy an enemy or an ally or damage them genetically. As the wind is not confined to frontiers, the lethal fall-out which it is not one of the primary or even the secondary carries may affect both ally and -enemy equally. In view of some of the statements which are reaching us, one wonders whether the soldiers are determined to ignore the advice of the scientists until it is too late. It is of paramount importance not to increase the scale of the tests, h is emphasized throughout the report that the scale of the tests determines the danger in the future. In the light of all that, it seems there can only be one answer: control of these tests with the object of eventual abolition must be our aim. There must be no delay. To fail to do so js to fail in our duty to thc people of the world and to posterity. Add to all this the concern that is arising all over the world due to air pollution and radio-activity, and the established fact thai it can cause cancer of the lungs and other physical defects. I am of the opinion that the time has come when the people are looking to the social sciences for assistance in this matter, .because of its urgency to the community from a public health point of view. When we consider the hopeless fight facing municipalities in trying to control this menace, which is not only taking toll of many human lives but is also costing the citizens of this nation thousands of pounds in repairs to their homes, and is also costing thousands of pounds in the maintenance of factories and offices, public utilities, bridges and the like, we can only assume that this has become a national responsibility and a duty that the Federal Government can no longer fail to recognize. I have been prompted to raise this issue. Mr Deputy Speaker, because of the conditions that exist in the big industrial electorate that I represent, and also because of the reply I received from the Minister for External Affairs( Mr Casey), who is the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, to a question that I asked in the House on 2nd October last year. My question wasAs scientists in most of the countries of the world are becoming more deeply concerned -every day at the ever-increasing incidence of lung cancer and deaths due to smog, particularly in industrial areas, will the Minister give serious consideration to setting up a special bureau within the research division of the Commonwealth Scientific .and Industrial Research Organization to investigate methods of controlling this deadly menace, which is becoming so prevalent in the community, especially in heavily industrialized areas? The answer I received wasAsT understand the purport of the honourable gentleman's question, the matter he has mentioned comes within the field of medical research. That objectives of the Commonwealth Scientific and .Industrial Research Organization. However, I shall certainly remit the question to my friend and colleague, the Minister for Health, and discuss loan works programmes an amount of it with him to see whether he has any constructive suggestions to make. I conclude by saying that the nation can no longer afford such an apathetic approach to such vital questions. The time has come for action on the menace of air pollution and smog, and for the abolition of atomic weapon tests and warfare. The facts and statements' I have presented to the House should convince all right-thinking persons in Australia of the validity of my contentions and of my demand for action-urgen t action-by the Federal Government on this matter, which is so vital to mankind, and which has become so evident only since atomic tests have been conducted. The concern that I have expressed was shared, with a great deal of realism, by President Eisenhower and Mr MacMillan during their recent conference at Bermuda. had a very interesting dissertation on smog from the honourable member for Gellibrand ( Mr Mclvor). It is my intention to remove some of the smog from the thinking of the members of the Opposition in relation to the important question of housing. I want, quite definitely and unequivocally, to say to the House that I support the remarks of the honourable member for Lilley( Mr the money io be made available for housWight) in the House last Thursday. The honourable member for Brisbane( Mr result, the Queensland Government asked George Lawson) has referred to them this afternoon, and I hope to show that honourable member, in the course of a few comments, that some of the statements he made do not accord with the facts of the housing problem. The discussion on housing in Queensland was begun by the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) last Thursday, when he denied that the sum of £2,750,000 devoted to the Queensland Housing Commission this year was the amount that the Queensland Government requested at the last meeting of the Australian Loan Council. He said that the -Queensland Government had, in fact, asked for an amount of £3,040,000. Mr George Lawson -That is true. to explain this matter in my own way, and I require no assistance from the honourable member for Brisbane on it. When the Premiers met with the representatives of the Commonwealth recently they requested the Commonwealth to make available to State £210,000,000, including an amount for housing. It has been usual, in recent years, for the Premiers to ask for an amount considerably higher than that which the Commonwealth is prepared to give. The Commonwealth was not prepared to give the amount requested for the simple reasonand I do not want to go into all the details of this-that the loan market will not supply all the money sought, some of which, therefore, would have to come from funds supplied by the Commonwealth from its receipts of revenue. In the current year the Commonwealth restricted the amount to £190,000,000, which was the same as the amount provided, or guaranteed, by the Commonwealth in the previous year. The Premiers then went on to consider the distribution of this amount, and they decided that the amount to be provided for housing would be £32,150,000, which compares with an amount of £33,200,000 that they allocated to housing in the previous year. Therefore, the Premiers sought an overall reduction, throughout Australia, of £1,050,000 for the purposes of the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement in this year, knowing full well that the new agreement to be produced by the Commonwealth would provide that 20 per cent, of ing was to go to building societies. As a for £290,000 less than the £3,040,000 for which it had asked in the first place. Mr George Lawson -What did the Minister for National Development say in answer to a question asked by a member of this House? Minister said. I am telling the honourable member the facts as given to me by the Treasurer, who should know them, as he was chairman of the meeting of the Loan Council. I say quite definitely that there has been gross mismanagement of the housing situation in Queensland. Mr George Lawson -Anothe r knocker! says ""Another knocker"". Let me indicate the expenditure by the Queensland Government under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement over the last five years. In 1953, the amount spent was £5,200,000.",26,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

56,Mr Hulme,"The honourable memberIt dropped in the following year to £3,700,000, and in the year after that it rose to £5,000,000. In the succeeding year it receded to £4,700,000, and this year it has dropped to a fraction over £3,000,000. If that does not indicate that the Queensland Government has been prepared to sacrifice its housing situation from the point of view of rental homes, I do not know what does. The amount that is made available this year is made up in a certain way, and I think this should be mentioned because of the figures that have been given in the House in this debate. The balance at the beginning of July last was £465,000. The proportion from the £2,750,000 available to the Queensland Housing Commission for rental homes is £2,200,000. Additionally, there is available from the Commonwealth for housing ex-servicemen £110,000. The amount from the allocation for building societies is £164,000, and there is also an amount of about £100,000 which represents repayments in relation to homes already sold in previous periods-a n amount that is never else on the Labour side as available to the State Government for building in this particular year. That gives a total of just over £3,000,000 for the current year. So we come to the situation where the Queensland Government, in February, makes a demand for £278,000. It is remarkable that this amount of £278,000 is only £12,000 short of the reduced amount that the Queensland Government asked for when it met with representatives of the Commonwealth and the other States and decided the total amount that the States wanted for housing in this year. But the information which has been given does noi disclose an additional fact. I have been approached by members of the Queensland Merchants Association. The Queensland Housing Commission has said to contractors in Brisbane, "" We cannot pay you until July"". In turn the contractors have gone to the merchants and said, "" We cannot pay you until July"". Therefore, there has not been a complete disclosure by the Queensland Housing Minister of the seriousness of the problem in Queensland at the present time. There is a general belief that information is usually gained from the press, but with two other Queensland members, and three representatives of the workers who were about to become unemployed, I went last had every opportunity to disclose to us the actual situation in Queensland. The facts which I have mentioned were not disclosed. This matter is the responsibility of the State seems a great pity that you have not found out the seriousness of your situation until the end of February and have been able to give the men only about eight days' notice of your intention to dismiss them. Surely you could have found out how the situation was developing last November or December, so that these men could have had at least a month in which to make other arrangements for employment"". For this reason, I put the blame entirely on the Queensland Government, and not even the honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds) or the honourable member for 1 Brisbane( Mr George Lawson) can deny the truth of what I have said. Nor can they genuinely deny that the blame must be laid upon the Queensland Government. 1 want now to say one or two things in relation to housing in another context. It seems strange to me that although the Labour party decided at a conference in Brisbane only a fortnight ago to do more to attract the immigrant vote, its representatives should come here and immediately try to knock the immigrant. How can they say on the one hand, "" We are going to make an appeal for the votes of immigrants "" and, on the other, "" Cut your immigration programme because of its effect on the housing problem "". I do not understand that line of thought. Immigrants have built more houses than they have occupied. In June. 1947, Australia had a population of 7,500,000. The housing shortage was then 250,000 homes. In June, 1956, the population was 9,500.000 and the shortage of homes was 115,000. Therefore, in the intervening nine years, we provided homes for the population increase and reduced the backlog, as at 1947, by 135,000 dwellings. In my opinion selective immigration has made a substantial contribution to this. We have not, except just after the war, when displaced persons had to be catered for, haphazardly brought people to this country. Immigrants have been selected with a view to the contribution they could make to the",30,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

The responsible for the fact that 400 men were retrenched in Queensland only a few days ago, because of the reduction of the funds made available for housing purposes. The honourable member for Petrie went on to talk about immigration and be challenged the attitude of the Opposition to this problem. The Australian Labour party can claim great credit for the fact that it initiated and instigated the greatest immigration programme known to the world. It was justifiably said of the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), in his speech the other night, that the honourable member for Melbourne will go down in. history as the man. who initiated, such a wonderful, humane, immigration programme. Of course, the Labour party is interested in the discharge of the great obligation which Australia and all the other countries in the new world have to alleviate the problems which exist in other parts of the world, where the war took such a dreadful toll of the people. Just as we initiated that programme, so we intend to do our utmost to maintain a constant flow of immigrants to Australia, but it is important that the Government should appreciate that Labour's attitude to immigration is associated with its great determination to ensure that economic stability will prevail in Australia. It is useless for the Government to continue the present rate of immigration when we know that to import immigrants is to import unemployment, or to import slumhousing conditions. Unless the Governit intends to bring to this country, but also to the large number of, so to speak, old desperately hard, particularly It is wrong, futile and useless for Government spokesmen to say that we on this side of the House are divided on the immigration question. We have set out our view very clearly, unlike the Government parties. There are several Government parties, and there is every indication that in the near future there will be more. As a united Opposition, we are unanimous in our attitude to immigration. An immigration programme was submitted to the Federal Parliamentary Labour party just before the Parliament went into recess. For the education of Government supporters, it would be as well to refer to it now. The preamble to the statement which came before the Federal Parliamentary Labour party, and which was endorsed unanimously, read as followsLabour is disturbed at the decline in the proportion -of new arrivals from the British Isles. There has been some mention of the attitude of the honourable member for Melbourne. Let it be said that he vigorously supported this programme. The statement continuedThis Executive expresses the gravest concern at the deterioration of the Australian economy which is vitally affecting the nation's capacity to absorb Surely this classic example of the Governmigrants at a rate consistent with developmental requirements and the welfare of the community. The Executive draws attention to the policy of the Labour party, which initiated the greatest influx of migrants known to this country. We also draw attention to the financial and economic policies of labour which enable migrants to be absorbed under conditions of full employment. Having regard to the foregoing and the problem of increasing unemployment, we state as follows:1. That migrant intake must be regulated so as not to impose undue strain upon the economy and lay insupportable burdens upon the States. .2. That immediate attention should be given to the unduly large proportion of semi-skilled and unskilled, migrants, which cannot be readily absorbed into industry. 3. We warn as to the growing national problem of migrant Australians competing with Australian workers in a situation where full employment is not the policy of the present Federal Government. There need be no speculation about the Opposition's attitude to the grave immigration problem. But we consider that immigration is inseparably associated with the censure voiced in the amendment, because there is great need for the Government to examine the immigration intake in the present situation, when the housing problem is so grave. Therefore, it was with considerable gratification that so many old and new Australians last Wednesday evening heard the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) propose the amendment, which constituted a dramatic censure motion. For thousands of old Australians, and many thousands of new Australians, the words, "" The Government is censured "", with which the amendment begins represented some kind of justice and retribution. No doubt this will have to suffice the people until the next elections are held. It was invigorating for people to listen to the attack upon the Government made by the Leader of the Opposition, and for them to appreciate that the Government is not going to get away with its complete disregard of the needs of the Australian people. Many people considered the fantastically absurd pronouncement made by the Prime Minister on 7th March last that adequate funds were available and that shortages of man-power and materials represented the housing bugbear, too irresponsible to be taken seriously. They have since learned that it is the Government's considered intention to give full effect to the Prime Minister's negative housing policy, and that as a consequence nothing will be done to alleviate the difficulties of the homeless and end their dilemma. ment's inability to serve the best interests of .the Australian people will solidify the rock upon which it must ultimately perish. Apparently, the Prime Minister does not even recognize that a crisis exists in the building industry.

He described the campaign as one of exaggeration. House since he spoke on 20th March. MrL . R. JOHNSON -He has not been in the House since, as the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) says.

60,Mr Ward,"He has not been in theThose of us who, during the last recess, took time to examine housing problems, are obsessed by a firm conviction that the Government is failing to serve the best interests of the Australian people. During the recess, 1 spend considerable time investigating the housing problems of people in my electorate, and as a member of the Australian Labour party's fact-finding committee, which Government supporters were invited to join if they wished, I was able to obtain first-hand information and advice hased on the experience of people whose job it is to know something about the building industry. I have been convinced that a human tragedy on a large scale is being perpetrated upon thousands of Australian families, and that as a direct consequence this Government stands indicted and condemned. The Hughes electorate, which I have the honour to represent, extends from Botany Bay south to Thirroul, on the northern outskirts of Wollongong. This electorate embraces a considerable part of Sydney's southern perimeter, and includes a number of suburbs in which much development has taken place in recent years. It contains the Sutherland Shire, which is the birthplace of Australia, and in which 1,681 homes were built last year. The rate of development in the shire is second only, to that in the municipality of Bankstown, which is part of the electorate represented by my colleague the honourable member for Reid( Mr in Australia. This represents 45 per cent, Morgan). If the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer) were to visit the Sutherland Shire, which is second in New South Wales in the rate of development, they could see in the Royal National Park something like 60 families, in which there are several hundred children, living in primitive conditions in tents, huts, In new areas around the perimeters of large and humpies made out of flattened-out kerosene tins. Many of these people see me about their problems from time to time, but I am unable to do much to help them because the finance available at the present time is so inadequate. In one busy morning during my regular interviewing period at Sutherland, twelve of fifteen people who interviewed me came about housing problems. I remember clearly the pathetic appeal of position. I should know something of their one mother who lives with five young problems, because I experienced them children in a one-room shack with an earth myself not very long ago. I had to build floor. This mother of five Australian-born my house the hard way. First, I had to boys and girls was becoming most concerned and agitated at the prospect of spending another winter in the shack, which has no garbage or sanitary services, and no water, gas, or electricity supply, lt lacks all the facilities which the vast majority of the constituents of Kooyong have probably come to take for granted. I was interviewed a fortnight ago by a widow who lives with five children in a caravan the walls of which are made of pressed-wood sheets. The ages of the children range from 21 to 11 years. The family is in. a tragic situation, which gives the lie direct to the Prime Minister's contention that there is no crisis in the building industry. This mother had been driven to desperation by the condition of her elevenyear-old son who had been discharged from hospital only the day before after treatment for glandular fever. She will be forced to spend another winter in the caravan, which is entirely lacking in amenities, hoping desperately that more housing funds will be provided and that her position will be alleviated. Her fruitless quest for housing finance gives the lie direct to any one who endeavours to detract from the censure to which the amendment gives effect. The sub-standard housing conditions evident in my electorate can hardly be justified in the light of the fact that in the last nine years 5,379 service stations have been built more than the number constructed in the preceding nine years, and I believe that it indicates the scale of values adopted by this Government and demonstrates that it prefers to give priority to the Liberal citadel of profit-making and excessive profiteering rather than to the welfare of human beings. capital cities and provincial cities where young families must necessarily make their homes, the incidence of inferior and substandard accommodation is unprecedently high. In my electorate, which, as I have mentioned, is developing rapidly, many families reside in beautiful homes which, though perhaps not up to the standard of those in staunch Liberal areas, leave nothing to be desired, but many thousands of young Australian couples are not in this happy join a long queue in the desperate fight for money. In my electorate, which is so typical of many on the outskirts of large capital cities, I see daily many people who have no prospect of obtaining finance and having a builder proceed methodically and economically with the construction of a home. Instead, they have first to buy a block of land, which may cost £800. They have then to construct a garage on the block, and in the process, they may spend perhaps £150 on prime cost items-com monly known as p.c. items-suc h as a stove and a bath, in the hope of using them later in the house they intend to build. They probably spend about £200 on furniture. Their total asset is then perhaps £1,200, but when they look for finance for the house their efTorts are of no avail, and the asset they have in the property is of no help. It is incredible that this Government should not only create that state of affairs but also that it should be prepared to condone it. It is an incredible and fascinating situation. The honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme) has been talking about immigration. When all is said and done, our best immigrants are Australian-born boys and girls, but there is no incentive for young couples these days to have large families. The wealth of young families is in their capacity to use their hands. They have a future against which we can surely stake some of the Commonwealth Government's surplus for the express purpose of enabling them to get on with the job of building their homes. The Labour party's fact-finding comdred; in 1954-55 there were 65,000; in mittee was a tremendous revelation. It is 1955-56 the figure fell alarmingly to 60,687, true that we had evidence from trade union and for the quarter ended December, 1956, representatives. The Government seems to it is estimated by the Commonwealth Statistake the view that to receive any guidance tician that the figure dropped to 60,062 from the trade union movement is to court houses under constructiona drop of ill repute. But in addition to trade union some 20,000 in thefive-yearperiod. representatives the committee on housing, which sat in Sydney under the leadership of the honourable member for East Sydney other than houses. In 1950-51 the figure and the honourable member for Parkes( Mr was £91,000,000 worth. Tn 1951-52 it was Haylen), was able to hear a large number of £125.000,000; Liberals, who spontaneously came forward £115,000,000; to give evidence. We had not only employee £133,000.000; representatives but also employer represen£171,000,000, and in 1955-56 it was tatives and they were all equally enthusiastic £220,000,000. Those figures indicate that in their endeavour to avail themselves of this Government is placing emphasis on the this opportunity to condemn the Governthings which are least important to the welment for its complete offhandedness. The federal secretary of the Building quarter ended September, 1956, the figure Workers Industrial Union gave evidence had risen to £233,897,000, while the value and pointed out that in the building industry to-day there were 12 per cent, to 15 per cent, unemployed. In 1951 he said we had reached the peak employment period when 126,483 workers were employed, but by September, 1956, the figure had dropped by 5,572, so that to-day we only had in the building industry 120,911 employees. This is a most regrettable circumstance, because there has been an increase in the population over that period. Rather than a decline in the home-building force, we could justifiably have expected an expansion. On top of those figures we must have regard to the fact that the £23,000,000 munitions factory under construction at St. Mary's has absorbed some 4,400 building employees. In the not-far-distant future, even having regard to the existing unemployment rate, those 4,400 employees will be thrown onto the industrial scrap heap. We are becoming very concerned as a Labour Opposition about the future of these men. Let us look at some of thefiguresassociated with housing. Let us look at the number of houses under construction today, compared with the last five years. These figures are official and come from the Commonwealth Statistician. They are contained in the "" Monthly Review of Business Statistics ""' and are vital. They show that in 1950-51 there were 80,000 homes under construction. In 1951-52 there were 82.000; in 1952-53 there were 69,000; in 1953-54 there were 59,000 and a few hunNow let us look at the value of buildings in 1952-53 it was in 1953-54 it was in 1954-55 it was fare of the Australian people. For the of houses under construction had risen by only £10,000,000 at the end ot the five-year period. Of course, there is inflation. The £1 is worth 6s. 8d. or 7s., so the real, value of the houses being built has deteriordate. Iimagine that human beings will ated to a very marked degree. How many houses are needed in Auslralia to-day? If we look, at the report of the Commonwealth Housing Commission, which accepted the bousing occupancy rate of 3.52 persons per dwelling, we get a basis for calculation. The present population is 9,427,000. On the basis of the commission's report we should have 2,678.000 houses. In 1945 we had 1,800,000 dwellings. ( Mr Lucock) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. Supply and Minister for Defence Production) [5.17] Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I think that everybody in the House will agree that although the Opposition did not intend it this way, its amendment to the motion for the adoption of the Address-inReply has been valuable in that it has promoted an interesting and informative debate on a subject of great national importance. I believe that from both sides of the House we have heard some good speeches. Not all the speeches have been good, but we have heard some good ones, which have helped to inform the Australian public on the matter of housing in this country. I would be the first to agree, and I think all my colleagues would, too, that the housing situation is a national problem. The Department of National Development quite recently published a report wbich has been commended highly in this Parliament-a t any rate I have heard it commended in the Senate by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator McKenna)-as an unbiased and informative document. That report tells us that something like 105,000 houses are needed in Australia at the present time in order that all families in this country may have homes of their own of an acceptable standard. The compilers of the report have, they admit, pitched their standard pretty high, but, nevertheless, for the purpose of our discussion to-day, I would like to accept the position that we need 105,000 houses. thousand, houses. thousand. I am speaking of the repon of the Department, of National Development, which places the figure at 105,000 as of this always demand better and better living conditions, but that does not enter into this housing question. We are concerned witb what we would hope to be built and occupied in Australia as a reasonable standard for the people-. Our housing problem arose, as we ail know, because of the cessation of building activity during the war years. Thus extra demands were made for housing in this country after the war. It is worth noting that whereas eight or nine years ago, shortly before this Government came into power; the figure was 250,000 houses needed, it has now been reduced under this Government to-105,000. That has not all been done by the Government. The reduction has been brought about to a very large measure by the people of Australia exercising a bit of initiative, making sacrifices, and working hard to ensure that they get a house for themselves according to the standard of their requirements. It has been done under a government which has provided conditions to enable it to be done. In broad terms, that is the answer given by the Government-and I hope to develop it in a moment on behalf of the Government-to -the censure motion which charges it with not having a national housing policy. I agree straight away that a shortage of houses is a great social problem. It produces irritation and frustration-eve n personal tragedy, and damage to family life. AH of us in this HouseI imagine that nobody would disagree-ar e completely aware of this problem, completely sympathetic towards those who are suffering under it and determined, within the limits of our power, to alleviate their difficulties as soon as possible. But housing is not the only problem. If it were the only problem, we could solve it immediately and without difficulty. This countrya young, developing country with limited resources and with great demands made upon those resources -is beset on every hand by problems similar to the problem of housing. built the St. Mary's project, plenty of houses could have been built.",34,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

Are we to concentrate all our resources upon suddenly solving the housing problem and neglect the pensioner? Are we to concentrate our resources upon housing and neglect the health and hospital needs of the community? Are we to concentrate all our resources upon housing and one or two other problems and neglect the needs of education? Everybody knows that those are also problems. They have to be fitted into the framework of our national life and solved gradually, as we can solve them. An interjection a moment ago referred to defence. Defence also creates an economic and nnancial problem. project be? country adequately equipped for defence? 1 know what the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) would say. He would leave this country wide open to people whom, 1 rather strongly suspect, he favours more than he favours many fellow Australians. Nevertheless,, defence is a problem. We must tackle what is undoubtedly a problem for the nation with due regard to the other calls upon our resources. One other aspect must be considered, and that is that the Commonwealth, in dealing with these problems, and with the problem of housing in particular, must use the tools that is a comparable figure. Turning to the are to its hands. Though it is true that, in the nnancial sense, the Commonwealth has adequate power to give assistance for housing, it is an indirect power. It is given through a section of the Constitution which enables the Commonwealth to grant money to the States upon conditions. But so far as direct power is concerned-and that, I take it, is what is aimed at in -the amendment to the motion-outsid e our own territories, repatriation, defence and matters of that sort, the Government does not possess direct constitutional power. That is why our predecessors in initiating the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, and we in following it, have had to use the indirect nnancial method of approach. What have we done? I shall outline what we have done, and in doing so I shall answer the charge that the Government has no national housing policy. First, apart from our obligations to our territories, we have a record that has never been equalled in the sphere of war service homes, which is a matter of direct legislative responsibility. In the past seven years, about £190,000,000 of the taxpayers' money has been supplied by the Commonwealth to build 91.000homes. That is a remarkable figure. Since the war, on war service homes and in finance under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, the Commonwealth, on behalf of the Australian taxpayer, has supplied no less than £500,000,000 for housing. Yet it is said that this Government has no housing policy. It is no wonder that we are proud to point to these things! My colleague, the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner), and my colleague, the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer), have pointed out that, compared with the great United States of AmericaI might say the fabulous United States-and also with the United Kingdom, last year this country had the highest rate of home building. Of the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, Australia came first. At the same time, in that year we had the lowest number of persons occupying each home unit. the respective population increases? no regard to the size of the United States compared with the size of this country. It amount of finance supplied, I shall give comparisons between 1949, the last year of Labour's term of office, and 1956, the last complete year of this Government's term of office. In 1949, tax reimbursements were £48,600,000. In 1956 we paid to the States £157,000.000. In 1949, no loan support was given by the Chifley Government; last year we gave £91,000,000 of loan support to the States. Sir Arthur Fadden -We gave the States the whole of the loan market. whole of the loan market. We stayed out of the market.

Under the war service homes scheme, in 1949, £8,600,000 was allowed by the Chifley Government; in 1956, £30,000,000 was allowed by the Menzies Government. Figures are not everything. Nobody would suggest that they are everything, but the allegation has been made that we have no housing policy. After all, when £500,000,000 has been invested in housing at the instance of the Commonwealth during the past eight or nine years-almos t all of it under this Government-ho w can it be said that there is no housing policy? I shall move from what the Commonwealth has done. It is a formidable record and one which obviously causes difficulty in the minds of honourable gentlemen opposite, as their interjections show. What have the States done? As I pointed out, this is obviously a matter of joint concern. We live under a federal constitution. We live under a constitution in which the great bulk of the power in matters of housing is in the hands of the States, not the Commonwealth. In this matter of State as well as Federal concern, we find that the records of the States vary quite dramatically. I shall take Western Australia as an illustration. Since 1947, there has been a 73 per cent, improvement in overtaking the housing lag in that State. Western Australia, by the way, has had by far the largest population increase of any State, and in this year of grace Western Australia has reduced the housing lag to the entirely manageable position in which only 4,000 houses are needed. When we turn to my own State of New South Wales, which has had by far the smallest population increase in the relevant period, there has been an improvement of only 43 per cent, in the housing position, and there is at present in New South Wales a shortage of 60,000 houses, more than twice the shortage existing in any other State in the Commonwealth. It is little wonder that this controversy that has been going on lately has had its root in the State of New South Wales. Far from this being a matter of Commonwealth responsibilityalthough this Government has done its best -if there must be criticism about the housing lag in New South Wales, then the blame lies entirely at the door of the Cahill Labour Oovernment of New South Wales. It is due mainly to two causes. The first is the quite grotesque and, as the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) said, scandalously high cost of building in New South Wales. It was pointed out in one press statement this morning that rail freights for timber from Grafton to Sydney have increased by 500 per cent, since 1947. It now costs more to bring timber from Grafton to Sydney than from Singapore to Sydney. At the same time royalties on timber in New South Wales have increased by 625 per cent. That is one cause of the housing lag in New South Wales, and that obviously is a matter of State concern. The second cause is the matter of tenancy control, which has been mentioned in this House again and again. I say only this about it: Before 1955, every dwelling house in New South Wales was subject to a form of tenancy control under which, with certain exceptions applying to only a few protected persons who are a diminishing class and have almost disappeared, one could not get a tenant out of a house in New South Wales unless one could find him alternative accommodation. The Cahill Government itself has recently acknowledged that it is scandalously wrong, and has changed the law with respect to houses built after 1954. Furthermore, when it comes to fixing rents in New South Wales, with respect to houses built before 1955 rents were fixed on the basis of 1939 valuations. There were some adjustments, but every fair-minded person will admit that, in fact, the rental returns to landlords in New South Wales whose houses have been occupied since before 1955 are unfair and inadequate. In fact, I had the opportunity on Sunday night of watching on television a session featuring Mr Cahill, the Premier of New South Wales. The session is known as "" Meet the Press "". Mr Cahill was bombarded with a series of questions about this very matter of tenancy and rent control, and he ended up by admitting that these controls were causing very great hardship to a very great number of citizens in New South Wales. Those were his words, as nearly as I can remember them. He said that his Government was going to have another look at it. Indeed, it had a look at it before, because recently it changed the Landlord and Tenant Act to provide that with respect to any house which was let or built after the beginning of 1955, it is possible for thc",38,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

73,Mr Beale,"What is wrong with it?landlord to exclude the provisions of the Landlord and Tenant Act to which 1 have referred. You can now let your house for any rent you like, so long as the tenant consents. You can now eject your tenant by giving him 30 days' notice, or some other appropriate amount of notice. If anything were needed to prove that the original tenancy arrangements operative prior to 1955 were unfair, it is the fact that the State government changed the law in that year. As a result, however, we now have the grotesque and unfair situation in which houses rented before 1955 are subject to rigid tenancy control, under which one cannot eject one's tenant except by almost an act of God, while houses rented since 1954 can be entirely excluded from tenancy control and from the restrictions on the right of ejectment.

That is just not true-and I effect that finance is not becoming availspeak as a member of the Government when able from that quarter, such criticism must I say two things. First, no directive has ever been given by the central bank to the private banks about housing loans. That is point number one. Secondly, there is nothing in current credit policy restricting the bank's powers to provide finance for housing within the limits of their investible funds. As proof of that statement, we have the fact that in Western Australia the housing problem has virtually been solved. Any instructions given to the banks are Australia-wide, and so, if such instructions had been given, they would obviously be reflected in bad conditions in Western Australia corresponding to the bad conditions in New South Wales. The fact is that there is nothing in credit policy restricting lending by the banks, and no such directions have been given. Everybody knows that for years there has been in operation a general request to the banks to exercise Quite obviously, there has been a temcause is that there has been a delay in New South Wales in the ratification of the last again be laid at the door of the Government which took its time about ratifying the agreement. Of course, another factor, which is a normal enough one, is that when the new savings banks were created a great deal of money flowed into them, some of which would otherwise have gone into the Commonwealth Bank. To that extent, the Commonwealth Bank was inhibited in increasing further the amount of its loans. But that also is about to be rectified. Order! The Minister's time has expired. This afternoon the Address-in-Reply debate has revolved round the addendum moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) and we have been treated to a pattern of evasions by four successive Government supporters. The honourable member for Lawson( Mr Failes), coming from New South Wales, said that the housing position was the fault of the New South Wales Government. He was followed in the same excuse by the honourable member for Mitchell( Mr Wheeler) and by no less a personage than the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale). The honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme) changed the theme slightly by saying, since he came from Queensland, that the housing crisis was due to the action of the Queensland Government. There were certain modifications of their favourite theme in each case. The honourable member for Lawson said that the worse feature of the activities of the New South Wales Government in respect of housing was its perpetuation of the Landlord and Tenant Act. He apparently is not as abreast of the law as is the Minister for scription. I am glad to see that the DiviSupply, who knows that in the last two and a quarter years anybody in New South Wales who wished to let a house which had previously not been let, or who wished to erect a house for the purpose of letting it, could do so, quite free of any restriction as to rent or eviction imposed by the Landlord and Tenant Act. The honourable member for Mitchell said, of course, that his own Government was to blame to the extent that the housing position would largely be cured if only the Commonwealth Bank were bifurcated. The honourable member for Petrie said that the Commonwealth at least had helped the position by the large influx of immigrant building workers, although he failed to point out that the content of building workers in recent years in the immigration field has declined and is declining at a more rapid rate. It is pleasant, in those circumstances, to go back to the initial speeches on the motion for the adoption of the Address-inReply, the maiden speeches of the honourable members for Barker and Wentworth. I confess that I had looked forward with some interest to hearing the honourable member for Barker. I had hitherto only been aware of his views on political matters from the fact that, as a lecturer in political science within the University of Adelaide, he had contributed an article on the South Australian State electoral system to the "" Australian Quarterly"". I thought that anybody who was interested in explaining the system was a man of some initiative, and that anybody who proceeded to justify it, as the honourable member did, was a man of very great courage indeed. I am sorry that since the honourable gentleman's transition to this chamber the co-educational content of the lectures in political science at the Adelaide University has very greatly declined. I am not blaming the Commonwealth Government for that, however. I also had looked forward to the advent of the honourable member for Wentworth. I suppose that if he had acquired a doctorate in philosophy he would have been known as an economist. Liberals who are not doctors of philosophy are known usually as accountants, but he designates himself as a banker, and I think there is something magnificent and mediaeval in such a desion of Wentworth is represented no longer by a Machiavelli, but by a Medici. The subject of housing was first dealt with on the Government side by the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies). He was not at his best, let us admit it. He was supercilious, as usual, but he was not even plausible on this occasion. The statistics he related compared the five years immediately after the war, the five years of economic rehabilitation, with the last five years. They ignored a 1.500.000 increase in population in the intervening years. They ignored the fact that Australia's population is growing very much more rapidly than is the population, proportionately, of any country of the",39,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

This debate has been prompted largely by the Prime Minister's remarks concerning a report on the housing situation prepared by the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner). Honourable members will have noticed, of course, that in recent years all matters dealing with housing have been transferred to another place. First, matters concerning the housing commissions and trusts in the States were transferred there. Last year, matters relating to war service homes also were transferred there. That is why, of course, we can never raise these matters on the debate on the motion for the adjournment, and why we can never ask questions without notice concerning them. This is the first opportunity we have had for more than six months to debate a very significant submonths so as to avoid any reference to ject, the most pressing personal problem in Australia. I must say that the Minister for National menced and completed, and the volume of Development varies his figures according to the number of houses which are produced from year to year. He has said, in this latest report, that Australia's housing need is somewhere between 50,000 and 55,000 houses a year, and he cites figures to show that this year we shall need only 51,500, and that in 1960 we shall need only 55,000. lt is interesting to recall that in August, 1954, he was saying that the nation's requirements of housing, to meet normal growth plus immigration at current levels, was about 60,000 houses a year. He has reduced his target in the last two and a half years. Six months ago he forecast that the decline in the rate of house building was only temporary. But we did not have to go to this report to realize that matter for the States and the building conthe housing position was bad. The Statistician keepsfiguresof the number of people employed in building houses and commercial buildings. He also keepsfiguresof the output of building materials. He does not keep, and it would be very difficult for him to keep, figures relating to the number of people who want houses. There can be no doubt as to the decline in buildings and in building materials. I quote what I believe to be the latest figures, contained in the "" Monthly Review of BusiDecember. 1 shall compare thefiguresin each case with the twelve months before. The number of houses commenced in the December quarter of 1955 was 17,970. in the December quarter ot last year it was 16,524. The number of houses completed fell, in the same year, from 17,407 to 17,036, and the number of houses under construction at the end of the respective quarters fell from 63,449 to 60,062. The latest figures in respect of the production of building materials, which are for November, 1956, show that the number of clay bricks produced fell from 77,900,000 in November, 1955, to 70,600,000 in November, 1956. The number of terra cotta roofing tiles produced fell from 6,101,000 to 4,959,000, and the production of cement roofing tiles from 4,971,000 to 3,724,000. The number of cement building sheets fell from 2,476,000 to 2,015,000. The production of domestic refrigerators fell from 34,814 to 23,726. I am comparing figures in corresponding seasonal fluctuations. There can be no question that the number of houses combuilding materials being produced, have drastically declined and are still declining. Reference has been made to the constitutional position. It is true that the Commonwealth can do nothing, in general, about housing, except as regards its own employees, the inhabitants of its Territories or ex-servicemen, other than to provide money. It cannot control, in any direct way, how the money is spent. If, as seems to be the case, there has been great exploitation in the sale and subdivision of land, that is a matter for the States which can exercise control over the sale of land. If we complain at the number of commercial buildings, such as service stations, being built, that again is a trols that they can exercise. If we believe, as everybody claims, that it would be cheaper to build houses in projects or groups, it is necessary to acquire or resume land in large lots, and we cannot do that except in respect of ex-servicemen, &c -and we have given that up now. But the States can do it. They can develop estates in that fashion.",41,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
76,Mr Aston,Tel l us about the reference,42,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
77,Mr Whitlam,"I cannot detect theWe canaot engage in town planning, but the States can. If we complain of the extra cost of housing caused by archaic local government provisions regarding ventilation, ceiling heights, the separation of kitchens and cial power that is required to complement laundries and other extravagant and outdated requirements, once again there is nothing we can do about it. It is a matter for the States. If we complain, as many government supporters have done, about the effect of rent control on the distribution of houses-that is, if we are prepared to have a 41 per cent, increase of rents in six months, as happened in Western Australia in 1954 when the Legislative Council of that State refused to extend rent control legislationonce again, that is something that we cannot do anything about. But the States can. If we complain about real property laws, if we point out that it is impossible to have horizontal mortgages in respect of home units-agai n we can do nothing about it. But the States can. If we complain about the royalties on timber, as the Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) did, and imply that we should hew down our forests and do nothing to replace them, again that is a matter for the States and not for us. There is, however, no feature of the housing problem which cannot, constitutionally, be solved by co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth. Normally, a house cannot be carried across a State border and, therefore, section 92 of the Constitution, which is the great impediment to Commonwealth and State co-operation in many respects, and which makes a legislative no-man's land in this country, does not apply to housing. By cooperation between the Commonwealth and States-admittedl y very difncult to achieve -it is possible to overcome all these constitutional difficulties. But if the Government still thinks it is inhibited by the Conacts that I have mentioned are valid-and stitution, let it avail itself of our offer to support the grant of a Commonwealth legislative power in respect of housing. The Government here is pleading the absence of a power the grant of which to this Parliament it opposed in 1944. In the same way, it so often pleads the absence of legislative power in regard to industrial matters, the grant of which it opposed in 1946, and the absence of power to deal with inflation, when it opposed in 1948 the grant of power to deal with prices and profits. If, as heretofore, home-building and home purchase have to be financed from taxation, as war service homes and Housing Commission houses are, or by banks and insurance companies, the Commonwealth has all the finanthe property powers of the States. There is no question that the Commonwealth Parliament's powers over insurance and banking are sufficient to enable it to direct banks and insurance companies to put all the money into housing which is necessary to meet fully the demand for houses. The Banking Act, by section 27, provides that the Commonwealth Bank can direct private trading banks as to the purpose for which advances may or may not be made. The Commonwealth Bank Act, by section 10, provides that where the Treasurer disapproves of the Commonwealth Bank's policy he can require the bank to alter its policy, so long as the Government takes the responsibility there for and a report is brought to this House. Now, on l l t h September last, 1 asked the Treasurer whether he disapproved of the policy of restricting loans for the erection and purchase of homes upon which the central bank and the trading banks have mutually agreed, as he had just told the honourable member for Phillip( Mr Aston). I asked whether, if that was so, he would exercise the powers under these two acts that I have mentioned to ask the Commonwealth Bank to alter the policy and, if the bank refused, would he direct the bank to do so. The Treasurer replied, "" I shall answer both questions, ' No *"". So he does not disapprove of the policy of the banks; accordingly, he will not reverse or modify the policy. If the banks are not lending enough money for housing that is unquestionably a responsibility of the Government. If these they have not been challenged-the n we can correct the position. At the beginning of last year, we saw the commencement of one of the most flagrant confidence tricks that has ever been played in this country. Three private trading banks were given licences to operate savings banks. The licences provided that, in respect of 30 per cent, of their deposits, the banks would consult the central bank and pay particular attention to loans for houses. But what has been the policy of these banks as regards loans for the purchase of houses? In January, these three private savings banks had £91,000,000 of depositors' funds. Far from lending 30 per cent, of that amount, as they agreed to do, they have not lent even 13 per cent. The New South Wales Savings Bank has announced that in the first year it will lend £6,000,000, over 80 per cent, of it to individuals and less than 20 per cent, to building societies. The Australia and New Zealand Savings Bank has announced that it will lend £5,000,000 in the first year. The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney has announced that it wiil lend £2,000,000. All those come to considerably less than half the 30 per cent, in respect of which they were required to consult the central bank in accordance with the terms of their licences. They have bluntly said that, until further notice, that is the amount they will lend. One does not know how much the Commonwealth Bank has lent, but it has still lent very conWe find that in this, the first year in which siderably despite the fact that over the year its deposits have increased, not by the £40,000,000 a year which was customary, but by only £4,000,000. It still kept up its advances for housing to somewhere about the £10,000,000 mark, although the figure used to be about £12,000,000. Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. suspended, 1 had pointed out that although Australia's population was growing proportionately more rapidly than that of any other country in the world, in the last twelve months the number of houses under construction, the quantity of building materials in use and the number of people employed in building houses had greatly fallen. 1 had also pointed out that the Commonwealth had complete control over the sources of finance whereby those materials ancl men could be. adequately employed. I now point out that, between July and December last, the trading banks had decreased their advances for housing by £7,400,000, and in the previous financial year by £11,100,000. They had, in fact, reduced their advances from £105,700,000 to £87,200,000 in eighteen months. I recalled that six months ago when I asked the Treasurer ( Sir Arthur Fadden) whether he disapproved of the banks' policy and would alter it, he said, "" No, I do not disapprove. I will not alter it"". I pointed out also that, a year ago, licences were given for the establishment of three private savings banks. Those banks now have deposits of £100,000,000. Under the terms of their charter they are required to advance 30 per cent -£30,000,000-for housing, but this year, instead of advancing £30,000,000, ihey have announced that tbey will advance £13,000,000. 1 come now to another aspect of building finance, the building societies. The building societies have been having an increasingly thin time of it in New South Wales and Victoria, the only two States where they have operated substantially in recent years. In this financial year, the New South Wales societies have received less than £6,000,000. Last year, the amount was £6,627,000, the year before £6,815,000, the year before £7,350,000, and the year before that £11,700,000-showin g a constant decline. In Victoria, ihe decline has been similar. money will bc made available for building societies in those States under the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement, the advances by the banks and by the life assurance and fire assurance societies are lower lhan they have ever been. In fact, there has been a noticeable decline in fhe contribution of life assurance societies ever since, in August. 1951, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) and the Treasurer discussed with the life assurance societies, here in the capital, publicfinancialquestions and investment policy generally. In the middle of 1951, the life assurance societies cut their advances to building societies to 10 per cent, of the former figure, and this year they are the lowest they have ever been. I would like to point out the contribution which increased interest rates have made to higher building society repayments. It will be recalled that when this Government came into office the interest rate to building societies was 32per cent. In July, 1952, the Government increased this to 4 i per cent. In March the Government increased it to 5 per cent. The difference which the greater interest rates alone have made is shown by the fact that if a man were to borrow, for a period of 30 years, the sum of £1,000 he would make monthly repayments of £4 14s. 2d. at an interest rate of 31 per cent., £5 ls. 8d. at 44per cent, and £5 7s. 6d. at the present rate of 5 per cent. I come now to the question of housing commission finance. All the money with",42,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
78,Mr Whitlam,"When the sitting waswhieh commission houses are built is provided by the Commonwealth Government. In.the peak year 1953-54 New South Wales received, ior housing commission houses, £12,450,000. In each of the next two years it received £10,800,000. This year it will receive £8,208,000. In Victoria the decline in the same three years has been from £12,000,000 to £10,800,000, and then £7,600,000. amounts have been £4.500,000, £3,600,000 and £2,770,000, respectively. The number of applications for housing commission homes has risen constantly. In South Australia during the last nnancial year there were 11,751 applications. In the previous year the number was 10,800 and in the year before that 9,807. ln Victoria, the number of applications has risen to 15,039 from 12,449 in the previous year and 10,089 in the year before that. Jn New South Wales there was, in fact, a decline last year to 13,228. In 1954-55 there were 15,628 applicants and in 1953-54 there were 14,175. That is a good indication of the demand for housing in Australia. -The war service homes position is shown by the fact that, in the last nnancial year, the total number of houses provided fell to 11,803 from 12,788 in the previous year. One can break these ngures down into all the different categories of war service homes assistance and in every case find that there was a drop. The number of applicants last year was 22,131. The only increase was in the waiting period, which is now two years between making an application and receiving the first instalment with which to build a house, and fifteen months between making an application and getting a loan to buy a house or discharge a mortgage. 1 conclude by referring to the immigration position, which was touched on by the honourable member for Petrie( Mr Hulme). I would draw his attention to the Temarks of Mr S. D. C. Kennedy, the building representative on the Commonwealth Immigraiion Planning Council, over which he presides. He said that immigration was recognized as a national issue, but that Australia's drive for new citizens could not possibly succeed unless housing was dealt with as a national matter. He addedAustralia is losing valuable citizens who return to their homelands because they cannot get homes in this country. We not only lose the people, but a!so the money it has cost to bring them here. We must find ways of holding them, particularly the skilled tradesmen, and there is no better way than helping them into homes of their own. mann) -Order! The honourable member's time has expired. listened with some interest to the GoverIn South Australia ihe nor-General's Speech in opening this Parliament last week and take this opportunity of congratulating the Government upon its record, as reflected in that Speech. When we consider the pressures that have been brought to bear against this Government by selfish interests and all the storms-cause d chiefly by political unionism-that it has had to ride out, we can gauge the extent of its success in guiding the economy of this country over the last six or seven years. However, 1 was disappointed at the absence of a challenging, forward-looking policy. I was disturbed because I believe that unless we have forward planning in this country the economy will remain in the present precarious state. The prime example of this hand-to-mouth planning is to be found in the policy of import restriction. To my mind, import restrictions create a topsy-turvy financial system. The truth is that our balance of payments position has occurred, not because we are buying too much, or wish to buy too much, from overseas but because we cannot sell enough overseas. To close the door against imports from other countries will only make the last position worse than the first, because there is a great deal of money in circulation in this community that otherwise would have gone overseas. That has led to the reckless expansion of manufacturing industries in the cities. It has created a spurious atmosphere of prosperity in the industrial centres and is making it harder than ever for us to export overseas to secure our balance of payments in the long run. I have somefiguresto indicate the extent of the damage that is being done by the policy of import restrictions. It has been estimated that we are keeping some £210,000.000 in this country which otherwise would have gone overseas. That £210.000,000 is being used by local manufacturers to jack up prices and to make it harder for our export industries to meet world parity with their commodities. That is an extremely dangerous policy to pursue.",44,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
79,Mr Deputy Speaker ( Mr Ader,,45,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
80,Mr Ian Allan (Gwydir) [8.7],"Iand the sooner we can get rid of import restrictions the better it will be for all of us in this country. When we consider the sale of our exports, we must consider only the great primary industries. No matter how much noise we make about the success of our manufactured goods in foreign markets, it does not take very much reflection to realize that in this country, where we have to import our fuel supplies, where we are net importers of base metals, and where we have such a very high cost structure, we cannot export manufactured goods against competition in the world's markets from low-cost countries such as Japan. Germany and, for that matter, Great Britain. In the long term, we must go back to our great primary industries. Wool, wheat and meat are our principal commodities and will remain the principal stays of our economy for many years to come. What are we doing in a positive sense to correct this adverse balance of payments? I believe we are doing so little that it makes Singapore to Sydney. That illustrates the no difference. We have no really concrete policy, apart from the negative one of giving taxation concessions to primary producers. We have no positive policy to stimulate the export of primary goods. There we have a paradox. We must depend, in the ultimate, on primary production for our security, our welfare and the maintenance of our standards in this country; yet we are doing virtually nothing to build up our exports of primary products. The tragic position of the primary industries is illustrated by the figures showing the estimates of national income. From the financial year 1948-49 to the financial year 1955-56, wages and salaries rose by 142 per cent.; the incomes of unincorporated businesses, professional people and so on rose by 130 per cent.; incomes from dividends rose by 130 per cent.; other personal incomes rose by 170 per cent.; but the income of farmers rose by a fractional 25 per cent. There is no reason to assume that primary producers are any different from other people in the community. Even cranks who style themselves democratic socialists believe in the profit motive. If we do not give the primary producer an adequate profit, we cannot expect him to produce. There will be no great development of our country if there is no profit in it. That is what is happening on the land. The land is stagnating. There are other factors which I would like to mention, apart from the general rise in costs, promoted by import restrictions, which make it virtually unprofitable to buy land and enter upon any kind of farming. First, there is the burden of freight costs. That is principally a political matter, because the railways in this country are controlled by the State governments. In the old days it was the country lines that were the developmental lines, and the city, to some extent, carried the country. Now the boot is on the other foot. The country is expected to carry the city. In New South Wales the metropolitan trams and buses lose something of the order of £5,000.000 a year. Who pays for that? Not the city dweller, but the country man. The Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) mentioned this afternoon that it costs more to bring a load of timber from the northcoast of New South Wales to Sydney than it does to bring a load of timber from extent of the burden imposed on the country man by railway freights. It affects, not only the primary producers who buy goods from and send goods to the cities, but all those men who are employed in country towns. The coal-miners in one town in my electorate recently worked out that it cost a man and his wife there at least 3s. a day more for the goods they had to buy than it cost the city people. That additional cost resulted from the charge imposed by the State-run railways. That illustrates the extent of the costs that the primary producer and those who work in the country have to bear. There is another cost besides freight. Discrimination is practiced by manufacturers and distributors of a great number of commodities against the country man. The basic price of the celebrated Holden car, for example, excluding freight, is about £6 higher in the country than in the city. The country man has to pay higher sales tax on it. That practice is widespread. The country man is hit to leg all the time by the discriminatory practices of manufacturers in the cities. Take the oil companies. In one town in my electorate, the town of Inverell, in which I live, we pay l i d . a gallon more for petrol than is paid in Brisbane. We pay 8d. a gallon more than is paid in Sydney, although it is well known that petrol can be landed in Inverell for less than 5d. a gallon in freight. Petrol is one of the main cost items in the farmer's list. Why should discrimination be practised on a scale such as that? City Labour members know nothing about conditions in the country and they care less. An additional factor, apart from the costs which the country man finds onerous and burdensome, is the policy of the banks. No one blames the banks for seeking the best possible markets for their money. They are business houses. But the fact is that, owing to a shortage of funds, they are unable to lend adequate amounts to the man on the land to allow him to develop the land properly. He is supposed to live off his own fat and, as I have shown, he has not much fat to live off in these days. Primary industry has been placed right at the end of the line, yet we depend on primary industry to keep the economy afloat. I suggest to the Government that it is high time we had some planning authority which would make sensible plans for the future to raise production and insure this country against the consequences of drought. If we had a drought on the scale of the drought which occurred at the end of the last war. we could lose up to £1,000,000,000 in the next ten years. We also need to insure against a falling off of production because the rabbit is returning. We must insure also because we cannot guarantee that we shall always receive the prices that we have received in recent years. It is true that this year we have had a bit of a rise. Because the country men worked like beavers and produced a great deal more to sell at a lower price, there has been a rise in the amount of foreign money coming into this country. But one swallow does not make a summer. We could easily go the other way next year if we had a drought or if the prices fell. I put it to the Government that we must have some plan now for the relaxation of import restrictions in order to reduce our cost structure, which should be brought down to world parity as quickly as possible. We must have some plan for the provision of developmental finance. That is not an insuperable problem. Developmental finance is provided on a small scale in a number of countries, and under various schemes it is done particularly in the United States of America and Canada. It is not new. I myself conducted a similar scheme on a very small scale with sugar-farmers years before World War II . What we want is the provision of money for developmental work, and supervision by a new kind of extension officer in order to get new work done. The mortgage department of the Commonwealth Trading Bank can lend up to only 70 per cent, of the value of the security. The maximum limit of loan and the conditions under which it may be made have not been changed since that department of the bank was established in 1943. lt is high time the Commonwealth Bank Act was amended in order to make' the mortgage department really a developmental agency. These problems are not insuperable. 1 would not endeavour to suggest a scheme in detail. I could not do it at the moment. But I believe that there will be very little real trouble so long as we are determined to solve the problem of opening up new land, and increasing the rate of pasture improvement, clearing, and soil, water, and fodder conservation. I am sure it can be done. If we continue at the present rate it will take us 1,000 years to develop Australia properly. We cannot afford to take so long to do the job, for the reason, if for no other, that although our population is increasing very rapidly, that of other countries to the north is increasing much more rapidly. We need to make Australia rich and strong, and our economy robust, and this means that we must undertake developmental work immediately. A programme of the kind that I envisage will cost money, of course. But everything worthwhile costs something. We are spending a great deal of money in our attempt to raise the living standards of the people of Asian countries and of other countries to our immediate north. This is a vain attempt, because the population of those countries is increasing much more rapidly than we are able to develop their resources. If we are spending so much money for that purpose, surely we could spend more to maintain standards in Australia. I ask the Government to give consideration to this question so that in the months to come we may develop a positive plan to overcome our economic difficulties, and T urge it to grasp the nettle firmly, and to give the people of Australia an inspiring and challenging plan for our counu-y's future development. ever a government misjudged public opinion on a matter of vital importance, this Government has now done so, because it has failed to understand the strength and vehemence of the feeling of the Australian people about its neglect of the housing problem. Labour has always considered housing to be of paramount importance. I remember saying in this House on a number of occasions over the years that one can give a man the best possible basic wage to enable him to buy all the food and clothes he needs, but that if he does not have a decent home to live in he will be an unhappy social being. If the Government fails in the future as it has done in the past to deal with the housing problem, it will sow the seeds for a new growth of communism. The people want homes. They are entitled to them, and this country is prosperous enough to see that every one that needs a home has one. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Lindsay) told us about some of the people in his electorate who live in fowlhouses. Victoria has a Liberal Premier, and the Commonwealth has a Liberal Prime Minister, and it ought to be possible for them to formulate a real plan to remove the necessity for people to live in fowlhouses. able member think are doing their best-the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), the Victorian Premier, or the unfortunate people who are living in fowlhouses? . The truth is that many people in Australia are at present living under sub-standard conditions. On 2lst February, 1952, I proposed a formal motion for the adjournment of the House, under the procedure that formerly operated, to discuss a definite matter of urgent public importanceThe failure of the Government to deal effectively with the question of housing. On 22nd September, 1955, Mr Nelson Lemmon, a fine gentleman who had been a very good Minister in the Labour government, and who was then the member for St. George, proposed a definite matter of urgent public importance for discussion, namelyThe decisions of the Government to recommend to the States increases in the interest rates of 300,000. The Prime Minister contents charged under the Commonwealth and States Housing Agreement, to recommend to the States the abolition of the rental rebate system, to recommend to the States reduction in the money allocated to the State Housing Commission, and the consequent undermining of confidence in the building industry. The honourable member for Bass( Mr Barnard), on 31st May of last year, submitted for discussion as a definite matter of urgent public importance the following subject:The urgent and vital necessity of additional homes and housing accommodation in Australia, and the serious social dangers threatening the nation as a result of the failure of the Commonwealth Government to deal effectively with the problem. So it can be seen that this problem has not suddenly arisen. It has been chronic for a long time, and it has now become acute. In the debate on my motion on 21st February, 1952, I quoted from a newspaper report which declaredThere are still 30,000 Melbourne dwellings without bathrooms, nearly 50,000 without sewerage, more than 22,000 without even running water. What was true of Melbourne at that time is probably largely true to-day. It is true, also, of Sydney and of many other places. It is idle for the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) to rely on a report which purports to state the exact position existing in Australia at the present time. He claimed that there is at present a backlag of 115,000 houses. The Commonwealth Housing Commission, which was appointed by the Labour Government in 1944, found that there was at that time a shortage of 300,000 houses. The Minister for Supply( Mr Beale) suggested this afternoon that the back-lag was only 105,000 houses. The honourable member for Yarra( Mr Cairns) very effectively demolished the Government's arguments when hc pointed out last Thursday that there was a back-lag of at least 300,000 homes, because the population had increased by more than 2,000,000 between 1947 and 1956. He said that this meant 630,000 homes to meet the needs of the population increase of 2,000,000 at an average of 3.55 persons to a house and he pointed out that, on the basis of 60,000 houses a year to meet the normal needs of those marrying each year, as stated by the Minister for National Development, we should need 120,000 houses a year for five years-60,00 0 a year to meet current needs and 60,000 a year to overtake the back-lag",45,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

83,Mr Calwell,"Who does the honorhimself with saying that we only need 52,000 houses a year, and yet the Dean of the faculty of architecture in the Sydney University, says we need 91,000 houses a year. The Government makes great play on the number of homes it provides for ex-servicemen. Last year, there were 34,000 ex-servicemen requiring homes. To-day, twelve years after the end of the war. there are 25,000 ex-service men and women who need houses and who cannot get them. They cannot get the finance to buy or to build a house under eighteen months or two years. Why? It is because of the Government. The war ended twelve years ago.

That can be read in ""Hansard "". Mr Harold Holt -He said we had doubled it. Labour and National Service need not try to anticipate me because I will come to that point. The Prime Minister did say that his Government had built twice as many houses as we had built. That is true, but it is still not good enough. This Government should have built twice as many as we built, because the last "" Monthly Review of Building Statistics"" for 1956 shows that whereas in 1949 152,000 people were employed in the building and construction industry, at the end of November, 1956, there were 217,000 persons so employed, a difference of 65,000. Mr Harold Holt -One-thir d of them were immigrants. such as the steel industry, 70 per cent, of the employees have been immigrants. I am not disagreeing on the facts. This is a matter of interpretation of the figures. We have 65,000 more people employed in building to-day than we had in 1949, but obviously should be employing more people. We have to get more houses. There can be no doubt about that. I do not disagree with the principle stated by the Prime Minister-""The limitation on the housing programme in Australia is the limitation of man-power and the limitation of materials"". That is completely right as a principle but where the Prime Minister went wrong is when he took advice from his experts that there is a shortage of man-power and materials in Australia. All the advice on that matter from the employers in the building indusiry and from the leaders of the trade unions in the building industry ridicules that claim. Government supporters may conThere are no such shortages. I think the Prime Minister was right again when he the limit of materials money ought to be available to combine in doing a job for the home-loving people of Australia"". We could not agree more. What is physically possible is financially possible. That has always been our political creed; but what this Government has failed to do is to provide a ""financial policy that will enable the home-loving people of Australia to buy or rent the houses they so urgently need. The failure of the Menzies' Government goes even further than that: Fewer houses are being built this financial year than last year. The evidence about that is contained in issue No. 51 of "" Facts& Figures"", which is a Government publication. On page 52 the story of housing and building shows that the Chifley Government commenced approximately 58,000 houses in 1949. The succeeding Government built up to something over 84,000 houses in 1951-52, but since that time the number of houses being built each year has fallen. Why has it fallen? The population is increasing all the time. One would have imagined that if it was possible to build 84,000 houses a year in 1951-52, when there were greater shortages than there are to-day, it would be possible to build 120,000 houses a year now. We should be building to supply the needs of the Australian people who are marrying each year. We ought to be able to build 20,000 houses each year to give immigrants the houses they need and then we ought to be building beyond that figure for those who are to come in subsequent years when the immigrauon plan unfolds",48,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

87,Mr Calwell,"In some industriesand further develops. If we do not do that we shall run into a chronic problem and we shall run into it very soon. The professor whom I quoted a moment ago pointed out that unless we do these very things we will be in grave difficulties. The private trading banks are lending less for home-building this year than for some years past, although the demand for homes is growing year by year as our population increases and as old and sub-standard houses are being demolished. It is a paradox that the process of demolition of such houses is now proceeding at a very slow rate; but if it is speeded up, more new homes will be required. There are sub-standard houses at many places in Australia and it is the duty of the Government to see that something is done about them and done very quickly. The Opposition has always felt that housAustralian people and take profits at ing is our No. 1 problem. There is no other comparable problem. If we cannot build houses we shall be in grave difficulties trouble. They should help the Australian with a lot of people. The agents of the private trading banks are importuning Ministers in the Parliament and outside it, day after day urging that the Chifley Government legislation be mutilated further and that the Commonwealth Bank shall be turned into a bankers' bank, as it was in the days of the Bruce-Page Government. The private trading banks have themselves failed to supply the finance which the Australian Government and the people need in order that the work of housing can be carried out. The Prime Minister the other night said that trading banks had reduced their lending, not under the directive of the Commonwealth Bank or the Commonwealth Government, but because housing loans were not attractive to trading banks. Obviously the banks can make more profit through their hire-purchase subsidiaries. They can make more profit by lending to businesses that are already making huge profits. Nobody can deny that industry has had a prosperous era under the Menzies' Government. The extent to which the private trading banks have failed the people of Australia is illustrated by the fact that in the six months ended 31st December last, the Australian trading banks lent £7.400,000 less for home-construction than they had lent previously. savings bank sections lend? trading banks. things. thing in the mind of the honourable member who is one of the representatives of the trading banks in this chamber. To the extent that the trading banks have been able to take savings bank deposits from the Commonwealth Bank and the State savings banks, they have lent something, but overall their figures are £7,400,000 down on loans in the six months ended 31st December last, and over a period of eighteen months to December of last year their figures are down £18,500,000. What do the trading banks want? They only want to make profits all the time. If they are going to neglect the interests of the luxurious rates of interest, they are asking for nationalization. They are looking for people if they have any thought for their future security. I would be quite satisfied to settle on the 1945 Banking Act, but all these interferences and projected interferences with the banking legislation and all the denials of financial assistance to people who want homes will eventually bring a nemesis to those responsible. We have asked for a national housing plan. We recognize that it is not the Australian Government alone that has a responsibility in this matter. In a federation, the States have certain powers, and they also have certain duties and responsibilities. The Commonwealth also has powers, duties and responsibilities. I well remember the attacks made on the Chifley Government because of its alleged failure to do the things that were required to be done. State Premiers and Liberal and Country party members said that the Chifley Government was starving the States of funds for housing. If those complaints were in any way justified, thc indictment against the present Government is a thousand times stronger! But that docs not absolve the States from their responsibilities. Under the terms of the Constitution it is the duty of the Commonwealth to raise the loans, which State governments require for housing and for public works. But it is also the duty of which directs the banks, where necessary,",49,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

92,Mr Calwell,"Precisely .of the Australian way of life as those who can boast an Australian lineage that extends back for four or five generations. It is all very well for the Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner) to put out a press story and say, "" End of housing shortage in sight "". The end of the housing shortage is not in sight. It is worse to-day than it has been for quite a number of years past. It will continue to be as bad as it is now unless the Government sets out to secure the co-operation of the States and the States in turn co-operate fully and readily on a plan to build at least 120,000 houses a year. The learned professor in Sydney says that at least 20,000 more houses than the Governinent postulates are necessary. But that is still 30,000 houses a year fewer than the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Curtin) has shown in his ngures -and he has argued his case very ably and very logically-and the figure which we put forward in 1952 as the figure required. I admire the dexterity of some honourable gentlemen opposite. One of them did not mention housing at all. He talked about a national roads plan, so satisfied was he that of Australia. the Government had no case and that he could not defend it. Other honourable members opposite, including Ministers, have said campaign, in the November-December as little as they could about the question of housing and, if they have praised the Government, they have done it with bated breath.

A motion of censureand that is what the amendment of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) amounts to-is the heaviest weapon that Her Majesty's Opposition can employ against a government in office. Traditionally, it conveys that the Opposition invites the Parliament to dismiss the Government and replace it with a government drawn from the ranks of the Opposition. The Opposition attack, on this occasion, has been directed to this Government for its record on housing. The Parliament will. I am confident, reject the motion for two completely compelling reasons. The first is that this Government, as has been made evident during tie debate, has an incomparable record l relation to Australian t home building, lt is a record that thc Government is determined to sustain. In fact, a great deal of the time of the Menzies Fadden Administration, since it took otfice in 1949, has been devoted to the housing problem. We have, as everybody knows, oniy a limited power to deal with this matter, since housing primarily remains the responsibility of the States. The Government has for a long time past, quite voluntarily undertaken to help the States, year by year, by allocating large amounts to the States out of our annual loan programme. These annual loan moneys have, during our term of office, been heavily supported by funds out of the Commonwealth budget, including large sums from taxation provided by the people. In the result, the Commonwealth Government has been finding practically all the money that the States spend on housing. It has been providing roughly one-third of the total amount spent on homes throughout the length and breadth When we last had a general election period of 1955, the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) dealt specifically with housing in his policy speecn, a speech which, apparently from their votes, the people of this country approved, because they gave us a record majority in this place. The Prime Minister pointed out that in the five postwar years of the federal Labour government, 202,000 houses and flats were completed in Australia. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), has just conceded these figures. The Prime Minister said freely that this was a good record, since it was at least equal to anything done in the best years before the war. But he went on lo point out that in our first five years of office, after 1949, 388,000 houses and flats were completed. That is almost double the number completed during the previousfiveyears when the present Opposition was in government. This was a record unsurpassed anywhere in the world, when considered on the basis of population numbers.

I shall refer to the United States of America and the United Kingdom, highly developed and highly industrialized countries. In the last completed nnancial year, 1955-56, the United Kingdom built 6.4 homes per thousand of population. The United States of America built eight homes per thousand of population. Australia exceeded the United States record by building 8.4 thousand. I question whether any country, except, perhaps, New Zealand, which also has the benent of a Liberal government, has constructed more homes proportionately to the number of its people, or has fewer persons per occupied dwelling, than has Australia, ls that a record which invites censure and displacement of the Government? I should have thought that it wiis a record of which we. as a people, would have been justly proud. This does not mean that either we, as a government or as a people, should rest upon our past achievements. Not only will it take a few more years before the accumulated arrears, largely caused by the war, have been cleared up, but thereafter, as our population grows-and I hope that it will grow at a rapid rate-and as living standards rise, as I am confident they will under this Government, there will be a constant and high demand for houses. A person in one home will, perhaps, want a better and a bigger one, and it will be part of our responsibility to assist him in his very desirable objective. This is as it should common knowledge, into many pieces. The be. As the Prime Minister said in the Parliament only the other evening, the foundation of our society is the home, and if all are to have homes, then we need more houses. Without labouring the point which has been dealt with effectively by other speakers on our side of the Parliament, I say this with the full authority of the Government: Assuming the maintenance of satisfactory levels of employment generally, and in the building industry in particular, the central bank's policy will continue to aim at ensuring that a reasonable proportion of increased savings in Australia becomes available for investment in housing and is employed in housing loans. The Government will form the best judgment that it can. not only from the best official advice it can secure, but also from the best expert advice that it can secure from any quarter, as to the level of home building sustain. I can give an assurance on the part of the Government that if at any time it seems to us that there are resources available for home building which have not been taken up, we shall give speedy consideration to any further central bank action necessary to take up that slack. In short, housing will continue to be regarded by us as the greatest human problem with which we have to deal. That is the first compelling reason why this amendment shouid be rejected. But the second is, perhaps, of even more consequence to the people of Australia at the present time. I said a little earlier that the purpose of a censure motion is to invite the Parliament to dismiss the Government and replace it with one drawn from the Opposition ranks. It is unthinkable that a people who have been able to assess, over recent years, developments within the Australian Labour party and the capacity of the Opposition to form an alternative government, would entrust the right honourable member for Barton (Dr. Evatt) and those who sit with him with the reins of office in Australia. Never, I suggest, Mr Speaker, in the long history of parliamentary government has there ever been a political party in worse plight to claim the right to govern a free, democratic people than the Australian Labour party has shown itself to be over recent years.

The industrial movement also reflects these divisions. Left wing militants, industrial groupers, right order to hold his place in the team has had wing Labour men and Communists are all to be found striving for supremacy, one against the other, inside what is ironically described these days as the Labour movement. There is certainly plenty of movement in what is called the Labour movement, but it is the movement of the atom splitting its particles in a number of quite undiscernible directions. Labour's divisions do not stop at its own borders. The battle rages inside as well. We have recently been treated to some bitter exchanges between the Australian Workers Union, the largest numerically in the Commonwealth, and the Australian Council of Trades Unions. Perhaps Mr on inside the party, but one wonders Dougherty is a sympton of the division inside the Labour party. These men to whom I refer are all inside the officially recognized Australian Labour party. We find Mr( Mr Stewart) brought out of the caucus Dougherty, the president of this, the largest union, at one time attacking Mr Cahill and his Government and calling them a lot of no-hopers. The next time we find him attacking Mr Monk, the president of the Australian Council of Trades Unions. In the next breath we find him attacking Mr split with these deep and bitter divisions Campbell, the New South Wales president of the Australian Labour party, and then finally, apparently in his latest outburst he is attacking Mr Chamberlain, the federal president of the party. That is symptomatic of what is going on inside the movement. Already, in the State of Victoria, some twenty parliamentarians from the Labour party, formerly welcome members of the movement, including former Cabinet Ministers and Federal and State members-seve n of them from this place-hav e received their political execution, or are marked for the axe as soon as it can be effectively brought into use. But Victoria is not the only State where these divisions have gone so deep. One has only to look at the predicament of Mr Gair, the Labour Premier of Queensland, and of Mr Cahill, the Labour Premier of New South Wales, to realize how uneasy are the associations inside the official Australian Labour party. The honourable member for Reid( Mr Morgan) is pressing for an inquiry into the way in which the party conducts itself in New Soulh Wales. The honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell), who is the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and a stalwart of the Australian Labour party, in to surrender one of the most cherished and prized policy undertakings of his political lifetime-hi s attitude to immigration. I am saddened to think that a man who has given so much of his life and his effort to that subject should have surrendered so speedily to the pressures inside his party on what should have been for him a vital matter of policy. Opposition members interjecting, honourable members opposite all want a turn, and it is hard to think of some one on the other side about whom I could hot say something. I do not know all that goes what thoughts the honourable members fbr Grayndler ( Mr Daly), Macquarie ( Mr Luchetti), Dalley( Mr O'Connor) and Lang room discussions after listening to what has been put up as the new look of the Labour party in this country. This is a rabble, Mr Speaker, split not only in'o the three defined groups I have mentioned, but also, inside the Australian Labour party, that force themselves into the press of this country almost every day. This is. the rabble which invites the country to displace a government which has given Australia the seven most prosperous and progressive years of its history in order to make way for a government drawn from that side of the House.",53,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

105,Mr Harold Holt,"Well, it is not anmore comfort. 1 direct the attention of the House not only to what was adopted, and that was important enough, but also to an analysis of the resolution which came forward from the Victorian delegation. Let it be realized that this was not some outer branch of the State organization of the Labour party. This was the Victorian delegation, in attendance at the most important policy-making conference that the Labour party can hold. And this is what that delegation included in its proposals: The achievement of socialism by industrial action; the growth of nationalized industries by boards, upon which the workers and the community shall have representation; the establishment of an elective supreme economic council by all nationalized industries; that all parliamentary representatives be required to function as active propagandists of the objective and methods of he movement and the nationalization of banking and all principal industries. Victoria went even further in another motion which said that "" capitalism could be abolished only by the workers uniting in one class-conscious economic organization "". There were other proposals which, if time permitted, I should like to mention, and I hope that at a later stage in the life of this Cosgrove. They are middle-rof-the-roaders Parliament I shall be able to elaborate on the developments which occurred at that conference in the foreign policy field and in the economic field. In the meantime, I invite all section of the House, and of the people, to make a careful study of the publicists for the Labour party in these days. The Victorian resolutions were symptomatic of what is going on. The publications of Dr. John Burton are significant in relation to what is going on. Honourable members opposite will not laugh him off. No honourable member in this House will laugh him off, because it was honourable members opposite who made Dr. John Burton permanent head of the vital Department of External Affairs. It was the Labour party which endorsed him as one of its candidates in a federal election. I say that what he has published in his very interesting and informative pamphlets is the most honest and most clearly expressed statement of Labour policy and planning ever put forward in this country. Let us also examine what Professor Arndt wrote in his Chifley Memorial Lecture, which he was invited to give by a branch of the Labour party in Victoria. If all these things do not hang together in a programme, a highly significant programme, which should be carefully studied by all the people of this country, then these people have no right to enjoy the standards which they would hope to possess under free, democratic, parUamentary government in Australia. 1 shall have time to give only one or two short quotations from Dr. Burton. That gentleman pointed out in his latest book, "" The Labour Party in Transition"", that the Labour party's objective of democratic socialism clearly implied fundamental changes in the economy and in our social life. I do not know how many people want fundamental changes in our economy and our social life but, so far as he is concerned, the Labour party will give them to the people. Time is running against me and there is much that I would like to'tell the House of these policies which have been so clearly and cogently put before us by the Labour party's most articulate spokesman. Here we have in this latest publication, ""Labour in Transition "", the statement thai we are to have democratic socialism-no t the socialism of Mr Cahill, Mr Gair, or Mr who are being swept into the ditch. Those other gentlemen have taken their position firmly on the left. "" The Light Grows Brighter"" is another Burton pamphlet on socialism. It is not the green light for safety that symbolizes liberal progress in this country. It is not even the amber light for caution which governs the faltering steps of Cahill, Gair and Cosgrove. (t is the red light, the traditional colour of socialism, the established colour of communism, the universally recognized colour for danger. That is what honourable gentlemen mean by democratic socialism and "" new look "" Labour. Leader of the House( Mr Harold Holt) in his new capacity has made a very bad start with this statement, which he began by saying that housing is a human problem. Then he completely deserted that tack for a diatribe against the Labour .party. He knows perfectly well, even if he had kept to his brief, that the Government's case is indefensible. He should remember that the Labour party is not on trial. The question that we are debating at the moment is:",55,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
106,Mr Haylen (Parkes) [9.14],"Th eWhat has the Government of the day done in .regard to housing the people of Australia? I should like to bring the Minister back to that. His was a hysterical outburst full of all the nonsense you read about, but it had no basis and certainly had no relation whatsoever to the debate which we are waging here to-night. I support the Opposition's amendment to the Address-in-Reply in relation to the housing problem, and I would bring the Minister back to the statement of his own leader, the most fatuous, stupid and completely un-understandable statement ever made by a leader of any party in this counother institutions to get themselves housed. try. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) made that statement in reply to questions by the press concerning housing. He said, "" I admit no crisis. I admit no slump "". Earlier, on 7th March, when the housing problem was referred to him by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt), he said, "" The problem is not a question of finance, but of man-power and materials "". In the land of egg-heads he has laid the largest egg in captivity. He has been out of this House, and not prepared to debate the matter, because he is so at variance and out want to make any exaggerations. We do of touch with the problems of the Australian people. The Menzies statement, the Spooner statement, the Cramer statement completely indicate that the Government has lost all touch with reality and with the problems that face the Australian community. The Prime Minister says, talking off the cuff in one of those statements for which he is notorious, that there are not any problems of finance, that the problem is man-power and' material. That has become almost as' much a bromide as was his statement that he would put value back into the f l . The support for our contentions is comin3 from the Liberal party on the other side of the House and from the Liberal party outside the Parliament. It comes from people like the Liberal president of the Building Industry Congress, from the Liberal Minister for Housing in Victoria and from other representative Liberals who say that the Prime Minister is wrong. Why has the Leader of the House kept away from the subject of the housing problem and given us a serious lecture on where Labour is going and why? What has that to do with this debate? If1 were the Speaker, I say with all humility, long can one live in an ivory tower? HowI should have ruled him out of order because he was never on the ball at any stage of his remarks. The Prime Minister's statement is notorious and does not require reiteration. He said, "" I admit no crisis. I admit no slump"". The Minister for National Development (Senator Spooner), in another place, was pleased to be amused at the activities of the Labour party in appointing a fact-finding committee. We found it was imperative for us to meet ordinary people who are unhoused, dismayed at the future, and see no hope from the banks or They came to us quite frankly, and on a non-political basis, and the members of the committee, with the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) as chairman, heard their stories-and we heard plenty. Never mind what this House has heard about the housing problem. It is what the people outside feel about it that matters. And if the answer of the Government and the answer of high finance to the problem of housing is the fowl'iouse we think it is an unutterably tragic situation. We do not not want to over-state the case because the basic facts of the case are overwhelmingly in favour of the proposition that we put. In Sydney"" Truth"" last Sunday appeared the following statement under the heading of "" No Exaggeration "":Truth this week found a family of nine living in a disused fowlhouse at Berowra. They pay £2 a week rent for the fowlhnuse. They wou!d not give their names to Truth because they, were frightened they would be evicted. Perhaps the original holders, that grand old English breed, the Buff Orr>in""tons. wanted to get their home back. Surely the Minister, who has spent 25 minutes denouncing the Labour party, if he has any instincts of decency ought to be worried about the housing problem. We have stated over and over again, until it is boring even us. what the position is in this country. That position has been amplified by one speaker after another from this side of the House during this debate, which has lasted over a week. We say that 300.000 homes are required in this community to catch up the lag and meet the current demand. We say that 70.000 houses are needed each year; yet the Prime Minister says. "" I admit no crisis. This exaggeration csn be ignored "". How long can one forget the demands of the Australian people to be housed according to civilized standards? The Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt), who ought to know better, gives us a diatribe about Labour's difficulties. It is the Government that is in difficulty, and he should know it better than we. We need 300,000 homes in all, and 70,000 a year, but what are we building? In 1955, the peak year, this Government built 78,299 homes. In 1956 it built 69,909 homes. There has been a drop of nearly 10 per cent. If that persists the housing crisis will be not a crisis but chaos. The Government should consider that fact. It cannot get away from the facts in this matter. Added to the accentuation of this problem is the insane attitude to immigration of the Minister for Labour and National Service. How in the name of God, or in sweet reasonableness, can we provide for the Australians who are already resident in this country if we keep pushing in 115,000 new Australians each year? There has not been a more loyal advocate of immigration than myself. Under the Chifley Government I was chairman of the Commonwealth Immigration Council. I was sent abroad to study the position and I do not idly destroy the principle of migraumpteen thousand empty or near empty tion; but I would not stand by and see the old Australian displaced from his home. Nor would I see the new Australian fooled about the prospects in this country. That is what the Minister has to consider, not some sort of by and large devotion to immigration. It is not a sacred cow. If it does not bring the productivity that we need, where must it end? The Minister, realizing this, baled out of his portfolio and "" You have a lot of spare room here; you gave it to a junior. Now it is being run by apprentices and nothing comes of it. On the one hand we have the impelling knows how completely ridiculous and wrong and urgent needs of Australians for homes, that is. and on the other the insolence, arrogance and stupidity of the Prime Minister, as well wanted to force the spinsters to take in as an attack from the Minister for Labour boarders. and National Service on what Labour is doing. Labour is bringing the Government back to a realization of what politics really cause he has a key-money mind he is thinkmeans. It is an established principle that ing, "" What a lovely lot of double housing the urgent needs of the people should be units we can have. Where one house was looked after. ber tories ( Mr Hasluck) would be better employed looking after his aborigines. He has a rotten history in that regard. He should have a look at the starving, sun-blinded natives of the Warburton Ranges, and do something about his own portfolio. We demand homes for the Australian people and we will not be content to listen to any sophistry from the Government. Its leading protagonist to-night decided to spend his time talking about the future of Labour instead of homes for the Australian people. It was a complete dereliction of duty. Behind the Prime Minister stands a fearful group of followers. When he says a word on banking or anything else, they obey meekly. We know exactly where they stand. The operative statement of government policy on housing is that of the Prime Minister. What the Minister for the Army( Mr Cramer) or any other Minister says is unimportant. The Prime Minister said "" I. admit no crisis. I admit no slump "". We think that he is completely wrong. The Minister for the Army is the most fantastic character outside of a Disney film. The other night he said that there were homes in Australia, in the crowded cities especially, and that we ought to fill them. I thought that this sort of talk was communism. I thought that it was red work. Does the Government intend to take all the unhoused people in the electorates of East Sydney, Watson and Dalley to Vaucluse, Pymble, Wahroonga and other s.;ch salubrious suburbs and say to the inhabitants, must fit these people in "". Is the Government going to do a house-rationing job in the community? Of course, every one before we can now have two "". The whole thing is completely wicked.

110,Mr Haylen,"Not only that, but beHillcrest-avenue, because her husband has died and her son, who was previously at the war, has married and gone to live in another suburb. Are we to believe that she, sitting with her aspidistras, and knitting a sock for the Red Cross, is the villain of the housing crisis? How utterly absurd and ridiculous that is, and the Minister knows it! This Minister for sub-division is completely confused by his attempts to make two houses sprout where one grew before. The only way to do that is to find finance for housing, and have a plan. But this Government has no plan. Member after member from the Government side of the House talks about what has happened, and produces statistics. But this is not a statistical debate. If ever a debate were on a human subject it is this one. What does the Government intend to do for all the people who are crowded into emergency housing? What does it intend to do for people who, eleven years after the war, are still living with their in-laws? What does it intend to do for the people who are in fowl houses? It has been established that there are such people. The statement on housing that the Prime Minister heaved off his chest was the worse boner that has ever been heard in this House. Labour was proud to have a factfinding committee under the impartial chairmanship of the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward). The Liberal party was so worried about it that it sent along a stooge. I personally examined him and when he left he said, "" Mr Haylen, you are an awfully charming fellow but I think that what you told me is perfectly right"". The Prime Minister had told us that it was a question of man-power and materials but we refuted that, and that is why the Government did not like our fact-finding inquiry. There is nothing wrong with a group of parliamentarians, or any citizens, ascertaining facts. Indeed, there is too much whimsy in this House and Labour wants to replace it with fact. We found out that there were 80,000,000 super, feet of timber at grass and 50.000.000 bricks and a similar quantity of tiles waiting to be used. We found that there was this frightening stockpile of bath heaters, sinks and P.C. items, to which the Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) has already referred. We found that unemployment in the building industry was between 5 per cent, and 12 per cent. How then could the Prime Minister's statement have any validity? It was the greatest joke in history, and showed him up in all his isolation. The press was kind enough to talk about his being in an ivory tower. He was not even in that, but rather in a state of mental relapse, when he made the statement, because obviously there are men wanting work, and there are resources waiting to be used in the building industry, but this has been prevented by the financial policy of this Government. Then came the sneer. The Prime Minister is noted for the sneer, but not for performance. He saidTt is not surprising that if one sets out to have a judicial inquiry designed entirely to produce a result one should get thnt result. Was he thinking of the Petrov Commission? That is the only judicial inquiry that I have seen since I have been in this House that has deliberately set out to reach a certain decision, and has done so. Ours was not a judicial inquiry. It was an inquiry by a group of Labour men, representing half a million voters in the electorates most concerned by the housing shortage. We sat down to find a formula, and to find a reason for it all. Was there anything wrong in that? I think that the public of Australia will concede that we did a good job, and that it is not we who have to make out a case in defence. It has been made by the Liberals against the Government of the day. I will give examples from three States. We had a witness before us, called Mr Kraagen. He is the manager of the New South Wales Sawmillers Association. He does not want all the timber resources of this country to go by the board. On Saturday last, in the "" Daily Teleeraph"", he issued a challenge to the Prime Minister to come into New South Wales, where the crisis is deepest, and said that he would show him 83 timber mills closed. 80.000,000 super, feet of timber at grass, and 500 unemployed timber workers. In view of those facts, will the right honourable member tell me how man-power and resources can be said to be lacking? Let us deal with Queensland. Remember what happened last week! In t^e gallery of this chamber were six members of a Queensland union who came to plead their cause for a job, and a job only. They were employees of the Queensland Housing Commission. They said that if the Government did not change its policy, did not find some money and did not put more blood into the economic bloodstream of the country, they would be dismissed. I was touched by their case. They interviewed a Minister, without result. This is what happened. It is in cold print. This item, which is also from the "" Daily Telegraph "", reads as follows:Brisbane, Fri -The Qld. Housing Commission have an alternative. The Labour party to-day dismissed 452 men working on housing projects in the Brisbane suburbs of Zillmere, definitely has an alternative.

The honourable member for Parkes said that representatives of the building industry came to Canberra and endeavoured to obtain finance in order to avoid the dismissal of approximately 400 men. union expense. There may be a subtle difference, and 1 think it is certainly a significant one. I appeal to the Government this evening to make £300,000 available to Queensland, not for the sake of the Queensland Government, but for the sake of the 400 men concerned. I make that appeal on the understanding that the allocation be contingent on the Queensland Government's agreeing to the appointment of a royal commission to investigate all the affairs arid methods of the Queensland Housing Commission. I make six charges against the Queensland Government concerning housing. I charge it, first, with bungling in its budgeting. I charge it, secondly, with gross carelessness, and, thirdly, with inefficiency in administration. My colleague, the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Wight), has for some time been trying to establish publicly the existence of that inefficiency. cannot even add up. maining three charges. I might say that I added the honourable member up five minutes after I first saw him. The honourable member for Lilley has been endeavouring to condition public opinion and public responsibility to the shocking state of affairs concerning the Zillmere housing scheme.' If any one wants evidence of inefficiency in shocking state of affairs there to find an abundance of it. My fourth charge is that successive Under the existing Labour governments in Queensland have My fifth charge is that the Queensland Government very definitely favours State landlordism. It believes in the socialist concept that by controlling rental homes the government is able to control the people who live in them. My sixth and final charge, which is directly linked with the fifth charge, is that there is every reason to. believe that a substantial element of political intimidation has been evident in the administration of the Queensland Housing Commission. The attitude of State Labour governments throughout Australia is on this occasion exemplified in the matter of housing. They are opposed to the acceptance",61,Dismissal Of Housing Men

That brings me to a matter that was mentioned this evening, I thought quite charitably, by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt), who is Leader of the House.

On the other side of and every person on a nodding acquaintance the House, believe it or not, sits Her with socialist practices? Majesty's alternative government. As the Minister for Labour and National Service pointed out, the various fragments, sections and segments of the Australian Labour party decided at the Brisbane conference to present to the people of Australia a new product, which was in fact only an ostensibly new product dressed up in a fresh wrapping. It is called democratic socialism. I cannot this evening canvass all the aspects of democratic socialism, but I certainly propose to canvass one or two that I believe warrant it. I invite the honourable member for East Sydney to give some thought to this, if he is capable of giving objective thought to any one other than himself. What do Opposition members mean by socialism? What do they mean by the establishment of a socialist society? Do they agree with Professor G. D . H . Cole's statement? In ""Problems of a Socialist Government"", he wroteSocialism involves the complete transference of all major industrial operations to public ownership and socialist control. In other words, socialism is not a question of nationalizing a few specially selected industries, but of changing the entire basis on which industry as a whole is conducted at present. That was written by one of the leading advocates of socialism living to-day, Professor G. D. H . Cole. Does the honourable member for East Sydney agree with these words of Mr Herbert Morrison in "" Dare We Look Ahead ""? The aim of socialism would be to touch that for economic undertakings here and there but extending the principle of public ownership to land and economic undertakings to such a point that the nation is in all essentials the master, the director of the means whereby the nation Mr Wise, wroteThe first objective of a socialist government, as soon as it attains office, should be the capture of administrative and economic power. Wilh this in view it should proceed methodically and rapidly to eliminate private ownership from the leading industries and services of the country. And it should transfer them to communal ownership in such a manner that there can be no return to private ownership. It must be made impossible for any succeeding government by mere repeal of legislation or other means ever to attempt to reconstruct the capitalist system. We must make such an omelette that it is impossible for the eggs to get back into their shells. This House, and indeed the country, will be familiar with that metaphor, because the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) who is deputy Leader of the Opposition has, on one of two occasions, referred to scrambling eggs.

I ask the house to note, in particular, the substance of the right honourable member for Barton's point. If a socialist government had secured that amendment, then the whole federalist system in this country would have been destroyed. We would have had bank nationalization and nationalization of medical services, and the various services mentioned by the Minister for Labour and National Service this evening would have all been destroyed. Private enterprise would have been snuffed out.

133,Mr Peters (Scullin) [10.4],"In everywas a Labour government in the days of war. when the sceptre of power fell from the palsied hands of the Liberal party into the hands of John Curtin. To-night, when there is a proposal to censure the Government, the honourable member for Moreton( Mr Killen) has attacked the Labour party because it has a particular platforma platform which, he says, means that the Labour party will turn Australia into a republic. The policy, platform and objectives that the Labour party has to-day it had also during the period when Labour governments administered the States and the Commonwealth. That policy and those objectives were the policy and the objectives to which members of the Democratic Labour party, so called, or the Anti-Communist Labour party, so called, pledged their faith and allegiance. That was the policy that they preached over the years as members of the Labour party. But our friend talked to-night about Judases. I do not know what his implication was, but, if there are any Judases, they houses. He produced evidence that a vast are those who betrayed the principles to which, over the years, they gave their allegiance-no t those who to-day still stand behind the principles they advocated in the days gone by. We wish to discuss the question of housing. At this late stage of the discussion, it agreed that an abnormal number of people would be a work of supererogation for me to seek to give details of the tragic conditions of the vast number of people in this country who need shelter to-day. It is unnecessary to dwell on the question whether man-power and materials are available or are not available. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr. Evatt) introduced the censure proposal. He clearly set out the points upon which he challenged the Government. He showed that there was a shortage of homes and that materials were available. He said that finance was not available and that finance was what was required. Let me pause here and interpose the comment that the playboy politician who is now the Deputy Leader of the Government said that the States had their responsibilities in connection with housing. The only contribution to the debate on housing made by the honourable member for Moreton was the statement that the States have their responsibilities. Certainly the States have There was a Labour government their responsibilities. But the States say, "" We will carry out our responsibilities and provide houses if the finance is made available"". The Liberal Premier of Victoria said, "" I want finance"". Premiers of all States say that they want finance and that, if they secure the finance, they will carry out their responsibilities. The Prime Minister( Mr Menzies), in what was described by the "" Sydney Morning Herald"" as his worse speech, replied to the Leader of the Opposition. His speech, of course, was the best that his advisers inside the Government and outside the Government could produce. Then the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) spoke. Any one who heard his speech will have no doubt that he replied effectively to all the assumptions, arguments and fictions put forward by the Prime Minister. He proved irrefutably that vast numbers of people needed houses, that many were living in. garages and sheds and bringing up families in rooms, and that many people in Sydney were living in fowlamount of material was available and that people were leaving the building trade because they could not secure employment. That, of course, was the overwhelming case for the censure proposal put forward by the Labour party. So decisive was it that the press from one end of Australia to the other who could not get houses were living under tragic conditions, and that adequate materials and man-power were available to relieve the position. Even Ministers of the Crown, at a later stage, admitted those two contentions, and, of course, the Premiers of all the States agree that they can get materials and man-power if only they are provided with sufficient finance. I quote now a statement from the Melbourne "" Age"" which epitomises the attitude that is generally adopted in connection with this censure amendment by the press of Australia. It readsThe problem of housing, and in particular thc problem of finding finance, which faces so many married people in search of a home of their own . . . There can be no glossing over the Commonwealth Statistician's ngures which showed a drop of 5,000 in the number of houses under construction at the end of the last nnancial year compared with twelve months earlier. This slowing of the tempo of housing was not caused by any fall in demand, for it occurred in a period when the marriage rate was high, the influx of migrants was well sustained and demand was increasing . . . Again,figuresprove clearly that there was no shortage of material or of workers in the building industry, to account for the decline in activity. There can be only one explanation for this slow decline in production: the difficulty of obtaining finance for home building. Returning again to figures, there is clear evidence that the trading banks in recent months have diverted substantial sums from housing to the financing of hire-purchase firms. Melbourne "" Age "", which, of course, is not a Labour newspaper. It is not a supporter of the Labour movement. The Melbourne "" Age"" helped to put this Government on the treasury bench. I do not wish to go into too many details on this matter, and I merely point out a few illuminating facts. There are 24,000 outstanding applications for war service homes in this country. In Victoria last year there were 15,000 applicants for housing commission homes, but only 4,000 homes were built. In the previous year there were over 12,000 applicants, and only 3,000 homes were built. In a period of less than two years in Victoria there was a shortage of 20,000 Housing Commission homes, and throughout Australia there was a shortage of 24,000 war service homes. A similar position exists in other States to that which obtains in Victoria. It is estimated that between 200,000 and 300,000 homes are required in this community. The result of this shortage is that homes are being broken up, and the health and spirits of the people are being undermined. This applies, of course, to "" old "" Australians. It is "" old "" Australians who can get war service homes and Housing Commission homes. The position of "" new "" Australians is considerably worse. In Carlton, Fitzroy, St. Kilda and elsewhere, as was demonstrated by the Melbourne "" Herald"" in a series of articles and pictures, whole families of from three to six persons and more are living in single rooms, for which they pay as much as £5 a week. I pointed these things out in this Parliament before the last federal elections. I brought evidence to the Parliament and invited the playboy Deputy Leader of the Government, the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Harold Holt), to accompany me and Mr Lovegrove, M.L.A., through Carlton and Fitzroy, where we would have shown him these conditions. those conditions existed in the metropolitan area of Melbourne, and they affected thousands of people. When I brought this matter before the House there were in the Parliament members of the Anti-Communist Labour party. They, of course, said, "" This is an attack on immigration "". It appeared that one attacked immigration if one sought to show that new Australians as well as old Australians should have decent conditions. Of course, that is not so, and calumnies of that kind will not deter the Australian Labour party from fighting to ensure that proper conditions are provided for the Australian people. The conditions under which some of them are living are deplorable and tragic. If the Prime Minister( Mr Menzies) believes that the basis of civilised society is the home, and that we need happy homes, he should do something about it. But what did he say in the speech that he made in this House? He based his arguments in reply to the censure amendment upon practically one ground alone. He said thisThe limitation on a housing programme in Australia is the limitation of man-power and the limitation of materials, and anybody who is so naive as to believe that new man-power and new materials can be created by increasing the supply of money is merely adding to inflation. that, and upon the basis of that one sentence he constructed a whole speech. That was his defence of the housing position. It has been proven, of course, beyond any challenge whatsoever, that there are ample building materials and that there is quite a good amount of labour available. But does the right honourable gentleman contend that if we increase the number of houses in the community we will increase the price of houses, or that if we lessen the demand for houses we will increase their prices? Of course we will not. The only time when people in this community will be able to obtain houses at reasonable prices, either for purchase or rental, will be when there are adequate numbers of houses. We will diminish rather than increase inflation in the building industry, if, with proper safeguards, we arrange to build more houses.",65,Dismissal Of Housing Men
