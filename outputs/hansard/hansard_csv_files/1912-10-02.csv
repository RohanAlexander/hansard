The clause is designed to prevent or diminish crimping, and, in my opinion, is already sufficiently wide. Asuperintendent, a seamen's inspector, and the owner, master, mate, or engineer of a vessel may be employed for engaging or supplying seamen. If we added to the clause, it is possible that persons who have been connected with crimping might be employed directly to secure seamen. -The Bill introduced in 1908 contained the wordsNo person, other than a superintendent or the clause effective, the master, mate, or engiowner, master or mate or engineer of a ship, or a person who is bond fids a servant in the constant and exclusive employ of the owner. No one desires to encourage crimping, as it was found to exist in. Newcastle. bourne at one time. the Commission showed that it was worse at Newcastle, where many sailing ships from all parts of the world bring seamen of all classes and characters. characters had control of them. there were some captains employed in the trade who were unscrupulous enough to make a profit out of this practice. Those who ought to have been the natural protectors of the seamen were not their natural protectors, but were trying to make a profit out of a nefarious traffic. The evidence showed us that it ought not to be tolerated in Australia for ten minutes. We all desire to suppress the traffic. I am sure that when the honourable member for Angas suggested an improvement by the adoption of some words in the Imperial Act he did not wish to insert an amendment which would encourage or countenance this practice at all. through, I cannot see how the suggestion made by my honourable friend would give facilities for the operation of crimping, because he does not suggest that any body or individual should be licensed to engage seamen. All he suggests is that a person who is bond fide the servant and in the constant employment of the owner shall, be authorized to do it. That would give, I think, a certain elasticity in the conduct of Australian engagements, without encouraging any of the evil effects which the Minister has suggested. I hope that he will give us some reason why this provision has been omitted from the Bill of 1908, and may see his way to provide something similar, if not the same. The Navigation Commission distinctly recommended that, so far as possible, this business should be in the hands of a superintendent-that is, of a responsible person. This clause allows the owner, master, mate, or engineer of a ship to act. Of course, the owner cannot do it by himself, as he will be away, nor can the master; mate, or engineer leave his post for this purpose All that my honourable friend asks is that, in order to make the neer should be enabled to carry out what he desires through a bond fide servant who is constantly in the employment of the owner. ney-General) [10.45] I think that the amendment would be dangerous. The Navigation Commission heard a great deal of evidence on this matter, and it was alt to the one effect. A condition of things had existed in some of the ports of Australia, particularly Newcastle, which, was little short of scandalous, and from what we gather only in San Francisco were conditions worse. The extent to which this practice went, and its ramifications, were really calculated to surprise any person who was not familiar, with shipping matters. It was clearly impressed upon the Commission that the only, remedy was to confine the business of engaging seamen, to a public officer, and so they recommended that no person other than a superintendent should be allowed to supply or engage a seaman on board a ship. I want it to be clearly understood that it was never suggested for a moment, nor was there the slightest evidence that. anything in"" the nature of crimping occurred in regard to Inter-State shipping; of course, that would be perfectly absurd. The practice was confined to foreign-going shipping. But, as this measure affects Australian shipping as well as foreign-going shipping, naturally some regard had to be paid to the representations",14,Navigation Bill

The scope which was thought proper by the Commission was enlarged by the Government, so that now a superintendent is not the only person who may engage a seaman, but a seamen's inspector, who is, of course, a Government officer, or the owner, master, mate, or engineer of a ship may also do so. We can find an excellent reason for allowing those persons to act, because they all have the sanction of practice. The master or mate does engage, and ought to be allowed to engage, seamen. He is the man under whom they are going to work, and, therefore, it is perfectly proper that he should be allowed to engage any person who he thinks is suitable for his purpose. position with his staff. When we go outside the owner of the ship we are in troubled waters. The amendment suggested would, I think, be most undesirable. Take the suggestion of the honourable member that this business should be intrusted to a person who is bond fide the servant and in the constant employment of the owner. Practically it means that any person who is in the employment of the owner may engage a seaman. I take it that in practice a .seaman could be engaged under the clause by the owner or by the owner's agent. The honourable gentleman would not say that the strictest possible interpretation of the provision would preclude the owner from delegating to a bond fide agent the business of getting a seaman. It is perfectly true that he could only be supplied and shipped in one way, but the preliminary negotia1 ions could be carried out by an agent. The -owner would be responsible under the provision for anything improperly done. The moment you enlarge that, and permit the owner to delegate his authority, you will get into a very uncertain position. I do not think that even the question of allowing the owner himself is without diffiexperience shows that crimping has been the culty -master. master of a ship, you know where you are. Who is the owner of C :hip? If the ship belongs to a registered company, or to a single individual, I know who the owner is; but under the law the ownership of a ship is divided into sixty-four parts, and any person who has a sixty-fourth belongs to a registered company, is the owner of the ship within the meaning of this provision. The clause is quite wide enough; it cannot possibly affect Inter-State shipping prejudicially. I do hope that there will not be any tendency on the part of the Committee, in the full light of the evidence, which disclosed an astonishing and scandalous position of affairs, to enlarge the scope of the clause, and so to invite the continuance of that situation. I think that the Attorney-General has not given full consideration to the very reasonable suggestion that has been made by the honourable member for Angas. As a matter of fact, the Bill as introduced in The engineer is in a similar 1908 contained a special provision of the kind enabling a person in the exclusive and constant employ of the owner to attend to a matter of this kind. ber say that under the clause as it stands an owner could not appoint a person to act for him?

The clause as it stands is of an almost prohibitive character. should be prohibitive. ing to assist the honourable member in putting down crimping, but I am simply urging now that reasonable facilities should be afforded owners in this connection. I am-prepared to go almost to any length to avoid crimping; I would make it a criminal offence to be severely punished. But our result of negligent supervision, boardinghouse-keeperswho are primarily and mainly responsible for crimping, being permitted to go on board ship. It is not possible for my honourable friends opposite to produce any evidence that the practice that has hitherto prevailed of permitting this work to be performed by a bond fide servant of a company has resulted in crimping.

That city is notorious for crimping. does the honourable member for Kooyong. will be retained, and that the Committee will assist the Minister to make this measure a workable one. It should be above all party considerations. I think the Committee is unanimous in its desire to abolish crimping. Personally, I would make imprisonment the penalty for that offence. If there is one contemptible person on the face of the earth it is the inall know that the masters of the principal dividual who is willing to take sailors into his house, and whilst they are under the inlot of work to do whilst they are in port, fluence of liquor to induce them to sign articles to ship on certain-vessels. I desire vents me from voting in favour of taking to assist in stopping that practice, and therefore I wish to make the punishment for it a sufficient deterrent. But in the offices of many of our shipping companies there is usually a confidential man who practically looks after tlie whole of the shipping for the firm. the superintendent? thought the amendment would open the door to crimping it would not command my support. employ a confidential man who is a first class servant, and who attends to the whole of the shipping business for his particular firm. He naturally knows a great deal more about it than does the shipowner, who is very often only a figurehead. the slightest danger in empowering such a man to ship the crew of any vessel. Very much more danger would be incurred in permitting the mate to sign on the seamen. We all know that it is not difficult for a ship's mate to enter into collusion with the keepeis of boarding-houses and public houses which sailors frequent. It would be very much more dangerous to allow him to ship seamen at places other than the shipping-office, than it would be to empower a confidential man in the employ of a shipping company to undertake that work. There is no honnot entertain a perfect horror of crimpers, who, for the sake of gaining a few pounds, It is a are prepared to do some of the most cruel work that is done in Australia. But I do not think that by adopting the amendment we should be opening the door in the slightest degree to crimping. trust that the Committee will not alter the clause. If we place the matter of shipping seamen in too many hands we shall run grave danger of the practice of crimping creeping in. The honourable member for Kooyong said that we ought not to penalize the ship-owners. I wish to assist them as far as possible, but I must safeguard the interests of the men who -are employed on board ships. We vessels which trade along our coast have a and it is only that consideration which prethe work of shipping seamen out of the hands of the mates of vessels.

51,Mr Groom,"We must take Australiandoubt that if we were legislating for Newcastle only, the law would be much more strict than it is. The honourable member for Eranklin has stated that it is very often the mate that arranges the crimping; and I think it would be much better and simpler to leave the engagement of seamen to some person who resides permanently in the port, and who is much more likely to know "" the run of the ropes "" than is a man who visits the town only at long intervals. The State Government of New South Wales have under consideration legislation to make the law even more strict than it is at present, and they communicated with the Commonwealth Government with a view of tightening up the provisions of this Bill instead of leaving them more elastic, as is now suggested. It is well known that the practice of crimping does not apply in the InterState trade, but is confined to oversea shipping, British and foreign. clause will be accepted as it stands. Doubtless this Bill, like every other Bill, will recrimp seamen, but for boarding-masters andquire amendment in the future, either in the way of tightening up the clauses or making them less drastic. [11.14] -This is one of the most important clauses in the measure; it touches the very core of the disadvantages under which ocean-going seamen sometimes labour, and I am sure that honourable members on all sides are in accord with the Government in their desire to put down with a firm hand the detestable practice of crimping. I cannot at the moment say whether the amendment submitted by the honourable member for Angas is a good one or a bad -one; but my own inclination is rather to restrict the number of people who are permitted to engage in the work of supplying seamen-to restrict them within the smallest limits consistent with the reasonable working of the shipping business. One point on which this Bill errs on the side of leniency is that of penalties. opinion, the monetary penalty should be abolished and imprisonment only substituted. I cannot help contrasting the lightness of these penalties with those imposed under the Royal Commissions B ill ; and nothing that could be done in connection -with a Royal Commission is half as detestable as the practice of crimping. In this connection I should like to call attention to the report of the Royal Commission on the Navigation Bill, which affords some very startling information. It is just as well that these facts should be laid before the Committee, so that honourable members, who have not had much experience in nautical matters, may gather some idea of the practices which sometimes prevail in' shipping seamen for deep-sea vessels. On page 15 of the report of the Royal Commission we are toldA considerable amount of evidence was received in connection with the supply and discharge of seamen on foreign-going ships.. Some of this was so sensational that, had it not been amply corroborated, its accuracy might well have been doubted. The witnesses, it may be remarked, were not recruited from any one class, but represented, indifferently, all sections of the community. From boardinghouse-keepers,. shipmasters, seamen, lawyers, merchants, doctors, and police, the same testimony was received. As it would be impossible to suppose that witnesses of so representative a character, would mislead your Commissioners, they were forced to the conclusion that fresh legislation in. this matter is most urgently needed. I trust the I may here remark, parenthetically, that it is the practice in some ports, not only to others to sometimes utterly neglect to ascertain whether the men they supply are really seamen. Cases have come under my personal observation where men, who had never been to sea in their lives, have, after a spree, found themselves on a sailing ship miles out of sight of land. is shanghaiing. comes within the same series of offences. both practised here. not know whether shangaiing is practised so much in Australia as it used to be in some other parts of the world when I was at sea. The report saysBriefly stated, the law, as laid down in the Merchant Shipping Act, permits seamen to besupplied by a person who "" holds a licence from In my. the Board of Trade, for the purpose, or who is the owner or master or the mate of the ship, or is bond fide the servant, and in the constant employ of the owner, or is a superintendent."" That covers the scope of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Angas. The report goes on to sayThese provisions have proved quite inadequate to prevent crimping, and, in Newcastle, they may be said to have been for years past openly defied. The report goes on to deal with the practices of boardinghouse-keepers and runners",18,Smith Woul D Not He Be Evidence To Show That The Person Was Em

The Royal Commission commentedThis cold-blooded avowal of participation in a nefarious and criminal traffic excited no surprise in the shipping community at Newcastle, where long usage had rendered those concerned familiar with that nnd much more of the same kind. These were ordinary business transactions, as is admitted. They were frequently conducted in years past. I hope they are not conducted to the same extent now at the port of Newcastle, in this beautiful country of Australia. I venture to believe that few shore-going persons have any knowledge of the fact that these practices have been pursued, and that our seafaring men have been victimized in this shameless and heartless fashion. But that is not all. who have come out to Australia in ships, especially American ships, have been so tyrannized over on the voyage, and. been subjected to so many pinpricks, and often It ill-usage, as to make them disgusted with the vessel, and anxious to leave her on forcing them to desert the ship and forego I the whole of their wages. What has become they went entirely into the pockets of the tolerable as possible on board ship, shared' does not disclose. The report says, however, in regard to that matterI t was sworn, too, that a regular traffic existed in inciting seamen to desert, and that this was carried on by boardinghouse-keepers, runners, and others, some of whom, it was alleged, did not even have a place of accommodation. Several witnesses alleged that some masters of vessels connived at such practice, partly for the purpose of sharing what was suggestively termed ""blood money"" (the £ 1 paid for the supply of seamen), and partly for the purpose of defrauding the seaman of his wages. Cases were cited in support of this statement. In one, men to whom three years' wages were due were compelled to accept an insignificant proportion in order to obtain their discharges. A witness gave an instance where £ 6 0 being due, £ \ o had to be accepted. In other cases, despairing of ever getting anything and induced by glowing reports of local conditions put forward by the crimps, men have left the whole of their wages in the hands of the ship. I think there can be no two opinions on the part of honourable members that practices of that kind should be put down as firmly as possible, and that we should see that no loophole is left in the Bill which will permit them to be continued. To that extent I realize ihat the Government in framing the Bill have tried as far as they could to provide against abuses. I myself am very chary of accepting any proposal that might possibly open the door to a continuation of such abuses. open now. know that the amendment of the honourable member for Angas will do that. I am rather inclined to think that it will afford an additional safeguard. But I am informed that the mates of some of these It has even happened that seamen vessels share even more largely than the masters do in the money which is obtained from crimping.

So are we all on this side of the House, especially in regard to those provisions which relate to the employment of seamen. not move the amendment I mentioned, because I wanted to see what honourable members had to say on the matter. As the honourable member for Lang said, we are desirous of attaining the,same object as the Ministry-to put down crimping. But one has also to consider the convenience of employers, and we have the admission of the Minister that, except at Newcastle, there has really been no evil of that kind. used to be very bad in Melbourne. evil at Newcastle, there is nothing to prevent an amendment being made to apply particularly to that port. We are not bound to have the law uniform throughout Australia, but can make exceptions where the evil is intensified. That consideration ought to diminish the Minister's opposition to the suggestion I am about to make. In New Zealand, for instance, greasers and firpmen may be engaged directly by the engineer of a ship, so that greater latitude Sub-clause i is given in this matter by a Dominion that has as much to do with seafaring matters as we have, if not more.

No seaman shall be rated(a) as "" greaser,"" who has not served six months as fireman at sea; or (i) as "" fireman,"" who has not served six months as a trimmer or fireman at sea. Provided that persons rated as firemen or -greasers before the commencement of this Act shall continue to be entitled to be so rated. (2.) No person shall give a discharge to a seaman as fireman or greaser unless the seaman has served in the capacity in which the discharge is given for the time specified in such discharge. Penalty for breach of this sub-section : F if t y pounds. I wish to draw attention to the qualifications of greasers and firemen. My attention has been drawn to the fact that the clause, as it stands, will unduly restrict the choice of men to act in these capacities. Before he can be rated as such, a greaser is required to have served six months as a fireman at sea, while afiremanhas to serve six months as a trimmer or fireman at sea. It is contended that this provision is unduly restrictive, and that many men may gain their preliminary experience as firemen on land. In the New Zealand Act, from which the clause is taken, provision is made that where a greaser or fireman has served on land, such service shall be taken into account in the rating for sea service. It is also pointed out that under the New Zealand Act three months' service is sufficient. What reply has the Minister to make to that criticism? I hope that the Minister will. adhere to the clause as it stands. There may be a very great deal in the view expressed by This thing should be made the honourable member for Bendigo. Buti l he had had the misfortune to go to sea as afireman,he would have found it pretty awkward to be obliged to fire with a man who had never been to sea before, and who, therefore, had no sea-legs. If a fireman finds himself on a steamer which is bad to fire, it is of no use for him to kick up a row whilst he is at sea. The work of firing has to be done, and very often one fireman has to do the work of two, and to carry a man who is a dead-weight. That is a general ground of complaint by firemen and officers. A fireman is entitled to be protected against a man who is not competent to do his work. If anything is a dog's job, it is that of firing at sea. Firemen have a perfect right to ask us to look at this matter from their point of view, and to give them a decent chance to earn their living in a manner which is fair both to themselves and to their employers. The present system is not fair to the men who fancy if they can get to sea they will be able to get along somehow. The proper place for such men is the inside of a gaol, because they have obtained their positions through misrepresentation; they undertake work which they are utterly incompetent",23,Smith Woul D Not He Be Evidence To Show That The Person Was Em

It provides that these men should have a certain amount of experience. Probably the honourable member for Hindmarsh has had as much practical experience of this class of labour as any honourable member has had. men go to sea as trimmers or firemen as a last resort, having failed on the land. As my honourable friend has truly remarked, the life of a fireman at sea is a dog's life, and the smaller the liner is the worse it is for the fireman. One of the main objects of the Bill is to try to improve the lot of men who go down to the sea in ships, whether as firemen, greasers, or seamen. No doubt many honourable members have seen an unsteady fireman helped on to the boat after the gangway has been removed. think that every man should be competent to take his share of the work. At present the men who are steady frequently have to do the work of firing for a watch or two for two men. In other words, they have to do the work of the men who are laid up for the first portion of the voyage because of their inexperience, and perhaps because' some are not quite steady, and are unable for a watch or two to do their share of the work. The steady men are those who should be encouraged to get on, and we ought not to make their work harder than it is. I move That sub-clause (2) be left out, with a view to insert in lieu thereof the following sub-clause :""(2.) After the expiration of twelve months from the commencement of this Act, a seaman shall not be permitted to engage in any capacity unless he satisfies the superintendent lhat he can pull an oar nnd handle a boat : Provided that this sub-section shall not apply to the engagement of a seaman who has not previously served at sea.""

Those who have been on A trimmer, of course, can be put ship board have seen posted up a notice showing how the crew is distributed among the several boats, and must know that firemen as well as ordinary seamen are required to assist in handling a boat. In case of shipwreck the chance of rescue might be very remote if one elected to remain on board rather than to put to sea in a small boat; but I think that the chance would be even less if one put off in a boat manned by men who had had no experience in pulling an oar. If I remember rightly, Lord Mersey, in his report, states that some of the female passengers who were lowered into the boats from the Titanic were able to show the seamen A number of what to do. In that case there had not been any opportunity for boat drill. This amendment is designed to insure having on board ship men who are able to pull an oar and handle a boat, and so to meet an emergency. that the Minister is right in proposing to make provision that a seaman shall be able to pull an oar and handle a boat; but, under the amendment as it stands, a man I would not be allowed to work in any capacity on ship board unless he could do so. It is proper to require this qualification in the case of seamen man should not be employed in any capacity on ship board unless he possesses this qualification. able member allow a man to be employed even as a nurse on ship board unless he could pull an oar and handle a boat? force in the argument that a man employed on ship board in almost any capacity should be able to pull an oar, but the question is whether this amendment does not go too far.

Whilst we do not wish in any way to interfere with the wages conditions of Australia, since we have attained to a fairly healthy .state of affairs here under which the general mass of the community are able to live up to the standard that modern civilization and education require, still if labour is not available locally at rates prescribed under an industrial agreement filed with, or an award made by, the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court, it should be possible to use the crew of a vessel to load or unload her. goes beyond what ought really to be in the mind of the draftsman.

The clause in the Bill is, as it stands, very general ( "" in handling cargo in connection with""), and, though it is understood that it is unusual to employ British crews in this work in Australian ports, the provisions of the clause will press very It provides, in effect, that hardly on owners in the event of no shore labour being available. The Board has urged against some foreign Governments the claims of masters of British vessels to employ their crews in foreign I dare say ports in the manner sought to be prohibited by this clause, and other foreign Governments also support similar claims on behalf of their masters. It is to be feared that the putting into force of such an enactment will lead to retaliation by foreign countries. I think that we ought to have a reply by the Minister to those representations. Some of the vessels employed in our limited coastal trade sub-clause 2. lian trade ships.

The intention of the clause is that, in the case cumstances, it is to all intents and purposes of foreign-going ships, shore labour shall be competing in the Inter-State trade. Such employed. That is perfectly in accord with the general principle which has governed the economic and fiscal policy of the country since this Parliament has been in existence. I rnost emphatically protest against any attempt being made to differentiate between persons who are engaged in the maritime industry and persons who are engaged in a shore industry. Both the author of the amendment and the honourable member for Darling Downs know quite well that the position is not so simple ferred to an agreement which is in existence that it would be met by providing that when there is a scarcity of shore labour available, the crew of a vessel may be employed to work cargo. The members of the crew of a foreign-going vessel are paid, I suppose, from £ 3 ios. to £ 4 . per month at the most, which works out at less than 6d. per hour, whereas, under the awards which are now current throughout Australia, stevedores get is. 6d. per hour for working cargo eight hours a day and extra pay for overtime. How profitable, then, it would be for the master of a foreign-going ship to say, "" I cannot get labour here, and, therefore, I will employ my own crew to load and discharge cargo?"" The proviso sets out clearly "" that the regulations shall not allow the employment of the crew of such ship, in handling cargo or ballast, where a sufficiency of other labour is available."" That is perfectly proper. I utterly fail to see why we should differentiate between shore labour usually so-called and shore labour which is employed in working, ships.. I cannot agree that any such differentiation is proper. The agreement which exists in Australia at the present time between the employers under the Shipping Federation and the members of the Waterside Workers Federation in regard to the working of cargoes, provides that in all the main ports sailors shall not be permitted to work cargo, but that, in those ports in which shore labour presumably is not available, or is not always on hand, the crews of vessels may be employed in this connection. This clause places the foreign-going shipper on exactly the' same footing as the local shipper; and anything more than that the foreign-going shipper ought not to ask for. If he comes here and trades he ought to pay shore rates. A foreign-going ship may take on hardwood at Bunbury and bring it round to this side; and, under such circompetition, at 6d. an hour, is quite unfair and unjust to those employers whom we compel to pay certain rates. Amendment negatived. Sub-clause 2 provides that the regulations may forbid -the employment, except as prescribed, of members of the crews of Australian-trade ships in handling cargo or ballast in connection with the loading or unloading.

I do not think that it is the general desire of honourable members that the -regulations under this clause should prohibit the crews of vessels being used under the circumstances I have indicated. If the regulations are to apply, such vessels, at the first port of call, will have to ship a special crew to work the cargo; and this, of course, will' mean an increase in the freight.

I do not say that no such regulation could be framed; but this clause is confined to ""Australian-trade ships,"" which are defined in clause 5-thoug h that clause has not yet been passed-as includingEvery ship (other than a limited coast trade ship or river and bay ship) employed in trading or going between places in Australia, and every ship employed in trading between (a) Australia and (4) territories under the authority of the Commonwealth, New Zealand, or the islands of the Pacific. Then, further, clause 5 contains the following interpretation :"" Limited coast-trade ship "" means a sea-going ship exclusively engaged in making short voyages from and to any port in Australia within limits (not exceeding a radius of 400 miles) . . . . determined for the port by the Governor General. There is no doubt that for all practical purposes an "" Australian-trade ship "" is a ship engaged in Inter-State trade so far as this sub-clause is concerned ; and, therefore, I think that the regulations would not apply. That, however, is a matter for interpretation. The. honourable, member has asked what is the conception of the scope of this sub-clause by the Government, and whether it would be possible to frame such a. regulation under it. No doubt it would be possible to frame such a regulation, but whether it would be proper to do so must remain for the discretion of the Minister. I indicated what the practice is in regard to Inter-State shipping; but there is no such practice at the present time in connection with the Intrastate shipping. I am now speaking of the result of an agreement between the shipowners and the employee's. Inter-State shipping, the practice I have spoken of is subject to limitations, in so far as certain ports are exempted. In regard to Intra-State shipping, and particularly in regard to those ports the honourable member has in his mind, the practice does not apply. afraid that the sub-clause, if retained, would be very oppressive in its operation in connection with some boats engaged purely in the Gulf trade. The Attorney-General was quite right in referring to the definition of "" Australian-trade ship,"" because the sub-clause applies to such shipping only, and not to a limited coast-trade ship or river and bay ship. A limited coast-trade ship means a ship exclusively engaged in making short voyages from and to any port in Australia within limits. The Attorney-General in quoting the interpretation clause ""jumped"" the succeeding words, "" not exceeding a radius of 400 miles."" The limit may be much less than 400 miles; and in South Australia, for instance, there are a great number of vessels who make short trips daily, say, from Port Adelaide to Yorke's Peninsula, of about four hours' duration. The greater number of the men are employed on those vessels owing to the fact that their services may be utilized at the various ports,.' the actual sea part of their work being comparatively smalL Under recent awards they are paid fairly good wages and good overtime rates. Under an interpretation of some awards the last one, for instance, connected with officersa sum may be paid as commutation for overtime at sea; but if no overtime is worked at sea, and; the monthly sum is paid to commute the amount paid for overtime there is no allowance for work done on land. ships to unload cargo, and sometimes no shore labour is employed at all. The cargo is thrown on to the wharf from the slings of the ship by men employed on board. cases men are employed on board because they can be used at the various ports, and the greater part of the work is done in port. For instance, a seaman who is also a winchman is engaged on account of the double qualification. If the limits prescribed by the Governor General are In regard to sufficiently short, a limited coast-trade ship cannot employ men in loading and unloading, though, of course, if the voyage prescribed is over the 400 miles a good many ships might be exempt. "" River and bay ship"" is defined as including ""every ship which trades exclusively in some river, gulf, or bay within any State or States.""",27,Smith Woul D Not He Be Evidence To Show That The Person Was Em

I am informed also that some of the Northern river ports are beyond the radius of 400 miles from Sydney.

It is the same with freights on butter. In fact, everything has risen through these additional awards. crease is not all due to the award. it is the fault of the awards or the companies.

I know that the honourable gentleman does not wish to impede or hinder the operations of the small vessels trading up our rivers and along parts of the coast; but if a Government were to limit coasting trade to the trade within 100 miles of a port, or even a larger radius, the operations of many of them would, as a result, come under the control of sub-clause 2.

202,Mr Archibald (Hindmarsh) [3.10].,"the only object I can see is that some shipowners-and not the best of them-ma y have an opportunity to swindle the members of their crews. The established practice has worked remarkably well, and I can see no cause to interfere with it. It appears to me ridiculous to make an alteration simply for the sake of making an alteration. I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in the Bill of 1908 there is a proviso, in section 48, that, in the case of a limited coast-trade ship an agreement, not otherwise contrary to the Act, may be made for a period not exceeding two years. This, I understand, was taken from the New South Wales Act, and I believe that the Minister has had a communication from the North Coast Shipping Association asking for the retention of this proviso. This would inflict no hardship on any seaman, who can obtain his discharge on very short notice, though I believe it would impose some inconvenience on the master. Why has this proviso been omitted from the Bill? Senate; I do not know why. suggestion of the honourable member for Angas seems reasonable. The only difficulty is that it imposes great inconvenience on the master. It is a question of practical administration. and Customs) [3.16] I have here a copy of the ordinary Board of Trade agreement for. foreign-going or home trade ships. The same form is used in Victoria. sets out an agreement with regard to one of the Inter-State boats, and is dated 6th July of this year. The agreement is for a voyage from Melbourne to any port or ports in the Australian States, trading to and fro in any succession of voyages for a period not extending beyond the 31st day of December, 1912, or until the first arrival at Melbourne after the expiry of that time, and the discharge of cargo consequent upon such arrival. One of the conditions of the agreement isIn one port only, viz., Melbourne, but not elsewhere, the master mav discharge any seaman if he give him not less than twenty-four hours' notice on a day other than Saturday, and if the notice be not less than twenty-four hours before the vessel sails. Any seaman may end his engagement at the port aforesaid if he give such notice as aforesaid. If the ship be laid up in any port other than the port where the articles were drawn up, the seamen shall accept their discharge with wages then due and shall be entitled to free passage back to the port where the articles were drawn up. That is precisely what we are trying to provide for in this Bill. In New Zealand the home-trade agreement is for six months. In Canada the running agreement is not to exceed six months, and under the Merchant Shipping Act the running agreement is to terminate on the next following 30th June or 31st December, so that it may be under six months. Six months is a fair period for any agreement made in Australia. The proposal in the Bill is a very fair one. A six months' agreement is quite long enough. Under a running agreement a man can ship from here to London, and go thence to America or elsewhere. The home port is wherever the man has signed on. If a man signs on under a running agreement, and leaves his ship before he gets back to his home port, he is a deserter, and forfeits his wages, so that the owner is protected. If the parties do not agree, six months is too long, and if they do agree there is nothing to prevent a man renewing his agreement; and the little inconvenience that may be caused to the sailor or shipowner is small in comparison with the difficulties that often arise from long agreements. Amendment agreed to. and Customs [3.20] I move That the word "" superintendent,"" in the last line of the clause, be left out, with a view to insert the words "" proper authority"" in lieu thereof.

Mt. TUDOR (Yarra-Minister of Trade and Customs) [3.35]--In the coastal and Inter-State trade the practice is to sign on before the master, and nine-tenths of the men employed in these vessels do not know their owners, or the managers, where the vessels are the property of limited companies. I understand from a well-known Inter-State captain that in his experience the signing on before a master is invariable. In the little river ports owners as well as masters are made available, because it often happens that the masters assist the crew in loading and unloading, and it would be inconvenient to call them off their work. craft referred to are generally their owners as well.

The amendment is intended to remedy this confusion, and to bring the Bill into conformity with the Merchant Shipping Act. Later it is intended to strike out clause 164. that the term used in the Merchant Shipping Act is ""port of destination,"" and those are the words used in the Constitution. It would be best to stick to that phrase, because the meaning of it will be the subject of a decision by the High Court in connection with merchant shipping awards made by Mr Justice Higgins. The question is whether port of destination means an intermediate port or the final port of destination of a voyage.

The whole question of rating requires to be very seriously considered. The rating, A.B. in Australia, has come to be an absolute misnomer. Unfortunately, the old A.B. is to a ' very great extent dying out. A man obtains his rating as A.B. after he has been employed for three or four years as an ordinary deck scraper on a cargo steamer trading along the coast. It is about time that we considered whether men who are not qualified sailors should be classified as A.B's. A.B. must be able to pull an oar and handle a boat. minute how to pull an oar. member is quite correct. So long as^a man can handle an oar-and most grotesquely some of them do it-and has been three years on a cargo steamer he can be rated as an able-bodied seaman. We passed that clause because it was understood that the question of rating would be considered when the proposed amendments of the measure came up. We are now dealing wholly and solely with the question of rating; and I contend that the discharge should state distinctly whether a man is a sailor or is just an ordinary deck hand. member mean by a "" sailor ""? who has served his time on a "" wind jammer;"" and sailors cannot be produced under any other conditions. By this Bill we compel the owners of small coasting craft to discharge the men they now employ in favour of those who fulfil the definition. qualification of a seaman. scribe any qualification, but simply defines a seaman as a man who has served a certain time at sea, and who may be nothing more than an ordinary deck hand/ For such men displaced-me n who have spent their lives in navigating small sailing vessels. It is the height of absurdity to class a man ai an able-bodied seaman when he may know nothing whatever of seamanship, and may have no experience in steering or in handling canvas. small vessels are compelled to discharge their present sailors. vides, for instance, that in vessels under 15 tons not less than one able-bodied seaman shall be carried; and the definition of an able-bodied seaman is one who has been a certain time at sea whether in a sailing vessel or on a steamer. the owners of coastal boats to discharge men who have been all their lives at the work, and supplant them with others who are probably not half as skilful. A man who has been engaged wholly on a steamer as a deck hand is just as dangerous a man as could be found to put in charge of a ketch or coastal vessel.

255,Mr Hughes (West Sydney,"Atgrave injustice. I have been trying to follow the argument of the honourable member to see precisely in what direction the danger lies, and that these men are in danger. Apparently, there is a class of ship °n which the most skilful and reliable seamen of Australia are to be found. We are told that those we. have been in the habit of regarding in the light of seamen are nothing more than persons who have worked on steam-boats, and cannot be relied on in any serious emergency, and that under this Bill able seamen are to be displaced. This is a most extraordinary position. I ask that some attention should be paid to the Bill, and it should be indicated by the honourable member what is the particular class of men to whom it is proposed to do this monstrous and asinine wrong. I know of my own knowledge how rating is obtained. I was, with twenty-eight other men, shipped as a seaman on one discharge, which was handed from one to the other; and during a strike in Sydney 110 men were shipped, not on one discharge, but without any discharge at a l l ; they were shipped on permits. A permit represents an effort of imagination on the part of the applicant to remember the circumstances under which his alleged discharge has been lost. It is the practice to ship men on worthless discharges or on these permits; and now, by this Bill, it is proposed, for the first time in the history of navigation, that that practice shall not continue, but that no man shall be shipped unless he is of a certain age, and possesses certain qualifications. Then, the honourable member will observe, by the proviso to clause 37, that a man who has been rated as an able seaman before the commencement of the Act shall continue to be so rated; and, therefore, every able seaman now will be an able seaman under this measure. Under the circumstances, I earnestly hope that the honourable member for Franklin will not persist further. I freely admit that the nursery of our mercantile marine is to be found in our fishing and other small craft, and all men employed thereon who are now entitled to be rated as able-bodied seamen will continue to be so rated under the schedule. will not. of authority.

The master should be at liberty to state that he declines to give an opinion about a man. We have good precedent for allowing this in the practice of New Zealand and the Old Country. arises from the fact that if one knowingly makes a false statement regarding character he is liable to be indicted. Character is a mere matter of opinion. We here know one another fairly well, but would hardly like to be called on to give certificates of the characters of our fellows. The master who reports on character must report on the character as a whole, as a guide to the person to whom the discharge will be presented ; to state one feature of the character would not be sufficient. If a mistake is made the risk of being indicted is run. A master ought not to decline to give a certificate of character, because that may suggest that something is being suppressed. The discharge is a privileged communication, and an action could not be brought by an aggrieved seaman for any false statement on it, but there is the risk of the master being indicted for having made a wilful and malicious mistake. l>38]-2 and Customs) [4-34]--It is an indictable offence to give a discharge falsely indicating the capacity in which the seaman has served. The seaman is entitled to a discharge stating that he has served as A.B., O.S., fireman, or greaser, and the length of his service. If his service has been good, the master should not write on the discharge "" D.R.,"" which means "" decline to report."" It sometimes happens that the very best seamen displease the master, or the officer with whom they come most into contact, and, consequently, when their discharge is written out "" D.R."" is placed upon it. This is most unjust, and often damns a man's chances of getting another ship. The seaman who has given good service is entitled to a proper discharge. If service has not been good, the master should take the responsibility of saying so on the discharge. I am in favour of the clause as it stands, but there should be some modification of the penalty. The Royal Commission took a lot of evidence on this subject. The 1904 Bill followed the Merchant Shipping Act, clause 69 providing that the master might state that he declined . to give any opinion upon any or all of the particulars required to be written on a discharge. The Commission not only took the evidence of many seamen on this point, but also questioned Captain Charles Parsons, the Superintendent of Mercantile Marine in Victoria, part of whose examination I shall quote. It is as follows:497. What does a "" decline to report"" discharge mean?-That the master declines to report to the man's ability as a sailor, or as to his conduct. 498. It is generally considered a bad discharge?-Thos e to whom such a discharge is presented generally interpret it as meaning that the man has not a good record. 499. Do you think it is advisable in new legislation of this description to compel a master to give a man a discharge on his merits, setting forth that he is either good or bad?-Yes. 500. Although a "" decline to report"" discharge is generally recognised as a bad one, a master is not responsible at law for it?I think that he is. I believe that the question has been dealt with by the Courts. 501. I wish you could show me a decision to that effect?I have heard of a case in which a master was proceeded against for giving a man a bad discharge. 502. A ""decline to report"" means an attempt to avoid making any statement as to a man's record?-That is so.' ,503.

Whatever position in life a man may occupy, his character is his most valuable possession, and where it concerns his living we should take special pains to protect it. A man upon whose discharge "" D . R . "" is written is practically damned, because the letters amount to the statement that he asked for a certificate of character and his employer declined to give him one. A positive statement of bad character would hardly be worse than this negative statement. A man's service is either good, bad, or indifferent, and the actual facts should be stated about it. Buti f we put upon the master the obligation of making positive statements on the discharge, we should protect him in all cases where he has honestly expressed his opinion. wrong character may be given should be protected. all parties. A man who has a bad character has no right to compel the master to give him a good character, but a man who has a good character is entitled to have that saidof him on his discharge. ney-Genera!) [4.42] -No doubt it is convenient to masters to be able to write "" D.R."" on discharges; other persons often (ind it advantageous to evade responsibility in a similar manner. But seamen are entitled to discharges on which their character and the nature of their service are truthfully stated. may be written on a discharge merely because a master has a' prejudice against a man, and that will damn his chances for employment as effectually as would the worse character, leaving him without any remedy. The Royal Commission was informed that it was a regular practice in the port of Newcastle to make the lot of seamen so uncomfortable that they were bound to leave their vessels. Seamen discharged from such vessels would be sure to have their certificates marked "" D.R.,"" or to be given bad certificates. Clause 66 provides that a master shall be liable for wilful false statements, which is only proper, because a man's character being his most valuable possession, it should not be traduced. though they were little better than dogs, but in the Bill they are treated as men. They are entitled to their discharges, and to have written on their discharges the whole truth about them. [4.45] -There is very much in what the Attorney-General has said about the treatment of seamen at some ports being so bad that they are only too glad to leave their vessels at the first opportunity. They are sometimes so incensed at their treatment that they are quite satisfied to leave their ships, and to forego the wages accruing to them. Any master of a vessel or, in the case of an American ship, the "" bully"" mate, might so treat the sailors on board as to make it absolutely impossible for them to obtain a good discharge, no matter how satisfactory their conduct would have been to a master not actuated by unworthy motives. On the other hand, while I think it should be obligatory to give a man a character where his character has been good, I do not think this provision would be altogther an advantage in the case of a man whose character has been uniformly bad., and whom it is not desirable to recommend for employment. Unfortunately, even among seamen, such cases sometimes occur. "" D . R .

WhatI see in this clause is the possibility of a master, actuated by the best of motives, and perfectly honest in his dealings with his men, having, perhaps, on board a ship a sailor of bad character, and having to set out his character in a written document. That might render him liable to an action for defamation. sets out the man's character. would determine the falsity or otherwise of the charges seeing that the man would have been at sea, and that the other seamen on board would have been discharged, and, in all probability, would have gone to sea in Seamen are often spoken of as other ships from where they could not be called to give evidence?

Under the existing awards, the sea is not a bad calling to follow.

Clause 66 (Offences as to Discharges). loth to propose an amendment of this clause, because I recognise the difficulty of drafting one to meet the views that have been expressed by some honourable members. As it stands, the clause provides that a report as to character must not be false. In other words, a humane master, who tas on board a seaman of very bad character, must tell the truth about him. He could not be considerate, even to the point of commiseration. The obligation is thrown on the captain of doing justice, not only to the seaman, but to others who may re-engage him. A person who signs a discharge takes a very big risk; and the captain, out of kindness, might wish to modify his opinion of a seaman's character, and for this he is liable to be prosecerned. We regard the seaman as needing, cuted on an indictable offence before a jury. We have decided to protect the seamen, who ought not to be maligned; and I suggest that it might be possible to modify tlie clause by making sub-clause a a distinct clause with a lighter penalty attached. I further suggest that we might follow the wording of the Imperial Act by which such an offence is regarded as a misdemeanour. We have adopted a different terminology from that of the Imperial Act, and speak of a captain ""knowingly "" committing an offence, which does not quite mean the same thing as the terminology of the New Zealand and the Imperial Acts. Very often in our drafting we make changes of this kind, for which I cannot quite see the reason. The New Zealand and the Imperial Act speak of the issue of a false discharge, the captain knowing it to be false, whereas we provide that he shall be punished for making a report which is false, but the falseness of which may be known to some one else, and not to him. That may not be the interpretation which will be placed on the clause,, but, as a matter of grammar, the clause may We should, I think, provide that such an offence shall carry with it the penalty of, say, six months' imprisonment,, under which circumstances the case need not go before a jury. I further suggest that after the word "" f a l s e "" we should insert the words ""and defamatory."" This would give the captain a chance to modify his opinion about a bad fellow, but good seaman ; but be must not be maligned by defamatory statements. A sailor may be guilty of unmentionable crimes, but, at the same time, an excellent seaman; and a kindhearted captain might not wish to tell the whole truth, as he is compelled to do by the clause as it stands. If we insert the words "" and defamatory"" it will mean that the discharge must not be false to the detriment of the seaman. and Customs) [5.6] I am quite prepared to submit to the Attorney-General and theCrown Law advisers the honourable member's suggestion that the clause be reconsidered with a view to making the penalty lighter. The object of the clause is tosafeguard the seamen as far as possible. As has already been said, all seamen are not angels, nor, indeed, are all captains;. it is possible that both seamen and captains may have made mistakes, and our only desire is to deal fairly with all cona little more looking after by reason ofhi.s position; and this makes us, perhaps,, lean more towards him than to the officers. do not profess to know the exact legal bearings of this question, but I should say that a man who knowingly gave a false and bad character to a seaman, on whom he has perhaps a ""set,"" should be deemed 1 guilty of an indictable offence, and very severely punished. On the other hand, if the seaman be as bad a lot as could possibly be found on board a ship, a skipper ought not to be permitted to give him a good character, and thus deceive another ship master.

I am informed that the provision will be very difficult to carry out, as many ships arrive on Saturday or Sunday, and there may be day. On. the subject of payment of wages, there is a provision in an award made last year by Mr Justice Higgins to the follow-' ing effect:Wages shall be due monthly on the first day The wages (other than money for overtime) shall be payable as to any amount not exceeding three-fourths on the written order of the seaman countersigned by the master to the wife or a near relative of the seaman, and subject thereto to the seaman on or before arrival at one of the main ports. Money for overtime shallbe payable to the seaman at the home port, or, at the latest, within 28 days. I believe this permits the payment of the wages at outports, and so has led to a good deal of waste of money. I have heard that application is to be made to vary the award on the ground that a good deal of the money paid at the outports does not find its way to the seaman's wife and family. The Attorney-General might look into the question of whether it is advisable to permit payments of cash' wages anywhere but at the home port.

There was a doubt as to whether, when a seaman was off and on articles on the same day, he was entitled to two days' wages-. That and other questions may arise under this clause, by which it is provided that the wages shall be taken to begin either at the time at which the seaman commences work, or at the time specified in the agreement for commencing work or presenceon board. But a man might agree to commence work on a Wednesday, and by reason of urgency, he might have to set to on Monday.

(2.) Where a seaman, whose service terminates by reason of the wreck or loss of the ship, has been engaged by the run, he shall be entitled to the wages to which he would have been entitled on the termination of the run, subject *o all just deductions. --Claus e 81 of the Bill of 1908 provided that if the service of a seaman terminated before the period contemplated in his agreement because of the wreck or loss of the ship, or because of his being left ashore at any place abroad under a certincate of his unfitness or inability to proceed on the 'voyage, he should be entitled to his wages up to the time of this termination of service, but that if he had been engaged by the run he should be entitled to a proportionate part of his wages, subject to all deductions, to be calculated up to the termination of his service. Then section 158 of the Merchant Shipping Act provides that where service is terminated before the date contemplated in the agreement, by reason of the wreck or loss of a ship, or by reason of the seaman being left ashore at any place abroad under a certificate provided for by the Act, showing his unfitness or inability to proceed, he shall be entitled to his wages up to the time of the termination, but not for any longer period. In this clause nothing is said about unfitness to proceed because of illness, and a man engaged by the run will be entitled to the wages for which he had agreed on its termination, although his services may be determined earlier by the wreck or loss of the ship. Why has this departure been made from an Imperial Act and the draft of and Customs) [5.42] A man who engages for the run undertakes to ship for a voyage, say to Valparaiso and back, for a lump sum, and undei the clause such a man will be entitled to the full amount bargained for, even if the vessel is wrecked, or, by reason of some disaster, cannot finish her voyage. Sub-clause 1 may be a little hard on the seaman. In the Admiralty inquiry into the collision between the Olympic and the Hawke, it was held that the Olympic was practically a wreck because she could not proceed further, and the pay of her -sailors terminated at the time of the collision. may get another ship at a port close by. all against that. --The Bill of 1908 followed the New Zealand Act of 1903, section 79 of which provides that where a seaman, wherever engaged, is discharged in New Zealand before completing the full term of his engagement, he shall be paid, or may recover, the full amount of his wages up to the time of his discharge, notwithstanding that he has not completed his full term. Where his service terminates before the date contemplated in the agreement, by reason of the wreck or loss of the ship, or by reason of his being left ashore at any place under certificate of his unfitness or inability to proceed on the voyage, he is entitled to his wages up to the time of such termination. It is further provided that a seaman engaged by the run shall be entitled to a proportionate part of the wages to which he would have been entitled on the termination of the run, subject to just deductions, and that that proportion shall be calculated up to the termination of his service. The wording of the New Zealand section was practically followed in the Bill of 1908. I think that after the words ""entitled to"" there should be inserted the words "" a proportionate part of the wages to which he would have been entitled on the termination of the run."" Surely there can be no reasonable objection to such an amendment. Minister) [5.46] -Wher e a man agrees to work by the day or month, the arrangement is made regardless of the ship's destination, and when, by any reason, he is 1908? prevented from doing the work that he undertakes to do, it is reasonable that the wages which he is receiving should then terminate. The position, however, is different when a seaman engages for what is termed "" the run."" If , for instance, a man engages to take a vessel from Port Pirie to Newcastle, he undertakes to do for a lump sum the ordinary work of a seaman on board, and if, for any reason over which he has no control, he is prevented from taking the ship to the port to which he has undertaken to take it, his wages should not be deducted. practice.

350,Mr Roberts,"Wher e men are paidcannot be taken to its intended destination, their wages immediately cease, but, in so far as a "" run "" is concerned, the men invariably contract to take a vessel from one point to another for a lump sum. They undertake a risk. The quicker the vessel reaches its destination, the sooner they earn their money. In the case of a wreck, which for all practical purposes is under the control of the captain-on e of the parties to the agreement-the seamen are in no way responsible, and they should get their money. They are on the spot, ready and willing to perform their contract, and are prevented from completing it by circumstances over which they have no control. It would scarcely be fair in such circumstances to say to them, "" Although you are willing and ready to complete your contract, and have been prevented from doing so through no fault of your own, you must have a certain sum deducted from the amount agreed upon."" How could the proportion to be deducted be determined? A seaman is engaged "" by the run "" to take a vessel from one port to another, regardless of time. In ordinary circumstances, a vessel might run from Port Pirie to NewCastle in ten days; in unfavorable circumstances, she might take twenty-four. I remember being on a vessel which took that time to make the "" run."" How, then, would the honourable member in such circumstances apportion the amount to be paid ? It could not be determined on the basis of time, nor could it be on the basis of distance. A sailing vessel might take a week in some circumstances to cover 500 miles, and in others she might cover it in two days, so that the amount to be deducted could not be determined on the basis Of either time or distance. Where the practice has been to pay a lump sum "" on the run,"" the seamen should receive the full amount, even if they are prevented by a wreck trom completing the contract. fusion that may have arisen is due to the fact that we have departed from the terms Of the New Zealand Act. Sub-clause 1 agrees with a provision in the New Zealand Act upon which it appears to have been founded, as well as upon the Imperial Act. That provides that in the case of a wreck, the seamen shall be entitled to their wages, under the agreement, up to the time of the disaster. I have always thought that that is rather hard on the seamen. It was pointed out in the evidence during the Titanic inquiry that some of the sailors were given a fewpounds by passengers, because they had lost everything, and their pay had ceased from the time of the wreck. In sub-clause 2 we have departed from theNew Zealand Act, under which only a proportion is paid where the service of theseamen engaged on the run terminates byreason of the wreck or loss of the ship.. The New Zealand Act provides that where a seaman whose services are terminated by. the wreck or loss of the vessel has been engaged by the run, he shall be entitled to a proportionate part of his wages. Here we provide that he shall be entitled to the whole of them. Since the New Zealand Act provides for the payment of a proportionate part, it is to be assumed that it ispossible to find out, in relation to time, at all events, what ought to be the proportion paid on the destruction of the vessel. in a penniless condition. orable member.

I ask the Minister to bring the definition into line with the Imperial Act. It will be noticed that some of the provisions of the Bill were framed before the awards of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court, tice Higgins, for instance, a seaman, in addition to his wages, is entitled to a free passage to his home port.

We are endeavouring to do our best for the men, but they should take the responsibility for their own actions. It was suggested to me several times, when this Bill was before another place, that there should be some special provision in regard to the offence of drunkenness. 1 hope it is not correct, but it is said that drunkenness, especially on the part of firemen, is largely on the increase on the Australian coast; and a suggestion has been made that",49,Smith Woul D Not He Be Evidence To Show That The Person Was Em

It ought to be known that this is a distinct offence, and a provision such as I suggest would have a moral effect. and Customs) [6.10] -Whateve r may have been the case in the past, there is less disposition now to accept drunkenness as an excuse for dereliction of duty. The penalty of £ 2 0 is, of course, the maximum. In the Articles of Agreement which are in vogue at present, it is provided that any member of the crew who, in the opinion of the master or officers, is under the influence of liquor, or behaving in a disorderly manner, may, in lieu of the fine of 5s elsewhere provided in the agreement, for a first offence, be instantly dismissed at ther on. It cannot be urged, therefore, that the master's option, if in port, and, if at sea, after logging, at the first port of call. put by the honourable member for Kooyong is not altogether covered by the amendment of the Minister, which deals with inability to properly perform duty by reason of drunkenness, and, so far as failure to join the ship is concerned, meets the circumstances. If , however, the man is on the ship, the only thing that can be done is to fine him 5s. for a first offence. The honourable member for Kooyong points out that a substantial loss may be caused by the drunkenness, and that ""there ought to be a higher penalty than a mere fine of Minister) [6.14] I ask the honourable member not to press the suggestion, and I do so in the interests of seafaring men generally. I do not think it would be quite fair in an Act of Parliament to particularly brand firemen or seamen as persons too freely addicted to drink. There are clauses already in the Bill under which ample punishment can be meted out for drunkenness. I think we should look at this alleged offence of drunkenness a little leniently. I do not say it is the fault of the Government, but half of our seafaring men who are charged with drunkenness have been simply drugged and poisoned. It would be much better if the authorities would take one-half the trouble they do over the drunkenness, in order to insure that our sailors are not treated in this way. Sailors, I am sorry to say, are regarded as the legitimate prey of certain classes of the community, and people generally regard the position with indifference. It would appear as if laws were passed simply to ornament the statute-book, and we ought to see that firemen and sailors get something like a "" fair deal"" without piling up penalties against them. I should be very sorry to brand any section of the community unnecessarily with any particular offence, but we cannot ignore the fact that it so frequently does exist so far as certain seamen are concerned. As regards the Honorary Minister's objection to putting a reference to it in an Act of Parliament, I remind him that a much more serious offence, relating to embezzling or wilfully damaging! cargo, stores, or equipment, is mentioned a few clauses furthe seaman will suffer any un3ue detriment by the insertion of the suggested provision, while it is thought that it might have a good moral effect. believe this Bill will do away, to a large extent, with crimping, and thus remove a great deal of the temptation to certain people to make sailors drunk or drug them. The Bill will, therefore, have a beneficial effect in that direction, and the ship-owners, will be benefited also by its passage. Amendment agreed to. [6.18] -On e of the offences specified is "" absence without leave from duty.""

What would suggest incompetency? A cook reported upon might merely have failed to please those for whom he was cooking on a rough day, while almost anything might be construed as misconduct.

The Board of Trade took exception to many provisions in this B ill ; torney-General) [8.39] -There is nothing but, as a matter of fact, some of these have since been adopted, and made part of the British law. For instance, the clause dealing with allotment notes was objected to, but it has since been accepted by the House of Commons. The Board of Trade, however, takes no exception to this penalty, which applies only to vessels in the Australian trade, and British ships, until they are registered here, will not come under the clause. ships, and I do not think the penalty is too high. not wish to deal with the point raised by the Minister, because the argument of that honourable gentleman seems to answer itself. There is, however, a curious anomaly in the clause. In the first place, it applies to the master or owner of a foreign-going ship, and he has to keep a supply of medicine as ordered by the Minister. I understand that the Minister will merely order the same sort of medicine as is required by the British Board of Trade. While this clause applies to foreign-going ships, the master is the only man who is fined if he does not comply, although, perhaps, this may not be due to bis own fault. We have a pious expression of opinion, which we cannot enforce, that if the master is convicted traliathrough the act or default of the owner, the master may recover the penalty and costs from the owner. How can we say what is to happen in the owner's country, 10.000 or 12,000 miles away? Could we arrest the ship when the master is convicted through no fault of his own? Could he recover the penalty and costs from the owner in an Australian Court? could a master recover the penalty and costs? In a foreign country, I take it, although this Bill will give him no power in any country beyond the Commonwealth. pend "" very considerably; and I desire to know exactly what the clause means. If the master cannot recover in an Australian Court, the clause is, as I have said, merely the expression of a pious hope, for the Bill does not give one iota of claim in any other country. Of course, the Bill binds the Australian owner, but the foreign owner is in a different position, unless we can arrest the ship; and I do not know how we stand legally in that regard. novel in this proposal, which places a captain in exactly the same position that he is in under the Immigration Restriction Act. If a prohibited immigrant lands, the captain is liable to a penalty of £ i o o ; and what happens to him afterwards-whethe r he recovers the penalty from the owner of the ship or anybody else-is , of course, a matter for the master himself. We are providing for our own this clause hold out any hope to the master that he can proceed in an Australian Court, against a foreign owner? Can the ship be held as a guarantee for the costs and damages recoverable under this clause? we have any jurisdiction over the foreign owner.

In the case of British ships it has been found, quite unnecessary to require any deposit for a sick seaman left behind, because the Merchant Shipping Act makes full provision for such cases. The superintendents throughout the Dominions are authorized to pay the whole of the expenses incurred on behalf of any such man, vouchers being forwarded to the Board of Trade, which collects the amount from the owners. This system works well, and, therefore, there is no necessity for the subclause. Amendment agreed to. rather hard to follow these long medical clauses. Sub-clause 3 deals with apprentices and seamen who are left on shore in any place in Australia, by reason of sickness or accident on an Australian registered ship. It is provided that there shall be a deposit of the full amount of the wages due to the seaman to the end of his engagement, for a period not exceeding three months, and, in addition, the medical expenses are paid. At the end of the clause it is provided that, in lieu of the express benefits which I have mentioned, a seaman may elect to be sent back to his home port, and receive all the wages due, the medical expenses also being paid. In other words, a seaman gets all the wages up to the time he is left on shore, and his medical attendance paid for, while he may request to be sent to the port of shipment. My attention has been called to the fact that this clause is anomalous; and it appears to some that to give three months' wages is rather too much. I do not so much object to that, though I desire to call attention to the fact that a seaman may, under the Seamen's Compensation Act, be getting compensation, the amount of which is half of his wages, in addition to the benefit of this Bill. I have once or twice drawn the Minister's attention to the fact that it is really necessary to read this legislation in the light of Acts passed and awards made since the Bill was drafted, and since the Senate dealt with it. Last year we passed an Act under which the seaman would be very properly entitled, in case of accident, to half his average wages for twelve months, up to a period of about three years. Therefore, in. addition to the benefits of this clause, he will receive half his wages. In other words, he will receive all his wages up to three months, as well as medical attendance under the Bill, and half wages under the Seamen's Compensation Act. It is also necessary to look at the conditions of recent awards in connection with shipping, because, so far as our local jurisdiction is concerned, we are really duplicating the benefits in some cases where the award is in relation to Inter-State shipping, and possibly where it relates to Intra-State shipping. The jurisdiction upon Intra-State snipping, however, is a matter upon which the High Court has yet to give a decision. I do not wish to move an amendment, but I do not know whether the Minister is aware that he is giving these double benefits. and Customs) [8.47] -As we struck out a clause duplicating the punishment for an offence by seamen, 1 do not think there is any idea that they should obtain double benefit from two Acts. I shall look into the point raised by the honourable member for Angas. While it is possible that a seaman may decide which Act he will take advantage of, I do not think he can get the benefit of both. [8.48J -There is something to be said in favour of the contention of the honourable member for Angas; but a provision of this kind is very desirable, as is shown by my own experience. On one occasion, having signed for a round voyage, I had been about fifteen months on the ship, and we put into Colombo after leaving Mauritius, where I , with one or two other members of the crew, had developed fever. I was sent ashore to the hospital at Colombo. I had only a canvas suit on at the time, all my other clothes being kept on board, and the master of the ship received orders to sail to another place. When he left, he was under the impression that I would be a dead man within four hours. However, I recovered, and after eight weeks in the hospital was discharged as cured.

I wanted to obtain further employment, because I was left without money or clothes. I had to spend six weeks on that steamer living on top of a deck house, with a coiled hawser for my sleeping place, and was landed in London without a penny. I went to the agents for the owners of my ship, and explained my position to them. pathy with me, they refused to recognise any claim on my part, in the absence of identification. The ship was at that time somewhere in Indian waters, and I have never received my wages from that day to this. I can appreciate a provision of this kind being inserted in the Bill to prevent others from undergoing a similar experience. hope the moving story of the honourable memher for Lang will not blind us to the statement of the honourable member for Angas that we may possibly be doublebanking with regard to some of this legislation. It is essential that the interests of seamen should be safeguarded, either by this clause or some award. I should prefer to see it done by statute; but we do not want a system of double payment of hospital expenses and sick pay.

The nature of the trade in which they are engaged, and the shallowness of the rivers and river -entrances, make it necessary to construct vessels of peculiar design, with very small draft, on board which space is naturally at a premium. Of course, Parliament cannot consider only the commercial interests connected with shipping; the best accommodation possible should be provided for the officers and men employed on these vessels; but, in view of the fact that they cannot afford to greatly curtail their present cargo space, and that increased demand will be made on their accommodation by the increase of the size of their crews in many cases, we should not be too exacting in our requirements. be compelled to provide such accommodation .as may be prescribed. refer are not river and bay ships, but small steamers trading from Brisbane and Sydney to the rivers on the north coast of New South Wales.

I have pointed out before that the conditions an effort has been made to comply with its of life on vessels for seamen can be much improved, especially in new vessels, without much addition to the prime cost of construction. The crews' quarters should be situated above deck, preferably in the after part of the ship. This position will enable their quarbeen much increased. ters to be provided with skylights and adequate means of ventilation. Ventilation means the Tegular supply of fresh air to the inhabited spaces without the creation of a draught, and the extraction of the foul air so that the carspace has to be provided. Under this -Bill, bonic acid gas, & c , shall be constantly removed, and the quantities not allowed to increase beyond a recognised low percentage, while the relative quantity of oxygen in the air may be as high as possible. The present regulations of the Board of Trade merely insist on the provision of a ventilator, which is -often situated over a berth, and is generally stopped up from below, or the external opening is covered up with canvas. Complaints are made of the degeneracy of the seamen found on board British ships. They can indeed do little else but degenerate under the present conditions. Persons who travel by steamer, and are enabled to sleep in state-rooms below deck, are often only too cognisant of the imperfect ventilation found in ordinary steamers even under such favorable circumstances where the stateroom is inhabited usually for only a few hours at night. They can easily imagine the condition of the seamen, shut up in quarters below deck which are practically _ in constant use posals to which the Board of Trade obas a sleeping, living, and dining room, generally dark, dirty, damp, and encumbered with clothing.

466,Sir Robert Best (Kooyong) [9.21].,"advance in a very proper direction. The Commonwealth Navigation Bill, of 1904, followed the Merchant Shipping Act of 1894, and it required that provision should be made for only 72 cubic feet of air space. That Bill was subsequently referred to a Commission, of which the present Attorney-General was a prominent member, and the Commission made a recommendation, in which I most heartily concurred, that a minimum of 120 cubic feet of space should be provided. That goes even a little further than the Imperial Merchant Shipping Act, which, as I have said, provides for 120 cubic feet per man, less bathroom and messroom accommodation. The New Zealand Act has a like provision. Under this Bill, we have gone one step further. The Minister has very fairly said that it is quite in favour of 72 cubic feet. The Commisimpossible in a Bill of this kind to provide for every class of vessel. The small trading craft referred to by the honourable member for Darling Downs may, in many cases, suffer considerable hardship, but the Minister has, very fairly, promised that if he can meet their case, he will do so; that he will not wantonly inflict hardship on the owners. Apart from that feature of the situation, which has been dealt with by the honourable member for Darling Downs, I ask the Minister whether we are not surpassing anything that has been suggested in this direction by proposing to require that 140 feet of space shall be provided? I am prepared to listen to a justification of this proposal, but I do not know that anything has transpired since the Royal Commission reported, and since the British and New Zealand Acts were passed, that would necessarily justify the proposal to increase the accommodation from 120 to 140 cubic feet. We must provide for the most comfortable accommodation that can be afforded our seafaring friends, but consistently with the inquiry that has already taken place, I submit that we ought not to unnecessarily penalize ship-owners by requiring that a minimum accommodation of 1:40 cubic feet shall be provided. We must recognise that this means a decrease in the carrying capacity of every vessel. proposed increase of accommodation for the crew will make a difference in the case of the Kyarra, to which I referred in my second reading speech, of ,£3,500 in the matter of freight. It is unwise to unduly penalize the owners unless there is complete justification for this proposed extension. The only justification yet offered is for an increase of the present accommodation to 120 cubic feet. To increase it beyond that point means to unnecessarily penalize the ship-owners and also the public, because the cost will be passed on to the public. 1 am not going to propose any amendment, but I expect to hear from the Minister a statement showing that the recommendation of the Commission that 120 cubic feet should be provided was too low. ney-General) [9.30] -There are one or two phases of this matter that ought to be looked at. The Royal Commission was guided by the evidence, a summary of which shows that of the witnesses on this point, three were in favour of 140 cubic feet, eleven in favour of 120 cubic feet, eleven in favour of 100 cubic feet, and six sion, as I say, had to be guided by the weight of evidence, which was not in favour of 140 cubic feet. At that time there was a tradition, very strongly held by all seafaring men, that, foT some inscrutable reason, Providence had ordained, from the beginning, 72 cubic feet of space for seamen. That was the space provided for in the Merchant Shipping Act, and had been so provided from the beginning. At the Navigation Conference a discussion arose on this very point, and the question of applying this space to all British ships arose. The representative of the shipowners, Mr Hill, and others, including 1 Captain Chalmers, of the Trinity Board, all assured us that 72 cubic feet was ample, and that the conditions under which seamen lived were everything that could be desired. But as the Minister of Trade and Customs has pointed out, there has been a change in England, where the space of 120 cubic feet has been adopted, although it was then scoffed at as impossible. It is perfectly proper, I contend, for us, who live in a semi-tropical and tropical country, to ask for 20 cubic feet more. ships do a good deal of tropical work? This but our trade is practically wholly within the tropics. cubic feet, under the British Act, is subject to deductions for bath-room and messroom accommodation. true; but I should hesitate to affirm the principle that we must follow the English Statutes in every respect; we have seen too",59,Smith Woul D Not He Be Evidence To Show That The Person Was Em

It is such a room that no sixpenny against the 120 cubic feet in the Imperial lodging-house would be able to let, except Act. We know that from the space alto a derelict; and it is suggested that the lowed under the Imperial Act, deductions accommodation is so extremely restricted are made for mess-room and bath-room acon some vessels that officers cannot be procommodation ; so that we may take it that vided with such space. that is true in many cases, though in some not recommend the air space provided in cases it possibly is true.

[10.0] I am prepared to amend the amendment to apply to ships exclusively engaged in trade in tropical waters.

Franklin can bear me out in saying that' on the Warregoa vessel which was trading exclusively in tropical and sub-tropical waters, running from Brisbane to Cooktown, thence to Thursday Island, and the ports in the Gulf of Carpentaria-tb e officers' quarters were perfect ovens.

He knows as well as I do how extremely bad some of these conditions can be, and actually are, at the present day. I was surprised, after not having come in close contact with vessels of that description for many years, to find We must make provision that vessels which should have been broken up twenty years ago were still running on the Australian coast, and subsidized, too, by the Commonwealth.
