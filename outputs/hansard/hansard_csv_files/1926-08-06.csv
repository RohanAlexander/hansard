30,Mr Brennan (Batman) [11.161,"this debate that we want good roads. As a matter of fact, we all want good things generally; but the first question that we must ask in regard to the bill is whether we can afford the good roads that we want, and the second is whether the money which we have to invest would be expended in the wisest possible way under the proposals before Parliament. I remind the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) that he is oledged to a policy of economy, or at least he was so pledged when he occupied another and less conspicuous position in this Chamber. Sometimes I think that since he became Treasurer he has forgotten that pledge, but it still remains. I am a great believer not only in the abstract policv of good roads but also in practical pro-, posals for opening up this country, and in making sacrifices to do it, to enable those who are bearing the heat and burden of the day in connection with primary production to bring their produce to market, and to make life more endurable and more enjoyable for them. I would remind the Treasurer that the scheme of main roads which this bill envisages is in the nature of a national luxury, and that this nation, since the war, is heavily in pawn. We have become accustomed to speaking carelessly in terms of millions, and the phrase ""What is a million?"" which once caused some astonishment members would have to be changed in more modern times to "" What are ten millions?"" to produce anything like the same effect. This nation, since the war and arising out of it, is in pawn to the god Moloch, whose interests we served for over four dreadful and tragic years. Although we are a protectionist country -a t least it may be taken that we have accepted that as our policy, and I think that all sections of the House believe in it-w e have to remember that the inflated revenues that we are receiving through the Customs under a protectionist tariff are unnatural. We must, if necessary, cease to expend with prodigal flamed against increasing taxation and hand and unthinking mind the millions that we are receiving through the Customs and by means of loans, and cease to live as we are living to-day, in an age of luxury and extravagance, because the time may come-and I very much fear that it will-whe n the Customs revenue will fall, and once the debacle begins it will be rapid and complete. protection then. the protectionist policy is beginning to operate as such instead of as a revenue producing oolicy. At the moment, because of our conditions of living, certain persons are able to flood this country with imports desnite even the highest protective duties that we have imposed. That condition is naturallv and necessarily temporary and uncertain, and so soon as protection really begins to operate as such, these inflated and extravagant revenues of to-day must naturally and necessarily fall. that. But no statesman would say that our existing unnatural conditions will last indefinitely. SoI say to the distinguished gentlemen on the other side who have so' light-heartedly produced the conditions of debt and difficulty under which we are living to-day, and under which generations still unborn must labour for 100 or 200 years, even under the most favorable circumstances-becaus e the produce of the labour of the workers of this among honourable country is being thrown into the open jaws of the god Moloch-that we cannot rightly, though we may in fact, have both prodigality and luxury in the one generation. This country must eat the husks before it will be entitled to participate in the fatted calf. It appears to think that it enjoys some special privilege by virtue of the fact that its loans and unnatural revenues are enormous, enabling it to live in a welter of expenditure as though its conditions were natural and permanent, whereas, in fact, they are clearly unnatural and bound to be temporary. It is, in these circumstances, when the public mind is inits burden-and rightly so, in view of the swollen revenues of this countrythat the Treasurer proposes to add a super-tax to that burden. The taxation outlined in the bill will fall largely upon industries and production, and has not the justification which a wise, protective duty could be argued to have.",16,Federal Aid Roads Bill Second Reading

That is merely a preamble, and is not an enacting part of the measure. It is merely an historical declaration of the facts framed by the persons responsible for the measure to explain its meaning and to justify, if possible, its introduction. He then turned to section 96 of In that act there are all the essentials of the Constitution, which readsDuring a period of ten years after the estabmeasure imposes restrictions on the lishment of the Commonwealth, and thereafter States which were not in the former; until the Parliament otherwise provides, the there is the necessity for the apParliament may grant financial assistance to proval of the Commonwealth Minister, any State on such terms and conditions as the and provision for the supervision and Parliament thinks fit.

40,Mr Brennan,"I accept the rightchoice of the class of roads for which this subvention is to be used, and for complete co-operation between the States and the Commonwealth. It is clear that the States cannot receive this money without parliamentary sanction, and it follows that, under the act as under the bill, the 'States must come forward. I submit, therefore, that the argument of the honourable the Attorney-General, in which he would distinguish between these two measures on constitutional grounds, is much too attenuated to be convincing. I was struck by the interjection of the honourable member for Forrest( Mr Prowse), who, when the Attorney-General was speaking, asked, "" If that preamble had been in the act, would it have been all right?"" or words to that effect. The Attorney-General said, with commendable astuteness, that he would deal with that point later; and presumably he proposes to deal with it at the meeting of the League of Nations. The point I am endeavouring to make is that if one of these measures is constitutional, the other is also constiof industry and the operation of the tutional, and if one of them is outside the powers of the Constitution, the other is also outside those powers. My opinion is -and I state it with great humility, and with respect for the learned jurists who are bound to differ on this point-that both of them are outside the constitutional powers of this Parliament. I confess that I have not argued the point before, and I would probably not have argued it now if the Attorney-General, who is the responsible law officer of the Crown in this Parliament, had not challenged honourable members to say a word or two about it. Section96 of the Constitution contemplates the existence of necessitous States, such as-ca n I name them without giving offence?-ou r friendly allies in the federation, Tasmania and Western Australia. Of both of them. I wish to speak with a marked respect, in striking contrast to the language of one right honourable member, whom I shall not name for fear of bringing him into discredit in the island State, where he may sometimes go for a holiday. It contemplates that condition, though I would not say that necessity was a condition precedent, and the handing over of money by the Commonwealth to the States to give effect to their policy within the terms of the State constitutions. It does not contemplate giving effect to a policy formulated by the Commonwealth for the States, and to that extent imposed upon them. should initiate the policy. initiate and formulate the policy in respect of which the money is paid. It is curious that honourable members on the Government side, who have been so lamentably slow to support the Labour party in seeking amendments of the constitutional powers, should be so ready themselves to embark on the troubled and dangerous waters of doubtful constitutional practice, and in that way to invite constitutional difficulties and litigation. They should have learnt 'by this time that this Constitution of ours, unhappily, is not a flexible instrument, but is a painfully rigid one. Its rigidity has cost luckless litigants in this country many thousands of pounds, and, more important still, has hampered the development peacemaking tribunals created by this Parliament. The honourable the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) was eloquent in his criticism of a former Nationalist Government for departing from the best traditions of constitutional government; but he has been the readiest, the most cheerful offender in doing what he has so strongly condemned in others. I realize the serious limitations which our Constitution imposes on us, and therefore I have, on more than one occasion, advocated the amplification of our constitutional powers. But I also counsel respect for the Constitution while it remains, and which the distribution of powers between the States and the Federation is still part of our scheme of government. If the Labour policy were given effect, and we had in this country a unified system of government such as that policy foreshadows, with delegated powers in local governing bodies, it is more than likely that one of the functions that would be assigned to those bodies would be the making of roads. I do not despise the work of the present municipalities in road making. It is true that the limitation of their powers and their purse hampers their activities; but, as intelligent and economical road makers and road maintainors, the municipalities,",18,Federal Aid Roads Bill Second Reading
41,Mr Hughes,"In short, the States",19,Federal Aid Roads Bill Second Reading
42,Mr Brennan,"The States shouldand in Victoria the Country Roads Board, too, which operates as an instrument of the State Government, have done extremely good work. It should be borne in mind that the function of road making and road maintaining is bound up with railways and railway administration. A t present an unfortunate competition is developing between road and railway transit. Competition is good in its way, but national transport should be controlled by an authoritative body, .operating in the interests, not of private firms or companies, but of the people. The right honourable the Prime ter, in the course of an impassioned speech on Tuesday to show, as he said, exactly he stood in regard to this bill. may stood on Tuesday evening, but, if he did, he showed that he stood in a different place from that which he previously occupied; and I understand that if he sets out to-day to show his present it will be another modification position as defined on T'uesdnv evening.

Mr Brennan. supposed to have learned, therefore, from the joint and several utterances of these .distinguished spouses at the head of the Government, that, at the time, it was clearly intended that the tax should be levied on petrol-driven road vehicles. The right honourable gentleman has asked for clear thinking on this question. I have endeavoured to apply a little clear thought to it , and, as a result, I am of opinion that a duty of 2d. a gallon on imported benzine would affect many other people beside the users of petrol-driven road vehicles. MinisThinking over the matter has also, apparently, enabled the PrimeM in ievening, set out ster to clarify his own position, because where when he spoke on Tuesday night, he He assured the House and the country that have shown exactly where he his proposal would need to be modified in many important particulars.

Others did not, because there was much in the argument of the right honourable gentleman with which we on this side entirely agree.

May I also remind him that although this toll is being paid largely by his friends and supporters in the Country and National parties, and although the swallowing up of small companies, of which he made a feature, and the levying of a toll on the primary producers, have been going on for years, hitherto he and the members cf his party have remained unmoved. This levy on the oil used to drive the machinery of the primary producer did not begin to be felt until the.right hontively, and then I watched the orable gentleman got piqued when he saw himself thwarted in carrying out his road policy. will admit that the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited has been'progressively moving towards curbing the activities of the importers. per cent, of the total oil requirements of Australia? The right honourable gentleman had better not challenge me upon the operations of that enterprise, in which the Commonwealth Government has allied itself with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, which also is a large importer of oil. Some day when I have done with wireless matters and the Marconi business I may have pleasure in moving a censure motion in connection with the Commonwealth's association with the Anglo Persian Oil Companyi n order to see if it would not be wise to prick that bubble also. What has caused the change ? Because, undoubtedly, the position has changed. To the right honourable gentleman it is no longer a question of the terrific toll on the various countries of the world, or the extent to which stait is only tionary engines and aviation engines in Australia have been levied upon. What really actuated him in uttering his denunciation on Tuesday was the fact that a representative of this great importing trust had threatened to withdraw his election support from him.

The terrific toll levied on the people of this country might have been borne, the levy on the farmers' oil engines might have been suffered, but that any one should threaten the right honourable gentleman with the withdrawal of been given with much generosity and liberality in the past, was indeed terrible. Probably he expected Labour applause, and he was surprised that it was qualified and moderate, even though some in the ranks of Tuscany did applaud a little.

That question requires a little consideration. He should not penalize his quondam friends for doing what he and his honourable colleague, the Treasurer, undoubtedly foreshadowed and intended. be no doubt that the Government intended to pass this tax on to the road users of petrol machines. Let us be honest and -consistent about the matter. If this were a protectionist levy which would benefit the whole community honourable members on this side of the chamber would be supporting it far more heartily and unitedly than honourable members opposite; but its protectionist intution Act; but I value the work done by cidence is utterly insignificant. matter of fact, it is a super tax. I should like to know what the Commonwealth Oil Refinery has to do with taxes on chassis and tires; but that point seems to have been overlooked by the Government. I remember seeing in the Melbourne Herald newspaper some little time since the picture of a motor car with arrows pointing to all the parts of it which were subject to heavy taxation. There can be no doubt whatever that this is a super tax and a revenue, but not protective, duty. I was reared upon the land, and for some years endeavoured to carve a living out of it, so naturally I have a deep and abiding sympathy with those who have to use bad roads. I believe that one of the most practical means of developing a .country is to provide it with means of transport and outlet. have the courage and patriotism to go into our undeveloped areas with the object of making a living for themselves deserve superabundant consideration and support. But that is not the question here. We already have an overflowing treasury, and distribute millions of money with prodigal handsa million for one bounty here, and a million for another there-withou t any consideration of the huge debts that are mounting up. We seem, by a reverse method of reasoning, to disregard our mounting debts in proportion to their rate of increase. In times of greater prosperity and solvency than these we should regard this proposal as utterly outrageous and unthinkable. My view is that roads should be dealt with by the State authorities. For that reason no very great objection was offered to the original proposals of the Government to pay subventions to the States, within certain well defined limitations, for the purpose of road making. Under the old arrangement of the States and municipalities retained a greater meaThere can sure of control of their roads. This Parliament has more than enough to do, without embarking upon an enterprise like this, the constitutional authority for which is extremely doubtful. It is true that we are looking for the amendment of our Constitution along lines which have proven urgently necessary to give effect to the concept of government of the original framers of the ConstiAs a our municipalities and other local governing bodies generally, and, from that point of view, these proposals and the methods by which the Government proposes to raise the money tb give effect to them, are utterly objectionable to me. The attitude of the Labour party in regard to trusts and combines cannot be misunderstood any more than can our roads developmental policy. We do not believe that we have any right under our Federal system to infringe the prerogative of the States, although we give place to none in our antipathy and hostility to trusts and combines. Nothing that the right honourable gentleman has said or can say will prevent us viewing these things in their correct perspective. Under our Federal system we should respect the rights of the States. If , bearing that in mind, we can, Those who by equitable means, secure for the people good roads, we intend to do so; but we do not consider that possible by means of the proposals now before us. The Attorney-General( Mr Latham) said the other day that the Commonwealth Parliament should deal with national matters, and that these were enumerated in the Constitution. My reply is that road making is not mentioned there. And if there is any matter that can be dealt with effectively by local authorities, it is road making. I shall vote against this bill. I shall do so on many grounds, some of which have already been referred to by other speakers in this debate. Tbe principal ground for my objection I say at once is that which was stressed with such force by the last speaker, the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan).

53,Mr Watt (Balaclava) [12.15],"are essentially and exclusively, under the constitutional powers of the respective parliaments of this country, State concerns. This measure is an intrusion into the domain, of the States. necessary. misleading; and that it will eventually prostitute, and be harmful to, the States. I do not desire under present conditions to see an essential function of the States, which most of them discharge as well as they can with the money they have, weakened in any way. I believe this measure to be distinctly unconstitutional. I read the Constitution as a layman, and not as a lawyer. Those of us who are laymen in this Parliament, notwithstanding our administrative legislative experience, which is fairly extensive when massed in this House, have to admit that lawyers may see points, in cases and principles which have been determined, that may escape us. But I have followed up this matter a little. I have read the Constitution and the commentaries upon it, and I make no doubt whatever that this measure is a defiance of the* intention of section 96. any one wishes to be satisfied ou that point, he should read the debates of the Federal Convention. mean to say that the High Court will do that. what is contained within the four corners of an act; but, all the same, we must recall, so far as we can, the views and intentions of the founders of the Constitution, because it was upon their expressed intentions that, on its submission to the people, these gave it their approval by their votes in all of the States. From the point of Anew of the legislator who is not surrounded by the atmosphere of the law courts, but is responsible to the people, and should be responsive to their desires and wishes, we must take that consideration into account. It is perfectly clear that section 96 of the Constitution was framed to give the Commonwealtb Parliament power to help a necessitous State, and not, by largesse, to debauch the States and persuade them from the discharge of their functions. The power conferred in section 96 is a very proper power. A practically similar power is contained in the Constitution of the United States of America, and iu some others. It was felt that the central and national Mr Watt. parliament should have the.power, if a particular State were in difficulties, either because of its association with the Federation or from any other cause, to vote It is unmoney from the national revenue to help I think it is wicked and it. But it was never imagined by any one 25 years ago that this power would be used as an instrument of subversion of the Constitution, depending and relying upon the cupidity of the expected recipients to induce them to abandon their constitutional rights, powers, responsibilities, and duties. That is exactly what is being done when this extremely liberal, and, I think, unwise offer is made to the States. and The honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) has referred to the different interpretations of the constitutional position given to the House by the Attorney-General,' first, as a private member, and later as Attorney General. I dealt with that at some length in my remarks on the budget, and I see nothing in the subsequent address of the Attorney-General to cause me to change If the views I then expressed. I cannot for the life of me see how a lawyer, giving an opinion as a lawyer, can take so I do not widely different a vision of these two measures-that of 1923 and this of the The High Court asks merely present year. I am not prepared to accept the ipse dixit of the Attorney-General. The honourable gentleman did not tell us whether he offered his latest opinion as a political Minister learned in the law, but I think we are entitled to know that. Only the other day,, in answer to a question concerning his intervention in a case before a court, the honourable and learned gentleman did distinguish between his dual responsibilities and duties. That distinction was not new to members who have studied the judicial functions of an Attorney General. The honourable gentleman's statement was historically correct, with the exception of one phrase which he used in reply to the question submitted to him. He said that he was not responsible to Parliament in one aspect of his duality. What a ridiculous statement. There are innumerable cases.. I could cite several, and I intend to cite one, in which in Great Britain, the home of constitutional principles, this duality of the position held by the Attorney General was distinctly recognized by the authorities; but it has never been separated from politics. The latest case is that is not fair comment, but it is a serious in which the Ramsay MacDonald Governcharge against the chief law officer of ment withdrew a prosecution against a the Crown to say that he gave an opinion communist editor on the judicial advice in law which was tainted with political of Sir Patrick Hastings, then Attorneybias.

"" misled "". the right honourable gentleman's remarks left on my mind. gentleman must himself be responsible for that. I did not say that. WhatI say is that when this law officer who is half politician and half lawyer gives an opinion in connection with this measure which commits him to the stultification of 'an opinion he gave formerly upon an almost similar bill, I decline to take his ipse dixit. That is all I say. I do not hesitate to express the belief that this bill can be challenged. I believe it will be challenged. AnythingI can do to cause it to be challenged before a proper tribunal will be done if the measure passes. Let those finally responsible for the determination of the matter decide it by having it brought deliberately before them. We have this extraordinary paradox. We threaten to withdraw a substantial sum of money from the States, in connection with another measure to which reference may be made, and almost simultaneously we bring along these gifts to debauch them. from the people of the States. not be taxed from anybody else; although, if the gifts were made to the people who contribute the money, the bill would have one defect less than it has at present. It is surely an extraordinary paradox that we should propose to curtail the powers of the States by refusing them certain supplies, and should then endeavour to make them gifts and still further weaken them. Although the States may be in need of money to carry out this highway policy in more senses than one; and I use the axe and the fire-stick, used in the clearword advisedly. I say, without any doubt ing of land for the settler. It has about whatever, that this is a wrong procedure and a wrong policy. We propose both these paradoxical things. The passage of one of the measures ia delayed, and it probably will not be dealt with this session. The Government is, however, still pushing on with this bill. I do uot think that we are entitled to make the States, which are constituent parts of this nation of ours, the poor relations of the Commonwealth. I agree with the Treasurer in one phase of his argument, that it is necessary that we should gradually divorce certain financial relations that subsist to-day between the Commonwealth and the States, but we should do that in a proper way. We should not endeavour to hold the States in pawn to control them. We should allow them to 'function so far as their means will allow within the ambit of their own constitutions. They should not be vassals of the Commonwealth. If we wish to alter the constitution-and I am prepared to go much further in this direction than some members of the Opposition, though I am not in accord with some of the views they have expressed on the subject-le t us alter it in a proper way. It should be done by deliberate debate and decision of the two Houses of the national Parliament, whose decisions should be submitted for the sanction of the people. We should not do this work outside, but inside the constitutional limits set down. This bill is, I think, an attempt to get control of important State functions by the aid of patronage, gifts, bribery, and debauchery, which their very poverty has induced some of the states to accept. In introducing the bill, the Minister dealt at length with the examnle of America. It is astonishing how little literature is available in our libraries regarding the gradual advance of the financial relationships of the Republic with its constituent States. But I have dug into my memory for a number of facts promiscuously obtained and stored there, which, though they must be given vaguely, indicate that the parallel quoted by the Minister is false.

Australia's revenues are small; those of the United States of America are almost incalculable. of population are, as the honourable member for Batman rightly said, huge, and swollen by the war; those of the United States of America are probably the lightest in the world, relative to the power of its people to pay. Ever since, about 60 years ago, the crash following the American civil war broke the finances of the Republic, its exchequer has gradually risen to opulence. have been occasions when the Finance Committee of Congress did not know what to do with the swelling federal revenues; and it has been from year to year ladling out to the States subventions, bounties, and dividends. These facts are easily traceable in the literature that should be, but is not, obtainable in our parliamentary libraries. But the Republic is now becoming cautious, and is harking away from this policy. It is urging the discontinuance of a number of these bad practices, with a view to leaving the States financially free. I am able to quote evidence of that new tendency. President Coolidge, when submitting his budget measure to Congress in August, 1924, referred to the Federal aid to the States and economy, and concludedFor Federal aid to States the estimates proin America. vide in excess of 109,000,000 dollars. These subsidies are prescribed by law. I am convinced that the broadening of this field of activity is detrimental both to Federal and State Governments. Efficiency of Federal operations is impaired as their scope is enlarged. Efficiency of State Governments is impaired as they relinquish and turn over to the Federal Government responsibilities which are rightfully theirs. I am opposed to any expansion of these subsidies. My conviction is they can be curtailed with benefit both to tlie Federal and State Governments. That was his ODinion after he had been two years in office as President. This year he used these words when transmitting his 1927 budget to CongressI do, however, recommend for the consideration of the Congress that future legislation restrict the Government's participation in State road construction to primary or interstate highways, leaving it to the States to finance their secondary or intercountry highways. This would operate to diminish the amount of Federal contribution. After giving a general warning, President Coolidge said, in effect, "" I now become more specific; let us reduce these gifts; let us cut them down to half. We Australia's debts per head shall confine our aid to certain broad national highways."" But later on the inevitable tendency of thought on thc Finance Committee of Congress will prove itself; and these amounts will be further reduced, and, in that way, thu divorce of federal and State financeswhich the Treasurer is desiring of effecting in Australia-wil l be illustrated in the United States of America. If we are Indeed,. there to follow the example of the United States of America, are we to be guided by its past practice, which it admits .was prodigal and harmful, or its modern and more cautious tendency? I prefer the lattei. America has had experience of the ill effects of the policy of making subventions to the States, to which the federal authority was driven only because, while the national exchequer was overflowirg; some of the authorities which were charged' with the development of the territories ' and the new lands of the wes'tand middle-' west, were necessitous. But. the situation' is different now, and the federal authority is seeking to establish new and better con-'""' ditions. SoI pass by the Minister's illustration, which had been so elaborately prepared for him by his department. gentleman is not quoting the State view sident of the Republic, and I do not know that he ever sat in a State Parliament. At any rate, on both occasions he spoke as the head of the nation, and he is not associated with State administrations. As to the special source from which the money to be handed to the States is expected to come, the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) rightly said that the original statement by the Government was that the users of the roads were to pay for their construction, if not for their maintenance. But in the passion that has been generated by political and. economic opposition to certain phases of the new duty, the Prime Minister has since explicitly expressed the desire that the companies which import the petrol should bear the burden of the duty. That may be wise, if practicable, but it is not the ambition with which the bill. was.",26,Federal Aid Roads Bill Second Reading
78,Mr West,The right honourable,27,Federal Aid Roads Bill Second Reading
79,Mr Watt,"I have quoted the Prelaunched, and it is not in accordance with the statement made by the Minister when introducing it. Undoubtedly the wisest policy that can be adopted by any nation or State that has the duty of making and maintaining roads is to compel those who injure the rOads to pay for their construction and upkeep. originally promulgated by the Government ; but augered by the natural opposition of the very powerful interests which, I believe, have made enormous sums oi money out of the increase of motor traffic in Australia, the Prime Minister allowed himself to he diverted from his first intention, and now seeks to impose on the petrol importing companies the tax of 2d. per gallon. Whether the idea be good or bad, he cannot do that. the companies. more innocent than he looks. What can the Government do to compel those who control the bulk of the petrol supplies to pay that charge, or to prevent them from passing it on to the users? spoke as though the power rested with him. knows too much of business to imagine that. May I say without offence that he must have been a little hot under the collar if he did entertain that notion for a moment. No man who knows anything of business can fail to realize that'under prasent conditions the .people who control the supplies of this eminently needful commodity can, if they so arrange amongst themselves, pass the whole of the duty on to the consumer; and the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, making so microscopic a proportion of the distilled spirit that motor users require, will be incapable of preventing it. Tht position would be different if the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited could supply 50 per cent, of the community'3 requirements, but its output is equal to only 5 to 7 per cent, of the total consumption. Oil Refineries were producing more petrol, the revenue from the duty would be less. in this proposal. If the Commonwealth Oil Refineries oould supply the whole of the needs of the community, and the importing companies were driven out of business, the Commonwealth would not get the £1,500,000 that it expects to pay into a trust fund for subsequent distribution to the States. The calculation of the Minister for Trade ancl Customs that That was the policy the duty will yield only £.1,500,000 may be perfectly right, allowing for the expansion of the Commonwealth Oil Refineries. But the rise in petrol consumption has been phenomonal and romantic. It may be safely said that in three years it has trebled. rate of 30 per cent, per annum for the last three years. with the States is for ten years, and if this rate of increase continues, a revenue now estimated at £1,500,000 may become £3,000,000 or £5,000,000 per annum. Is the Commonwealth to continue to pay into the trust fund the whole of the proceeds of the duty of 2d. per gallon on imported motor spirit? If so, this Federal largesse, which already seems to the States alarmingly high, may be two or three times as great before the agreement expires. are capable of variation from year to year, according to the revenue that is being derived from the special duty. vernment will declare that it proposes to see that the yield will be only £1,500,000, and the limits it proposes are observed, I shall have one less objection to the scheme. That is a phase of the subject that should not be lost sight of. Men might cheerfully vote £1,500,000 when they will not vote £4,000,000. cient for the construction of roads now, it may not be sufficient when the numbers of people and vehicles have doubled. Moreover, it will be found, as all road makers know-and as a State member I had long experience of this subject-that whilst roads may be easily made, because Commonwealth money can be raised by loan for that purpose, their maintenance is a much more difficult problem. built in the first place. properly.

I had the honour of establishing the Country Roads Board of Victoria; we appointed to it the best men we could get, and they did the best work that has been done oh any roads in Australia. After ten years of experience, they will declare that their problem at all times is not construction, but maintenance-and maintenance means finance. The Commonwealth Parliament would, I presume, be just as much entitled to grant money for the maintenance of roads as for their construction, and I fear that, upon the proposed trust fund and the Federal Treasury, substantial demands will be made in future for the maintenance of these special roads, for which the States will not accept responsibility. should always be met out of revenue. perishable public works whose life is short. The maintenance of these special roads will fall upon the revenues of this Commonwealth unless we are careful. We are inducing the States to embark upon a national scheme of road construction, and if they are not able to keep in a proper state of repair the roads that are made, the maintenance will at some future time devolve upon the Commonwealth. the States must satisfy the Minister that proper provision is being made by them for maintenance services. is not the least innocent man in this Parliament, and he knows what that amounts to. monwealth liability cannot be increased beyond £2,000,000 per annum. continue for ten years. period of time thousands of miles of roadways may be constructed.

The Commonwealth, therefore, will have to maintain them, or let their surfaces revert to grass. It is as plain as the sun at noon-day that if developmental roads are built under this agreement, we shall be called upon to maintain them at some future time. Respecting the petrol tax, the Minister implied that the States should have known that the Federal duties were to be imposed. The Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), by interjection, said he thought that everybody knew that. He suggested that in his policy speech he made the matter clear to the people. I do not think that he is correct, because when reading his policy speech I , for one,assumed that there were many ways of raising money for this purpose. member assume that it would come out of existing revenue? Prime Minister made it clear that a certain proportion of it would be provided out of ordinary revenue and the balance from special Customs taxation. I ask the Treasurer whether he told the State Ministers that extra petrol duties were to be imposed? asked what new duties were to be imposed, and whether a tax would be put upon petrol, tires, and chassis, and we informed them that we could not say exactly how the necessary money would be raised until the Government's financial proposals had been brought down. Peacock, when the Government's proposals had been announced, said that they were not a surprise to him. the State Ministers were told of the Government's proposals under the lap, while public information was withheld; but if that is so, and information was divulged to certain people respecting the. tariff that would be brought before this During that House, it was grossly improper. were told that new taxation would be imposed, but that, obviously, its nature could not be disclosed before the proposals were brought down to the House. ister was awake and vigilant in respect of",28,Federal Aid Roads Bill Second Reading

109,Mr Watt,"I am glad that the Minthe protection of the tariff interests of this Parliament. I assumed from what was dropped hy the Prime Minister that every one was expected to know that a tax on petrol would be imposed. taxation would be imposed. which the States are adopting towards the. Government's proposals, my opinion is. that State action in matters of this , kind . should precede Federal action. -,That would have obviated the present ; -.extraordinary and humiliating spectacle „.of the Commonwealth Parliament being .asked to do certain things on the assurance of the Ministry that five out of six States had agreed to the Commonwealth's proposals, and then finding that gome of those States were not merely refusing to ratify, but were repudiating the agreement altogether. Our present position has come about either because of the haste with which this Government is rushing this legislation through, or because of delay on the part of the States. One .State has agreed to accept the agreement, because of its natural desire for money. The South Australian Parliament has passed a resolution against ths agreement, although it was the apparent desire of the Premier, Mr Gunn, and his Government to accept it . that resolution was passed by the South Australian Parliament, Mr Gunn wrote tt; the Commonwealth Government accepting the agreement. tbe procedure that was adopted in connection with the Murray Waters agreement. In that case, the States had to pass legislation before the Commonwealth Government ratified the agreement. I suggest that the present humiliating position of the Prime Minister and the Government could have been avoided if the State Parliaments had first been asked to ratify this agreement. I certainly object to the Government proceeding with the bill in the present anomalous and ridiculous circumstances. It cannot be wise to do so, whatever may be thought of the .arguments for or against the measure. This Parliament should call a halt and say to the States: "" Make up your minds, and then we shall deal with the problem. Our offer .stands."" That is the proper attitude for us to take, and I suggest to the Prime Minister that, lacking the time this session to give the measure leisurely and proper consideration, and in view of public requirements, he should place it again on the stocks until the States have arrived at unanimity respecting the Government's proposals. as it stands. I should not object , if the tax were continued so long as the moneys collected were placed in a trust fund, which, I understand, is the intention of the Government. I certainly object to the tax, because of certain iniquities associated with it. If the States had first been asked to ratify the agreement, we should not now be in our present unenviable position. I object to the petrol .tax mainly because I believe that we should do nothing to obstruct the growth of the use of motor vehicles, especially for commercial purposes. The present tax on all the motorist uses, and, in addition, the heavy State licence and registration fees, are more than sufficient for him to bear, compared with other users of the roads and taxpayers generally, despite the comparisons made by a Minister to a deputation. I object also to the agreement, because it leaves out roads in urban municipalities. I do this, not because I represent both inner and outer urban municipalities, but because probably 60 per cent, or 70 per cent, of the motor taxation and motor consumption taxation contemplated under these proposals will be raised within the urban .centres, and further, because of the great damage done to urban roads by motor vehicles. There are roads in the metropolitan areas that, three or four years ago, were for mile after mile like Collins-street pavements, but are now riddled with holes because of the motor traffic that passes over them. Under the agreement motorists of the urban centres will pay heavily to provide roads in the country and in other districts which they will rarely or never use. Those whom I represent are to heavily contribute money that is to be spent in other districts. in those municipalities in half their present numbers if it were not for those in the country.",29,Federal Aid Roads Bill Second Reading

They will go to the chartered libertines of the Labour party. will be carried to the polls in motor cars, while the supporters of the Nationalist party, who at the last election had a car placed at the disposal of nearly every voter, will have considerable difficulty in obtaining any at all. This tax., moreover, is unfair not only to certain municipalities, but also to certain States. I do not wish to take a provincial attitude, because I am not a parochialist. I am an Australian above all things. When I was a youngster I took an interest in politics and advocated the adoption of the Federal Constitution, and since then I have done my best to assist the growth of the Federation. I have served in both Commonwealth and State spheres, but I am not going to argue now for State rights. used to be a red-hot champion of State rights. honourable member is as as his passion. Under the agreement, Victoria will raise £5,600,000, and will benefit by only £3,600,000 Under the two-fifths calculation of the Treasurer, that State will hand £2,000,000 to the other States, and the amount will grow, until ultimately it may become £5,000,000 or more. South Wales has to raise £7,600,000, and will benefit by only £5,500,000. The distributions are to be made on the basis of area, and of population, and therefore Western Australia, Tasmania, and Queensland will greatly benefit. it back in subsidies. get anything from the sugar bounty, the cotton bounty, the duty on bananas. years New South Wales received in the way of special benefits, £875,000, Victoria about £1,000,000, and Western Australia next to nothing. ber can prove that, he will be the senior wrangler of this Parliament, and capable of winning the mathematical tripos. The principle of special taxation for earmarked purposes, to be levied from certainStates and given to others, has never been and cannot now be justified. New South Wales and Victoria, between them, contain probably 71 per cent, of the population of Australia, and they Their supporters-o i iroXXoiwill receive infinitely less proportionately to population than the States with small populations. For these reasons I intend to vote against the bill. The scheme is ill-considered and unnecessary, and it makes the Kingdom of Heaven, as the States see it , very hard to enter. I hope that what the honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan) said, at the beginning and closing of his remarks, will not be lost sight of by the Treasurer, who. before the year 1923, was one of the most eloquent advocates of economy. I have just been perusing the speeches that he made, including the "" loot "" speech, and it. is difficult for any one to imagine the change that has since occurred in his character and conduct. I say that not tcchide but to chaff him, and I venture to say that, before long, he will find it extremely hard to justify his position. He is not responsible for debts and commitments that were contracted prior to his becoming Treasurer, but, if he would put into operation only 50 per cent, of dangerous the theories that he so vigorously advocated when Leader of the Country Party, instead of making huge bounties and distributing largesse in every shape and form, as he has done since his elevation to Cabinet rank, he would be reducing the national expenditure. As the honourable member for Batman said, we are New living in an extravagant age. At this time of undoubted prosperity, we should make provision for those alternating periods of prosperity and depression which must inevitably come to Australia. As sure as God made little apples, we shall have periods of drought. If we get bad weather when the ship of government is under full sail, as it is now, I foresee a lot of trouble for those responsible for the government of this country. So soon as the necessity for retrenchment arises, the electors will inflict condign punishment upon those who have been guilty of misgovernment. The Government should not disregard this warning nor our past experience. It is certainly , time that we called a halt in expenditure, and refrained from voting extravagant sums to industries and to States in a way that the national treasury cannot possibly afford.

He said that communications had been sent to each of the State Governments asking them whether they adhered to the agreement arrived at by a conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers in February of this year, which five of them had subsequently written to say they fully accepted. The PrimeM in ister also said that the bill would be delayed to permit of replies being received from the States. Since then five replies have come to hand. The Premier of Queensland telegraphedYour wire to-day's date, Queensland Government intend submitting to Parliament a bill to ratify roads agreement made witb Commonwealth Government. Mr Collier, of Western Australia, wiredYour telegram, 2nd August, my Government adhered to its acceptance of scheme, and will submit agreement to Parliament as Government measure at earliest possible date. And from Tasmania the following has been received: Referring to your telegram, 2nd August, my Government is prepared to accept roads agreement. A bill for ratification is being introduced State Parliament early next week. Arrangements have been made by those three States for the passage of legislation to give effect to the agreement. In addition, the following telegram has been received from the Premier of South Australia :In view of resolutions which have been carried unanimously in both Houses of State Parliament emphatically protesting against the Commonwealth road proposals, this Government considers submission of agreement to Parliament for ratification would be futile.

Yet within a fortnight that Government has, through its official head, submitted a motion to the State Parliament for the repudiation of the agreement. I shall deal with that aspect of the matter later. The reply from the Premier of New South Wales wasFederal main roads grant. In reply your telegram yesterday, desire inform you it is not intention this Government confirm tentative agreement arrived at by conference Federal and State Ministers held Melbourne last February. In those circumstances the Government regards its course as clear. It will carry out the agreement as a national policy in those States where, the governments, in good faith , are introducing legislation to ratify the agreement. It will do tbe same as it did with the proposal to unify the railway gauges, which, when the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes) was Prime Minister, was agreed to by the Premiers in conference, and was subsequently repudiated by some of them. The Government believes that Australia cannot afford to have bad roads or an inefficient transport system. The increased cost of running motor traffic on bad roads is more than the cost of constructing and maintaining good roads. That has been proved by experience in other parts of the world. The Government considers that good roads, and an efficient transport system, are an essential, part of our machinery of national development and production. I should like to depart from thistheme for a moment to answer some criticisms of me by the ri»ht honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr. tain principles which I had enunciated as a private-member from the corner benches.

The increase in invalid and old-age pensions has added about £4,000,000 to the total annual expenditure of this country. I am not ashamed of that expenditure. The act which increased those pensions was greatly overdue, and I am glad that it will help the old and infirm people to have something like reasonable comfort in their declining years. My only regret is that it is not possible, because of the conditions of this country, to make their old age still easier for them. Defence is the only other item involving increased expenditure.

131,Dr. Earlepage,"I think I shallCommonwealth Government £560,000 under the agreement, That was actually admitted during the conference, and it was shown that at the present time New South Wales provides for main roads something like £819,000 for the county of Cumberland, and £1,151,000 for country main roads. Wales Minister for Works pointed out, the Government of New South Wales could use the amount required from that source to cover the money the Commonwealth Government was willing to place at the disposal of the State, without imposing additional taxation. He pointed out that by so doing that Government could continue and extend its programme. cipalities of New South Wales spent £3,320,000 in 1923-24, and £460,000 wa3 provided by the Government for roads. Much of the money provided by the Government came from motor fees, and the land-owners provided eight times as much as was provided by the motor users. When one knows that all over the world the volume of. traffic on the roads is 500 per cent, more than it waa a decade ago, one must admit that the road user should pay a proper contribution towards the cost of constructing and maintaining roads. Mr Lang's second objection is that towns with a population of over 5,000 are omitted from the scheme. In the discussion that took place, the only point of difference was as to whether towns of a population of 10,000 or 5,000 should be excluded. Ultimately the margin of 5,000 was fixed as a compromise acceptable by the States. Some of the States' representatives contended that the agreement should not include roads in any towns, and others that it should include roads through towns of only a certain size. This proposition which was largely arrived at as the result of a discussion among the State Ministers who are to handle, control, and construct the roads is not, as it has been absurdly stated, to create a Federal authority to override the States. Once a year the State Ministers will meet the Commonwealth Minister for Works and Railways, certificates will be given by the Commonwealth Works Engineer, and the Commonwealth Minister for Works and Railways has to give his approval of a main system of roadsroads of the type of the interstate roads Dr. Earle Page. referred to by President Coolidge in his communication to Congress, which was quoted by the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt). gest that the Commonwealth arbitrarily votes money to a particular State, and As the New South will have no control over its expenditure? programme of road construction has been agreed upon.

The third objection raised by Mr Lang, the Premier of New South Wales, is that the States cannot use this money for the maintenance of roads.: The purpose in raising this money is to construct new roads, and bring about a better system of main roads, which the Commonwealth insists should be properly maintained by the States. I should like to point out that this question was discussed very fully at the conference of Ministers, and Mr Calder, who is an authority on the subject, saidI am only guessing when I say that I think (in Victoria) the local authorities spend about £1,000,000 a year on roads. For the past few years, they have been so burdened in financing the main roads system that they have had to reduce their expenditure upon other roads to a minimum. Under the old system, the burden of providing for the construction of main roads fell on the shires and municipalities, and they were not able to divert their funds to the maintenance of other roads. The conference of Ministers thoroughly appreciated that fact. It is also thoroughly appreciated in Western Australia, where, a couple of days ago, a conference representing 104 affiliated roads boards throughout the State carried unanimously a resolution "" warmly supporting the Federal Main Roads Bill now before the Federal Parliament,"" and urged every Western Australian senator and representative ""to strongly support the measure being passed this session."" The representatives of these roads boards assume that Ihe proposal to spend Commonwealth money on making main roads will undoubtedly help, to a remarkable degree, the construction and maintenance of other roads in country districts. I have already said that, in any opinion, this agreement will be finally endorsed in New South Wales. I shall bring evidence in support of that statement. My first evidence is that of Mr Stokes, Lord Mayor of Sydney, who, as everybody knows, is -the Labour member for Goulburn in the State House. Speaking at Braidwood last Friday, Mr Stokes saidHe did not know why the State Government had not accepted its share of the Commonwealth Government's roads grant of £20,000,000. He knew the matter, had not been considered by the party. He thought the Federal offer should be accepted. Under the system of proportional representation, in operation in New South Wales, every country electorate has at least one, if not two, Labour representatives, and I am certain that the pressure of country Labour members will induce the Government of the State to give further consideration to this matter. regard as evidence what he has quoted. ? it is not evidence, it is a significant statement. If honourable members care to read the New South Wales newspapers, they will see that every day shire councils throughout the State are carrying resolutions urging the Government to come into the scheme. A fortnight ago I spoke to 150 motorists in Sydney. Not one of them was opposed to the Commonwealth's proposals; every one keenly supported them. Within the last few days I have been in touch with other representative Sydney men, and I can find little trace of dissension in the State against a national roads scheme. Mr Newlands, president of the Chamber of Manufactures in Sydney definitely said that he was strongly in favour of the scheme. Mr Ludowici, vice-president of the Automobile Club, commends the scheme, and his only regret is that the Commonwealth may not exercise sufficient control to ensure that good roads are made. I am sure that if a plebiscite were taken in New South Wales, 80 per cent, of the people would be in favour of the Commonwealth's proposals. practice to appeal to the people of a State behind the back of its Government? putting on record the actual position in New South Wales. Although, during the last fortnight, there has been an intensive newspaper campaign in my own electorate, engineered, as the Prime Minister has pointed out, by the Town and Country Union and the oil importing companies, one cannot find, throughout New South Wales, any disposition to oppose the principle.

I am merely indicating what will happen in New South Wales within the next few months. NowI come to Victoria, where we have the extraordinary spectacle of an Opposition urging the Government to stand up to the agreement it has made with the Commonwealth Government. presentation of the position. the debate in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, continual references were made to the unconstitutionality of the Commonwealth's action; but, according to the newsv.aner reports of the proceedings in the State House last night, the unconstitutionality of our action is apparently to be pardoned if Mr Hogan, the Leader of the Opposition, can get through his proposal that the whole of the money raised by the Commonwealth in Victoria shall be spent in Victoria. avoided the position. that the action of the Commonwealth is unconstitutional, it is most interesting to read the opinion furnished to the Victorian Government by Messrs. Menzies and Eullagar. Although these gentlemen say that the Commonwealth's action is unconstitutional, they are frightened that the High Court, if asked to decide the matter, would give a decision against them, able members can judge for themselves, I shall read the legal opinion given by Messrs. Menzies and Eullagar. It is as follows:For those various reasons we are of opinion that, on the true reading of the Constitution, the Federal Aid Roads Bill is ultra vires, and will, if passed, be invalid and inoperative. We extraordinary thing happened. Although are, of course, sensible of the fact that the. trend of High Court decision has been in the direction of sustaining the Commonwealth power in all cases of substantial doubt, either by construing ambiguous provisions of the Constitution somewhat liberally in favour of the Commonwealth, or by the other well-recognized principle of construing challenged legislation, so far as possible, in such a manner as to preserve its validity. Tbe comparatively short period during which the High Court bas been applying tliese principles renders it difficult for any constitutional lawyer to advise with certainty upon the extent to wbich the logical application of the later High Court doctrines will produce results which are possibly unexpected, and it may well be that the High Court, -by giving to the important words of section 96 the very widest operation, might hold the proposal a valid one. That is the supposedlystrong legal opinion upon which the Victorian Government has taken its stand, but it is not very definite when those who furnished it are afraid that a reference to the High Court may upset it. The next StateI propose to deal with is South Australia. I must confess that, although I have great hope of New South Wales and Victoria coming into line, because of developments that have taken place during the last few days, it is impossible to say what will happen in South Australia. The changes of mind of its Government are so kaleidoscopic that no one can tell what is likely to happen in that State. Six or seven months ago, at the conference of State ministers at which this matter was discussed, we had Mr Gunn, the Premier, asking, "" On what are you going to impose the new tax ? "" It is absurd for the right honourable member for Balaclava to say that no information was given to that conference. The Prime Minister set that point beyond doubt on Tuesday night. The budget was delivered by me on the 8th July. From that date the actual proposals of the Commonwealth Government to raise the money were definitelyknown; and on the 14th July, six days later, Mr Gunn wrote to the Commonwealth as follows:With reference to your letter of the 6th inst. and previous correspondence on the subject of the policy of the Commonwealth Government in respect of the reconstruction and maintenance of roads, I desire to inform you that, after giving the matter most careful consideration, and in view of all the circumstances, this Government is agreeable to accept the proposals submitted by your Government. Then, within the next fourteen days, an Mr Gunn's letter carried with it an obligation to carry into effect the resolution of the State ministers at their conference with the Commonwealth Minister to ask the State parliaments to ratify the agreement with the Commonwealth, within a",35,Federal Aid Roads Bill Second Reading

155,Dr. Earle Page,"S o that honorfortnight Mr Gunn himself moved in the State ParliamentThat this House is of the opinion that road construction is a function of State government beyond the powers of tbe Commonwealth Constitution, and, therefore, emphatically protests against the road proposals of tbe Federal Government, and urges members of the Commonwealth Parliament not to give effect to them. The South Australian Premier knew the facts on the 14th July, and yet on the 28th July, instead of carrying out the obligation entailed by his acceptance of the proposal, he moved that motion in the House of Assembly. on the ground of unconstitutionality. 1 presume that the South Australian Government took legal opinion in the meantime. South Australia was exceedingly anxious that the new duties should be imposed cnly on chassis and tires. He is now more concerned about the constitutionality of the petrol tax than of our road proposals. It is impossible to know what the State Governments will do in the future, for they have already changed their ground so often. In these circumstances, the Government has decided to proceed with its'policy, and will impose only sufficient taxation to meet the obligation it has incurred It is evident that as only three States have intimated that they intend to ratify the agreement, our expenditure in the coming year will not be so great as was anticipated. The three States concerned will, as a matter of fact, need something like £860,000. The Government has decided, therefore, to impose the tax of 2d. a gallon on imported petrol, but for the time being to waive the proposed additional duties on tires and chassis. The tax on petrol will supply requirements for the time being. If later, other States ratify the agreement, and it is found that the Commonwealth has insufficient revenue to meet its commitments, the Government will re-consider thc position as it then appears.

If these measures should be declared unconstitutional, it appears to me that the only result will Le that the States will have to repay to the Commonwealth the road moneys they have received. I wish now to offer a few observations in reply to the speeches delivered by the right honourable member for Balaclava is ( Mr Watt), and other honourable members. First of all, let me insist that this matter must be dealt with from the national standpoint. If we are not prepared so to deal with it, we should leave it alone. It is surely our duty to do our best to enable our producers to compete in the world's markets with the producers of other countries, and also to compete with them in their own market. We should make our national machinery of production thoroughly efficient. If one country in the world needs good roads more than another it is Australia, for 96 per cent. of our production that is exported and sold on the world's markets is primary production. During his second reading speech, in introducing this bill, the Minister for Works and Eailways( MrH ill ) was subjected to continual gibing for talking so much about the United States of America. I have no desire to talk a great deal about America, but we must give seme attention to the fact that at present our imports from that country are valued at four and a half times as much as our exports to it. It is generally recognized that American methods are efficient, and, in my opinion, we should, in view of our unfavorable trade balance, do our best to apply them here. So far as Great Britain is concerned, the trado balance is fairly even. We sent about £69,000,000 worth of our products to Great Britain last year, and we imported British goods of about the same value; but in the case of the United States of America, we received £39,000,000 worth of goods, and sent in return for them only about £8,000,000 or £9,000,000 worth of aur produce. In the circumstances, it i= surely desirable that we should do whatever we can to improve our position. Ten",36,Federal Aid Roads Bill Second Reading

161,Dr. Eakle Page,"-The constituyears ago, the TJnited States of America introduced, on a very small scale, a federal aid roads grant system. In the first year of its operation, the Federal Government spent only about $20,000,000 on it ; but last year its expenditure under the same heading ran into many hundred million dollars, for it has found that the policy pays handsomely. but we have not a decent road in the Commonwealth. that we started to build some, and thc Government, in introducing these comprehensive proposals, is actuated with a desire to do so. Good roads are found in the TJnited States of America, not in isolated patches, but in stretches of hundreds of miles throughout the whole country-side. Vast sums have been allocated there for road-making under the federal aid system. Difficulties were encountered in developing this system there, just as they are being encountered here; but having 48 States in their Union, the Americans seem to find it easier to take a national view of the situation than we do with only six States. Federal aid road money is distributed in the United States of America as follows-one-thir d on the population basis, one-third on the area basis, and one-third on the basis of the mileage of road in a State to the total mileage of roads in thc Union. ticipate ? shall indicate in a moment. It is interesttotal, bvt received in road grants ing to see how this policy works. In America, as in Australia, some of the States are developed far more than others. New York State, for instance, contains only 10 per cent, of the total population of the United States, but pays 26 per cent, of the direct federal taxation that is collected, and is granted only 5 per cent, $7,510,000 for roads, or 1.66 per cent, of of the money distributed for federal aid roads. In other words, it pays proportionately five times as much taxation as it receives in road grants. us the exact figures? so in regard to a number of the States. Massachusetts paid in direct taxation to the Federal exchequer in 1922-23, $139,094,000, or 5.3 per cent, of the total taxation collected in the Union; but she received in federal aid road grants only $6,832,000, or 1.51 per cent, of the total amount distributed. In other words, she paid four times as much, proportionately, in taxation as she received in road grants. New York State paid $664,797,000 in direct taxation that year, or 25.36 per cent, of the total; but received in federal aid road grants only $23,045,000, or 5.1 per cent, of the total. In other words, that State received only one-thirtieth as much in road grants as it paid in direct taxation. New Jersey contributed $110,909,000 in national taxation, or 4.23 per cent, of the total; but received in road grants only $5,652,000 or 1.25 per cent, of the total. Pennsylvania contributed $247,121,000 in taxation, or 9.43 per cent, of the total, and received in road grants $21,237,000, or 4.70 per cent, of the total grant. Here let me join issue with the right honourable member for Balaclava in regard to the development of the United States of America. Quite a number of settlements there are as backward as some of our States. Dr. Elwood Meade, who has been here recently, has been responsible, in the last three or four years, for establishing a number of new settlements in the United States of America which are just as primitive as any in Australia. When we come to the Dakota states we find that the proportion of road grant to national taxation has changed. For instance, North Dakota in 1922-23 contributed only $1,507,000 in national taxation, or .06 per cent, of the §7,185,000, or 1.59 per cent, of the total amount distributed. In other words, she has received about five times as much in road grants as she paid in direct federal taxation. South Dakota paid $2,065,000 in national taxation, or .08 per cent, of the total amount received, but was granted the total distribution. Texas contributed $34,634,000 in direct taxation, or 1.32 per cent, of the total, but received £27,313,000 in road grant, or 6.04 per cent, of the total distribution. Montana's contribution in national taxation was $3,280,000, or .13 per cent, of the total, but she received $9,422,000 in road grants, or three times her total contribution to the national exchequer.",37,Federal Aid Roads Bill Second Reading

The distributions are made on a national basis, and undoubtedly we must regard this as a national question. It has never been suggested that these grants in America were bringing about unification. The right honourable member for Balaclava argued that it was not fair to compare the TJnited States of America with Australia. Then let us take Canada, just across the border, with her population of 9,000,000, and her huge area of undeveloped country, for she may well be compared with Australia. Canada has found it necessary to make federal subventions to the provinces to enable them to develop roads, as Mr Calder pointed out in. his report.

Dr. $670,000,000. I have stated the position in the United States of America and in Canada, and now let me examine the position in Australia. It is contended that we should not spend money in this national way, but should allocate the expenditure to the Statesi n which the money is collected. That is not the way in which we allocate other expenditures A r e the road grants in by this Parliament, with the exception of the per capita payment, and I think I have demonstrated that the per capita payments have never been satisfactory, and have had to be supplemented from other sources. we have ever been asked to raise for a special purpose. ing taxation other than through the Customs for the purpose of making the per capita payments. Let us consider the bounties which have been paid in the past to stimulate industries. Much of the money paid in this way has been spent exclusively in one State. In the case of the iron and steel bounty, the total amount paid was £667,000, and of this amount £664,000 was spent in New South Wales, and the balance in Victoria. In the case of the meat export bounty, the total expenditure has been £263,000, aud of this amount £227,000 went to Queensland. In the case of the canned f r u it bounty, £70,000 out of a total expenditure of £120,000 went to Victoria. In the case pf the cotton bounty, practically I do not; 'but I the whole of the money will go to Queensland. In the case of the wine export bounty, of a total amount paid of £245,000, £150,000 went to South Australia. In connection with these payments, no one has ever suggested that the money should be allocated on a population I have not those basis to the State in which it is collected. It is spent as it ought to be, as the need arises, and in the States in which the assisted industries are carried on. There is another example in the expenditure on the River Murray Waters scheme. The money is provided by the whole of the people of all the States of Australia, and yet the whole of it is spent in three States. None of the other States have ever grumbled on that account, because it is a national work. No one will contend that every shilling collected in a particular State should be spent in that State. Let us exestablishments, and we shall find that, although people in Victoria at this time grumble about the proposed expenditure from Federal sources in the other States^ the Federal expenditure on this account has been greater in Victoria than in any of the other States of the Commonwealth.

These are national services, main roads are not also national services, I do not know what a national service is. The right honourable member for Balaclava admitted that there should be something spent on interstate roads, and it is refreshing to find from the last report on the federal aid roads system in the TJnited States of America, that, instead of the States becoming almsmen of the Pederal Government as the result of the Pederal and road grants, they have, under the system, been placed in a position in which some do not need Federal assistance at all. has said that they are to receive to the cost of construction and mainten600,000,000 dollars this year. good roads is appreciated, and an efficient system of road construction enables produce to be transported quickly, and cuts production cost, and it is found to be tribute, but I remind the honourable memworth the while of America to make prober that he has been carrying the whole vision for the construction of decent roads burden of the expenditure up to the throughout the country.

The argument as to the value of good roads needs no further elaboration. In Canada it is admitted that the difference between an ordinary earth road and a macadamized road, as regards haulage, amounts to 6d. per ton mile. In four' years, from 1920, they spent £5,000,000 on road construction, and it is estimated that the expenditure is worth £1,000,000 a year in the extra loads which can be hauled and the shorter time occupied in transporting products to the railway station.

That means that the general public pays all. We say that the motorist should pay his fair share of the cost of constructing roads, as he does in other countries. Ever since 1909, a roads fund has been in existence in Great Britain, the Government of which last year collected from motorists about £18,056,000. In fact, I think the Chancellor of the Exchequer was charged with having raided the funds to the amount of £7,000,000 in order to balance his last budget. The Government has put before the States, the House, and the country a definite and continuous policy. It is objected that the improved roads will permit of competition with the railways. It is high time that the railways, which are a State monopoly, experienced some competition. Competition is good for everyjected to it shall we get improved services and cheaper rates. But competition must be fair; the railways must not be expected to bear the burden of heavy capital cost and maintenance, while their competitors, the motorists, use the roads without payment. The honourable member for Yarra said that the Federal land tax should be retained, in order to enable the road grants to be paid. I have already pointed out that the greater part of the present cost of road construction is paid by the land-owner. The time has come it, but I for the road user to pay his share, and to that proposal there is no real opposition from the genuine motorist. It is said that a certain amount of money is being found by the States for road construction out of loan. At the conference with the.State representatives, Commonwealth Ministers tried to reduce the loan expenditure to a minimum, and undertook that there would be incorporated in honourable its scheme a 3 per cent, sinking fund, which would ensure that by the time the road was worn out, its capital cost would be repaid.

They abused their unfortunate critics, and said they would stand to their proposals with a firmness that would make the rock of Gibraltar seem a mere jelly, but saying they'd ne'er consent, consented. that the honourable member was once a member of the Ministry. of the Government that introduced a roads policy which, to the Attorney-General, was totally different in principle from the present proposal. I shall now deal with the speech of. the Prime Minister( Mr Bruce), which has been well described as an extraordinary outburst. It was loudly cheered, but, to me, it was one of the best red herrings drawn across the trail that I have seen in the Parliament. He waxed eloquent about the evils and rapacity of the nil importing companies. One could have imagined when listening to him that the Leader of the Opposition was speaking. I have never before heard such an impassioned and eloquent denunciation of the octopus qf vested interests sucking the life-blood of the people of Australia. One wondered what evidence the Prime Minister possessed which led him to denounce the oil interests in such unmeasured terms, and whether the best way to deal with them was under a bill giving effect to a roads policy. He made strong comments on, and definite charges against, the oil importing companies. I hold no brief for those companies in any way. The manager of one of them replied through the press to the charges made by the Prinie Minister. I do not know the man, but I read his letter and also a statement in the press that the Prime Minister's attention had been drawn to it, but that he had no comment to make. One of the charges made so dramatically by the Prime Minister was that the oil importing companies employed Chinese or coolie labour, the inference being, of course, that such labour was not employed by the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, otherwise there would be no point in the charge. The letter that I have referred to appeared in the Argus of yesterday's date, and readsMany of the statements made by the Prime Minister on Tuesday night, in the House of Representatives, are demonstrably incorrect, one allegation particularly so, namely, that the British Imperial Oil Company employs Chinese or coolie labour. There is absolutely ' no foundation for an attack of this kind on a company which has always prided itself'on its standard of employment. Every employee of the 'company is a white man, and, to the best of my belief, an Australian, or some otlier British subject. I do not know if that statement is true. graph refers to the Australian branch of the company. tinuesTt is obvious that, in Asiatic countries, from which both Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited and the British Imperial Oil Company draw their supplies of oil, a fair quantity of coolie labour must certainly be employed. If the crude oil that is imported by the Oommonwealth Oil Refineries Limited, has been produced by white labour, then the Prime Minister was justified in making his charge; but if the facts are a3 stated in the letter, then his charge was certainly not justified. Thc Trime Minister should prove his case or withdraw his statement. by the Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited distilled within Australia, whereas the spirit of other companies is distilled elsewhere, by labour other than white? the Prime Minister's charge was to obtain support for the Government's unfortunate roads policy. The inference was that one company employed coolie labour and the other white labour. The Prime Minister's second charge against the British Imperial Oil Company .was that it was a foreign company, although trading under",43,Earle Page Honorabl E Body And Only When The Railways Are Sub

In reply to that, the letter states:I thought that this matter had been cleared up once and for all in my letter to the Prime Minister of the 28th May, in which I stated that the Shell Transport and Trading Company Limited"" is, and always has been a British company, owned by Britisb shareholders and controlled by British directors."" necessary also that I should once again remind Mr Bruce of the following statement made by Mr Hughes, when Prime Minister, in the House of Bepresentatives, on the 18th July, 1917, following a specific inquiry regarding the constitution of the British Imperial Oil Company Limited :"" Certain information has been received from the British Government in reply to our inquiries relating to this company, to the .effect that the British Imperial Oil Company was a British company, and there were no reasons why it should not be treated as such.""

The honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Hunter) has accused the honourable member for Wimmera of standing up for a foreign company, and attempting to throw dust in our eyes. I think that the statement should be withdrawn. Groom) -Becaus e of the noise in the chamber it was impossible to hear what the honourable member for Maranoa said.

He should reiterate his charge, and prove it , or else withdraw it . The Prime Minister has made dire and mysterious threats against the oil companies if they pass the tax on to the public. Here again we have evidence of the extraordinary confusion in which the Government finds itself. The Treasurer has said that those who use the roads should pay for them, and the Prime Minister has said that the It seems importing oil companies, and not the road users, should pay for them. It has been said that the States agreed to the Government's proposal. The inference is certainly that the States were willing partners to it . But 1 do not think that they were, because they were not acquainted with all the facts. When a representative of a State has agreed to a proposal he should certainly attempt to carry out his contract. If we are to have repudiation between government and goverument in this country, where shall we end ? I am glad that the Government has seen f it to review its policy. Honourable members know the value of good roads. America has been quoted as an example, and the interjection by the right honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) was pertinent. He said that the heavy taxation of American motorists was more easily borne by them as motor cars, motor tires, and petrol were much cheaper there than in Australia. The reply of the honourable the Treasurer had but little point in it. I venture to predict that if the Government would reduce all tires, chassis, and other parts of . motor cars to the American price level, no motorist in Australia would object to the petrol tax. I have some other comments to make regarding the method of brought down to deal with that, I shall If I did, I withdraw my reserve those remarks for the present. has been much talk to no purpose in this debate. Almost all, if not all, honourable members believe that good roads are a national necessity. A t any rate, honourable members on this side of the House, I withdraw uncondiduring the Federal election, lauded the Government for proposing this scheme, I am not speaking which it was thought would provide for continuity, and would set up machinery for making roads efficiently. There is no dispute as to the need for good roads; we all want them. But the question is, how to provide for them. It was felt that if it could be done out of the ever-increasing revenue of the Commonwealth Government, that would be the next best thing",44,Earle Page Honorabl E Body And Only When The Railways Are Sub

223,Mr Prowse (Forrest) [3.47],"Ther eto lowering the tariff. Those who are taxed by the tariff felt that this .would be a means of getting some return for their money. The right honourable the Prime Minister said that the money would be collected from the users of the .roads; but he'also said something else. He said that the new duties were in no way related to the protection policy, but were purely revenue duties, imposed for a specific purpose. It is clear, therefore, that the people were told that the users of the roads would have to find the money required for the scheme. I should say that the Government's proposals, to that extent, are fairly equitable, and, at any rate, the Government is justified in endeavouring to carry out a policy put forward by the Prime Minister at the last election. It was clearly shown by the last speaker-and I think I have shown it also-that discrimination in taxation for the purpose is now proposed, and it is that discrimination which is resented as an injustice. I am surprised that the Prime Minister should lend himself to it. A t present only a small percentage of the C.O.R. spirit is used in this country, although the. percentage may increase later. About 94 per cent, of the petrol used in this country and only 35 per cent, of the tires are imported; but the local article is not to pay anything for the roads. There has been much argument to try to demonstrate that some honourable members do not believe in good roads. The truth is that we are all anxious for good roads. The contention that good roads are necessary to save wear on cars and tires is unarguable; it is beside the question. I should like to see the Government act in strict accordance with the promise made to the electors. I am glad that it has somewhat modified the scheme. If the money is raised by taxing the users of the roads, the imposition should be made as light as possible, and distributed over all road users.

I move That the House at its rising adjourn until Monday next, at 3 o'clock p.m. As honourable members know, the referendum campaign has to be commenced shortly, and I assume that it is the desire of all honourable members that the remaining business shall be disposed of as soon as possible, so that they may return to their constituencies. The business still to be taken is the Federal Aid Roads Bill, bhe Customs duties-whic h have already been introduced-the Cotton Bounty Bill, the Estimates, and the Income Tax Rates Bill, which is passed every year to fix income tax rates. There will be no alteration in the rates. The Imperial Conference agenda-paper is still on the businesssheet. The Government may have to bring down a bill of considerable importance, the nature of which I cannot indicate at the moment, and possibly, also, a small amending bill will be introduced. Those are the only matters it is proposed to proceed with. not object to this House meeting on Monday next, but I am sorry that the Prime Minister did not tell honourable members definitely during the week that it would meet on Monday. It was certainly indicated in a tentative way. make my intention clear to the honourable member. I made a statement which I thought was quite definite. sions I endeavoured to obtain definite information, but I could not do so. I told the members of my party that there was a possibility of the House sitting on Monday, but on possibilities it is not easy for honourable members to arrange their adjourned. affairs. I hope that, if there is any pressure of business next week, we shall sit all day rather than try to rush the business through during all-night sittings, when it is not possible for honourable members to do justice to their constituents.

Question resolved in the affirmative. That the Honse do now adjourn. Treasurer has announced that the duties on tires and chassis will be withdrawn. That is really an announcement of a tariff amendment. Will it be followed immediately by amending the tariff schedule that has been tabled? I realize that withdrawing duties is different from imposing new or increasing existing duties, but it is important, when changes in the tariff are announced, that -the schedule should be altered immediately, for otherwise the conduct of business is hampered. It is well known that the delay in considering thc last tariff schedule, caused by the intervention of the election,' had a serious effect on many businesses in this country. Chassis may be in bond to-day, and, ordinarily, would be released on Monday. I ask for an assurance that the amended schedule will be brought down at once. and Minister for External Affairs) [3.58] I appreciate the point raised by the honourable member for Yarra( Mr Scullin), but no practical difficulty is likely to arise. It is a different matter when increases are being made. The announcement of increases must be made after the Customs Houses have closed, and the amended schedule must be placed on the table of this House before they open next day. The object of that procedure is to prevent withdrawals from'bond. In the case of a decrease of duty, goods may be taken out of bond as soon as the [192] announcement of the decrease is made, with confidence fhat refunds will be made of any duty that may have been paid.
