I wish to suggest that it would be of great advantage to honourable members if the document could be printed.

However, I have not the slightest objection to the printing of it, nor have the Government. The return is being prepared , and I think that when it is laid 1 on the table it will be seen to be of sufficient importance to justify printing, because it is a paper which should be distributed.. on the table by a Minister, he may, if he pleases, move that it be printed. Otherwise, and in the ordinary course, all papers go automatically to the Printing Committee. from the Prime Minister when we may expect action to be taken in regard to legislation on electoral matters ?

Sir WILLIA M LYNE (Hume-Minister of Trade and Customs) -In movingThat the B ill be now read a second time, I shall be as concise as possible. I wish first to point out that it is divided into two parts, the -first of which is practically a transcript of the Merchandise Marks Act of Great Britain, which has effect throughout the British dominions, while the second contains provisions relating to the imports and exports of the Commonwealth, and gives power to compel the placing of a proper description on goods or on packages containing them. The first draft of such a Bill in my possession was prepared by the late Government. meanthe Reid-McLean Government? Sir WILLIA M LYNE -The ReidMcLean Government. The Bill with which I am now dealing really tones down one or two of the more drastic provisions in the Bill framed by the late Government; but, of course,, it goes further that that. The need for such a measure was to a large extent shown during the debate in the Senate on the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill. Certain but they were not inserted, as it was considered by legal authorities that they could not properly be made in the Bill beBill was prepared by the late Government. Besides being due to the discussion in the Senate to which I have referred, the Bill was also the outcome of the Premiers' Conferthe need for such a measure was explained vernment. that he has toned down the Bill prepared Sir WILLIA M LYNE -Yes, the meain some respects rather drastic.

These clauses undoubtedly give a clearer ancl stronger definition of what was probably the intention of the section referred to. Section 56 of the Customs Act, relating to prohibitions subject to restriction, does not deal with the matter in the same way that the present Bill proposes to do. I refer specially to those two sections of the Customs Act, because it has been asserted that we can do all that is required in the matters therein referred to without passing such a measure as that now before us. I find, however, after having consulted the officials of my Department, that this Bill is necessary to make the intentions of the Customs Act perfectly clear, and to confer greater and more discretionary power. The Customs Act does not deal with the standard of exports as this Bill does. The term "" standard "" is not used in this measure, but the term "" trade description "" is employed by the draughtsman, and the object is to compel persons who are exporting goods to bring their products up to a certain prescribed standard. tell us what exports are likely to be affected ? a list of the articles likely to be affected by the provisions which are intended to prevent the exportation of inferior goods to the detriment of bur export trade. For instance, under this provision, we shall be able to prevent the exportation of jam in short weight tins. I am informed that the articles of export most likely to be affected are as follow Biscuits Butter Cheese Confectionery Fish, n.e.i. . Fodder, compressed Fruits, Raisinsâ Grain, Flour Oatmeal ,, Wheatmeal Boots and Shoesâ Hay and Chaff As regards imports, the articles 'likelv to be affected by the provisions of the Bill are as follow:Beer Leather Apparel Jewellery For instance, those that Boots and Shoes Fruit Juices Butter Macaroni and VermiCandles celli Cheese Manures Cocoa Meats, Preserved Coffee Meats, Concentrated Confectionery Medicines, ProprieFish, Preserved tary Fruits, Preserved Milk, Preserved (various kinds) Milk, Concentrated Furniture Mustard Gelatine Oils.

That, however, is not the case. kindly tell us in what respect the Bill prepared by the late Government has been modified. Sir WILLIA M LYNE -It will take some time to go through the details and compare the respective clauses. The measure prepared by the late Government was called the Imports and Exports Examination Bill of 1905. Clauses1 and 2 in the old Bill are practically identical with clauses similarly numbered in the present Bill. altered slightly from the original by the addition of one or two words in the "" trade description."" Clause4 in the present Bill is the same as clause 5 in the old Bill. Clauses in the present Bill is the same as clause 6 of the old Bill. of the old Bill have been dropped. Clause9 in the old Bill is the same as clause 6 in the present Bill. Part of clause 3 and clause 10 of the old Bill are embodied in clause 7 in the present Bill. Clause 11 in the old Bill is practically the same as clause 8 in the present Bill, and clause 12 in the old Bill is almost identical with clause 9 in the present Bill. clause 3 and clause 13 of the old Bill are, with some modifications, embodied in clause 10 of the present Bill, and clause 15 of the old Bill is nearly the same as clause 11 of this Bill. Clause 14 of the old Bill is the same as clause 12 of this Bill. I do not say that the wording of the clauses in the present Bill is exactly the same as that adopted in the measure prepared by the late Government, but nearly so. Clause 16 of the old Bill corresponds with clause. In con13 of the present Bill, and clause 17 of the old Bill is identical with clause 14 of this Bill. Clause 15 in the Bill before us was not included in the old Bill. Honourable members will be able to compare the clauses, and see what alterations and transpositions have been made. allow me to look at the Bill prepared by the late Government? and learned member may have it at once. I may inform honourable members that the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill, which was prepared and introduced into the Senate hy the late Government, has been divided Some of its clauses have been embodied in the Trade Marks Bill, which was introduced by the Attorney-General, and other clauses have been included in the measure now before us. For instance, clause 4 of this Bill is practically the same as clause 4 of the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill. Then the provisions as to ""false trade descriptions"" (and "" trade descriptions "" are embodied in clause 3. The provisions contained in clause 7 of the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill will be found in clause 4 of the present Bill. Clause 11 of the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill is partially embodied in clauses 8 and 9, and clause 12 of the Fraudulent Trade Marks Clause3 in the present Bill is Bill contained provisions similar to those in clause 11 of this Bill. Clause 13 of the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill corresponds with clause 15 of the present Bill, clause 14 with clause 7, clause 17 with clauses 2 and 7, clause 18 with clause 9, clause 19 Clauses7 and 8 with clauses 10 and 12, and clause 36 with clause 14. In connection with the lists of goods which will be affected by| the provisions of this Bill, I desire to point out that many improper practices are indulged in in connection with the preparation of foods. Honourable members may remember that some little time ago.a Commission took very important evidence in New South Part of Wales, in reference to the falling off in the birth rate. That evidence was never published, although I venture to think that it should have been. I have read a portion of it, and the Honourable Dr. Mackellar and Mr O. C. Beale have spoken to me with regard to some of the assertions made by witnesses. There is no doubt that extreme action is necessary in order to prevent the adulteration of foods, especially infant' foods. I have been pressed by the members of that Commission to do something",15,Commerce Bill No Z Second Reading

Bill should empower us to deal. I think that there should be energetic action taken to stop this evil practice as far as possible. provisions be more appropriately embodied in an Adulteration of Foods Bill? Sir WILLIAM LYNE that we can quibble about the title of the measure. All that I am anxious about is to get a title which is sufficiently comprehensive, ancl which at the same time will not be ruled out of order. have shown some desire for consistency by agreeing to transfer certain provisions from the Trade Marks Bill to another measure. Sir WILLIAM LYNE power is given-and I presume that the late Prime Minister had this idea in his mind when he 'framed the measure-to deal with importations in one particular direction. Take the case of what are known as "" quack "" medicines. I am informed that a great many of these are so adulterated that they are absolutely injurious frct o the stand-point of human use. placing of a formula upon the bottle, as is done in Germany. That will stop the practice of adulteration. best that we can. I am of opinion that the Trade Marks Bill will have some effect in that direction. It is absolutely necessary to prevent the practice of, adulterating foods for children and adults which is being carried on at present. cocoa, & c , to some extent come within the same eategory. In regard to exports, we desire to obtain some control over goods of short weight, ancl impure foods which are probably sent away to other countries. Honourable members, no doubt, are familiar with the statements made before the Royal Commission which is at present investigating the condition of the supplies which were forwarded to the troops in South Africa during the recent war. It is necessary that we should be able to check anything of that kind. I admit that the task will throw a very grave responsibility upon our Customs officers. At the same time, they must recognise their responsibility, and we must attempt to make them still more vigilant and careful than they might be if the matter were not such a I serious one. If they realize that by allowing any inferior goods to be exported to other parts of the world they will, if the charge can be sheeted home to them, be held blameworthy, they will probably exercise still greater vigilance. I have known cases in which inferior f r u it has been placed upon the English' market, to the detriment of a better class of frui t from New South Wales and I do not know Tasmania. There are no regulations governing our exports, and although in most of the States there is something in the nature of an Export Board in existence, the supervision exercised has been of a most perfunctory character. These boards do not shoulB u t the Government der any responsibility, and there is no penalty exacted for remissness. In this B ill ciple of caveat emptor applies there? The buyer'must look after himself. Sir WILLIAM LYNE . Honourable members must have noticed in the press, times without number, statements to the effect that fruit and other perishable articles bearing the brand either of Tasmania, Victoria, or New South Wales, have been purchased in London in such a state as to db serious injury to the producers who export good produce to the mother country. lows out that principle to its logical conclusion, he will have to provide for an examination into mining matters in order to see that persons are not imposed upon by the offer of valueless mining shares. Sir WILLIAM LYNE . ^ I do not think Coffee, so. That is quite a different thing. We shall not attempt anything of that kind in this Bill. This is a very important matter, and one with which we ought to deal at the earliest moment. I have no desire to make a long speech upon it. No doubt the provisions of the Bill will be dealt with exhaustively in Committee. I am not aware that there is any important point that I have overlooked. I have put matters, as far as possible, in their categorical order, and I have informed honourable members of the source from which we have taken the various provisions. I shall, therefore, content myself at the present",16,Commerce Bill No Z Second Reading

62,Mr Bruce Smith,"If the Minister folstage, with moving the second reading of the Bill. should not have spoken upon the second reading of this Bill but for the fact that 1 shall probably be absent when the measure reaches the Committee stage. There is one point to which I wish to direct special attention, and which, perhaps, under ordinary circumstances, might have been better dealt with in Committee. I desire to say that I am in entire sympathy with the Minister so far as the object of the Bill is concerned. commendable one. WhatI desire to point out is that there are circumstances in which it is absolutely impossible to apply a uniform system. Speaking for my own State, the item of export in which it is particularly interested is that of apples. For many years we have been endeavouring to open up the English market, and we have now done so very successfully. The latest arrangement which has been arrived at provides that very large shipments of apples shall be made next year, the freight upon which will be only a little more than 2 s. per case. The point that I wish the Minister to'bear in mind is that the vessels which convey these shipments to England arrive at Hobart, and make their stay there as brief as possible. enter into contracts with them have practically to purchase, beforehand, the space which they think they will require.. For instance, they may say, "" We will ship 50,000 cases of apples by this boat, and 30,000 cases by the next."" cumstances they are required to pay for the space which they anticipate will be taken up by those shipments, irrespective of whether they utilize it or not. After a vessel arrives at Hobart, it sometimes happens that an agent discovers that he is 5,000, 6,000, or 10,000 cases short of the quantity required to fill the space booked. He has immediately to telegraph to the Huon district, Send me at once 4,000 or perhaps rt 5,000 cases of apples."" A small steamer takes these apples down the Huon River to Hobart, and directly alongside the English vessel, to which they are transferred. cumstances, to delay a shipment until an examination could be made, would be fatal. The shipments must be sent away speedily or not at all. I quite agree with the Minister that no punishment is too heavy to inflict upon the individual who ships thirdclass goods under a first-class brand. The man who uses a first-class brand should ship a first-class article. I repeat that it is impossible to apply a uniform system under circumstances such as I have detailed. The experiment was made by the Tasmanian Government in regard to the export of fruit. I hope that the Minister will understand that I am not offering this criticism in any captious spirit; I am merely desirous that no regulations shall be made which will strike a very serious blow at the most important industry in Tasmania. At the present time we know that if we cannot Its object is an exceedingly ship our fruit speedily to London, it will rot in the local market, and we shall eventually have to feed it to pigs. Unless we can ship to England more than one-half of our cropI believe that unless we can ship 75 per cent, of our apples to London next year-ther e will bea glut in the Australian market. Honourable members must recol. lect that we do not occupy the same position as do the shippers of butter and other articles on the mainland, where certain lines of steamers call regularly. Every vessel which goes to Hobart for a cargo of fruit must be brought there under special charter, and its stay there must be as short as possible. Any delay falls very severely on the contractor who has chartered the vessel. If The persons who the space which has been purchased is not filled, the person who has contracted to bring the vessel to Hobart is required to pay for it, and the boat goes away lo that extent empty. Under such circumstances, to delay the shipment of fruit until it could In such cirbe examined by a Customs officer or e::pert would be fatal to the consignment. That is the point which I desire to impress upon the Minister. I repeat that this very experiment has been attempted by the Tasmatnian (Government, which was imbued with every desire to carry out the system which is now proposed, and to insure that nothing shouldfoeshipped unless it was up to the standard. I trust that the Minister will give this matter his very seriouÂ§ attention. I hope that I shall be pardonud for making these observations at the presenr stage, but I am prompted to do so by the fact that I shall probably be absent from Under these cirthe House when the measure reaches Committee. not be here next week, and I should not like to miss the opportunity of making one or two remarks upon this measure. I was a little surprised to learn that the Bill had",17,Commerce Bill No Z Second Reading
63,Mr Mcwilliams (Franklin),I,18,Commerce Bill No Z Second Reading
64,Mr Bruce Smith (Parkes),"I maybeen prepared by the late Government. However, it is quite possible that the alterations which have been made, and which the Minister has not detailed, may represent the difference between what I regard as the objectionable features of the measure and the unobjectionable features proposed by the late Government., I think that the B i ll is a dangerous one in many respects. I quite admit that it has much to recommend it , and I shall endeavour to show in what respect it seems desirable. But is is a dangerous B ill because it is one of a class -framed by people who imagine that all human affairs can be regulated-wh o believe that commerce and industry can be managed by officers so as to reach a point of perfection which has not yet been achieved under any system of government in the world. The great danger is that where measures of this character are framed by men who are not familiar with the complexities and intricacies of commerce they carry the desire to regulate to such an extreme that they practically paralyze the machinery which they wish to perfect. The history of British commerce teaches this one fact above all others. I do not know of any one who has expressed it better than Buckle in his History of Civilisation, where he shows that almost the whole of the measures which were passed in the first half of the nineteenth century were in the nature of repeals to get rid of injurious attempts at regulation, which, as a fact, had embarrassed commerce in every feature of its organization. These lessons of history have been forgotten. There is a tendency to-day to resort to the old-fashioned school, by which it is taught, as I have said, that all human affairs can be so regulated as to render them perfect. glance at the history of the reigns of Elizabeth, and of Henry VII . , and Henry VIII . , to find that the statute-books were simply choked with attempts of this sort to regulate trade and the details of commerce. I mention this only to emphasize the point that while it may be necessary in these days of adulteration for the Government to take legitimate steps to protect the ignorant part of the people-and I class myself among them so far as a knowledge of such things as chemicals is concerned-w e must take care lest we go too far. While it may be necessary for the Government, owing to the great competition in the sale of goods, to guard against what I mav call unfair and dishonest adulteration, it is imperative that we should keep in mind the old lesson of history-that we do not carry this principle so far as to really injure and embarrass the very trade that we are trying to conserve. There are two divisions of this measure which ought to be kept clearly distinct-the one relating to imports and the other to exports. In the endeavour to carry the movement for supervision to its most desirable extent, it seems to me that fhere has been a little too much enthusiasm on the part of the drafter of the B ill Dealing first with the division relating to exports, I shall not for a moment take exception to the desire to make, If it be not made, or to maintain, if it be made, the reputation of Australia for sending good produce of honest weight, and in good order, to other parts of the world. It is quite admissible for the most rigid individualist to contend that where a country has achieved a reputation for good exports, the man who secretly sends from that country a bad article under a good brand, is really trespassing upon the reputation of the honest exporter. Therefore in that sense, it is quite allowable for the Legislature to prevent any fraudulent representation on the part of an exporter that may prove injurious to those who are endeavouring to carry on the export trade of the country upon fair and honest lines. But in dealing with exports, it is necessary that we should exercise some care. We do not want fo coddle the buver in foreign countries. I can quite understand that in a country like this, it may be justifiable for the Government to supervise the exportation of such an article as butter, in order to see that the packages in which it is sent abroad bear representations that are true and honest. But I do not admit that it is deOne has only to sirable to carry that Government supervision to the extent of seeing that all the frui t that is exported from Australia is of good quality. I take exception, therefore, to the unlimited character of the supervision which it is proposed shall be exercised over our exports. I quite admit that in the case of such exports as butter, it might be allowed; but I understood the Minister to say that instances had occurred in which persons had exported inferior frui t to England, and that this Bill would cover such cases, and prevent their recurrence. that to attempt to do it would be to embark upon a wild goose chase. If the Government is going to supervise the quality of frui t exported from this country, or the",18,Commerce Bill No Z Second Reading

It is a principle which has law. a bargain, and subsequently becomes dissatisfied with that bargain, there is no remedy if the defect of which complaint be made could have been seen at the time of the purchase, because the buyer ought to have been aware of that which he could see for himself. If , on the other hand, there were a latent defect in the article, and there were an undertaking that it was sound, the defect being latent, the buyer could recover on the ground that he had been deceived. That is the law, and that very principle comes in here. understand this measure being applied to butter, which might be so filled with some preservative as to be positively injurious to health or life. It might be the legitimate function of the State to have butter examined before being exported, and on finding it to be dangerously adulterated with some preservative, it might quite legitimately exercise its power to prohibit the exportation. I am satisfied, however, that the Minister is wrong when he talks of applying the provisions of this Bill to such things as fruit, or other produce, such as cheese and meat. These are all instances of a very large class only an expert would be able to deal with of goods over which supervision cannot, ancl it. need not, be exercised by the Government. My only doubt is whether in all cases the half-rotten fruit? discretion which is necessary with regard to these things will be exercised. am present when the Bill is being discussed in Committee, I shail devote condase in connection with the export of butsiderable attention to the task of eliminatter. ing any portion of the measure giving the irrespective Government power to regulate the quality of an article to be exported, where the defect is patent, and can be seen by the buyer.

I have cited the case of fruit , only long as the world lasts, goods, because the Minister mentioned it , showing quality of which is apparent, that he had it in his mind. But let us regardless of what suppose that the Government are to classify frui t that is intended to be exported from a State like Tasmania. That would mean that the Commonwealth must have an officer on the wharf, or even upon a ship's deck, who, after examining the whole of"" the cargo of fruit, would be able to say "" this fruit is inferior and cannot be shipped."" Where is the line to be drawn "" Let the as to what is inferior and what is superior fruit? It recognises that if one makes be prescribed.

If unnecessary action has been taken by one of the States, that is no reason why we should cease to criticise a proposal on the part of the Commonwealth to do the same thing. I submit that my point is a very sound one. It is proposed practically to dictate to men who have studied the trade for years as to what is wanted abroad.

At one part of the year we may export the very thing which at another period we import. do. should be empowered to dictate to the producer what class of fruit he should grow. If the doubt is as to whether the producer would send his fruit away in an unripe or rotten state, I am sure the Legislature need not take action. If a man exported fruit which appeared to the expert to be rotting before it left Australia, what condition would it be in when it arrived at its destinavatives in food is most, detrimental to tion, and what incentive would there be for the producer to continue to export fruit in such a condition? Having dealt with the necessity for a keen distinction between the supervision of exports which contain what I call a latent defect, and those in which the defect is patent to every one, I pass on to the question of imports. Everyone knows that there is a growing tendency on the part of people in all British communities to doctor themselves by the use of tabloids and pilules, and other preparations of that kind. tice. and the honourable member for Melbourne will agree with, me, that the people are constantly running great risk by using with confidence drugÂ£ which they may buy in concentrated form, without really knowing what is their effect upon health. As a matter of fact, the Adulteration Act now in operation in. Great Britain requires the manufacturers of these commodities to place upon every label a caution to the buyer that he ought to take medical advice before using them. have to be reduced before that will be possible. point which I am not now considering. They have got pretty low sometimes. My point is that there has been a recognition by the authorities in England that some of these very things which are being sold plentifully to, and' used freely by, the people, are sufficiently dangerous to life to require the printing on the labels attached to them of the advice to take medical advice before using them. We know that the use of preservatives is growing to enormous proportions, and that by them many things which would otherwise perish in a very short time are now kept good, so far as the taste can discern. The public do not 'know to what extent preservatives are used. To go into details, you may nowadays keep milk or cream in your house for days before it will turn sour. Why? Because it is charged with preservatives. We know that doctors differ exceedingly on the question whether the use of preservatives in food is not seriously injurious to health. A short time ago the opinion was expressed by the Medical Board of New South Wales that the constant and liberal use of certain preserhealth. confirmed by the medical authority on my right. It may be perfectly allowable for the Government to exercise rigid supervision over the standard imports being brought here.

The question is, on whom will the onus of proof lie? to make the Bill a sort of addition to the Customs Act, and if honourable members -will take back their memories to the discussions in this Chamber about three years ago, they will recollect that in connection with all offences against the Customs Act the onus of proof is thrown upon the person charged. There was a great deal of comment on that feature of the Act when the measure was before this Chamber. When a man is charged with a breach of the Customs Act, he has to go into Court, not to defend himself against the evidence brought against him, but to prove that ""he is innocent of the charge. protection given in the latter part of clause 8 is merely a throwing upon the person charged with importing goods to which a false trade description is applied, of the obligation to prove his innocence. not wish to seem pertinacious, or to be too emphatic, but if we give the Government power to examine and analyze goods when they arrive, and, if adulterated, to proclaim the fact in the Gazette; and to prohibit the importation of similar.goods, making the person who is guilty of such importation liable to a penalty of Â£ i o o , and compelling those charged with the offence to prove their innocence, we create many difficulties. One has to know only a little about commerce to be aware how difficult will be the administration of the measure. Goods are frequently sent out to persons in Australia as regular consignments, without being ordered. There are hundreds of men in the States who are acting as agents for the manufacturers of Great Britain and other countries, and who, without ordering them, receive goods on sale as if they were importers. When a parcel of such goods, together with the necessary papers, had arrived from Great Britain or America, the Customs Department might say to the consignee, "" The importation of goods of this class has been prohibited, and yet you are importing them,"" and an honest and innocent man would have to go into court to prove his innocence without any evidence being brought against him. with in the same way in connection with his dealings with wholesale wine and spirit merchants. member may not approve of that. to join with me in my protest against this provision as unfair. It is a fundamental principle of British law, which is supported by centuries of experience, that the onus is upon the party making a charge to prove the person guilty who is charged with a breach of the law. We should pay our fellow-citizens the credit of presuming that they are innocent until something has been proved against them. I admit that the Government could do a great deal of good by .supervising the importation of goods, by making public the fact that certain goods are injurious to health, and in some cases by going so far as to prohibit, The so-called by proclamation in the Gazette, their importation.

102,Mr Bruce Smith,"Then I ask himis a desirable one. But there is no doubt .that if the House is not very careful, proceeding as it must in ignorance of many classes of trades, it may pass legislation which, as has been the case with other Acts, it may subsequently have reason to regret. The honourable and learned member for Parkes has pointed out the many difficulties -which may arise in dealing with imports. I wish particularly to provide safeguards against the enormous powers which' are to be given to the Customs Department to make declarations through its officials as to the weight, size, measure, package, condition, or adulteration of goods. Clause 13, however, goes still further. It provides thatAny goods intended for export which have been that the timber was jarrah, blue gum, or dnspected in pursuance of this Act may, in manner [prescribed, be marked with any word, figure, or stringy bark, as the case might be; but mark for the purposes of indicating the quality, if we went to the length of describing the -class, or grade of the goods.

We shall really help our exporters, and facilitate their business by assuring the purchasers of the articles that inspectors at this end are acting on their behalf, and taking care that they shall get the article for which they stipulate. For instance, if a shipload of timber were being exported from the Commonwealth, it would be justifiable for the Government to give its warranty particular quality of the timber, we should exceed the bounds of reasonableness and But it would be impossible The grading of exports would much' adulteration is practised that we The adTake, for example, Lea and Perrins' Worcester Sauce. If the proprietors of that sauce were called .upon to place upon each bottle of their well-known product, a precise statement of the ingredients used, their good-will would vanish into thin air, and any one could use their formula. I know that these matters could be better dealt with in Committee, but I am now indicating broadly that we shall require to be careful in giving extended powers under regulations. Unwise administration might result in a serious interference with trade, and gross injustice to many deserving traders, whose business is more or less established on secret formula;. Then, again, I hope we shall avoid the mistake that was committed in connection with the Sea Carriage of Goods Act. I gave my hearty support to that measure, but I strongly impressed on the Government that it should not be brought into operation too early. guard against bringing a Bill of this kind into force too suddenly. Its ramifications will be very much greater than those of the Sea Carriage of Goods Act, and its commencement should be delayed for at least twelve months after it is finally passed. It cannot be emphasized too strongly that there are certain classes of articles which, though they may not be called first class, are still legitimate articles of export. Any interference with the exportation of such products would be an unwarrantable interference with the development of our productive power. know, wheat may be of any number of different varieties or grades. The grain may be so low in quality as to be absolutely unfit for human consumption, and yet possess commercial value, not only here, but in other parts of the world. To prohibit the exportation of such wheat because it did not reach a certain standard would be to interfere to a serious extent with our export trade, and to damn the whole principle of the Bill, the general object of which we most heartily sympathize with. case of fruit, for instance. There may be a thousand different distinctions. It would be absurd to sav that unless fruit was of a certain standard it should not be exported. That would be an unwarrantable interference with the operation of trade, which would tend to restrict the production of our national wealth. Whilst the Government might be justified in giving their certificate that certain fruit was of a well known variety, ancl that it was properly packed in boxes of the regulation size, they should not Mr G. B. Edwards. attempt to classify the fruit itself. If we are careful not to permit the Government to exercise such powers as will lend themselves to abuse-if we refuse to give them such powers as we may be led to infer will almost surely be abused-the Bill which contains principles which must commend themselves to the good sense of honourable members, may be made a very useful measure. able and learned member for Parkes and the honourable member for South Sydney have indicated a number of the objections that I had intended to express. A Bill like this is pregnant with much danger to the commercial life of the country, and I find it impossible to refrain from saying a few words with regard to it. We are face to face with a proposal that the Government shall have the absolute right to say upon I think that we should what lines trade shall be carried on. The Minister proposes to assume control over both the import and the export trade. It seems to me that we should allow the principle of caveat emptor to apply to its fullest extent. How can we say what is good and what, is bad? How can we determine the stage at which a certain commodity becomes of no further use to the community ? I am perfectly sure that no officer appointed by the Government would be qualified to come to a proper'determination on such a point. In connection with the inouiry now being conducted by the Tariff As honourable members Commission, it has been shown that potatoes, wheat, and a hundred and one other things which are absolutely useless, so far as human consumption is concerned, are vet of considerable commercial value for distillation purposes. Alcohol will probably be the great cheap fuel of the futureit may eventually displace petroleum. At present it is not doing -so, but illimitable possibilities appear to be opening up so far as the use of alcohol is concerned. Under the provisions of the Bill now before us, Take the the Minister might prevent tlie importation or the exportation of articles which would lend themselves to the production of alcohol or other commodities, and he mitrht also prevent the importation of valuable substitutes, such, for instance, as saccharine. Synthetical chemistry is only in its infancy!, and' we cannot tell how far its development may extend in the near future.

Alcohol will probably be the fuel of the future, and a very slight development in this direction will perhaps alter all our present-day ideas of combustion. I do not know how butter that was unfit for human consumption could be of any use, but I hold that if there is a foreign market for soch butter, there is no reason why a man should not be allowed to export it , even if he cannot obtain more for it than the ordinary price for grease. The grower of each favour of grading. a man should be permitted to export even inferior butter, and get whatever price he can for it.

In order to show the danger attending the use of Government marks, let me quote the case of a shipment of butter, bearing a Government brand, part of which, after leaving here, became fishy. There might be no doubt that when the expert examined it here, it was his honest opinion that it was suitable for export; but apparently before it reached its destination so many microbes of an obnoxious character had developed in ' it that it became fishy. If these cases of fishy butter had been the first to be opened, the price of all the other butter shipped on the vessel in question would have been lowered by 2d. or 3d. per lb. Although there might have been only ten or a dozen boxes of fishy butter, those who had exported the remainder of the shipment would have had to suffer. That is one of the real dangers of the grading system. As the Bill stands at present the Government may make it compulsory for an exporter to show that his butter has been graded, and belongs to such and such a class. Would any honourable member say that because one consignment was bad, other shipments by the same vessel should suffer? Honourable members show by their silence that they agree with me that such a thing would be most unfair. I think their silence shows that they assent to my proposition. ning chorus of dissent if we always took notice of what the honourable and learned member said. sented to the statements of 'the honourable member. gers, is the House prepared to say that Government grading should be compulsory?

But it does not go any further, and in that it is wise. I speak of tlie dairying industry only, as one with which I am familiar. most affected by the Bill. to exports of all kinds.

We have been told that the late Government intended to introduce a Bill similar to this, though it may be that the differences between this Bill and the Bill which they would have introductd are such as to make the two measures entirely opposed in tone and character.

I trust that honourable members will see that nearly all of these restrictive measures, instead of being of advantage to Fne people, really constitute an evil. The pDwer to direct the grading of exports, if exercised at all, should not be exercised by the Minister for the time being, without a definite statement being made to Parliament as to the exports to which it was to apply. Without some such provision, I am certain that serious evils will arise. Lord Coke said that the great and serious evils which arise as the creation of laws designed to build up new principles are almost incredible. It is only about 100 years since the people commenced to understand what is meant by the principle of non-interference. erally regarded now as wrong, cated in economics there is a stronger belief than ever before that there should be as little interference as possible by the State. There has been an extension of what is regarded as the proper scope for State interference, I admit, and more matters now come under the control of the State, and, in my opinion, very properly, than was formerly the case. But, unquestionably, whenever a new matter is brought under Slate control, a fresh evil is created, and the question to be determined is whether that evil is lesser than the evils which would continue if the old state of affairs remained unaltered. _ It is, however, sometimes contended that those who object to State interference, as a general principle, are opposed to all kinds of State interference. we should object to State interference in such matters as sanitation, for instance. It is not because one believes in State noninterference generally that he would permit men to do as they please, to the serious detriment of the health and property of their neighbours. The State is justified in interfering in regard to the employment of child labour and a dozen other matters. In this case, however, no such interference is necessary. All that we need do is to give the purchaser a simple, cheap, and Yet the honourable effective remedy for any damages that he may suffer through purchasing adulterated articles. given to the purchaser of half-a-pound of bad butter? the butter was such that the purchaser should have ascertained it by the exercise of his sight, taste, or smell, he should not be allowed to bring an action; but if the adulteration was such as could not be detected by those means, a remedy should be provided for him. There is no need for the creation of a large staff of inspectors. If we go on building up Department after Department, the Commonwealth expenditure will soon exceed the limit of one-fourth of the receipts from Customs taxation allotted to us by the Constitution, and we shall have to hold our hands from what may be absolutely necessary legislation, ' simply because Ave cannot afford it . But what is more important than the passing of a measure by Parliament is its effective administration. It is the administration of a measure which affects the people. Good administration may make even an unsound law not wholly offensive, but bad administration will make the best law ever passed absolutely injurious to the community. I am surprised to find this Parliament going back to the methods of the musty past. All the evils complained of could be dealt with by giving a remedy to every purchaser. tion be proved without the assistance of Government analysts and inspectors? send a sample of milk, or of any other commodity, to an analyst. self? ment analysts might be employed for the But it is absurd to think that purpose of examining articles that were suspected to have been adulterated. 1 would be required for the whole Commonwealth ? pose that the great bulk of the articles of food are adulterated.

170,Mr Conroy,"It is a mistake to supcarrying out my suggestion. Under the system I propose, every man would act as a policeman buti f only a few inspectors were appointed the door would be left open for fraud and corruption, and very grave mistakes might be made. Articles intended for export might be rejected, on the ground that they did not come up to a certain standard, and yet they might be of comparatively high commercial value for certain purposes. We are rapidly approaching the stage at which there will be no waste products in any department of industry. Even the refuse of great cities is now being turned to practical use. Are we to lay down laws that will retard the development of synthetical chemistry? do not wish it to be put to a wrong use. vented if we passed such laws that each individual would have the power to safeguard his own rights. We cannot look after the rights of each man, because we cannot determine what he regards as his rights. We could, if we pleased-unfor tunately we do not please-giv e him the chance to enforce every right he possesses. By failing to provide easy means for the enforcement of all claims, we deny to many individuals the chance of obtaining their rights. We should insist upon all men being made, as far as possible, equal before the law. At present that is one of the things we decline to do. A thousand wrongs are crying out for redress, and we are turning a deaf ear to the appeals for our assistance. The Bill appears"" to me to seek a remedy at other than the fountain head. The intention, no doubt, is good, but the result will be evil, and I have no hesitation in saying that in the course of the the Secret Commissions Bill, are of such next ten or twelve years serious attention will have to be given to the considerations that I have brought under notice. I prophesied in connection with the Customs Act that a hundred and one evils would arise, and I believe that this Bill will be attended sire to retard the progress of the measures, with equally undesirable results. By instituting the principle of Government grading arid Government marking, we shall deny to men the reward of their own industry, and rob them of the motive which is the principal inducement to work and effort. Nations have been beggared by their Parliaments-by the enactment of unjust laws and the imposition of excessive taxation. We have certainly passed many unjust laws, and we are marching rapidly along the path we might as well drop the Bill for this which will lead us to the imposition of session, and perhaps for next session also. such excessive taxation as will involve us all in ruin. Such measures as that now before us tend to bring all men down to one level. I cannot support a measure which will give Government officials an opportunity to deal with matters of which they will probably be quite ignorant. The Bill contains some provisions which I would be glad to see embodied in another measure; but the vitiating effects of some of its clauses are such that I shall oppose the motion for the second reading. pose to speak at any great length. The remark which fell from the Minister of Trade and Customs that he had toned down the measure which was prepared by the late Government, conveys to me the idea that the original Bill must have been a remarkable production. It is unfortunate that the tendency of our legislation in this Parliament seems to be in the direction of narrowing the scope of our commercial and industrial life. The expectation, prior to Federation, was that our legislation would certainly not retard enterprise, but that it would help to promote it. We have before us a Trade Marks Bill, a Secret Commissions Bill, and the present measure, all of which contain provisions calculated to restrict the liberty of those who are engaged in trade and commerce. The provisions in this Bill, and in the Secret Commissions Bill, as well as certain provisions in the Trade Marks Bill, are creating consternation amongst members of the trading community, who find it difficult to estimate the effects of such legislation, and who look forward to the dislocation of business. The Bill before us, and a drastic character, and will have such a serious effect upon trade and commerce, that I think it desirable that they should be referred to a Select Committee. I do not make that suggestion with the slightest debut merely in order that opportunities may be afforded to the commercial community to make full representations to Parliament with regard to them. A Select Committee might be appointed which would be fairly representative of all shades of opinion, and it might be stipulated that the report should be presented by a certain date.",29,Commerce Bill No Z Second Reading

I quite recognise that the Trade Marks Bill was under discussion in another place last session, and that it is not open to the same objections of party consideration that apply to the other two measures I have named. I claim that, in the interests of the whole commercial and manufacturing community, as well as of the people of the Commonwealth, it is undesirable to press through measures of this character, in the absence of proper information and proper investigation. I make this appeal to the Minister in no obstructive spirit. The commercial community are entireVyi favorable to the principles underlying these Bills, but in operation the drastic clauses which they contain may prove very harmful to us all. It appears to me that we are attempting to set up a position of self-righteousness, and to impose upon business men restrictions which will hamper all conditions of trade. I speak with the authority of the Chamber of Commerce, and of other organizations of manufacturers, and I appeal to the Minister to agree to the appointment of ,a Select Committee to receive representations -whic h will be fairly made-as to why certain of the provisions of this Bill should paragraph to the House. I am so accustomed not be brought into operation. I refrain from any definite motion, in the earnest hope that the Minister will see his way to grant my request, which is 'a fair and legitimate one, having regard to the interests of the whole community. We are endeavouring, by all our legislation, to narrow the area and influence of our trade and commerce. legislation enacted in the past, and we continue to pile up Acts of a similar character. If , by passing such measures, we could influence all outside trade and commerce, some useful purpose might be gained. But instead of accomplishing that, we are merely, restricting the operations of our own people. Naturally, the commercial community wish to see proper standards established in connection with our exports. They wish to show that by raising the standards of imports and exports we are benefiting the community. But some of the details of the Bill are of so drastic a character as to induce me to make this earnest appeal, not the measure be remerely as a private member, but as the representative of large commercial organizations. move the adjournment of the debate until a later hour of the day, because I desire to bringanother matter under the notice of the House.

Reid and the Opposition in connection with the chairmanship of committee's election, which took place in the House of Representatives on Wednesday. The Labour Party and a section of the Liberal Protectionists were pledged to vote for Mr Chanter. As between Mr Chanter and Mr Salmon the Opposition generally, and Mr Reid in particular, greatly preferred the latter. When, therefore, it became evident that to run their own nominee, Mr Wilks, meant, through the exhaustive ballot, the certain success of Mr Chanter, the Opposition at the last moment on Wednesday decided to withdraw Mr Wilks from nomination. But greatest of all, the Opposition desired to humiliate the Government. could only be done by in some way opposing Mr Salmon, the Prime Minister's nominee. Now, considering that three Ministers of the Crown voted against the honourable member for Laanecoorie, I am impelled to ask whether they were endeavouring to humiliate the Prime Minister? It is a most extraordinary thing that it should be imputed to me that I was attemping to humiliate the Prime Minister, by voting against a gentleman who was opposed by three of the honourable and learned member's own colleagues. I did not know that the honourable member for Laanecoorie was the nominee of the Prime Minister. He was not put forward by the head of the Government in any way. I was absolutely in the dark as to the attitude of the Prime Minister, or of any other member of the Government, so far as knowledge was concerned. I naturally supposed that the Prime Minister would vote for the honourable member for Laanecoorie; but it was only a matter of conjecture. no knowledge. The paragraph continuesAbout five minutes before the nominations took It is miraculous how the Age knows the place the way to accomplish this end -was presented to Mr G. H .

Except on a question of privilege, no honourable member could have intervened at this stage. But there are questions of privilege and questions of privilege.

202,Mr Reid,"It is not my intention tobeginning, with reference to this matter. I suppose honourable members will.be quite prepared to learn that I was always in favour of the candidature of the honourable member for Dalley, provided that he was nominated. I presume that there would not be any treachery in supporting one who has had a long political career, and has been a life-long supporter of my own, if I thought that a thoroughly competent member of the party to which I belong should occupy the Chair for a session. There is no man in the House who would grudge that position to the honourable member for Dalley. My position, therefore, was perfectly clear from the first. anxious that, if possible, the honourable member for Dalley should be elected Chairman of Committees. hand, I did not conceal my strong preference for the candidature of the honourable member for Laanecoorie as against that of the honourable member for Riverina. I do not think we are called upon, at present, to go into reasons for such a preference, but the House will accept my assurance that I greatly preferred the candidature of the honourable member for Laanecoorie to that of the honourable member for Riverina. I went further than that. My honourable friend, the member for Laanecoorie, will remember that I told him in the most straightforward way that I was strongly in favour of the election of the honourable member for Dalleyi f it could be brought about; but, that, failing the election of that honourable member, I would strongly support him. The honourable member for Laanecoorie did not approach me on the subject, or seek this information in any way. meet him, and volunteered the information that I would give him the strongest support, as against the honourable member for Riverina. member for Laanecoorie that I was going to use every effort to promote the success of the candidature of the honourable member for Dalley. I do not think that the honourable member for Riverina had any special reason to expect my support. see, therefore, that I was perfectly open in declaring my^ attitude. I had no need to declare my attitude to the honourable member for Riverina; and I may say that that attitude is not based on any personal objection to the honourable member. However, I made my position perfectly clear ,to the only honourable member to whom I thought it necessary to make a statement on the subject. I may say that the honourable member for Dalley, throughout this matter, avoided all question of canvassing or ascertaining who would vote in his favour. Some of his friends, just as the friends of other honourable members did, interested themselves in his success; and I suppose that that is not an unusual proceeding. But all through there was a distinct understanding that we I was very would not put the honourable member for Dalley forward if it would lead to the election of the honourable member for Riverina. On the other We so greatlv preferred the honourable member for Laanecoorie that, if we saw that our putting forward a candidate would lead to a result to which we were strongly opposed, we would support the nomination of lhat honourable member The honourable member for Kalgoorlie, with whom I have been on very pleasant intimate terms-for I have always endeavoured to obliterate politics in our private intercourse-di d come over to this side of the House before the voting took place, and he broached the question of a proceeding which would have the effect of a vote resulting in the removal of the name of the honourable member for Laanecoorie from the list of candidates if the honourable member for Riverina was not elected. ,to us all over here. I happened to private interview, because it took place in the presence of several of my fellow members. Honourable members know that every supporter of the honourable member for Riverina voted for him. was no cross-voting on that issue. There was not a single supporter of the honourable member for Riverina who abstained from voting for him, say, on the ground that he could not possiblv win. The honourable member for Riverina voted his f u l l strength, and had his f u l l opportunity, and he was defeated by, I think, eight votes. I believe that, several of his supporters were absent-so I have been told-bu t all who were here voted in his favour.

There was a conversation between the honourable member and myself, and I say that .fortunately two or three honourable members were grouped around at the time. It is perfectly true that the question was discussed between the .honourable member for Kalgoorlie and myself as to whether we should vote against the honourable member for Laanecoorie in order to remove his name; but I saw clearly enough that I should be absolutely unjustified in entering into any such arrangement, unless by doing so I could secure the election of the honourable member for Dalley. I was not going to be made a pawn to be used to defeat the honourable member for Laanecoorie, so that when our man was put up my friends opposite could vote against him, and thus create a blank again, so that another honourable member probably of their own party, if it were thought advisable to nominate him, could be elected to the position. of good faith in this transaction. My object in desiring to place the honourable member for Dally in the chair was a legitimate object. If there is any -strength in life-long political friendship, and in the support enjoyed from one of the most honourable men in the chamber, as the honourable member for Dalley is, I should think myself something less than a man if I did not do my best to put him into the chair, especially when I believed he would make a thoroughly good Chairman. I was -not called on to help either the honourable member for Laanecoorie or the honourable member for Riverina in any shape or form, and my friend, the honourable member for Laanecoorie had the manliness to sav to me at once that he could not, and did not. expect my support. Young as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is, he is a gentleman with whom we need to be careful. I am very glad that I was careful, because, instead of falling into some mysterious position in which the honourable member for Dalley would have been left out in the cold-that would almost certainly have been the resultI told the honourable member for Kalgoorlie that while I was perfectly willing to vote against the honourable member for Laanecoorie, I would only do so on a promise of the support of his party for my friend the honourable member for Dalley-tba t unless that support was promised, I would not be any party to defeating the honourable member for Laanecoorie. presented to the right honourable member as a party arrangement ? honourable member for Kalgoorlie to saj that he did not do that-h e did not say he came to me on behalf of the party. makes it appear that he did so. orable member did not use the name of his party. Had he come and told me that he had the authority of his party, I should have accepted his word, and voted against the honourable member for Laanecoorie, and the honourable member for Dalley would inevitably have been elected if the Labour Party had voted with us. But that was the very point on which the negotiations broke down. I said, as any_ man of sense with less experience than I have had would say, "" If you will give us an assurance that I wanted a guarantee your party will support the honourable member for Dalley against the honourable member for Laanecoorie we will vote against the honourable member for Laanecoorie."" member had them all in the bag. 1 should we not do that which would not have been objected to if done in the interest of any of the other candidates ? I hope we are not going in for that sort of political hypocrisy, which applies rules to political opponents that we do not apply to ourselves. I make, no sort of concealment of the fact that if I could have secured the election of the honourable member for DalleyI should have done so; and no one, surely, would blame me for that.

That was the very difficulty; I put it to him : "" If you will come to me, and tell me that your party will do what you say, and will support the honourable member for Dalley, I will vote against the honourable member for Laanecoorie."" Now, the honourable member did not come back and give me any such assurance, so that there could be no promise. I refused to make any promise without the assurance which was not given to me, because the honourable member never returned either to tell me that his party would, or would not .give the assurance which I had told him I should require. tion so far as the honourable member and myself are concerned; and, as I say, the honourable member went to others on this bench who will be able to say what was the transaction between them. glad that the opportunity has been given to-day to discuss this question. say,, at the outset, that I was not responsible for putting the Age on to the statement that is published this morning. did not run to the Age in order to make a statement of what I believed to be a grievance.

I am going to be Now, that is the whole transaccareful, Mr Speaker, not to reflect upon any one after the deed has been done, but I certainly was in favour of having one of the other members, of the House elected in preference to the honourable member for Laanecoorie in the event of the honourable member for Riverina being unable to secure the position, he being my first choice. For that reason, I say, that when I saw that I may the election of the honourable member for Riverina was impossible, I approached the right honourable member for East SydneyI with a suggestion. The suggestion has been admitted by the right honourable member up to a certain point. Now, I say that I left the right honourable member for East Sydney thoroughly satisfied that we were going to get the support of the Opposition on the second call.

I might go further, and say, as the right honourable member for East Sydney has said, that some honourable members sitting on that side, not having a knowledge of any arrangement which might have existed, influenced other honourable members. I acted as I did because I was honestly opposed to the election of the honourable member for Laanecoorie-no t because I knew of any compact. I would refuse to entertain at any time the condition which was proposed to be made. honourable member for Kalgcorlie has introduced my name this afternoon, I wish to say a few words on this subject.

I was sitting behind where the honourable member for Robertson is now sitting when the result of the division was declared, and, being under the impression that the business was all over, I rose from the seat and came down I do not think the steps, expecting that when you, sir, would put the second question, it would This party be carried on the voices, naturally.

If he had merely made a personal explanation I should not have allowed any debate, but, the question of privilege having been raised, I have permitted tlie discussion to been mentioned, I wish to say that I veryproceed so far. During the last few moments, however, I have come to the conclusion that any legitimate purpose which could be attained by the discussion of the question of privilege has been already accomplished, and I hope that, honourable members will now enable me to close the debate, so that the House may proceed with its ordinary business. the press prints is iright, the time has come for us to build one huge gaol and imprison every one in it.

The honourable member for Kalgoorlie addressed three or four of us, the leader of the Opposition having his face turned in this direction.

Mr 'WILKS -That is my distinguishing virtue, and I do not think I am to be blamed for that fault. If any one has a right to complain, it is myself, because my name has been dragged into this matter. It seemed to me that the honourable member wished to make a catspaw of me in the interest of the candidate to whom he was attached. I refused a week ago to be made a catspaw of, and I refused again on the day of the election. I hope that the House will hear nothing more of these so-called arrangements in the future. able members of the Opposition have doubted whether the honourable member for Kalgoorlie spoke to the leader of the Opposition when he was anywhere than on the front Opposition bench.

I regret that this discussion has taken place, but I realize that in view of the paragraph which appeared in the Age, it was hardly possible to avoid some reference to the matter. I am pleased in one sense that this matter has cropped up, because we have heard the leader of the Opposition state distinctly that if he had agreed to support a certain candidate, he would have had the votes of the whole of his party in his pocket. position stated distinctly what I have indicated.

Several honourable members opfiosite, amongst them the honourable member for Parramatta, did all they could to disconcert the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, a young and new member of the House, who was defending himself against a serious attack. Kalgoorlie is the most dangerous member in the House-that is my opinion of him. for Kalgoorlie was being attacked by the big guns of the House, and notably by one honourable member, who hardly respects the Chair-w e had an example of his conduct in that respect last night.

The honourable member for Yarra, after having been in the Chamber, and having heard every word I said, has stated I said that I would not have a member of the Labour Party in the Chair at any price.

So far was I from trying to induce the members of the Labour Party to put forward a candidate, that I can give my word of honour that I never made any such suggestion on any occasion. The facts are these: Up to the day before the It is well known that election, I had intended to nominate the honourable member for Dalley, and the only reason I had for refraining was the request of the honourable member that I should not proceed with his nomination.
