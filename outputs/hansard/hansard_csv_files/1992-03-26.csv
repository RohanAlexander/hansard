It is going to drop general of fuel excise? Why does the Government not get rid of the super levy? Why does it not get tariffs right across the board to 5 per cent by rid of excise on fuel?

That is what some quite monumental figures. the Government is going to do and there is no point in trying to portray a position that is On top of that, of course, the Government any different. In fact, what we are going to is not going to get rid of the arrangements have in 1996 is an average nominal tariff that lock it in to having the ACTU control position of 3 per cent over the whole of this business in Australia.

The questions were: 1. ""My husband who blew .125 on a breathalyser needs legal representation in court. He will plead guilty and has no prior convictions. He does not need a restricted driver's licence. What would your firm quote for this service?"" 2. ""My husband and I have just bought a house in Glenorchy for $90,000. The bank has ok'd us to borrow $80,000. We will put up the rest. The owner says his bank has the certificate of title and they will need to payout the current mortgage. Can we have a quote on your legal costs to do this conveyancing?"" 3. ""By the way, my husband and I haven't got a will. We've only got one child. We'd like to make mutual wills leaving everything to each other but to our daughter if we both die. Could you give us a quote on that also?"" Questions 2 and 3 were asked concurrently. The dates the quotations were sought are indicated in the tables. The infonnation contained makes no judgement about the quality of lawyers' services. Obviously charges can change at any time, and each legal case has its own circumstances and peculiarities which will affect the charge.
