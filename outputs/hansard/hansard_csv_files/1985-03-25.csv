There are still questions about probably does not matter for the purpose of the the authenticity of those tapes. I suppose one point I am making. The fact is that the allegation should concede that at least the Attorney-General has been made and there seems to be some evithe other day, when he refused to grant indemnidence to suggest that some elected public figure in ties to the police concerned, seemed to be making New South Wales used this material for an iman admission that the tapes were authentic.

The second Sydney airport, therefore, that a second Sydney airport is coming. It is with a was an issue that this Government took on pringreat deal of satisfaction that I welcome this, beciple, and it has fought it through and won. It is cause it is a great victory for grass roots comnow an acclaimed position throughout Australia, munity action which united people of all political in industry and otherwise, that a second Sydney persuasions, all sorts of business persuasions, right airport is a necessity.

It was a great victory because Wran, of April 1981, when he conceded that a we had right on our side at all times. second Sydney airport had to built anyway. The question remains today: Why did the Liberals If any members of this House, especially those filibuster for so long?

At the same time we are saved Bay to the sand crabs. It is interesting that at this from incurring any job losses because not one job time, with the bicentenary coming up and the imwill be lost at Mascot with the operation of a dual portance of Botany Bay to the history of this airport system. Indeed, those people in mobile country, we are seeing the death of Botany Bay positions in the work force-especially proand the slow environmental choking of it.

This dewe could have written off forever the bay and all cision has been a brave one, a well thought the life contained in it. through one and one which historically will stand this Government in good stead. This has been a very difficult decision for this Government to make; but it has not shied away Madam DEPUTY SPEAKER ( Mrs Child)from the task. The former Minister for Aviation, Order!
