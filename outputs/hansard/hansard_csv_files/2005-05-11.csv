It is important to recognise that this government has been prepared to make some difficult decisions in the period since we were elected in 1996. As a nation we have a declining birth rate and an ageing population, so it was particularly important for the Treasurer-and this was done absolutely in the budget-to focus on the long-term liabilities that the Australian government will have, given the fact that a smaller proportion of the work force in the future will be contributing to the cost of running the country at a time when the ageing population will ensure that there are unprecedented demands on the revenues of the government.

195,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir,"Wednesday, 11 May 2005 ----Aged Care bringing together aged care providers, health professionals and local seniors. At the summit I heard directly from those involved in aged care about the issues they face in providing adequate services to the local elderly. I heard from carers who simply do not get the support they need from this government. I heard from respite workers whose services are now under threat because of the Howard government’s tendering system. I also heard from the people who run local nursing homes and from the elderly themselves. The message was loud and clear: the Howard government has neglected aged care in Richmond for nine years and they want something done about it. That is why I am presenting these findings to parliament today. I want the minister and the Prime Minister to hear what I hear from my community every day: more funding is needed for aged care, and it needs to be spent in the right places. The 2,000 EACH packages delivered in last night’s budget for people suffering from dementia barely touch the sides of what is needed to fill the gap. At the same time seniors will be hit in the hip pocket by the increased number of prescriptions needed per year for the safety net to kick in. The government is not providing the home care so desperately needed to keep elderly people independent in their own homes. We have the appalling situation of just 35 home care packages being provided for an area covering Grafton to the Queensland border. This means a sixto seven-month waiting list for just seven hours of home care a week. People like Ann from Banora Point, who is barely able to walk and suffers from a variety of incapacitating illnesses, cannot access the limited home care they need to help maintain their homes. Despite the Treasurer’s assertions, the government is not providing enough support to the carers of elderly people who also work tirelessly to keep loved ones out of aged care beds. Respite services and other support services are currently under threat because of the introduction of competitive tendering. Locals at the summit told me that a cut to respite would be disastrous for the carers in our community-for people like Aileen, a local woman who cares for her infirm elderly mother and intellectually disabled daughter. Without the limited amount of respite her family receives, she would be effectively housebound. I will always fight for a better deal for my community. This aged care summit was the very first step in improving services for the local elderly. I will keep the pressure on the Howard government until these problems are fixed. Across the board we are finding so much desperate need in the aged care industry, particularly in relation to home care-and in relation to the lack of nursing home beds as well. Now, with this increase in the PBS safety net, it is going to be incredibly difficult for the elderly. The lack of bulk-billing doctors in Richmond and the recent broken promise relating to the increase in the safety net make it very difficult for elderly people in my electorate to access the services they desperately need. There is no doubt that aged care in Richmond is in crisis, and that is exactly the information this summit proMAIN COMMITTEE",164,Business Profession And At That Time The Catholic

From all of the local aged care providers at the summit I heard that aged care is in crisis in Richmond and the Howard government has to address that now. Aged Care ment this morning. It is interesting that I should follow the member for Richmond who seems to have come into this chamber to make a statement which clearly purports to portray the aged care situation as being in crisis. Let us make one thing very clear: aged care was in crisis when the Australian Labor Party was last in government. Announced in the budget last evening was an increase in record funding levels for health and aged care to $45 billion under the Howard government-compared to $20 billion under the Australian Labor Party. What a stark contrast! Under the Australian Labor Party, which the member for Richmond claims to be so passionate about, the aged care sector and aged care workers and, most vulnerable of all, the clients of aged care facilities, were suffering under poor government policy and planning which saw no accreditation standards at all. Accreditation standards are something that this government introduced and that aged care providers and clients in aged care facilities can be proud of. SoI say to the member for Richmond: instead of trying to claim, Chicken Little style, that the sky is falling in on the aged care industry, she should be out there talking to her constituents, highlighting the benefits that flow under the Howard government’s aged care policy. She should not be misreporting and misconstruing the facts about what the Howard government has done for the aged care sector. Last night, in fact, we announced a $1,000 bonus payment for carers. That $1,000 is something carers would never get under the Australian Labor Party. In addition to that, I would highlight the introduction of the safety net threshold. The safety net that was introduced by this government was originally proposed to be $500 and $1,000, because we knew that would be sustainable. But the Australian Labor Party, together with the Democrats, opposed that in the Senate and, as a consequence, forced the threshold down to an unsustainable level. So, if anyone is to be blamed for rises in the safety net threshold, let the blame rest on the head of the member for Richmond, let it rest on her Labor mates and let the people of Richmond know that it is the member for Richmond who has caused the safety net threshold to be increased. It has been raised purely because it was going to be unsustainable under the Labor Party’s proposal. We have now raised it to a more sustainable level. The fact is that aged care providers and the clients of aged care facilities are far better off under the Howard government, with a $1,000 bonus payment, with record funding of $45 billion-up from $20 billion under Labor-and with an accreditation system that ensures that the elderly are looked after and provided for. With record amounts of HACC funding as well, we have also made it easier for aged care clients to age in place in their homes. It is a good news story for those on the Tweed coast, and I am very proud to be part of the Howard government and not some part of a Labor Party stack on 28 April.

199,Mr Byrne (Holt) (9.46 Am),"I rise today to talk about the predatory practices of an emTatterson Road in Dandenong South. It is a plastic injection-moulding business. It is a successful site and a successful business. A large number of its employees are migrant women who live in the region. What is happening at this place should send a very worrying signal not only to the community but to employers and also to the federal government-that is, the company is trying to put these migrant women, who have been very loyal to the company, on individual contracts and make them independent contractors. I know that there is a House of Representatives inquiry into this matter, but the way in which these women have been treated by this company should set alarm bells ringing. It should be considered by the House of Representatives committee as a very worrying sign and development, and it should give impetus to the government, when it contemplates the committee’s report, to introduce the appropriate legislation to prevent predatory employment practices like this. In the current EBA negotiations it was put to these migrant women that all of the new women had to become independent contractors. If they did this-and these are women earning $12.60 an hour-they would each have to establish themselves as a business, get an ABN number and fill out BAS statements. Then they would have to take care of their own sick leave, annual leave, long service leave and employer super contributions and have no security with respect to unfair dismissal. These are women who have worked in the factory for some time, who have demonstrated loyalty to the company. The company has responded to this by effectively saying: ‘Thanks very much. We’re going to make you all independent contractors.’ These migrant women, some of whom have English as their second language, are being turned into small businesses on site, after working in the company for something like 10 years. What concerns me are some of the practices. On5 May, a shipment of tyres was coming into this factory, and it was accompanied by 10 or 12 bikies whose heads were covered with helmets and bandannas to protect their identities. When they took this shipment through, they abused these migrant women. Frankly, I think if you are going to start using these sorts of tactics you have to be held to account publicly for them. Not only that, but the company are having people knocking on these women’s doors at night when their husbands are not homeat 9 or 10 o’clock at night-and effectively saying: ‘You are conducting an unlawful action.’ But this action is completely lawful, and I call on Kemalex Plastics to act in an Australian way in treating their employees fairly.

Marriott House provides a whole range of programs: literacy and numeracy skills, computers, art, creative work, independent living classes and all sorts of things to help these people integrate properly into our community. Secondly, they have more recently established a Personal Support Centre adjacent to Marriott House. This centre provides a facility to help transition young people leaving school with an intellectual disability into the community. The aim of the program is to help these young people explore a variety of options as they mature. They get further education opportunities, independent living skills provided, recreational and community access and an introduction to work programs-things that they can cope with. After two years, these young adults are much better placed to make an informed choice about their future. The centre is providing a really constructive role for our young people in the local area and it is highly commended. Lastly, the third arm of this Marriott Support Services is a group called the Lewis Industries, which supports employment opportunities in light production work, blister packing and light assembly work. Again, there are about 80 people from around the local Bayside area with disabilities who are employed in this factory. It empowers people with an intellectual disability to do some meaningful employment. They are referred through Centrelink, and assessed and provided with a whole range of jobs within Lewis Industries. I visited this operation. It was a wonderful experience and a great opportunity. I would like to thank Lloma Shaw and other staff members of the Marriott Support Services for their excellent work and the wonderful difference they make to our community. (Time expired) Sir Isaac Isaacs attend the opening by His Excellency Major General Michael Jeffery, accompanied by his gracious wife Marlena, of the exhibition at the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation on the life of the first Australian Governor General, Sir Isaac Isaacs. The function and the Governor General’s speech was attended by the Treasurer, former Governor General Sir Zelman Cowen and Lady Cowen, the Chief Minister of the congregation, Rabbi Rubinfeld and the CoChairmen David Lissauer and David Sherr. It was very competently MCed by His Honour Judge Alan Goldberg. I was extremely pleased to participate in this function and want to pay tribute to the fact that this was the 75th anniversary of the cathedral synagogue in Melbourne known as the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation, but more popularly known as the Toorak Shule that people can see on St Kilda Road as they come in by tram. It was on the synagogue’s 75th anniversary that they chose to have this highly appropriate exhibition of one of their most prominent former congregants. Sir Isaac Isaacs was born in Melbourne in August 1855. He entered the University of Melbourne to study law in 1875 and after graduation went on to become a practising barrister for the next 26 years. He entered parliament in Victoria in 1892, becoming Acting Premier of Victoria, and he was a member of the 1897-98 Federal Convention. When the Commonwealth of Australia came into being on 1 January 1901, Isaac Isaacs was elected the Federal member for Indi, in north-eastern Victoria. Isaacs became Attorney-General in the Deakin Ministry, and in 1905 he was appointed to the High Court, a position he was to occupy for the next 24 years. He became Chief Justice in 1930.

The King was reluctant, because Isaacs was a local man, unknown to him, but Scullin persisted and Sir Isaac Isaacs became the first Australian Governor General. The exhibition about Sir Isaac Isaacs at the Melbourne Hebrew Congregation is highly appropriate and it is open to the public now. I pay tribute to the Governor General and to all the people who were involved in this elevating exhibition and the wonderful ceremony I attended. I urge members of the public to attend the exhibition. The Governor General, His Excellency Major General Michael Jeffery, lent a great deal of historical continuity to Australia by paying tribute to the first Australian Governor General with his presence and remarks at the ceremony. Budget 2005-06 Miss JACKIE KELLY (Lindsay) (9.55 am)-This year’s budget continues the government’s commitment to strong, sustainable growth and provides more opportunities for Australians to benefit from and to contribute to our economy and society., As well as enhancing trade opportunities, it encourages greater work force participation through incentives to those receiving welfare payments. It continues to strengthen Medicare and the PBS, as well as addressing cancer prevention through screening and education. The economy is in good shape, with low unemployment, low interest rates and low inflation. As a result, personal and business tax cuts are high on the agenda, with less tax paid by all taxpayers. This budget includes my election promise of $7 million for the University of Western Sydney library at Kingswood, $10 million for the Panthers stadium at Penrith and $8 million over four years for the National Community Crime Prevention Program, Western Sydney. From1 July 2006, parents receiving the parenting payment will move to an enhanced payment which will have a requirement for them to look for part-time work when their youngest child is six. This will enhance their work capabilities and skills and future employment opportunities as mature age women or men. In concert with this measure is the announcement of an increase of 84,000 in outside-of-school-hour places, an extra 2,500 family day care places and a further 1,000 in-home places. Child care in my electorate is always welcome. The Howard government will also provide $55 million over four years to support 52,000 low-income families to meet the gap in child-care fees. All of this is in addition to the 30 per cent tax rebate for child care introduced after the election. Overall, $2 billion is being spent on support services over the next four years, to assist various groups who are out of work to find work. The reduction in welfare support over this same period is nowhere near this amount, but this expenditure does arrest a number of disturbing trends in our society. Subsidies will be provided to employers of the long-term unemployed to further support them to get back into work. To improve incentives for people on low incomes, the 17 per cent tax rate, which applies between $6,000 and $21,600, will be cut to 15 cents in the dollar as of 1 July next year. To meet the increasing shortage of trade labour, the government has announced an additional 4,500 pre-vocational training places, plus an extra 7,000 school based new apprenticeships, in tandem with funding for a technical college in Western Sydney, for which my electorate, based on the council area of Penrith, is submitting a bid. To meet the immediate labour shortages, skilled migration will increase by 20,000 places, to 97,500. MAIN COMMITTEE Cancer is a No. 1 killer of Australians. To combat this disease, the government will invest $5.5 million over two years to raise national awareness of skin cancer and $25 million over four years to discourage young people from taking up smoking-and that is most disturbing in my area, where 25 per cent of 18to 25-year-old females smoke.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 March, on motion by Mr Pearce: That this bill be now read a second time. powers to the Reserve Bank to regulate the payment system if it considers that this is in the public interest. The Reserve Bank of Australia has used this power to establish standards. The most significant standard relates to interchange fees, which are fees paid to financial institutions that issue credit cards and provide services to merchants. These fees, in turn, are passed on to merchants and then on to the prices of goods and services faced by consumers. A number of other standards have recently been announced in relation to EFTPOS and Visa debit cards. On the whole, for example, one can use one’s Commonwealth credit card to withdraw funds from a Westpac automatic teller machine, and there is a fee to process the transaction between the two institutions. This also relates to purchases made by consumers using EFTPOS, or electronic funds transfer at point of sale, where the trader uses one financial institution for merchant facilities and the customer uses a credit or debit card of another. These standards involve moderate reforms by reducing the fees. Some $500 million worth of fees have been reduced according to these standards. However, the standards involve an average-cost pricing model. This is not the most ideal, from an economic perspective. Economic theory suggests that in an efficient market a service should be priced at marginal cost-the cost of providing a small increase in the current service. This leads to more efficient resource allocation. However, this requires the Reserve Bank to have a high level of access to the international financial accounts of the financial service providers at a disaggregated level. The inability to obtain this data is one reason why the Reserve Bank has opted for an average-cost pricing model. Labor will be looking at options to move towards marginal-cost pricing, which will lead to further reductions in fees. In relation to the need for the Payment Systems (Regulation) Amendment Bill 2005, the amendment before the parliament today is to clarify the operations of the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act. The RBA standards are technically price fixing and in breach of section 45A of the Trade Practices Act. An exemption for compliance with the standard on interchange fees is provided for in regulations of the payment system and the Trade Practices Act. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, this expires on 1 July 2005. The bill makes the regulation into law, with the effect of providing permanent protection from part IV of the Trade Practices Act for all actions relating to the standards identified in regulation. Labor has consulted with the ACCC about how this law will work in practice. The bill should not exempt financial service providers from the Trade Practices Act except as required for strict compliance with the standard.

203,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (9.59 Am),"The Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 givescreates a broader exemption than needed for compliance with these standards. The ACCC has advised Labor that the courts are likely to interpret this bill narrowly. Still, it is essential that this bill not exempt the financial service providers from all the restrictions of the Trade Practices Act in relation to price fixing. To aid the interpretation of this bill by the courts in any subsequent judicial review, Labor calls upon the minister to now clearly state in his summingup that the intent of this bill is not to exempt the financial service providers from price-fixing restrictions in the Trade Practices Act, except as required to be able to comply with the Reserve Bank of Australia standard. Systems (Regulation) Amendment Bill 2005. Point (1) of section 6 in part 1 of the Payment Systems (Regulation) Act 1998 ‘provides for the regulation of payment systems and the purchase payment facilities’. Subsection 11(1) of the act provides that the Reserve Bank of Australia has the power to designate payment systems if it considers that it is in the public interest to do so. On 26 August 2002, the bank determined a standard for the setting of wholesale interchange fees for participants in credit card schemes. The standard came into force on 1 July 2003, and the bank then designated three participants for the purposes of the standard on 12 April 2001-Visa card, MasterCard and Bankcard. Interchange fees are charged between financial institutions in order to provide credit card services. However, if the participants in the designated schemes comply with the standards on the setting and charging of interchange fees, they risk contravening part IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974. Part IV of the Trade Practices Act describes and prohibits various restrictive trade practices. Subparagraphs of the TPA respectively provide that anything specified in, and specifically authorised by, an act or regulation made under an act is exempted from the operations of part IV. The payments system regulations of 2003, made under section 32 of the act, provide interim relief by protecting credit card schemes from liability under part IV of the act. However, these regulations apply only until 30 June 2005, as paragraph 51(1)(c) of the Trade Practices Act prevents such regulations from operating for more than two years and prevents similar regulations from being introduced. The bill eliminates the overlap between the Trade Practices Act and the standard by specifically authorising, for the purposes of paragraph 51 of the TPA, the setting of charges and interchange fees in designated payment systems by participants of specified schemes in accordance with the standard. up on this bill, I welcome the support of members for the bill. The bill will ensure that compliance with Reserve Bank of Australia interchange fee standards will not breach the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act. These amendments support the important reforms to the Australian payments system being undertaken by the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank’s interchange fee standards ensure that those fees reflect underlying costs. Moreover, the reforms aim to increase the transparency of fees to consumers and to promote competition in the payments system. I commend the bill to the House. Question agreed to.

205,Mr Pearce (Aston,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (10.07 am)-In summingOrdered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment. BILL 2005 Second Reading Debate resumed from 10 March on motion by Dr Nelson: That this bill be now read a second time. Dr EMERSON (Rankin) (10.08 am)-The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 2) Bill 2005 is the fifth such bill introduced to implement technical amendments associated with the introduction of the Higher Education Support Act, which came into effect on 1 January 2005. That means we have had an average of nearly one tidy-up bill for every two weeks that the new act has been in effect. This bill was introduced the day after the first higher education bill for 2005 cleared the House. The bill includes two issues that could be described as somewhat more than ‘technical revisions’, as the minister described them in his speech. I will go to some of those amendments, but, given that the budget came down just last night, this is an opportunity to debate this legislation in the broader context of the budget funding priorities. I would like to point out to members that last night the spending spree which the government engaged in during the last budget and during the election campaign grew from $66 billion, as first estimated by Access Economics, to $105 billion. That is an enormous amount of extra spending. It would be the hope of all Australians that a good part of that extra spending would be on investment in Australia’s future. The investment that we would seek is investment in the future drivers of productivity growth in this country, and what better source of productivity growth and economic prosperity than the young people of Australia. Sadly, of that $105 billion spending spree it is very difficult to identify more than a miniscule amount of extra funding that is devoted to investing in the young people of Australia. Cash-starved universities remain cash starved. Indexation arrangements have been prejudiced by this government’s desire to index university grants only by an amount that is less than the full costs of administration and salaries that they incur. As a result of that, these universities are becoming very desperate financially. When a university becomes desperate financially, inevitably it is going to be forced to seek other sources of funding. The government, to an extent, has obliged in that it has implemented for students two major measures from the beginning of 2005. Firstly, there is a very substantial lift in HECS fees. Those students who are able to access subsidised university education through the payment of HECS have now been confronted with fee increases of up to 25 per cent. It comes as no surprise that most, if not all, universities are availing themselves of the opportunity to so increase their fees by the full 25 per cent because they are being starved of cash through the government’s very tough indexation arrangements-refusing to index fully for the extra costs that those universities confront. The other major change is a much wider implementation of full fee-paying student arrangements for Australian students. Up until 2005 a very small proportion of university places was being taken by full fee-paying Australian students. The government has relaxed the arrangements there so that 35 per cent of Australian places can now be taken by full fee-paying students. It has facilitated that through FEE-HELP, a new loan scheme that the government is MAIN COMMITTEE implementing. This means that we are moving, tragically, away from the philosophy of university education funding of previous Labor governments-a philosophy that was originally introduced and implemented by Gough Whitlam. We are moving back to the pre-Whitlam era, when privilege and not talent determined whether young Australians would be able to obtain a university degree. The previous Labor government introduced the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. It is an income related loan scheme. The idea behind it was that students themselves could make some contribution to the cost of university education out of their future incomes. Crucially, the extra funding that would be generated out of the HECS arrangements would then be devoted to increasing the number of university places. It worked like a charm. University places in Australia have increased dramatically as a result of the implementation of HECS. We should recall that the repayment of the HECS loan is conditional upon the graduate earning a specified threshold level of income. Those who earn less than that threshold level of income do not have to repay the HECS debts. Under Labor the level of HECS fees was set so as to only partially cover the true cost of a university degree-about 20 to 30 per cent of the recurrent costs of a university degree, in fact. Why did Labor do that? The answer is that Labor recognised that a university education, though very good for the student, is also good for the broader community. In the information age university education is extraordinarily valuable for Australia. We need to be thinking about ways of broadening access to university for working-class Australian children. That is what HECS has been able to do, by dramatically expanding the number of university places. But some very bad policy was implemented from 1997, upon the election of the Howard government. Rather than acknowledge that there is a strong case for heavy subsidisation of university education, the government increased HECS charges by between 31 and 119 per cent, depending on the particular course. At that same time the government reduced the income threshold at which repayment of HECS begins-by some 30 to 40 per cent. It also provided for full fee-paying Australian students, but without a loan scheme. Consequently the take-up rate was small, presumably because most students did not have the money to pay full fees back in 1997. An analysis by Professor Bruce Chapman and Dr Ryan concludes in respect of the impact of HECS on the socioeconomic composition of university enrolments from 1988-just before the introduction of HECS-through to 1999 as follows: ... HECS did not discourage university participation in general or among individuals from low wealth groups. It also concludes HECS: ... has had no discernible effects on the access of the disadvantaged to higher education. That is what Labor had hoped in introducing that scheme. On top of those regressive changes that the government introduced in 1997, it implemented a series of very problematic changes to operate from 2005. First, universities were allowed to increase their HECS fees by up to 25 per cent. Second-and this is a positive measure; I will give credit where credit is due-the HECS repayment threshold was lifted from about $26,500 per annum to just over $36,000 per annum. So in effect the government was partially reversing a decision that it made in 1997. But, third, universities were permitted from 2005 to MAIN COMMITTEE fill up to 35 per cent of places for Australian students with full fee-paying students. The final change that was implemented from 1 January this year was that, to assist full fee-paying students, an income related loans scheme called FEE-HELP was introduced-like HECS but with a loan cap of $50,000. These changes, particularly those related to full fee-paying students and FEE-HELP, will be quite damaging. I need find no greater authority for that conclusion than the Minister for Education, Science and Training himself. The education minister knows that the capping of FEE-HELP at $50,000 will be quite regressive. This is a conclusion that was reached by Professor Bruce Chapman and Gillian Beer in a study released in 2004. It says, in part: However, if the capping of the loan leads to up-front fees, the effects are much more considerable and arguably much more regressive ... this aspect of FEE-HELP has the important potential to jeopardise the access of those who expect to receive relatively low future incomes. While this does not necessarily mean that relatively poor students at the point of entry will be adversely affected, this aspect of the 2005 reforms seems to be very regressive when viewed in a lifetime context. The education minister agrees. But the education minister has no clout in the cabinet. We saw last night that he has no clout in the cabinet-$23 billion extra funding went to tax cuts but you might have reckoned that the education minister would have had a little victory in getting the cap removed on FEE-HELP. We know he wants to remove the cap on FEE-HELP because he told the Jon Faine program on 4 August last year that he did. I will refer to some of the conversation between Jon Faine and the minister. Faine says: The man responsible for introducing student loans says the way the system is evolving and where you are taking it is only going to help rich students, students from rich families, is he right? The minister says: Well in fact Professor Chapman is right, but the interpretation of what he is saying is in fact a little bit incorrect. Professor Chapman is one of the people who designed the HECS program and what he is referring to in this context Jon are the full fee paying students, these are the Australian students. That is true; Professor Chapman was referring to those students. The minister goes on to say: Well in fact we have got 784 courses in Australian unis which charge or offer full fee paying places to Australians, we have got about 16 of those courses that have fees of around $100,000 or more, needless to say veterinary science, dentistry and so on. Faine: Medicine? Nelson: Well Medicine not yet, but that’s coming in, and we know that Notre Dame will be about $125,000 and we have heard that Melbourne will be about $200,000. So the minister is deeply concerned about these massive fee increases that he, through legislation, is allowing to occur. Jon Faine says: Now there is no way that an ordinary Australian family can afford to put a kid through one of those courses is there? Nelson: Well in fact you are right ... You would resign after an interview like that, wouldn’t you? You would go off to cabinet, saying: ‘Jon Faine is right. Professor Chapman is right. It is very unfair, it is very regressive, I’ll go and fix it up in cabinet.’ MAIN COMMITTEE The shadow minister for education is here, and the shadow minister for education cannot see where the minister has been able to fix this up in cabinet. We had a good look yesterday and we could not find any reference to it. Why? Because the minister was rolled by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. The Minister for Health and Ageing should have resigned when he was rolled in relation to the Medicare safety net, which he said was an ironclad promise. Similarly, we had the education minister saying that he was going to fix this regressive aspect of FEE-HELP for full fee-paying Australian students. That is what he pledged to do, but he went into the cabinet room and got rolled, and he should certainly at the very least consider his position. I remember the health minister considered his for-what did he say?-about 30 seconds. If the education minister could consider his position for at least 30 seconds-or maybe a minute-that would be good. But it gets worse. Mr Danby interjectingnot need any help from the member for Melbourne Ports. Well let’s look at some of the fundamental principles Dr Nelson. Did you come from a rich family? Nelson: Arr, no I certainly didn’t. Faine: You got a medical degree? Nelson: Yes, I did medicine at a time when there was no HECS, there were no full fee paying places for Australians, there was nothing like that. Faine: Well don’t you think it’s fair that anyone from any family no matter what their capacity to pay but just on their sheer ability should have an equal chance? Nelson: Well the situation in theory, you are right. That is just astonishing. The minister went on: ... the situation we have got at the moment is that ... you miss out on a HECS place, whether you are rich or poor the university will offer you a full fee paying place, at the moment, until our reforms start next year, if you are poor, you are just as likely to say ‘I can’t afford it, love to do it’. So instead you take up a HECS place in a uni you don’t want to be at. Faine: And someone else who can just write out a cheque … Nelson: Exactly! Faine: … because Daddy has got the money in the bank … Nelson: Exactly! Faine: … buys that place and that is not fair. Nelson: You are absolutely right Jon. ‘You’re absolutely right, Jon. I’m a dud of a minister because I can’t get this outrageous situation reversed in the cabinet room. Tony Abbott and I have the same amount of clout in the cabinet room: none at all.’ Why? Because the Treasurer announced tax cuts for the rich last night and the abolition of the superannuation tax surcharge. That means way over $100 a week for the wealthiest in the country-including, I might add, elected colleagues here, who will benefit very substantially from the abolition of the superannuation tax surcharge and from tax cuts for people earning up to $125,000. So this minister could not get this inequity reversed. MAIN COMMITTEE",171,Payment Systems Regulation Amendment Bill 2005

207,Dr Emerson,"But he is a good help from time to time. Jon Faine goes on:It would not have cost a lot of money to get it reversed. More importantly, to the extent that it would have cost some money, it would have been a good investment in Australia’s future. If you look at international evidence about the sources of productivity growth and future prosperity around the world, there is an international consensus that it is now our people. Investing in our people is the best investment we can possibly make. Yet this government has such an ideological prejudice against public investment in universities that it wants to go to the private route. We hear the minister saying in parliament, ‘Why should ordinary people have to fund the education of university students?’ The fact is that university students are going to be crucially important in determining Australia’s future economic prospects in an ageing population. We need to lift productivity growth in this country, and the great source of productivity growth for Australia in the future is our young people. In the next 40 years there will be four million more Australians over the age of 65. There will be two million more working-age Australians and there will be only a few more-a couple of hundred thousand-young people. The Treasurer is right-sometimes he gets it rightwhen he says, ‘Demography is destiny.’ What that means is that our young people will determine the future shape and the future prosperity of this country.

This legislation is a series of technical amendments, which are sometimes, arguably-and the minister will argue the case-somewhat more than technical amendments.

214,Dr Emerson,"It is all about priorities. We need to be investing in Australia’s future.government’s $66 billion spending spree has become a $105 billion spending spree. That can only increase the risk of an interest rate rise, which will wipe out the $6-a-week tax cut just like that. The $6-a-week tax cut will be barely enough to cover the increased cost of petrol. But worse, most of the government’s $105 million spending spree is for consumption and not investment. It is pouring fuel on the fire of consumption in this country while failing to invest in Australia’s future and failing to invest in the future of our young people. It is a disgraceful budget in failing that basic test. The government should go back to the drawing board, with a new education minister, to make sure that our young people do indeed have a proper university education in this country. tribution of the member for Rankin is that he is consistent. He is consistently negative, drowning in his own negativity like the rest of the ALP. They certainly have no vision for this country, they certainly have reform fatigue in opposition and they certainly cannot see the future of this nation. They come into this place on a regular basis and run down the clock. That is all they do. They have no vision, they have no strategy; they just rabbit on and run down the clock. They use up their 20 minutes every single time, without introducing anything new into the debate, without introducing anything that could benefit this country. They merely run down the clock. I think we see them right on their limit. The limit of their ability to contribute is to just take up time in this chamber. come to the subject of the bill. Amendment (2005 Measures No. 2) Bill 2005, is an important bill. It forms part of the progressive reform which this government is making to tertiary education. While the matters before us today are largely of a technical nature-they concern the way students’ contributions are fixed and the way those contributions can be varied and students kept informed and protected, and they clarify the financial arrangements relating to work experience-let us not lose sight of the bigger picture and what the Higher Education Support Act is trying to achieve. We need to encourage education. The government are very focused on encouraging education-in contrast to the negative carping we hear from the member for Jagajaga. We are keen to encourage higher education. Our society would be all the poorer without those academics and students who seek to pursue their own enthusiasms in the fields of science or history or literature, free from financial considerations. Indeed, whatever changes are made to higher education in the future, and whatever pressures come to bear on universities, I hope there will always be a place for those individuals trying to shed light on the way we were many years ago, the way we are now and the way we are likely to be in years to come. But the days of the ivory tower are over. No longer can our universities be isolated from the pressures of a rapidly changing world. They must be responsive, not just to the wider changes in society but also to the needs of the community they serve. They must be responsible with the public money they receive and spend and the service they provide to their students. Indeed, only if universities respond-and are helped to respond-in this way are we able to preserve the opportunity for those whose interests are perhaps less worldly, but whose interests enrich our society nonetheless, to continue their work. The proposed measures in this bill will assist with our aim that universities serve local communities, responding to their MAIN COMMITTEE",176,Higher Education Legislation Amendment 2005 Measures No 2

217,Mr Hartsuyker,"The bill I wish to speak on today, the Higher Education Legislationneeds and playing a part in building a future for those communities. I want to see universities financially viable. I want to see them capable of contributing on a national scale in scientific research, in the arts, and in business and commerce. That is their basic brief. I said I wanted to see universities contributing on a national scale. It is now a fact of life that to contribute nationally you have to be able to compete internationally. You cannot help your nation become competitive with other nations unless your product is as good as or better than theirs. That is why I welcome the provisions of the Higher Education Support Act that will partially deregulate higher education, enabling individual universities to play to their strengths and determine the value of the courses they offer. I believe this offers opportunities for our institutions to develop world-beating courses and specialities that can benefit our country and help us further mark out our place in the world. The government will provide an extra $11 billion over 10 years, starting from last year, which is, I believe, ‘backing Australia’s future’-to use the title of the document which launched this strategy. I also welcome the extra funding for regional campuses, but I will come to that later. It is only fair that with extra resources comes extra responsibility. The act tries to ensure that the universities deliver value for money. It may not be a phrase that has had too much currency in the academic world in the past, but it is one which will have a greater focus in the years to come. And why not? Students investing time, effort and money in a particular course want to be assured that that course is going to efficiently and effectively meet their needs and provide them with the skills they need in an ever more competitive jobs market. The taxpayer, too, has an interest in this process because it is the taxpayer who is providing a large proportion of the funding for universities, and it is the taxpayer who has the broader interest of ensuring that we produce a well-educated society and a well-educated young work force. The act also enhances Commonwealth funding for student places. There will be nearly 36,000 new Commonwealth-supported student places over the next four years and more funding for each of those students. Furthermore, no eligible students will have to pay upfront fees when they enrol. The Higher Education Contribution Scheme will see the repayment threshold increased. Loans will be introduced to help students paying full fees in public and private higher education institutions and for those who need help to study overseas. All this, and the measures to encourage greater access for disadvantaged groups, will mean that far fewer students will be deterred from pursuing higher education-far from the rhetoric that we hear from the other side. This is important: if Australian education is to assist our economy and if we are to compete on the global stage, we must ensure that everyone has the opportunity to obtain the kind of education that will allow them to contribute to the ongoing prosperity of this nation. I believe that it is particularly important that young people in regional and rural areas are given the opportunity to contribute to their communities. We have heard a lot about the global economy in the context of the reforms and challenges that it offers to our universities. I would like to consider for a moment what it means for local communities and higher education in rural areas. The global economy clearly offers opportunities for anyone with a good business idea and a good product. The global economy gives them an opportunity to access a huge marketplace with a supply of customers around the world. Provided there is access to the latest telecommunications technology, people in regional and rural areas can compete on the world stage. However, our regional universities MAIN COMMITTEE have to be up to the task. They have to offer the types of courses that people who are going to set up businesses in regional and rural areas will need. They have to offer the types of courses that are specific to the particular areas in which they operate. That is a very important factor on which my local university, the Coffs Harbour campus of Southern Cross University, is focused. Universities generally are focusing on the wider world, and regional universities are playing their part in that regard. It is a role of higher education to provide the training and skills which will help people to fulfil their maximum potential, that will help them sustain a community in a metropolitan or regional area. If you decide to stay in a community in an inner regional area, you perhaps need a broader range of skills. In regional areas generally the tasks are not as specific; people in cities in many cases tend to be far more specialised than people in regional and rural areas, where the work demands may be more generalised. Universities have to adapt to the differences in professional and business operations in the regions as opposed to those in the metropolitan areas. There are certainly generalists in metropolitan areas but in regional areas, like the electorate of Cowper, many professionals operate at a more general level. Universities also have to be focused on retraining. The old tradition of entering a career or profession and staying there for a lifetime is changing. People are changing careers several times during their working lives. Universities have to adapt to that. They have to offer training for young graduates and also for people seeking retraining to move from one career to another, to broaden their experience and to enable them to meet changing needs in those areas. If our universities are responsive, they will more effectively meet community needs. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 2) Bill 2005 focuses on providing transparency for students and the university sector. It provides greater flexibility in the way in which our higher education bodies deliver their services. The bill will amend the Higher Education Support Act by making a range of technical adjustments aimed at ensuring that all guidelines may provide for amounts to be indexed using the indexation formula in the act, and clarifying provisions in relation to students’ tax file numbers. It will also ensure that the appropriate decision review provisions apply to students occupying work experience in industry units. It will clarify provisions in relation to working out an accumulated HELP debt. It will also clarify that students accessing FEE-HELP may be enrolled with Open Learning Australia, and allow universities to publish their schedules of student contribution and tuition fees and census dates twice a year instead of once, which will allow universities to notify students of new study units. The bill extends OS-HELP eligibility to students who have at least six months of study left to complete their courses. It will also amend the Higher Education Support Act to ensure that it provides for arrangements relating to crediting a person’s student learning entitlement for those enrolled in work experience in industry units. There will be some positive outcomes from this legislation. For example, by publishing student contribution amounts and tuition fees twice a year, providers will have more flexibility to deal with changes in demand and supply for particular units of study. Students will now be more informed about the decisions made by higher education providers. More students will be able to access OS-HELP assistance for their overseas study. Students will only be required to complete half a full-time year of study rather than a whole year of full-time study upon their return to Australia. This amendment will ensure that students undertaking work experience units of study have the same entitlements for reconsideration of any decisions relating to MAIN COMMITTEE recrediting their student learning entitlement or FEE-HELP balance as apply in the case of other units of study. The legislation clarifies that a person who undertakes studies through Open Learning Australia is a student and therefore has the same entitlements to FEE-HELP as other students. These reforms will benefit higher education providers and students in regional and rural areas. In my electorate, as I have said, we have the Coffs Harbour campus of the Southern Cross University and this government has been providing additional support for that campus. The Australian government has been very focused on the fact that it costs more to provide educational services in regional and rural areas. The Coffs Harbour campus of the Southern Cross University provides a range of courses, including tourism and hospitality, which assist in sustaining the city’s local businesses and our local tourism base. It achieves skilling of our local young work force to meet the needs of the job market in the town. The Southern Cross University makes a point of catering also for mature students going through the process of retraining, who may need to change their skill set in order to continue to contribute to the regional area that the university services. There is an opportunity to undertake a range of courses to meet the needs of the local area. The university runs courses in teaching and nursing-two very important courses. My electorate has a very old demographic and offering a nursing course at Southern Cross University is a vital part of ensuring that we have the work force to look after those older Australians who seek to retire, or who have spent their whole working life, in the electorate. It is vitally important that the university is effectively meeting the demands of the aged care work force. The university is also very focused on providing young teaching graduates. The education sector is another very important source of employment in the area. The university is offering young people the opportunity to grow up in a regional area, receive tertiary training in a regional area, and then contribute to that regional area in their working life. It is great for Coffs Harbour that a young person can grow up in Coffs Harbour, receive tertiary training and then contribute to the work force, all without having to leave their home town if that is what they choose. That is a great amenity which is being offered by the university. The government is supporting the university through being aware of the fact that providing an educational service is more expensive in rural and regional areas. Southern Cross University receives a 7½ per cent additional subsidy-one of the highest subsidies that is available under the act-in support of the fact that the government is aware that it costs more to deliver those services in the regions. I believe that the government has worked very hard and very effectively to ensure that we have a higher education environment that is going to meet the needs of this country in the coming years. I think we have worked very hard to ensure that students at regional and rural campuses are not going to be disadvantaged by geography, that the universities they attend are going to be funded in a way that takes into account the fact that there are higher costs involved in providing courses in those areas. The universities, too, are responding. They are responding by ensuring that the types of courses they provide are meeting a need-perhaps a need which is more generalist, perhaps a need which is very focused on providing people who are skilled in areas of demand in our local area-and that is a very wise approach. I commend the approach that this government has taken in supporting higher education through funding particularly rural and regional campuses with a view to ensuring that they are MAIN COMMITTEE adequately resourced to provide courses in locations where, in many cases, students have grown up and seek to work in the future. I commend this bill to the House and I certainly commend the actions of this government in supporting higher education. Ms MACKLIN (Jagajaga) (10.45 am)-Unfortunately, the member for Cowper is ignoring the devastating effects of this government’s funding on the University of Newcastle-a university very close to his electorate, which is going to have to lay off 450 staff because of this government’s massive cuts to our universities. It is extraordinary this morning to be debating the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 2) Bill 2005, which is before us. It brings home the missed opportunities of last night’s budget-a budget that included $22 billion to be blown on tax cuts for the wealthiest people in this country. Amidst the largesse being handed out to the top end of town, the government has decided not to increase proper funding for our universities. The Minister for Education, Science and Training has decided that there will not be indexation of our university grants from Canberra, even though the universities have made it plain that that is their No. 1 priority. Last night we had billions of dollars being spent on benefiting the wealthiest people in Australia but nothing to index the grants for our cash starved universities. There is no question that our universities are suffering as a result of the $5 billion in funding cuts imposed on them by this government over the last nine years. Chronic underfunding is certainly threatening our universities. If anyone is in any doubt about that, they should read the Sydney Morning Herald series, which day after day points this out. Our universities are suffering and their quality is in decline because of this government’s budget cuts. The OECD has found that Australia has had one of the largest declines in public investment in universities and TAFEs of any OECD country. This country dropped public investment in higher education by 8.7 per cent, while the majority of our competitors actually increased it. Australia is one of only seven OECD nations to have reduced government funding for tertiary education per student between 1995 and 2001. But, instead of taking the opportunity last night to deal with this funding crisis in our universities, the government laid out its priorities very clearly: to give a big tax increase to the wealthiest people in Australia and, of course, to not provide proper indexation for our universities. This will be a terrible blow for our universities and for the staff and students who work and study at them. It will guarantee-and there is no question about it-that further fee hikes will have to be faced by students and their families. This government’s refusal to fund our universities, to make sure that they are funded to keep pace with increasing costs, will mean that the universities will be coming back to Canberra, trying to get approval for further fee hikes that will make it more and more expensive for young Australians to get a university education. That increase in HECS will come about entirely because this government has refused to properly index grants; it has refused to make sure that our universities are funded to keep up with their running costs. Just to tread water, to keep up with their running costs, universities will have to come back to Canberra for approval for further HECS rises. We know that this government has already increased HECS fees significantly. Until the latest hikes, HECS fees under this government had increased, on average, by 100 per cent. Now we have the majority of universities deciding to impose another 25 per cent fee hike and, of course, an associated massive explosion in the number of people paying full fees-that is, Australians paying full fees to get a university education in this country. MAIN COMMITTEE Let us just think for a minute about what young people have to pay to get a university degree-and this is if they get a HECS place. They will be paying $20,000 for a science degree, $40,000 for a law degree and about $15,000 for an arts degree. That is the level of debt that Australian students are going to have when they finish their university education. But even worse than that is what the government is doing on full fees. As a result of this government’s changes, we now have about 200,000 students who are allowed to jump the queue and buy a place at university if they have the money or if they have very wealthy and very generous parents. These are Australian undergraduates paying full fees costing as much as $210,000. Of course, these students can expect even more fee increases. That will happen both for HECS students and for full fee students. The bill we are debating today, as others have said, contains a number of technical amendments. Others have described these, so I will do so only very briefly. I must say that it is extraordinary: this is the fifth bill introduced to implement technical amendments associated with the principal act, which only came into effect on 1 January this year. The first bill with technical amendments was introduced the day after the first higher education amendment bill for 2005 cleared the House, and I have no doubt that we will see a few more of these bills trying to clean up the mistakes that the minister made in the first bill. The bill we are debating here today includes two issues which have been described by the minister as technical revisions, but I think they go a little bit further than that. Of the two provisions that I want to highlight here, one is to extend OS-HELP eligibility to students with one full-time semester left to complete their degree-that is down from one full-time year-and the second is to allow higher education providers to alter their fee schedules more than once a year. So the first of the provisions extends eligibility to a larger number of students who might want a loan to complete their studies at an overseas university. The second returns the higher education providers to what was the status quo prior to the principal act, the Higher Education Support Act, when they were free to alter their fee schedules at any time. I must say that it has become pretty commonplace for the Minister for Education, Science and Training to provide no rationale for these changes in either the explanatory memorandum or the minister’s second reading speech. There is a little explanation but no justification. Also-and this is the important point, which I hope the minister will respond to at the endthere is no indication of the value of the loans and the potential impact of the proposed change. It would be helpful for the parliament to be informed about those issues. The other parts of the bill are all of a much more technical nature. I will not go through the details of those here. They are uncontroversial and Labor will be supporting them. Even though it does return higher education providers to the arrangements they had before the major changes that were agreed to by the Senate in 2003, the measure that we fear-that is, to allow higher education providers to set their fee schedules more than once a yearcertainly brings forward our concerns about a new loans scheme that the government has recently introduced. That is the scheme called FEE-HELP. There is no doubt that FEE-HELP will have a highly inflationary impact on fee setting by those institutions whose students are able to access these loans. New figures released by the Department of Education, Science and Training last month show that the Howard government’s introduction of FEE-HELP loans will actually generate a very significant level of new debt for thousands of Australian students and their families. In MAIN COMMITTEE fact, these new figures that have just been provided by the department show that the new debt will skyrocket to over $3 billion by 2008-09. That is a pretty extraordinary effort by this minister in a very short space of time. According to the education department’s figures, the debts are expected to rise from $256 million in 2004-05 to a total of more than $3 billion in 200809. What an extraordinary explosion in student debt-and these are just the figures for students with FEE-HELP loans. The new figures also show that more than 60,000 Australian students will incur a FEEHELP debt. Of course, these are the students who will be paying these massive full fees, fees as high as $210,000, for a university degree. This comes at a time when the previous speaker, a member of the coalition government, says that we should be encouraging more Australians to go to university. That is dead right, but what this government is saying, ‘If you want to go to university, it’s going to be a US-style system where it costs massive amounts of money.’ I do not think anyone would disagree that $210,000 is a massive amount of money-it is that money that is actually going to open university doors and saddle Australian families with huge debts that they may not be able to repay in the future. The cost of another key Howard government commitment has blown out. The new figures from the education department show a massive blow-out in the cost of FEE-HELP. This is not the only blow-out in costs that this government has had to confront. This blow-out in the cost of FEE-HELP comes very hot on the heels of the news of the Medicare safety net blow-out. You would have to say that this government’s credibility on costings of its schemes has all but been lost when you see these massive blow-out figures. Maybe it is hardly surprising that the government is not concerned about these cost blow-outs. I want to read something from the OECD’s publication Education at a glance. It says: Many OECD countries with the highest growth in private spending have also shown the highest increase in public funding of education. This indicates that increasing private spending on tertiary education tends to complement rather than replace public investment. But it goes on to say: The main exception to this is Australia, where the shift towards private expenditure at tertiary level has been accompanied by a fall in the level of public expenditure in real terms. So let us not take any notice of the waffle that we get from the government; let us actually go to an independent source which sets out what this government is about. The government likes to portray itself as adhering to the current orthodoxy about broadening the sources from which universities are funded, but the facts are much simpler than thatas the OECD sets out. It is all about shifting the burden of funding our universities onto students and making them pay extraordinary fees for a university education. There have been very crude cuts to public funding of our universities, and it is students who have been expected to fill that hole. We do know that the Minister for Education, Science and Training has been rolled recently in cabinet. The member for Rankin also highlighted this. What the minister for education was attempting to do was to increase the amount which can be lent to full fee-paying students-that is, Australian students-at our universities. The decision of the government a couple of years ago was to cap FEE-HELP loans at $50,000. Students who get into a medical degree at the University of Melbourne and face fees of $210,000 will be able to get a FEE-HELP loan of $50,000, but of course they will then MAIN COMMITTEE have to go to their very wealthy and very generous parents for the rest-otherwise they will have no hope of being able to pay those fees. The minister assured radio listeners last August in these terms: ... this is one of the things I was determined to change, at the moment if you are offered a full fee paying place and you come from a poor family you might as well be offered a ticket to Mars. Let us see why that is. Veterinary science at the University of Melbourne costs $35,000 a year. The minister’s loan scheme would get a student paying those fees halfway into the second year of a five-year degree that costs $175,000. Because of this government’s policy of increasing the cost of education at every opportunity, a place in veterinary science is still a ‘ticket to Mars’. The poor student cannot have any prospect of paying those sorts of fees in order to get a veterinary science degree at the University of Melbourne. The answer to this problem is not uncapping FEE-HELP loans but increasing the number of HECS places. That is what we should be doing-making sure that students pay affordable fees at university. Even capped at $50,000 FEE-HELP loans for university students are going to generate massive new debts for thousands of Australian students and their familiesskyrocketing to over $3 billion by 2008-09, which is a very short time away. If this minister were to get his way, his pet plan-uncapping FEE-HELP-would mean an untold blow-out in student debt, leaving students with university debts that many of them would never be able to repay. Another area where the minister for education is swimming against the international tide is in his proposals to undermine the definition of what it is to be a university. The minister has tried to justify his failure to act to close down the so-called ‘Oceania University of Medicine’ by passing the buck to the Victorian government. This is intriguing from a minister who seems very determined to micromanage our universities and to tell states how to run their schools. On this occasion he seems to be determined to refuse to take responsibility for the job that he actually has. In the education sector the Commonwealth has a most unambiguous role in higher education. It is an area that has been under active consideration during the life of this governmenta lot of that active consideration having had shocking effects. But there is one issue that the minister is really thinking about at the moment-that is, what the name ‘university’ should represent. One of the things that he should be determined to do is to protect the term ‘university’, but in the case of the Oceania University of Medicine in Melbourne he has continued to refuse to act either to make this organisation close down or to remove the term ‘university’ from its name. The Victorian government has done its job in this case. They have not given Oceania the authority to grant degrees as either a university or a non self-accrediting higher education provider. So they have actually done their job. Now it is the Howard government’s job to protect the title of ‘university’. When it comes to protecting the good name and reputation of our universities it does seem as if this minister is just a little bit lost. He will not deal with the Oceania University of Medicine and earlier this year when the minister spoke at the National Press Club he responded to some of the criticisms I have made of him-where I have been calling on him to protect the name ‘university’. This is what he said: ... the average person listening to the ‘Mc Degree’ thing would think ‘Yeah, what’s wrong with that’. MAIN COMMITTEE I find it quite extraordinary that the education minister of this country would go to the National Press Club and publicly embrace the concept of ‘Mc Degrees’ at our universities. It is bizarre. It is unbelievable that we have a minister for education who seems entirely comfortable with likening the qualifications from our outstanding university system with the delivery of fast food. I should also take this opportunity to correct a statement by the minister when he said: ... inherent in that is a basic criticism of the kind of training that’s offered at McDonalds and similar operations ... I do not know whether the minister decided to completely miss the point on purpose: of course it has nothing to do with the merits of fast-food training; but the fast-food training that young people receive at universities has absolutely no relationship to the standard of education that each and every Australian would expect to receive at a university. It does seem that this minister is determined to no longer protect the great name of our universities. Why is this happening; why is it that the minister is either confused or no longer interested in protecting the reputation of our universities? Maybe it is the case-and perhaps the member for Cook could let us in on what is going on in their party room-that the minister for education is not 100 per cent totally focused on his job. Not long ago, the weekend Financial Review said: Nelson’s own busy-as-a-bee schedule has been widely noted. I am sure it has been widely noted by the Liberal backbench. One observer told that newspaper that: Nelson’s in a portfolio where he can go around to every electorate ... we’ve got Brendan turbo-charging around the place in a Comcar. I do not know if it is the same observer, but the article went on to say: There are quite a few MPs who came into politics in the last 10 years who believe in the Brendan story. Others find him a bit schmaltzy ... His whole office is attuned to getting the deputy leadershipNo wonder the universities are suffering. The article continued: But with Brendan you really couldn’t be sure he wouldn’t push you over a cliff. I hope that will not happen to the member for Cook. That has certainly been the fate of a number of important features of the Australian education system touched by his policies. What could be more important than making sure that access to universities is merit based? What could be more important than making sure that students can afford a university education? And what could be more important than the issue that is so critical right nowsafeguards of Australia’s international reputation? There must be something going on. The Australian must know of this story about the cliff, because in today’s higher education supplement of the Australian there is a story, on research, called ‘Pulling back from the funding cliff’. Maybe it is not the member for Cook who is being pushed over the cliff; maybe it is our universities that are being pushed over the cliff. This minister is not concentrating on his job. He is just thinking about his leadership prospects, and while that happens we are going to see the quality of our universities threatened as a direct result of his complete inattention. Opposition and our education spokesman in this debate on the Higher Education Legislation MAIN COMMITTEE",177,Higher Education Legislation Amendment 2005 Measures No 2
218,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (11.09 Am),"I am very happy to follow the Deputy Leader of theAmendment (2005 Measures No. 2) Bill 2005. These measures are almost entirely technical in nature. Indeed, the legislative brief in relation to this bill runs for a whole two pages or so. If you go to the explanatory memorandum, you will see that the core of what these measures are about runs to just over one page. I will give the Main Committee a bit of the flavour of the nature of these changes. I then want to expand on that somewhat in terms of the implications of these changes and how they fit into the broader measures that have already been introduced. Then, as my deputy leader and the other Labor speakers here have done-the member for Rankin has, and the member for Corio, who is following me, will, in his own inimitable way, no doubt deal with these matters-I will go to the implications of this for Australian students in our own electorates and more broadly. The technical nature of this is indicated in the explanatory memorandum. This bill would seek to ‘clarify the nature of review procedures which can be made under the higher education provider guidelines’, extend the scope of reviewable decisions and ‘ensure that requirements for review by request correspond with the requirements for reviews initiated by a review officer’. It will clarify provisions in relation to cancelling enrolments and allow the publishing of more than one schedule of student contribution amounts and tuition fees per year. There are some other provisions which extend what they call OS-HELP eligibility for students who are doing some overseas studying; clarify provisions in relation to accumulated HELP debt; and allow for more than one date to be specified for the publishing of census dates and equivalent full-time student load values, and so on. There is not much more in the EM because the relative depth of this is not so great. This bill deals with higher education, and I note that the older I get-and the further away from the higher education that I was able to get at the University of New South Wales following my HSC-the harder it is, I suppose, for me to remember some of the things I picked up there. here I thought: if you look at the technical nature of this, it actually tells you something about the previous measures, the intent of this and the impact it will have. It reminded me-and here I absolutely stand to be corrected-of a footnote at about page 151 or 153 of Michael Oakeshott’s book Rationalism in Politics and Other Essays. Whilst discussing Maine, whose great book Law and Customs was the fundamental resource in terms of looking at the way Western legal systems operated and the way in which customary systems operated, he said that Maine made this observation, which I can attempt to make pertinent here. He said: Customary law has the first look of being secreted in the interstices of procedure. It sounds strange, and it is a bit hard to start off with, but the more you think about it, though, the more useful it is. Normally, one would think, if you are looking at customary legal systems such as Aboriginal systems or those of other native populations and so on, that the way in which they normally go about doing things seems to be secreted or embedded in the very way they go about conducting their lives. So their customary law is not separated from the rest of their life, whereas in modern Western legal systems there is a great distinction between the legal system and the rest of people’s lives. They are at a distance from each other. MAIN COMMITTEE",185,Higher Education Legislation Amendment 2005 Measures No 2

220,Mr Hatton,"Still at it; not growing weary. The neurones still activate. On the way upThe connection here is that I have always thought it is a very profound way of looking not just at customary law but also at a whole series of arrangements. You do not look at what is put up front, you do not look at the name-in this case, the particular name of this legislation is not telling you all that much-but you look at the individual procedures that are secreted in or embedded within this bill and the practical effect they will have on Australian students either in providing incentives for them to enter tertiary study or in providing disincentives to keep them out. You have got to go not to the headline stuff but to the actual practicalities of what the bill involves, to what is secreted in the way things are done on a practical basis in those interstices of procedure. Here we find a series of measures linked to prior bills to radically change the way higher education operates in Australia, to take our customary procedures in higher education and dramatically transform them in such a way that what we are going to end up with is yet again to the detriment of Australia’s education system-at least the grafting of an Americanised system onto an Australian rootstock. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition’s example of the minister effectively welcoming the ‘McDonaldisation’ of our education system goes lock step with one of the fundamental mistakes made over the last 50 years, but in particular over the last 30 or 40 years, which is to take holus-bolus elements of the American system-the current ideologies or the current drivers in American educational thought; whatever the fashions are of a particular time-and then attempt to either graft them onto Australia or let that flood through the system. No greater damage has been done to the productivity of Australia’s work force than the way in which, holus-bolus, American predispositions, fashions or moods of the time have been allowed to destroy the comparative strengths and capacity of our system. We have a fundamental problem which has not been addressed by this government since 1996. There has been a lot of propaganda about literacy and numeracy at the lower, school level, but to my knowledge not a single dollar has gone to redressing the generational problems embedded by Australian teachers not being literate enough or, in some cases, numerate enough, because American systems have been taken on. I have said in this place before that the one certain and great thing that George Bush did in his presidency was to ensure that phonics was brought back in as a compulsory mechanism for teaching people how to read. In Australia, right down from infant and primary school level to secondary school level, and now through to university level, we do not have a literate enough population. We have a lowering of standards that has been engendered by the Americanisation of our system in this area, where American fashion has dominated the fashion in the teachers union and the thought in this country. Only in the last 10 years have we seen attempts at the New South Wales state level, and some attempts by the government, to reverse this. But now, instead of $600 million, I think we need about a billion dollar program to fix the problem with our teachers who are not literate enough and who have not been taught well enough to go back into the system to do it well. In terms of the real needs of higher education, I have no better example than what I encountered in my electorate of Blaxland just last week. Last week I went to a function to mark the opening of extensions at the Holy Saviour School. The extensions were opened by the member for Macarthur, Pat Farmer, in his role as Parliamentary Secretary. At that function, I had a discussion with Professor Naguib Kanawati, the pre-eminent Egyptian archaeologist in MAIN COMMITTEE Australia. He came to Australia from Egypt to undertake study at Macquarie University where his wife teaches French. He has built up the university’s school of Egyptology which now has one of the best reputations in the world. He has 52 undergraduate students. He told me that when he gets a PhD thesis presented to him, he is forbidden by the faculty from looking at the grammar or the spelling in that PhD thesis. He is simply told, ‘This is a thesis; you cannot look at any of that, you can only look at the factual basis.’ His point was very potent and it says a great deal about the problems in higher education. He said: ‘Archaeology is about stories and people’s ability to tell stories. It is not just a scientific activity; it is about communicating with other people. If you do not have the ability to do that effectively enough then you are in trouble.’ My comment to him went further than that: if we say that it is good enough in higher education to legitimise illiteracy, if we say it is good enough to legitimise a lowering of our standards and to simply take whatever people give us, then, if we look at the impact of the technical changes in these measures on what happens in higher education, they are dwarfed by the fact that Australia’s great trade advantage, our great pull in this region of the world, was that our higher education system was better than-and regarded as better than-any of those in the region, because it had discipline, certainty and value. Indeed, we have flogged that as a product throughout the region and throughout the world. Our future in the 21st century is utterly dependent on ensuring the quality of that product. But what is the minister for education concentrating on? This load of flummery which is at the base of his attempts to change a publicly funded system into a McDonaldised private education system at the university level. We have this story referred to by the member for Cook about Labor supposedly having some kind of reverse snobbery and not really being for tradespeople and so on. This goes back a number of years but it has never been more potent than since the current minister came into the place. I would like to see this government come up with a series of bills that did not just have small technical measures such as this one. I would like to see bills that did not just say, ‘We’ll build 24 technical high schools on the never-never.’ I would like to see a federal government that would say, ‘Over the past nine years we’ve done a transition. We’ve taken people from being in full apprenticeships to being in traineeships-discounted apprenticeshipswhich are easier to roll out.’ I would like to see a federal government that would say, ‘This problem is so fundamental. The average age of a plumber in Sydney is 53 years. There’s a generational shortfall in Australia in the trades. We, as a federal government, have been responsible for that not being met.’ In the process they can kick the daylights out of the previous federal Labor government if they want to do a bit of evening up, and we can argue about what we did to try to ensure that was turned around. This problem is fundamental to Australia’s productivity and capacity. Where is it being addressed in all of the bills that this education minister has put forward? I am still waiting. Australia is still waiting. What have we got instead? What came through the budget last night. Young Australian students will be penalised through measures such as those in this Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 2) Bill. It will make it more difficult for young Australians to get access to higher education. It will cost them more in HECS. Certainly the level at which they will have to pay HECS will be raised from about $24,500 a year to $35,000 a year, but the amount they will have to pay will be raised from three per cent to four per cent in order to compensate for that. MAIN COMMITTEE We know that this government has put into these bills a series of impositions relating to its expectations of higher education institutions. From talking to Professor Janice Reid from the University of Western SydneyI know absolutely full well just what a dramatic impact there has been on the University of Western Sydney’s campuses in Bankstown, in Campbelltown and elsewhere throughout Sydney. They have fought with all their might and main to reduce their costs, but they have finally succumbed to the government’s pressure, indicating just last month that the stance they took in 2004 to not raise Higher Education Contribution Scheme fees can no longer be sustained. They have finally said: ‘No, we can’t do it. We’ve tried everything that we can in discussion with the government. We’ve pleaded with them. We’ve demonstrated to them that we have a cut in the relative amount given to us by the government and that we are relatively disadvantaged.’ They have now had to reverse a principled stand, and the students at the University of Western Sydney, from my electorate and others surrounding it, will cop a 25 per cent increase as a result of the measures involved in this bill and associated bills. What kind of incentive is that for people to push forward and get into the education system? It is a massive disincentive. Why? It will add $962 a year to the cost of an arts degree and $1,604 to the cost of a law degree from the University of Western Sydney. They have a $9 million deficit. They cannot cut it in any other way. They have attempted to cut back whatever they can. We know that recently the University of Newcastle have taken similar approaches to try and cut their problems and to try not to impact on their students, who are their lifeblood, but they have pointed out-quite rightly, as the shadow minister has pointed out-that there has been a decrease in funding to higher education in Australia. The shadow minister and Deputy Leader of the Opposition has put the order of magnitude of cuts to higher education since 1996 at $5 billion. All of those in the major universities in Australia who have spent almost a decade trying to get a rejigging of higher education to put themselves back onto some footing know that the changes that have been made in the last year or so and in the technical and consequential changes today are going to hurt regional universities and universities like the University of Western Sydney because they have the fewest resources. But basically at this stage they are looking after themselves. They are being pressed forward, just like the universities in the United States. The bigger, older universities who are big enough and ugly enough to look after themselves will benefit to the detriment of those smaller regional ones, whether they are in metropolitan Sydney or out in regional Australia. Professor Janice Reid in this regard has said that the US has fared badly under the reforms of education minister Brendan Nelson and needs extra revenue to improve teaching, research and facilities. It needs to survive, and the University of Western Sydney has had to drop its principled stand that it would not hammer its students by imposing that 25 per cent increase. Labor has made its position in regard to this fundamentally clear. The minister is following on from Dr Kemp in propagandising and attempting to invert reality by coming up with his reverse snobbery bit. What is he doing for the people in trades in Australia? What is the Treasurer doing for those people who want to go into trades and pursue a life there? What is he doing for Australia’s productivity within the regions? I will tell you what they are doing. They are importing tradespeople-plumbers, electricians. We have people coming in. I did not know this until last year. Peter Martin-who was previously with the ABC and is now MAIN COMMITTEE with SBS-was preparing a program for SBS, which ended up not going to air, and he told me about it. There is a secret agenda in the immigration area for this government. They are not just papering over what the situation is; they are almost filling a giant hole. There are now about one-quarter of a million tradespeople coming into Australia every year. It used to be just the blokes working for IBM and a few people down at Honeywell and a couple of other companies that could not get appropriate people. I was down at the Landmark building in Barton, which was completed in July last year, one afternoon last year and I saw all these blokes-a group of Chinese plasterers-walking out. I thought it was a bit strange to see them all walking out at five o’clock in the afternoon after everyone else. They did not have the hard-hats on that everyone else had and all the rest of it. Peter Martin told me the reason for it. They had come as a job lot to do the work. There were no Australian tradespeople to do the work, because under this government they have not been trained. The vast possibility we had to train our young people to take the places of 52and 53-year-olds has been squandered. The possibility we had to export Australian expertise to the region and earn income by doing Australian trades work overseas has been lost. Those people are pouring in. At the end of four years, 50,000 to 60,000 tradespeople get a spot in Australia on an eased education entry and an eased point entry. Young Australian people are not given the appropriate educational benefit because they do not get a go at it. I think that is wrong. I will support the bill generally, but this government has got its educational priorities wrong. (Time expired) sition’s support for this piece of legislation. The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 2) Bill 2005 is indicative of the legislative chaos we have come to expect from this tired and incompetent government. It should be noted that this is the fifth bill introduced to implement the technical amendments associated with the introduction of the Higher Education Support Act 2003, which made significant changes to the Commonwealth’s funding system for higher education. Those changes were substantial and they encompassed a new Commonwealth grants scheme, major changes to HECS, and assistance for students. This bill has two main elements: it extends overseas help eligibility to students with one full-time semester left to complete their degrees, and that is down from one full-time year; and it also allows higher education providers-that is, the non-university providers-to alter their fee schedule more than once a year. The first of these provisions extends eligibility to a larger number of students who may seek a loan to complete their studies at an overseas university. The second provision returns higher education providers to the status quo prior to the Higher Education Support Act when they were free to alter their fee schedule at any time. The procedure in the introduction of this bill to the House is indicative of the arrogance of this government, because there has been no rationale given in either the explanatory memorandum or the minister’s second reading speech for the changes that have been included. This is quite typical of the government: treating this House with contempt and treating this whole area with arrogance. TodayI have some simple questions to ask members of the government, questions which echo that great line in the Bob Dylan sixties classic Like a Rolling Stone. I say this to members opposite: how does it feel? How does it feel to be part of a government that has cut $5 billion from higher education funding? How does it feel to be part of a government that has burdened young Australians with debt and wants to gouge an extra $839 million from students MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Higher Education Legislation Amendment 2005 Measures No 2
221,Mr Gavan O’connor (Corio) (11.29 Am),"In this debate I want to express the oppoand their families in higher HECS fees and a massive expansion of full-fee degrees? How does it feel to be part of a government that allows students to jump the merit queue if their parents are wealthy enough to buy a degree? How does it feel to be part of a government that, within the OECD, has engineered one of the largest declines in public investment in universities and TAFEs? How does it feel to be part of a government that has engineered the fourth most expensive fee structure for university students in the world? It is some record from the ‘minister from Mars’, who is now administering this critical portfolio to Australia’s economic and social development. At a time when Australia is engaged in a cut throat, competitive race to maintain its place in the global economy, this minister and his government are plunging Australia into a race to the bottom as far as higher education funding is concerned. The Labor Party’s philosophical position is quite clear; we have articulated it for decades. We oppose the creation of a US style system where money more than merit opens the door to university courses and to a good future. How galling it is for the sons and daughters of working people to know that their government allows people who have money in their pockets, or whose parents are wealthy, to jump the merit queue and buy a university degree ahead of them. I am not surprised-some might be surprised-that the Treasurer, in the budget he has just brought down, favours the rich above lowand middle-income earners with his tax cuts. Some would say, ‘That is just the Treasurer trying to buy his way into the Liberal leadership and the prime ministership of this nation.’ It ought not be a surprise to anybody, because the philosophical underpinnings of the Treasurer’s tax cuts in the budget are the same as the philosophical underpinnings of the minister for education’s policy that more ought to go to those who already have enough, and that the squeeze ought to go on those who are struggling to create better opportunities for themselves and their families in the future. In education funding Labor believes in the fundamental principle that access to university should be based on your achievements and your ability, not on your ability to pay-not on the size of your bank balance or whether your parents are wealthy enough to buy you a degree. Out there in the general Australian community there is consensus about giving people a fair go. There is consensus on the need for equity in this sort of opportunity creation through the higher education system. But that fundamental principle is not adhered to by this government. The Treasurer, in his budget, has given massive tax cuts to the big end of town, to the highincome earners, and so it is with the minister for education in his portfolio. He favours those who have the money to buy their way into a course ahead of those who can, and should, get there on merit. At a time when Australia is suffering a skills crisis in areas like engineering and science, the Howard government needs to fund our universities properly and create more HECS places for Australian students. It is an absolute obscenity that some 20,000 qualified applicants miss out on university places each year because this government cannot find the public funds necessary to give them a shot at the title. This government can spend $1.2 billion on a war in Iraq, it can spend $100 million on useless advertising to get itself re-elected, but it cannot find the dollars in an $8.9 billion surplus to give the sons and daughters of working people the opportunity to access a university education-unless, of course, they have a high bank balance so that they can jump the merit queue. That is the philosophical basis on which this government operates, from its budget for this nation right through to portfolio areas like education. MAIN COMMITTEE I want to comment on the budget’s lack of expenditure on higher education. The government has a $9 billion surplus, yet it only found in this budget an extra $31.9 million for extra higher education funding. Big deal! Does any member opposite believe that the Treasurer, who has created a surplus of $9 billion by putting his hand in the pockets of working families over an 11-year period, should get away with spending a mere $31.9 million extra on higher education funding? It is instructive to look at where that money has gone. I do not begrudge the University of Western Sydney its $8 million, or James Cook University, in North Queensland, the $1.9 million it is going to receive to create extra places. Those universities are entitled to that money, but it is interesting to note that they are in marginal seats which the coalition either had to hold or intended to win. Once again, the precious dollars generated by working people in this country are being squandered by this government in pursuits like the $100 million spent on useless advertising. Yet the minister for education, who has just entered the chamber, can only find a measly, miserly $31.9 million in extra university funding. Our great public universities, the universities that positioned Australia at the front of the pack in economic performance in previous decades, are now basically private universities. We pay lip-service to the notion of public university education in this country, as these universities now largely depend on private income to sustain them. Some people might say that is not a bad thing. Obviously, that is part of the reforms Labor introduced when we were in government. However, we were prepared to fund public places at these universities. If the government had not cut $5 billion from tertiary education budgets, the 20,000 students each year who now miss out might have got a shot at the title. According to the Australian ViceChancellors Committee, if the task of properly and adequately funding public universities is not addressed, the universities in this country will be $586 million behind per year. That is based on matters relating to the indexation of the funding grants. I also want to make some observations about the fact that this budget provides no extra funding for research. As I understand it, a new research framework is under discussion and negotiation as we speak. However, with no new money for research, the problems with the existing system are unlikely to be meaningfully addressed. I want to refer to the way in which the shortfalls in funding impact on the university which services the sons and daughters of working people, working families, in my electorate of Corio and in the Geelong region. Deakin University is one of Australia’s pre-eminent innovative universities. It is an integral part of the economic, social and cultural fabric of the Geelong regional community. It is a university which accommodates some 32,000 students, with campuses in Melbourne, Geelong and Warrnambool. It accommodates students both on and off campus. It is a very innovative university. It won the University of the Year award in 1995 and 1996 and it won more national awards in 2000. This university has done, in the research area, what the government asked it to do. The government asked universities to go outside the square and seek funding for research from private sources. Deakin University has grown its research income from external sources to about $20 million today. However, under the current funding arrangements, Deakin University is penalised for carrying out what the government intended or asked it to do. What an extraordinary policy position it is when the government of the day puts a floor under poor performing universities and puts on caps that basically penalise universities like Deakin University which go out and do the government’s bidding in getting private dollars for research. MAIN COMMITTEE I want to mention some of Deakin’s University’s research programs because they are innovative and they very much attempt to tap into private sources of funding and to integrate with what is going on in our community. As I said, external research income generated by the university is now greater than $20 million. Deakin University is heavily involved in biotechnology. The Victorian government has also funded some quite critical research projects in the areas of advanced materials manufacture, sustainable aquaculture systems and the design of energy efficient buildings. We have very strong linkages in Geelong to the wool industry, with the CSIRO Division of Wool Technology located in the electorate of Corangamite but still in Geelong, on the other side of the Barwon River. Deakin University itself has structured some interesting linkages with Australian Wool Innovation in the research field. The university is also heavily involved in research into obesity prevention and the creation of healthy lifestyles in Australia, and it has projects under way in the areas of the environment and water as well-all areas that are quite critical, not only to the region but to the nation. And, for Deakin University’s efforts in securing funding from private sources, the government penalises it. The Minister for Education, Science and Training is with us in the chamber today, and he may well have heard this argument before from Deakin University. I would like this matter attended to, because it is an extraordinary situation. A university pursues a path of innovation, does what the government wants it to do in the area of securing private research funding for very critical research projects that I have just outlined, in key areas of research and economic activity, and is penalised for it. That does not make sense. This matter has to be addressed, because the university has already lost some millions of dollars in recent years. In conclusion, with the minister in the room, I think we ought to end where we started. Minister, how does it feel-as the old Bob Dylan classic, the old sixties classic, asked-to have presided over budget cuts of $5 billion in this area? How does it feel to preside over a fee structure in this country that is burdening students and families? How does it feel to preside over a system that allows people to buy their way into courses ahead of people who have good marks and scores and who deserve the place on merit? And how does it feel to preside over a budget and to be part of a government that can spend over $1 billion on war and $100 million on useless advertising and yet deny 20,000 young Australians each year the opportunity to participate in a tertiary education and create an opportunity for themselves in the future? There is one salient fact that ought not to be forgotten as the Treasurer spreads the tax cuts around like confetti. And by the way, Minister, those tax cuts will not even buy a meat pie and a bottle of Coke at the McG on a Friday night for the working families in my electorate. Yet this Treasurer has had his hand in the pocket of working families for well nigh a decade. He creates a surplus of $8.9 billion and is only able to put additional funding of $31.9 million back into the tertiary education sector. Minister, how does it feel? Dr NELSON (Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (11.49 am)-in reply-I thank all of the members who spoke on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2005 Measures No. 2) Bill 2005 for their interest in the issues. Of course, quite a bit of what was said, particularly by the last speaker, is quite incorrect, and clearly I do not agree with it. There are a few important points in the bill that need to be restated. The bill amends three acts: the Higher Education Support Act 2003, the Higher Education Support (TransiMAIN COMMITTEE tional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 2003 and the Taxation Administration Act 1953. The Australian government is taking the opportunity to refine and enhance the effective implementation of the Higher Education Support Act 2003 through a number of technical amendments. In particular, the amendments enable higher education providers to respond to changes in student demand in a more flexible way. The amendments also ensure that students are properly informed about and protected from decisions which affect them made by higher education providers. The amendments to the Higher Education Support Act include: clarifying the indexation formulae in the act so it can apply to amounts specified in the Commonwealth Grants Scheme guidelines; clarifying provisions in relation to cancellation of enrolments of people without tax file numbers; ensuring that a student is only taken to have met the tax file number requirements for a given course of study when the student has provided the tax file number in relation to that particular course of study; extending the scope of reviewable decisions to include those made in respect of students undertaking work experience in industry; clarifying provisions in relation to working out an accumulated HELP debt; allowing the publication of more than one schedule of student contribution amounts and tuition fees per year; allowing for more than one date to be specified for the publishing of the census date in equivalent full time student load values; extending the OS-HELP-overseas HELP-eligibility to students who have at least half an EFTSL left to complete in their course of study; and ensuring that certain measures dealing with recrediting a person’s student learning entitlement and those dealing with work experience in industry are mutually exclusive. The bill also provides that guidelines issued by the Commissioner of Taxation under subsection 187-1(4) are legislative instruments for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. These amendments and others will build on the implementation of new arrangements under the Our Universities: Backing Australia’s Future package of reforms. One of the issues raised during the debate, which was done through either complete ignorance of how higher education funding works or, indeed, an act of intellectual dishonesty, was that put by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. She claimed that there is some sort of blowout, purported by the opposition to be $1.3 billion, in the estimated cost of FEE-HELP. FEEHELP, a new loan described as a soft loan, is available to Australian students who choose to take up a fee-paying place in a public university. They may have missed the HECS cut-off, which is a product of supply and demand. There are many academically eligible students who may not get into the course of their choice. For example, to do an arts-law course at the University of New South Wales you require a tertiary entrance score of 99.4. I would argue that any student with a UAI perhaps in the high 80s or above is academically capable of doing that course. The question is: why should those students be forced to take up a HECS place in a course they do not want to be in or at a university they do not want to be at, when they see international students coming in and paying full fees? This government takes the view that, whilst it is putting into the higher education sector 39,000 additional HECS places-that is, government funded places-it is only fair that an Australian student, if they are academically eligible, has no lesser right to access their own universities than students from Beijing, Jakarta or Bangkok. To assist with this, the government introduced FEE-HELP, which is a loan whereby students can borrow up to $50,000 to MAIN COMMITTEE get into an eligible private higher education provider institution or, indeed, a public university as fee-paying students. For postgraduate students, there is no charge associated with the loan; for undergraduate students, there is a 20 per cent administration charge attached to the loan. If, for example, a student borrows $20,000, they will only ever repay $24,000, which is the value of the loan indexed with inflation, as occurs with a HECS loan. If the government were cutting HECS places and replacing them with full fee paying places, I would be outraged; in fact, I would be leading the demonstrations against it myselfif you could imagine such a thing-because it would be unconscionable. Instead, at the moment, 40,000 Australian students are studying in private higher education institutions: Melbourne College of Divinity, University of Notre Dame, Christian Heritage College, Tabor College in South Australia and the Australian Institute of Music. Some of those opposite who have argued so stridently against these loans and against this access need to spend a bit of time listening to the families who have struggled to get their kids into these places. The director of the Australian Institute of Music told me two years ago when I went there when I was formulating policy to bring to the parliament, ‘We have students who come from working class families who come here and successfully enrol.’ The young woman who won the Australian Idol competition, Casey Donovan, was a student at that institution. To her great credit, she won the competition. He said to me, ‘The students enrol, they are accepted and they disappear for two years. Then they come back and they say, “I’ve saved $30,000. It’s taken me two years and three jobs.”’ This bill will open the system up. It means that a student from a low-income family can go to an institution like this, if they choose to, and they will not have to pay up front. Basically, they will have an income-contingent loan against their future earnings. The Labor Party is opposed to the loan scheme. Those who are trawling through the ashes of the election loss of the Australian Labor Party last year need to ask themselves whether they should cling to a policy of wanting to abandon this loan; nonetheless that is their prerogative. But to actually misrepresent the loan is really, I think, intellectually dishonest and does a great disservice to these young people and their families. Labor claims that the loan scheme has blown out by $1.3 billion. In fact what has happened is that the Labor Party has taken the table which was published in the 2003 budget documents under Backing Australia’s Future, which is the $11 billion reform program for Australian higher education, and looked at the projected or forecast costs for FEE-HELP for these loans. Then the Labor Party has taken from Senate estimates a more recent table which looks at the value of the FEE-HELP loans and, quite outrageously, suggested that there has been some sort of blow-out. Under the new arrangements FEE-HELP includes not only the new loans available for the undergraduate students to whom I just referred-those who are taking up opportunities in public and private universities-but also the loans which existed before: for example, the bridging loans for overseas trained professionals, the Open Learning Deferred Payment Scheme and the Postgraduate Education Loan Scheme. So the total dollar value of FEE-HELP includes those pre-existing loans. This calendar year we expect that there will be about $100 million of loans provided to students who take up these opportunities in public and private universities-in other words, a small fraction of the cost of the total FEE-HELP scheme, which includes the existing loans as I said. The other thing that needs to be understood is that the more money that is lent to students, the more students take up opportunities. If a student MAIN COMMITTEE has a very high score but misses the cut-off, they are not jumping in front of anybody else if they take a FEE-HELP place. These are students who missed out on a HECS cut-off although they are academically eligible to do the course. We learned many years ago in medicine that you did not need to be in the top half of one per cent to be a good doctor; you could be in the top 10 per cent and possess all of the other qualities that are required in medicine. So we now have people who have much lower entry scores who get into medical decrees, and quite rightly, because we are not just focusing on the top half of one per cent. Similarly, if a student misses out on combined law at the University of Sydney, which has a cut-off I think of 99.7, if they have a score of 98 they are then accepted as a fee-payer at Sydney university. They are academically able to do the course. That student, in taking up that place at Sydney university, with a score of 98, has actually declined a HECS place at ANU, which has a cut-off of 95. Students are making choices. What this means is that, if you do come from Mr Latham’s Green Valley world-basically from everyday Australia-then, with FEE-HELP, if you want to, you actually have a choice that you can make. You have an opportunity; you are not forced to go and take up a HECS place at Macquarie or US and at the same time see a foreign student come in-and we welcome themand take up a fee-paying place at Sydney university. SoI commend these amendments to the House. It is fair enough to debate policy and arguments from a philosophical perspective, but putting statements of intellectual dishonesty into the public arena is something on which I think, certainly in the long term, Australians make a judgment. It is really quite moving to see the correspondence and to hear from the families about the opportunities that are being provided by these loans. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. Second Reading Debate resumed from 16 March, on motion by Mr Truss: That this bill be now read a second time. 2005. At the outset Labor offer our support to the changes brought about by this legislation. We offer our support because Labor know that Australia’s aviation safety record is the envy of the world, that our aviation industry is a world leader, and that standards should not be compromised, certainly not for political or any other reasons. Labor have always taken a positive and proactive approach to aviation policy and we will continue to work with the industry to help it grow and further increase aviation safety in Australia. Since Labor are supportive of the measures being proposed in this bill, it will not be necessary to provide any great analysis of the bill itself, and the bill itself is quite straightforward. However, I do want to make a few comments in relation to the amendments and provisions being put forward by the Howard government. The purpose of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2005 is to amend the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to do a number of things, in particular to MAIN COMMITTEE",190,Higher Education Legislation Amendment 2005 Measures No 2
222,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (12.00 Pm),"I rise to speak on the Civil Aviation Amendment Billmake regulations that may be inconsistent with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 and to ratify the validity of existing regulations and past actions. Also it is to bring into the act the requirement that air operators certificate holders continue to satisfy the Civil Aviation Safety Authority that they meet the conditions of issue of an AOC. The bill will also standardise references in the act to aircraft which are registered in countries other than Australia-in particular, in reference to foreign aircraft being properly defined as foreign registered aircraft. These changes are being made in the interests of aviation safety to safeguard the public, and if we look at the most recent air disaster in North Queensland with 15 people dead, I do not think that we can ever be too careful or take too many precautions and measures to ensure the safety of the Australian flying public. Making amendments and changes to regulations that enhance that safety is something that should be supported. While Labor is supportive of the government’s measures on this bill, now is also a good opportunity for me to bring to the attention of members of the House and the public some aspects of the Howard government’s record in relation to aviation policy. It is not a good one. It is a record that smacks of ignorance of certain issues and, certainly, it is a government out of touch with the broader aviation industry. Under the Howard-Anderson government Australia’s aviation safety has been under threat. The coalition has buckled under pressure from certain industry players pushing for changes to suit their own personal agendas. The government has pandered to the interests of a few, ignoring the advice often of very experienced professionals in the industry. Those who have spoken out in the past have been threatened, bullied or harassed, or they have just been ignored by the government. In short, the government’s management of the aviation industry in recent years has been nothing short of appalling and, in some cases, even reckless. The Deputy Prime Minister, as the nation’s Minister for Transport and Regional Services, will be remembered, certainly in terms of aviation, I believe, as one of the nation’s worse transport ministers. Under John Anderson’s six-year ministerial reign the management and regulation of Australia’s civil aviation sector has become a public policy and public administration shambles. It has reeled from crisis to crisis. There has been no strategic or coordinated focus on civil aviation safety improvement, only those improvements that have been forced onto it by the industry, by specific individuals or by events that took place after September 11. I will give you some examples; I am not just talking about this without providing some substance of what it is about. The Howard government mismanaged the design and impleson arrogantly launched the National Airspace System stage 2b airspace changes despite the aviation industry expressing grave doubts about the safety of this new system. In February 2004 the Senate heard evidence from Airservices Australia, the government’s own airspace controller, that NAS 2b was not adequate. Airservices Australia further admitted in February 2004 that, in originally approving the NAS 2b changes, it took advice from both CASA and Mr Anderson’s special advisory group, which once included Dick Smith. Pressure from Labor forced the government to revisit the airspace changes to improve them. On 25 November 2004, Minister Anderson was forced to recant his personal project. Until then, he was apparently completely oblivious to his mismanagement of the new NAS 2b. The November 2004 reversal was required to return Australia’s airspace to a safer, more MAIN COMMITTEE",196,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2005
223,"Mentation Of The New National Airspace System, The Nas. On 27 November 2003, Mr Ander","robust system. I think that alone smacks of a minister and a government more intent on delivering their own agenda than an agenda for aviation safety. It does not stop with safety; it also involves aviation security. In this case, the government has done very little to cover itself in glory and I think it has a shameful record. The Howard government’s record in addressing aviation security is poor, to say the least, particularly as this country has such a decentralised system of airports, with something like 126 regional airports. Very little has been done, in terms of practical measures, to make sweeping changes. It took the Howard government an unbelievable 2½ years after September 11 to fix our air security legislation-and this is just legislation, rather than looking at the physical, practical things that could have taken place. I recall the fervent fury from this government at the time about the need to increase security, safety and all these things. How can a government possibly justify it being 2½ years after September 11 before legislation is passed in this House? It was certainly not because there was a lack of support from the opposition. It was not until almost 30 months after those terrible events on September 11 that aviation security legislation was finally passed. IfI recall, towards the end the government was hurriedly trying to get that legislation through. The government floundered for an unacceptable period while it sought to come to grips with and understand the demands of modernising the country’s aviation security policy framework. Despite this long delay, the Howard government still did not get it completely right. It was not until earlier in the life of this parliament that the government managed to get the legislative framework in place to allow the development of regulations for aviation security, and these have only recently come into effect. So, looking at the time difference between identifying a need and actually bringing into effect the necessary changes, it is an incredibly inefficient government that takes so many years to make these things happen. Even more frightening is the fact that, while this is very necessary, the actual efficacy of these measures is yet to be determined. Labor believes that the government’s policy in relation to regional airports is inadequate and deficiencies exist, particularly with respect to the screening of passengers and baggage at some regional airports. I would be interested to hear comments from government members on how they would defend this or somehow say this is not the case, when anybody who travels through a regional airport will tell you something quite different. Labor is also mindful of the need for more work from the government to ensure security measures are being modernised in other transport industries to match those being taken in the aviation industry. The previous Labor government began the process of separating safety regulatory functions and service provision functions. Labor continues to support this approach and is critical of the Howard government for the mismanagement of that process. Labor continues to support the establishment of the airspace and environment regulatory unit, but this should not undermine Airservices Australia’s safety management responsibility. It is May 2005 and still Airservices Australia and the Australian public are waiting for the regulatory functions of airspace management to be removed from Airservices so they can get on with the job of delivering worldclass aviation services. Safety and regulatory functions and service delivery functions must be clearly separated. At present they are not. When the government does get around to finally addressing this anomaly of aviation public policy, the Deputy Prime Minister will make air space management a funcMAIN COMMITTEE tion of the transport department and not part of CASA, as it should be. By not putting this function in the hands of CASA, the Howard government is continuing its mismanagement of air space reform in Australia. More mismanagement and headaches for the aviation industry are being created by the government and by the Deputy Prime Minister. CASA has the responsibility of all regulatory and safety aspects of aviation in the country except air space management itself. My understanding is that the aviation industry wants this to occur and that CASA believes it should have the responsibility of all regulatory and safety functions of aviation in Australia. In addition, Labor, unlike the government, has ruled out the privatisation of Airservices Australia. The structure of this function is important and should remain in its current form. Again, in proposing to review the status of Airservices Australia, the Howard government is clearly seeking revenge following the organisation’s questioning of changes to air safety regulations-a bit of payback for roll-back perhaps? There are a number of other areas to address, and I will continue with those. The fact that John Anderson and the Howard government are out of touch with modern demands of the aviation industry is highlighted when you consider their approach to something as simple as radar. This government’s pre-election plan to install radar at 10 regional airports has been exposed as an empty promise designed to allay safety fears rather than actually deal with them, particularly at regional airports. This was discussed just long enough for the government to get over that really important hurdle it had on its agenda, which is called re-election. Airservices Australia told a Senate estimates committee earlier this year that the installation of these radar systems would cost somewhere between $100 million and $140 million. The committee also heard that Mr Anderson made the decision to spend this money without seeking expert advice from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority or Airservices Australia. Airservices Australia also told the committee that an almost identical level of safety could be achieved using different technology for about one-twentieth of the cost. Labor is opposed to the government’s plan because of the needless cost of these radar systems that would be passed on to regional travellers in the form of higher airfares. Putting in place these more expensive systems would not actually deliver a better outcome. This plan really smacked of how out of touch this government is with providing air services. Tellingly though, Airservices Australia was unable to tell the committee how the proposed radar systems would be funded. During the election, Mr Anderson stated that Labor’s plan not to proceed with installing these further systems: … would reduce aviation safety at ten major regional airportsthis was the accusation he made against uscompared to the level of safety under a re-elected Coalition Government. That was the minister’s media statement on 5 October 2004. Despite this dire warning of the sky falling in, it appears likely that Mr Anderson will belatedly listen to the experts. He will actually implement Labor’s policy in this area; he will can his expensive radar plan and pursue automatic dependent surveillance broadcast-the ADSB-technology, which is not only more effective but cheaper. It is actually a better system. Do you want 1920s technology or do you want 2005 technology? It is incredible how the government could have pursued old technology, which it is now going to have to recant on regardless. MAIN COMMITTEE In contrast, the aviation policy that Labor took to the last election is a clear demonstration of our commitment to a growing industry without compromising safety or security. For instance, Labor understands the need to maintain the viability and livelihood of regional airports and training airports. We understand the importance of these airports to regional and rural communities. Again, in relation to the implementation of an air space management system, Labor has taken the approach that this must be designed and implemented by industry professionals in consultation with all sectors of the industry. On the point about consultation, it does not matter which sector or which minister you look at, all of these ministers have the same approach: they do not seek independent, expert advice. They believe that their own agenda is the right agenda, and they are often found wanting in terms of their own desired outcomes compared to the outcomes needed by industry. I have got many examples of that in other sectors, and certainly in my electorate, where the government just simply gets it wrong. CASA should be adequately resourced, and safety should be its priority. The review of regulations and internal CASA reforms designed to streamline and simplify rules and procedures should continue. Labor has welcomed the recent moves by CASA to restructure its organisation and to continue the rewriting of regulations. Labor believes that, as a safety regulator, CASA should fully consult the aviation industry while remaining an independent authority. It must not be managed or dictated to by industry or, for that matter, by government. Labor, unlike the coalition, has ruled out the privatisation of Airservices Australia. In proposing to review the status of Airservices Australia, the Howard government is clearly seeking revenge for some of the activities that were taken on board by this organisation. I will make a number of comments in wrapping up. The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2005 is necessary. Labor support it because we support safety and security in the aviation industry. We do not want to play with the Australian flying public’s safety. We think that these measures are much more important than government agendas and much more important than politics. We are supportive of these changes, as we always are in this area. We are proactive in this area and we do the right thing not only by Australians in the community who fly but also by the industry. We look forward to the continuing reform and restructure that need to take place in CASA and in other areas of the civil aviation industry. However, I want to put on record my condemnation of the government for being too slow, for not taking this issue seriously enough and for running a personal agenda in a whole range of air safety and air security issues rather than looking at what is best for the Australian public and for the industry itself. point out to the member for Oxley that he regularly referred to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services as Mr Anderson. While that may in fact be accurate, it is not in accordance with the standing orders and in future I will have to interrupt him if he does it. I ask him to desist from that practice. Bill 2005. The main purpose of this bill is to allow the making of regulations under the Civil Aviation Act 1988 that are inconsistent with the Commonwealth antidiscrimination laws where the inconsistency is necessary for the safety of air navigation and, for related purposes, to retrospectively validate existing regulations that may be inconsistent with the CommonMAIN COMMITTEE",197,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2005

226,Mr Fawcett (Wakefield) (12.17 Pm),"I rise to support the Civil Aviation Amendmentwealth antidiscrimination laws where the inconsistency is necessary for the safety of air navigation. In November 2002 the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission granted a five year exemption in respect of the Disability Discrimination Act and the Sex Discrimination Act to persons acting pursuant to the civil aviation regulations regarding medical fitness or pursuant to currently proposed amendments to those regulations. This allowed operations to continue under the existing regulations while CASA amended its legislation to enable regulations to be made, despite possible inconsistencies with the discrimination acts in areas that affected aviation safety. Why are these amendments needed? It is because the definition of what constitutes aviation safety has been challenged in the courts in the past and this provides a large degree of uncertainty to operators in what is a very competitive industry. In November 1994 an Australian airline was taken to court by an employee who was dismissed upon reaching the age of 60 on the grounds of safety and compliance with international regulations. He brought proceedings to the Industrial Relations Court of Australia, asserting that his termination was in breach of the federal termination protection laws which prohibited terminations on the grounds of age. Although his claim did not succeed at first, a majority of the full appeal bench, with two judges dissenting, upheld his claim and held that the termination was contrary to law. In this industry sector, the results of failure, error, distraction and incapacitation are tragic in terms of death and injury, as we have so recently witnessed with the loss of 15 lives in the crash of the Fairchild Metroliner, Aero-Tropics flight 675, near Lockhart River. Operators therefore require clarity and certainty as to their obligations and options in terms of who they are able to or are required to employ to maintain and crew these aircraft. The current HREOC exemption does not cover all aspects of aviation safety legislation that appear to be discriminatory. Some regulations, for example, affect safety but go beyond employees. For example, the requirements which result in non-ambulatory or mentally incapacitated passengers to be precluded from sitting in the seats adjacent to emergency exists do not come within the scope of the current exemption. But in the event of an emergency these are measures that are necessary to ensure that all passengers on board have every opportunity to conduct an emergency egress from the aircraft. The operator’s duty of care to ensure the safety of all passengers and crew must override other considerations. For the operator, aviation safety is a process of risk management. Most aviation operators use what is called the REASON model, which has multiple layers of risk mitigation covering technical and operational airworthiness, training, operational procedures, the qualifications, currency and capacity of crew to operate under both normal and abnormal circumstances. The issues surrounding this bill relate primarily to the capacity of the crew to operate under both normal and abnormal circumstances. Many of the arguments that are put as to the inequity of some of the existing or proposed aviation safety requirements draw upon scenarios that encapsulate normal operations and are often based on an out-of-date assumption about the nature of cockpit displays and warning design requirements. The first concern is to look at the capability of the crews in terms of safety requirements for the aircraft, the passengers and the crew. In aircraft, whilst we all hope that most operations will be normal, it is a fact, as we saw only recently, that degraded modes often do occur. Degraded modes make changes to both the workload and the environment that MAIN COMMITTEE the passengers and the crew operate under. For example, hydraulic degraded modes in aircraft like helicopters result in very large physical forces. In some cases in the past this has led to bent inceptors as the crew have bent the control columns in order to achieve the outcomes they need. Degraded modes lead to increased stress levels, particularly under instrument meteorological conditions or by night. They can also lead to extremes of control displacement. During certification of an aircraft’s cockpit environment, both normal and abnormal emergency ingress and egress are considered against the proposed anthropometric range of operating crews. So operators have a duty of care to ensure that the crews operating their aircraft are able to fulfil all the required functions of normal and emergency procedures and use these emergency exits, particularly in the case of smaller RPT or charter operations, where they also need to assist passengers to use them in the event of an emergency. The training and capacity to handle potential failure modes is a duty of care both to the passengers and to the crew themselves. It should be pointed out that capacity is the key word here. I had the pleasure whilst on exchange in the United Kingdom as a pilot with the Defence Force to work with a veteran of the Falklands war who had lost a leg in an aircraft accident there. He was then successfully flying both the Gazelle helicopter and the Chinook helicopter. I have also had the pleasure of working with an officer of the Australian Army who lost both legs in an aircraft accident and worked with the aviation medical professionals here to demonstrate that he had the capacity to control aircraft under abnormal and normal circumstances, which resulted in him regaining both his civil licence and his military ability to fly. So the aviation community is by no means discriminating against people just because they have a disability but they are looking to see that the person, regardless of disability, has the capacity to fly. These two examples demonstrate that that is the objective of the safety requirements in aviation. There have also been some comments about the requirement for colour vision. Colour hierarchies are an important element in cockpit display and warning design. Much research over many years has been conducted to ensure that operating crews are provided with all relevant information in an unambiguous manner which will allow them to respond in a timely and appropriate way to operational requirements and emergencies. The advent of LED displays and multifunction flat panel displays, sometimes known as a glass cockpit, has increased the importance and use of colour discrimination. Even in cockpits modified for use with image intensifying night vision devices, the chromaticity of warnings and displays is carefully matched to ensure both compatibility with the imaging devices and effective discrimination by the human eye. The second concern in aviation safety is also related to the duty of care to the individual concerned. There have been some questions, particularly in relation to pregnancy. In this regard, the recent case in New South Wales, which again raised the issue of the criminal nature of harming an unborn baby as well as the mother carrying it, combined with some state law seeking to make employers criminally liable for the death or injury of people in their employ, highlights the need for certainty for employers and staff in the aviation environment. With an increasing number of women operating effectively in the aviation environment, aviation medicine experts have now started to consider, and in some cases study, the effects on women’s bodies of exposure to the harsher aspects of the aviation environment-for example, vibrations in helicopters, G forces in aerobatic aircraft, the effects of extreme acceleraMAIN COMMITTEE tion such as ejection seats and even the effect on night visual acuity caused by oxygen deprivation during menstrual cycles or pregnancy. Where there is evidence to support an elevated risk of incapacity due to medical, physical, genetic or gender based reasons, operators need certainty in legislation to underpin their decisions as to who to employ and during which periods. These regulations relating to civil aviation have been made under section 98 of the Civil Aviation Act in relation to the safety of air navigation for the purpose of carrying out and giving effect to the provisions of the Chicago convention relating to safety. So we have two issues here: firstly, the discrimination acts and, secondly, our obligations to comply with international law. Without certainty in this area-and this is the case where these regulations are seen to be contestable in court-a high degree of uncertainty will exist for operators seeking to stay viable and employ Australians in what is an extremely demanding and competitive industry. A number of regulations have been made under the CAA which may be invalid for this reasonthere are regulations which impose requirements on the basis of pregnancy, for example. These regulations may be invalid even if it can be established that they are necessary for safety-for example, in the case of air traffic controllers. There is no exemption in the SDA permitting discrimination based on the inherent requirements of a job. On the other issue of international requirements, Australia is a contracted state to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, generally referred to in the industry as the Chicago convention. Part 67 of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations, which deals with medical requirements, is based on international standards and recommended practices as described in chapter 6 of annex 1 to the Chicago convention. Conformity with international standards and practices prescribed under the convention is necessary; otherwise Australia’s regulatory regimes for aviation safety and practices will be put at risk of not being accepted by the International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, which is the body administering the convention. This became a central point in the court case I referred to previously between the pilot and the airline. If the airline had chosen to continue to employ the elder pilot as an aircraft captain, the aircraft would not be allowed under international law to fly into hub airports such as Singapore. Clearly the definition of job requirement must be taken into account in the context of the international regulatory environment as well as domestic circumstances. This bill also moves to amend some terminology within the act by replacing the phrase ‘foreign aircraft’ with ‘foreign registered aircraft’. It also seeks to amend an anomaly which has existed whereby CASA requires operators to have an air operators certificate issued to them and to be able to demonstrate that they can, on an ongoing basis, meet the requirements of that issue. That is now brought into the act as opposed to just the orders. In conclusion, the bill will allow regulations to be made which permit conduct which would otherwise constitute a breach of the Disability Discrimination Act or the Sex Discrimination Act. The bill validates existing regulations in relation to both the past operation and the future operation of such regulations. The bill will also allow Australia to meet its obligation to comply with international standards set out in the standards and recommended practices established by ICAO. As a member state, Australia is obliged to implement these standards in its domestic aviation legislation. The legislation does not aim to discriminate; it aims to maintain Australia’s high aviation safety record. The regulations effected by this amendment will MAIN COMMITTEE not be unnecessarily restrictive or discriminatory but will ensure the protection of fare-paying passengers and the safety of flight crew, other people and aircraft. I am therefore happy to support the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2005. of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2005 in terms of its relationship with the antidiscrimination legislation, because it is obviously purely related to trying to improve aviation safety in Australia. In doing so I can indicate that the main purpose of the bill is to amend the Civil Aviation Act 1988 to empower the making of regulations which may be inconsistent with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The bill also places conditions pertaining to the ongoing retention of an air operator’s certificate, currently in the civil aviation order, into section 28 of the Civil Aviation Act. Appropriately, the bill also corrects errors and standardises references in the act to aircraft which are registered in countries other than Australia. I also intend raising a number of outstanding aviation issues in this debate which I think need consideration by the government. The importance of this bill speaks for itself, because it will also validate existing regulations and past actions based on these regulations. The power to make these regulations is very important to the aviation industry and to the travelling public because it is about safety in the air. In particular these regulations are seen to critically affect the safety of the travelling public. For example, regulations that restrict female flight attendants and pilots during the later stages of pregnancy have been developed to address genuine safety concerns. It is for that reason that we are debating this bill today. These amendments to the Civil Aviation Act affect very important and experienced industry professionals. Having said that, I stress the importance of government, and in particular minister’s offices, starting to take seriously the requirement to consult on a regular basis with the professionals that make the industry the safe industry we have been so proud of for so long. These industry professionals are well organised and always available for consultation about developments in their industry. These industry professionals represent the many thousands of people working in the industry, from pilots and engineers to flight attendants and air traffic controllers. Therefore, one could reasonably expect that a bill as significant as this, a bill which affects so many people integral to the operation of the aviation industry in Australia, would have led the government to undertake proper consultation prior to the original introduction of the bill in the last parliament. You would think that the government would have seriously consulted with the owners and operators of commercial airlines significantly affected by these amendments, in the same way that they should have consulted with workers in the industry. In speaking to this bill today, I note that there are serious concerns in the industry about the failure of the government to properly consult in the original development of the bill. It reminds me of the failure of the government to also consult prior to the introduction of its flawed national airspace system. In that instance, as is the case with the original development of this bill, the government chose not to consult the industry professionals, even though they were out there willing and able to provide sound professional input. Alternatively, the government chose to rely on the advice of enthusiastic amateurs. I simply raise these issues because I think that it is about time, if we are to get our legislative framework right in Australia-and it is of paramount importance that we do with regard to aviation-that we go out of our way to seriously consult people who can assist in the deMAIN COMMITTEE",200,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2005
227,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (12.29 Pm),"I rise to speak in support of the intentvelopment of legislation. For that reason, I condemn the government today not only for their lack of consultation with regard to the development of the national airspace system but also for their lack of consultation with experienced industry professionals in formulating this bill. It is exceptionally important. What we are talking about is not only the safety of people working in the industry but also the safety of the aviation industry and the travelling public generally. I think that it is fair to say that we as an island nation are heavily dependent on having a safe and efficient aviation industry. For that reason the bill was referred to a hearing of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Committee. As a result of those proceedings, submissions were received and a public hearing held. A number of those submissions indicated that the introduction of the legislation may affect legal proceedings already under way. I therefore call on the government, in its response to issues raised today, to clarify this legal position. The Senate committee also considered a range of other matters raised during the inquiry, and I look forward to hearing, in the minister’s response to the speeches today, the government’s response to those issues. Having said that, can I also say that unfortunately this is not the first time the government has ignored aviation industry professionals, as I have said. In the last 18 to 24 months, we have unfortunately seen the results of the government’s complete disregard for consultation with industry professionals, with its inappropriate introduction of the flawed national airspace system. I can only hope that, unlike the difficulties we experienced with the flawed national airspace system, in the development of this legislation we have finally got the legislative framework right. With regard to the airspace system, I want to remind the House today that there is a lesson to be learned. In the development of the airspace system, industry professionals called time and time again on the government to properly consult about the implementation of the system. As the relevant shadow minister at the time, I continuously requested-and, indeed, pleaded with-the minister to consult with industry professionals, rather than rely on the advice of enthusiastic amateurs for too long a period. The record will show that for too long the minister not only ignored my requests but also ignored the requests of the major airlines, the professional organisations and many in the public at large. It was this flagrant and arrogant disregard of the need to consult that placed the travelling public in Australia at risk during the development and implementation of the national airspace system. I cannot understand why the minister chose to ignore all those professionals, including the major airlines, while bending over backwards to rely on the advice of the ‘special little mate’, a fellow by the name of Dick Smith. I wonder whether or not this was part of arrangements entered into with regard to the potential contest in the seat of Gwydir in the 2001 election. Alternatively, was it related to political donations received at the time of that 2001 election? sent time has anything to do with the bill.

The minister must explain why Mr Dick Smith, an enthusiastic amateur, was allowed to pursue a US airspace model that led to a major change in the design of Australia’s airspace system. He must also explain the exact role of the airspace reform group. He must also explain why enthusiastic amateurs were allowed to go their own way without proper consultation with the industry, the experts and the professionals who are so intimately involved in maintaining aviation safety in Australia. I raise these issues because there is a lesson here. It is about trying to ensure that we take proper advice with regard to the development of aviation legislation in Australia. The importance of this goes to our duty of care, and the duty of care of the relevant minister of the Crown, to protect the travelling public. In that context, I also refer the House-because it goes to the responsibilities of the minister in terms of his duty of care and the development of aviation reform in Australia-to an answer he gave to my question No. 422, a question on notice. The answer, with regard to the air services system in Australia and the development of the national airspace system, notes that there were legal proceedings in the Federal Court in November last year involving Mr Dick Smith. The answer indicates that in connection with those proceedings Airservices Australia incurred costs of $474,399. The answer at point 3 states that the Federal Court has yet to determine the issue of costs in relation to legal action taken by Mr Dick Smith against Airservices Australia. I am anxious to discover what action is being taken by Airservices Australia, in concert with the Australian government, to ensure that as much of those costs of $474,399 are recovered from the action taken by Mr Dick Smith. This goes to accountability. 76 requires that with a simple bill such as this the member must speak to the bill. There are other forms of the House that can be used to air the grievances he has at the present time. I ask the member for Batman to come back to addressing the bill, or I will sit him down. tralia, and the intent of this bill is to make sure we get the safety regime into a proper form so as to guarantee the safety of the travelling public. The bill is a very simple bill which talks about the regulations for sex discrimination, disability discrimination, human rights and equal opportunity. The member for Batman will come back to the bill. is about validating regulations of past actions to guarantee that we remove any difficulties with respect to antidiscrimination. Having raised these issues, I want to reinforce to this House that it is a requirement of government to properly consult the Australian community in the development of legislation. In relation to the development not only of this bill but also of the national airspace system in Australia. I have referred to the fact, which has been clearly reinforced in this House, that the government has failed to undertake such proper consultations in the past. It is for that reason that I simply say that there is an ongoing requirement that the government make sure that industry professionals, with respect to antidiscrimination legisMAIN COMMITTEE",205,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2005

234,The Deputy Speaker,It is not open to the member for Batman to debate the issue.,206,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2005
235,Mr Martin Ferguson,"Yes, Mr Deputy Speaker. In terms of the nature of the bill, itlation and any other legislation going to the aviation industry, are properly consulted, so as to guarantee that we get the best legislative framework in place to guarantee we have the safest possible aviation system in the world. I simply say that I consider that the government on regular occasions-including during the development of this bill, which goes to antidiscrimination aspects of the aviation industry, which need to be attended to-has ignored the need for those consultations and chosen to go its own way, therefore potentially placing the safety of the Australian travelling public at risk. I therefore call on the government to guarantee that in the future it will accept its responsibilities to actually consult properly with the travelling public and come clean on the nature of those consultations and any special relationships it might have with people in the aviation industry who can unduly influence its consideration of policy issues. If it does not-and I know this irks some in government-I simply say that, if a serious accident occurs, it will be the fault of the minister, who will have failed to properly consult the industry and the professionals within it with respect to the legislative framework that exists in Australia. That is exceptionally important, because it is not only about duty of care-it can also go to absolute negligence with respect to how one performs and accepts one’s ministerial responsibilities. Any failure by the government to actually guarantee that in the future proper consultation is pursued in the development of legislation will basically not only place the travelling public at risk but also bring to a head serious questions about the responsibilities of the minister. Having raised these issues-and I know the government does not want a proper debate on the failure of the current minister to accept his responsibilities in the aviation industry-I commend the bill to the House. However, in doing so, I also clearly state that there are serious concerns in the industry about the performance of the minister-not only about his failure to consult on this bill but also about his failure to consult on a regular basis with respect to the operation of the aviation industry in Australia, over an extended period. I commend the bill to the House. Dr JENSEN (Tangney) (12.43 pm)-The purpose of the Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2005, as you stated a little earlier, Mr Deputy Speaker, is basically quite simple. It amends the Civil Aviation Act of 1988. The major provisions of the bill are to allow the regulations under the Civil Aviation Act that are inconsistent with Commonwealth antidiscrimination laws, where the inconsistency is necessary for the safety of air navigation. Aviation safety is an extremely important issue for me. I was an air traffic controller in a past life and I am very well aware of some of the issues that relate to aviation safety that may run contrary to antidiscrimination laws. A further related purpose of this legislation is to retrospectively validate existing regulations that may once again be inconsistent with the Commonwealth antidiscrimination laws, where the inconsistency is necessary for the safety of air navigation. The bill was introduced in March 2004 as the Civil Aviation Amendment (Relationship with Anti-discrimination Legislation) Bill 2004. The majority of the committee supported the 2004 bill. Their only recommendation was that there be a requirement for consultation with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This recommendation was implemented through new subsection 98(6C). The Disability Discrimination Act 1992 makes discrimination on the basis of disability unlawful in many areas. The Sex Discrimination Act 1984 similarly makes discrimination on the basis of sex, marital status or pregnancy unlawful. Both acts include a number of exempMAIN COMMITTEE tions. Regulations made under an act are generally invalid if they are inconsistent with the act under which they are made. Therefore, unless parliament specifically provides that regulations made under an act may make discrimination on one or more of the bases prescribed by the Disability Discrimination Act or the Sex Discrimination Act lawful or the regulations fall within one or more of the exemptions in these acts, regulations that purport to allow such discrimination will be invalid. There is some uncertainty as to the legality of certain aviation safety regulations or aspects vis-a-vis the Disability Discrimination Act or the Sex Discrimination Act. There are a number of regulations that have been made under the CAA that may be invalid for this reason. For example, there are regulations that allow discrimination on the basis of the disability of colour blindness-in relation to air traffic controllers, for instance. These regulations will be valid if the discrimination allowed relates to the inherent requirements of the job, as this exemption is provided for by the Disability Discrimination Act. However, there is some argument about whether it strictly falls within the ambit of the job as such, and so we need a broadening of these exemptions for the purposes of aviation safety. Another example relating to aviation safety which could run counter to the Disability Discrimination Act is the issue of emergency exit seating provisions. Currently people who are disabled in certain ways are not allowed to sit immediately adjacent to the emergency exitfor good common sense safety reasons, in that obviously they would be physically unable to open the emergency exit allowing people to safely egress. Under section 55 of the Disability Discrimination Act and section 44 of the Sex Discrimination Act, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission may grant exemptions from specified provisions of these acts. On 26 November 2002, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission granted a conditional exemption to persons acting pursuant to the then existing civil aviation regulations regarding medical fitness or pursuant to the amendments to these regulations that were proposed at the time, for a period of five years. These exemptions were granted subject to the condition that they were to apply only to where a person’s pregnancy, for the purposes of the Sex Discrimination Act, or disability, for the purposes of the Disability Discrimination Act, prevented the person safely fulfilling the inherent requirements of the role covered by the license concerned. In the process leading up to HREOC granting an exemption, submissions were made by a number of bodies. Most opposed the grant of an exemption, primarily taking issue with, for example, the current colour blindness standards and arguing that current colour blindness testing was inappropriately restrictive. The situation in relation to colour blindness following the granting of the exemption appears uncertain, as it may be argued that a disability constituted by a level of colour blindness that purportedly would result in the refusal of a licence does not prevent the person concerned from safely fulfilling the inherent requirements of the role covered by the licence concerned, as I mentioned earlier. For this reason, it is important that there are retrospective inclusions in the legislation so that measures already adopted for safety reasons continue to have effect. This bill not only gives certainty in terms of the period under which the regulations would take effect but also broadens the somewhat constricting nature of the exemption. Clearly in terms of the Sex Discrimination Act only medical aspects need to be considered. With the MAIN COMMITTEE Disability Discrimination Act, however, the scope needs to be somewhat broader, to ensure aviation safety. Australia is a contracting state to the Convention on International Civil Aviation, generally referred to either as the Chicago convention or ICAO. Part 67 of the civil aviation safety regulations, which deal with medical requirements, is based on international standards and recommended practices, as prescribed in chapter 6 of annex 1 of the Chicago convention. CASA has stated in its request to HREOC for an exemption to the provisions of the DDA and SDA that conformity with international standards and practices prescribed under the convention is necessary, otherwise Australia’s regulatory regimes for aviation safety and practices would be put at great risk of not being accepted by the ICAO, the body administering the convention, and by other contracting states. It is very important to note that all regulatory amendments are subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Furthermore, it should be noted that this bill does not remove the capacity of the individual to appeal to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This bill also gives the opportunity to correct the term ‘foreign aircraft’ to ‘foreign registered aircraft’. Clearly, something like a Boeing 747 is a foreign aircraft but it could very well be registered to Qantas. In conclusion, in terms of the discriminatory effect of the Civil Aviation Act, the bill will allow regulations to be made which permit conduct that would otherwise constitute a breach of the Disability Discrimination Act or the Sex Discrimination Act. This is unlikely to constitute a breach of Australia’s obligations under international conventions, other than in a limited respect-the position of aircraft traffic controllers, for example-given that the aim of the regulations is air safety. I commend this bill to the House. Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.53 pm)-I am very mindful of the fact that the committee closes at one o’clock, so I will make sure I conclude my comments by then. The Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2005 provides for regulations that may be inconsistent with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. It places conditions pertaining to the ongoing retention of an air operator’s certificate-more commonly referred to as an AOC-that are currently in a civil aviation order into section 28 of the Civil Aviation Act. It corrects errors and standardises references in the act to aircraft which are registered in countries other than Australia-and that is very important because we need to make sure that we do not have any errors and that references are standardised. That is something all legislation needs to be very mindful of, and it is taken care of in this piece of legislation. Looking at the background to the development of this legislation, I can see that it reintroduces the substance of the civil aviation relationship with the discrimination bill 2004 and a minor element of the Civil Aviation Legislation Amendment (Mutual Recognition with New Zealand and Other Matters) Bill 2003. We will be supporting this piece of legislation, as was detailed at great length by the member for Batman. The legislation takes into account recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee in relation to the 2004 bill. We found those recommendations to be of vital importance when determining our position on this piece of legislation. I should also note that a dissenting report was submitted by the Australian Democrats in relation to that bill. But the majority position has been incorporated in this legislation, which makes those of us on this side of the House very happy and puts us in a position where we can support this legislation. The Office of Regulation ReMAIN COMMITTEE view has advised that the bill does not require a regulatory impact statement and, therefore, none accompanies this legislation. The purpose of this bill is to amend the Civil Aviation Act 1988. It makes regulations that may be inconsistent with the Disability Discrimination Act 1992 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, and it ratifies the validity of existing regulations and past action. It brings into the act the requirement that holders of air operator certificates, AOCs, continue to satisfy the Civil Aviation Safety Authority-or CASA, as it is more commonly known-and that they meet the conditions of issue of an AOC. It standardises references in the act to aircraft that are registered in countries other than Australia, and it changes all incorrect references to such aircraft to the defined term ‘foreign registered aircraft’. It is only recently that I have started to look at these issues in any great depth. Within my electorate an airline has been operating for many years. It is called Aeropelican and it has been operating out of Belmont. In recent times, the operator of that airline has moved his services from Belmont, within my electorate, to Williamtown. As a big supporter of that airline, I became most upset when that happened, and I started to look at issues surrounding air operator certificates and how they impact on the ongoing operation of air services. I will not go into detail now about my battle to save Aeropelican. Needless to say, I put before the House the fact that it is a very important issue in the electorate of Shortland. Additionally, it is a very important civil aviation issue. I have raised this issue with CASA and I will be raising it continually, because Aeropelican is one air service that has the support of everybody within my area. Returning to this piece of legislation, I have to say that we on this side of the House are very supportive of the legislation. There are some issues in this piece of legislation that go to consistency. The fact that no regulatory impact statement was needed shows that most issues have been dealt with. The government has taken into account the recommendations of the Senate committee and that means this legislation should be supported by us. Debate (on motion by Mr Wakelin) adjourned. Main Committee adjourned at 1.01 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Petroleum (Question No. 184) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 29 November 2004: (1) What is the latest estimate by his department on the projected revenue from petroleum sales in 2004-2005. (2) How does this estimate vary from earlier estimates of revenue from this source. (1) and (2) See page 18 of the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook 2004-05 and page 5-6 of 200405 Budget Paper No. 1. Oil Prices (Question No. 185) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 29 November 2004: What advice has he received from (a) his department, and (b) the Reserve Bank of Australia about the likely inflationary impact of increased world oil prices. The impact of the increase in oil prices in the latter half of 2004 has been incorporated into the MYEFO forecasts. The Statement on Monetary Policy, which is publicly released four times a year provides an assessment of the Reserve Bank’s views on current economic conditions and the prospects for inflation. Calder Freeway (Question No. 253) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, in writing, on 1 December 2004: (1) Is he aware of the accident record of the section of the Calder Freeway at Taylors Lakes from the intersection with Sunshine to the intersection with Calder Park Drive. (2) Is he aware that Victorian Government has proposed constructing several interchanges along this section of freeway, at Sunshine Avenue, Kings Road and Calder Park Drive and closing the intersection with Robertsons Road. (3) Will the Commonwealth match the State Government’s commitment of 50 per cent of the estimated total cost of $60 million to allow construction of the proposed interchanges. (4) Has the Commonwealth previously committed any funding to commence the construction of the interchanges; if not will he commit the Commonwealth to funding the construction of the Kings Road interchange, to alleviate the dangerous situation facing motorists along this stretch of the Calder Freeway. (1) Yes, a number of correspondents have drawn to my attention the growing number of motor vehicle accidents along the sections of the Calder Freeway that were mentioned by the Honourable member.",206,Civil Aviation Amendment Bill 2005

238,Mr Anderson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(2) Yes, I am aware that the Victorian Government is proposing to construct a number of interchanges along this section of the Freeway to improve access to residential areas. (3) to (4) Under AusLink, the Australian Government is already contributing $1.537 billion to Victoria for land transport projects on the new AusLink National Network, and for existing commitments to projects off the Network over the five years from 2004-05 to 2008-09. In addition, the Australian Government announced an extra $158.6m in the Pre-election Fiscal and Economic Outlook and election commitments for Victorian road projects. This comprised an extra $21m for the Pakenham bypass, making a total commitment to $121 million, an extra $120m to fund the Scoresby Freeway as an untolled road, making a total commitment of $565m and $17.6m for commitments under the Roads to Recovery strategic fund. Legal Services (Question No. 278) Ms Roxon asked the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, in writing, on 2 December 2004: (1) How much did the Minister’s department spend during 2003-2004 on outsourced (a) barristers and (b) solicitors (including private firms, the Australian Government Solicitor, and any others). (2) How much did the Minister’s department spend on internal legal services. (3) What is the Minister’s department’s projected expenditure on legal services for the 2004-2005 financial year. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) The Department of Veterans’ Affairs spent a total of approximately $9.0M for the purchase of external legal services (which includes disbursements and engaging counsel) in the 2003-2004 financial year. It is not possible to separately distinguish between the legal costs spent on barristers and solicitors for a number of reasons including that: (a) these costs often appear on the one invoice with the consequence that every individual invoice for this period would need to be re-examined to accurately specify the amount that was paid directly to a barrister as separate from the other costs and disbursements included on that invoice; and (b) AGS officers and other legal service providers can appear in a matter as both a barrister and a solicitor due to the fused nature of the legal profession in many jurisdictions. (2) The Legal Services Group is the primary area in the Department for providing internal legal services on a wide range of matters (excluding the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Service (McRS) matters which are dealt with by the Comcare external legal panel). The total budget for 2003-2004 for the Legal Services Group was approximately $2.0M (this is made up of salary and administrative costs but excludes desktop and voice costs and the costs of the SES Band1 Manager). There are also other areas in the Department who undertake some work of a legal nature and may be capable of falling within the phrase “internal legal services”. For example, the Department of Veterans’ Affairs uses APS employees who are not legally qualified or admitted to practice to undertake a range of tasks which could be described as involving work of a legal nature. Examples of this include: (a) the development of legislation proposals; (b) appearances before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as advocates who representative the Repatriation Commission; (c) in relation to the McRS undertaking the management of cases, the reconsideration of primary decisions and the supervision of the external legal panel; and (d) the management and development of contracts. For each of the above tasks, there are also APS employees who are legally qualified and admitted to practice who perform similar duties. It is not possible to fully identify and allocate costs to the individual components of legal work that are undertaken by these other areas of the Department. (3) The estimated expenditure for the 2004-2005 financial year in the Department of Veterans’ Affairs is approximately $9.1M (which includes $2.3M for the Department and $6.8M for McRS and the Military Rehabilation and Compensation Act 2004) for the costs and disbursements of external legal providers and counsel, and internal costs of approximately $2.1M for the Legal Services Group Economy (Question No. 310) Mr Kelvin Thomson asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 6 December 2004: (1) What recent advice has he received from his department regarding the anticipated current account deficit in 2005? (2) What recent advice has he received from his department regarding the anticipated growth in Australia’s net foreign debt? (3) What specific government policies will address the growth in net foreign debt? The Treasurer is periodically briefed by the Department of the Treasury on current economic conditions and the outlook for the Australian economy, including the possible outlook for the current account and implications for foreign debt. In the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, released on 21 December 2004, the current account deficit is forecast to be $51 billion in 2004-05. Further information is available in that document. Over 95 per cent of Australia’s net foreign debt is owed by the private sector. Since this Government came to office the general government share of net foreign debt has fallen from around 17.2 per cent to 4.7 per cent. Through sound budget management the Government has reduced general government net debt from around $96 billion (19.1 per cent of GDP) in 1995-96 to around $23 billion in 2003-04 (2.9 per cent of GDP). Ensuring the budget is in surplus means the Government is not living beyond its means and does not need to borrow to fund its activities. Exports are expected to rise as agricultural exports increase, reflecting recovery from the lingering effects of the drought, while all exports should benefit from the continued growth of our major trading partners. Ongoing economic reforms to improve Australia’s competitiveness should over time reduce the current account deficit and hence slow the growth in net foreign debt. Domestic and Overseas Air Travel (Question No. 328) Mr Quick asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 6 December 2004: (1) For the year 2003-04, what sum was spent by the Minister’s department on (a) domestic travel, and (b) overseas air travel. (2) For the year 2003-04, what proportion of domestic air travel by employees of the Minister’s department was provided by (a) Qantas, (b) Regional Express, and (c) Virgin Blue. (3) For the year 2003-04, what was the actual expenditure by the Minister’s department on domestic air travel provided by (a) Qantas, (b) Regional Express, and (c) Virgin Blue. (4) For the year 2003-04, what sum was spent by the Minister’s department on business class travel on (a) domestic routes, and (b) overseas routes. (5) For the year 2003-04, what sum was spent by the Minister’s department on economy travel on (a) domestic routes, and (b) overseas routes.",211,Questions In Writing
239,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(6) For the year 2003-04, what proportion of the expenditure on air travel by the Minister’s department was on the domestic routes (a) Sydney to Canberra, (b) Melbourne to Canberra, (c) Sydney to Melbourne, (d) Sydney to Brisbane, (e) Melbourne to Launceston, and (f) Sydney to Perth. (7) For the year 2003-04, how many employees of the Minister’s department had membership of the (a) Chairman’s Lounge, (b) Qantas Club, (c) Regional Express Membership Lounge, and (d) Virgin Blue’s Blue Room paid for by the department. (1) In financial year 2003-04: (a) expenditure on domestic air travel was $910,751 (b) expenditure on international air travel was $1,249,233 (2) In financial year 2003-2004, the proportion of domestic airfares paid to carriers was: (a) Qantas (and subsidiaries) -96.1 per cent (b) Regional Express -2.6 per cent (c) Virgin Blue -1.3 per cent. (3) In financial year 2003-2004, domestic travel expenditure of $910,751 was apportioned as follows: (a) Qantas (and subsidiaries) -$875,165 (b) Regional Express -$23,924 (c) Virgin Blue -$11,662.

(b) In financial year 2003-2004, Treasury paid for 120 Qantas Club memberships. (c) No other memberships were paid for by the Treasury. (d) No other memberships were paid for by the Treasury. Medical Board of Western Australia (Question No. 394) Mr Bevis asked the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 9 December 2004: (1) Is she aware of the decision of the Medical Board of Western Australia, delivered on 20 July 2004, following its inquiry into the conduct of a Medical Doctor, a Navy Reserve Commander, which found him guilty on a number of charges relating to improper conduct, misconduct and gross carelessness or incompetency in respect of his conduct as a naval doctor, involving a female Lieutenant Commander who was at that time the Executive Officer at HMAS Stirling in Western Australia. (2) Can she confirm that the Board commented unfavourably on the Navy Reserve Commander, in particular, that (a) it had “significant concern about the evidence of the Practitioner. Some aspects",213,Questions In Writing
240,Mr Costello,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:of it were entirely unconvincing. Others raise serious questions as to its reliability and his veracity”, and (b) the fact that “he permitted a sworn statement of his evidence-in-chief to be tendered knowing that it was inaccurate is particularly disturbing”, and (c) “The Practitioner displayed... a willingness to give evidence which was at odds with what appeared in his written statement”. (3) Can she confirm that the Board concluded that the conduct of the Practitioner was found to have been unacceptable and identified a number of serious deficiencies in the discharge of his professional obligations and marked departures from the standard of care, treatment and management demanded of a competent general practitioner. (4) Can she confirm that the Board also concluded that the proven wrongdoing of the Practitioner was not confined to a single aspect of his care, treatment and management of his patient and encompassed a diverse range of failures and multiple infractions and that the nature and broad range of his professional misconduct required the Board to take action to protect the public interest. (5) Has the Department of Defence made any payments for the Reserve Doctor’s legal representation, penalties or costs associated with this matter, including inquiries conducted by the Defence Ombudsman and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. (6) Can she confirm that the medical board concluded the female victim gave evidence in a way that might be expected of a long-serving and senior officer in the Australian Defence Force and that neither her demeanour nor her performance as a witness was reflective of a lack of truthfulness. (7) Can she confirm that the female victim has not received any financial support for costs associated with these matters. (8) Will she ensure that the victim receives full and proper compensation for her costs and damages caused by the improper conduct of the Navy Reserve medical officer. (9) Was the medical officer the same person who administered inoculations to Australian troops deployed to Iraq, giving rise to complaints by some troops who refused to have the inoculations. (10) Has the medical officer since been recommended for promotion. (11) What disciplinary action has been taken against the medical officer. Mrs De-Anne Kelly-The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Yes. (2) (a), (b) and (c) I am advised that the Medical Board of Western Australia, in its reasons for decision, made such comments. (3) I am advised that the Medical Board of Western Australia, in its reasons for decision, made such findings. (4) I am advised that the Medical Board of Western Australia, in its reasons for decision, indicated that it had reached such findings. (5) Yes. In accordance with the Attorney-General’s Legal Services Directions made pursuant to Judiciary Act 1903 section 55ZF, the costs of legal representation and part of the Board’s costs of the proceedings, which it ordered Commander McKenzie to pay, were met as part of the assistance. (6) I am advised that the Medical Board of Western Australia, in its reasons for decision, indicated that it had reached such conclusions. (7) I am advised that the female Lieutenant requested the Navy to meet the expense of her next-of-kin travelling to Perth from Melbourne so he could serve as her legal adviser. This request was considered not to be within the legal assistance regime established by the Attorney-General’s Legal Services Directions. A subsequent request that the Navy meet the costs of the female Lieutenant Commander’s civilian legal representative during a conciliation meeting called by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which is investigating a compliant relating to the issue before the Medical Board of Western Australia, was refused for the same reason. (8) Matters of compensation and damages are determined in accordance with the law by the appropriate Court or Tribunal. (9) I am advised that the officer was posted as the Medical Officer on HMAS Kanimbla during the Iraq war where he was required to implement Australian Defence Force policy on immunisations. (10) I am advised that the latest Navy Officer Performance Appraisal Report on the medical officer is held for the period ending 17 July 2003. In this report, he was assessed by his supervisor (the Commanding Officer of HMAS Kanimbla) as being highly suitable for the next rank. This report was considered by the Navy’s Career Advancement Board in December 2004. The Chief of Navy’s promotion signal of 17 December 2004 did not include the medical officer. (11) None. Crime (Question No. 496) (1) What sums from the proceeds of crime has the Australian Government (a) requested, and (b) received from foreign countries following mutual assistance requests. (2) Of the $6 million frozen in foreign countries that the Australian Government assisted in identifying as proceeds of crime in 2003-4, what sums has it (a) requested, and (b) received. (3) Of the $6 million frozen in foreign countries, (a) what sums were frozen on what dates in which countries. (1) Australia asks foreign countries to enforce or give effect to forfeiture orders for the proceeds of crime. This is done in order to deprive persons of such proceeds. Requests are made irrespective of the prospects of any of the proceeds being returned to Australia. It is a matter for the foreign country whether they are able to repatriate proceeds of crime to Australia. Requests to foreign countries for the repatriation of forfeited proceeds of crime are confidential and it is a matter for discussion between Australia and the foreign country whether the proceeds of crime can be repatriated. During the 2003-04 financial year, Australia received two sums of approximately $335,000 and $281,000 from a foreign country in response to mutual assistance requests. (2) See the answer to question (1). None of the $6 million frozen in foreign countries that the Australian Government assisted in identifying as proceeds of crime in 2003-4 has been received by Australia. (3) Mutual assistance requests to foreign countries are confidential. The $6 million referred to in the Attorney-General’s Department Annual Report of 2003-04 was frozen in two countries in late 2003 as a result of unrelated mutual assistance requests. I note that my colleague Senator Ellison, the Minister for Justice and Customs, has primary responsibility for mutual assistance requests relating to proceeds of crime.

248,Mr Ruddock,"The Minister for Justice and Customs has provided the following answer to(b) The AFP is not aware of any public sector capacity to armour vehicles. (7) Vehicles can be armoured in Australia. The costs vary dependant upon agreement arranged and the level of armouring.

Detention Centres (Question No. 774) Mr Brendan O’Connor asked the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, in writing, on 9 March 2005: Is the Minister aware of solitary confinement being used as punishment in Australia’s Immigration Detention Centres. has provided the following answer to the honourable member’s question: Solitary confinement is not used in Immigration Detention Centres (IDCs), nor is detention in more restrictive accommodation used as punishment. IDCs are communal living arrangements where people live in compounds. Within these communities, like any community, there are expectations that people will behave consistently with the community’s rules for the benefit of the group and the individuals within it. The Detention Services Provider seeks the constructive participation of detainees through recreational and educational programs, counselling and mediation and an effective complaints mechanism. When these strategies do not work and people cause disruption to the facility or to other detainees, a more restrictive management environment including observation rooms and Management Support Units can be appropriate to ensure the detainee’s welfare and the welfare of the community as a whole. There are procedures covering these facilities. Any detainee placed in more restrictive accommodation is placed on a management plan specifically designed to re-integrate them back into the general detainee population as soon as possible. During this time their physical and mental health are monitored closely. Transfers to more restrictive accommodation, such as Management Support Units, may also occur at the request of a detainee wishing to have some ‘time out’ of their usual accommodation area.

In addition to Disability Employment Assistance, Job Network and vocational rehabilitation also provide services to people with disabilities. All Job Network members are able to assist people with disabilities and some Job network members specialise in helping people with disabilities. Vocational Rehabilitation Services assist people with disabilities to enter and remain in the workplace by assessing work capacity and providing support such as injury management and job preparation, training and placement. (3) The Government is currently considering a range of options for the Disability Employment Assistance Program arising out of consultations with the disability employment assistance sector in early 2005. For the present, efficiencies in better targeting services have made it possible to respond to fluctuating demand. The Government recently announced that it will fund an extra 250 employment places across 10 new outlets in areas of greatest need for job seekers with disabilities. In addition, it will fund a further 1500 places in existing outlets also assessed as having high need.
