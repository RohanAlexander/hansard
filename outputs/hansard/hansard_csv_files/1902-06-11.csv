It is a matter for regret that a Bill of such importance should have been brought forward at so late a stage of our first session. The Bill contains provisions' which must be of very great interest to all honourable members, no matter on which side of the political fence they may sit. We are now in the thirteenth month of this abnormal session, and a large number of honourable members are prevented from attending the House owing to the pressure of private business; therefore the measure is being considered in a thin House, and those honourable members who are present are jaded in mind and unable to give the attention which the importance of the measure merits. We might very well have allowed the consideration of the Bill to be postponed to 38 : i 0 I have seen no such some future session, when we shall be better informed and much better able to deal with it than at the present time. The question of bonuses versus protective duties is one upon which some honourable members who profess free-trade principles have been twitted with want of consistency. As a. free-trader I am perfectly willing to consider the question of encouraging certain industries by means of bonuses in preference to affording them the assistance of protective duties, because I believe that „ if matters are properly managed and are kept free from the influences which are sometimes exerted, an industry may be encouraged at much less cosb by granting bonuses than under any system of import duties. To that extent honourable members on this side of the chamber should be prepared to consider the present -proposal on its merits. The're -is-.no doubt that we possess within the limits of the Commonwealth some very valuable deposits of iron ore, and there is probably small question that these deposits cannot be successfully handled without the investment of a large amount of capital. In order to induce those who possesslarge capital to embark it, some special encouragement may have to be given, and I admit at once that so far as iron production is concerned, I should be prepared, if all conditions were satisfactory, to vote for some form of I believe that I can consistently do that. I must point out, however, that we have already had some experience as to has granted a number of bonuses, the benefits derived from which have not been at all commensurate with the amount of money expended, and, in the early history of other States, bonuses have been given for the production of cloth and several other articles with results far from satisfactory. I do not believe that the people of the States have received value for their money in these cases, and therefore we should be very careful to safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth before we enter upon such a colossal undertaking as that which is now held in view. The measure is not a welldigested one, or if it is the Minister for Trade and Customs has not made out such a case as he should have done. I quite endorse the remarks made by the honourable member for Gippsland to the effect that the amount of information given to the House by the Minister was meagre in the extreme.",16,South Africanwa R Expenditure

31,Upon Which Mr Watson Had Moved By Way,"Thehonorablememberis aremarkablyshrewd man, and has leanings towards the policy of stimulating the manufacture of iron; but he says that a sufficiently good case has not been made out to justify the Housei n entering upon an enterprise which will ultimately cost the Commonwealth a large amount of money. No one will call in question the value of the iron industry. No product of civilized man influences so largely the employment of labour and stimulates to such a great degree other classes of manufactures; and if we could by any means develop the iron industry in our midst we might be warranted in making a concession even of fiscal principles to some extent. I do not think that tlie Bill will have the desired effect, and therefore I am obliged to vote against it . During the agitation for federation I frequently -pointed out, and I believe others did tlie same, that one of the greatadvantages we should derivefromfederation would be that we should ultimately see the iron industry established in our midst. Under the old divided system the market -offered by any one State would not be sufficiently large to induce any one to devote a large amount of capital to tlie production of iron, and we could hardly hope to see that industry established until one of the States had increased its population to about 4,000,000 or 5,000,000. It seemed to me that under federation we might expect to see the iron industry established in one or more'of the States, because those engaged in the enterprise could look to the whole of . the States as a market for their product. . Apart from any assistance that may be given, I firinly believe that the establishment of such an industry will be only a matter of time. There seems to be a consensus of opinion that we have abundant deposits of iron of good quality; and, if this is so, capital will soon. be forthcoming for its development. If necessary we might be justified in going to the extent of affording some measure of fiscal protection. The offering of bonuses can only have the effect of hastening the establishment of the industiy, and it will require strong arguments to convince me that we should be justified in spending a quarter of a million of money for this purpose. Notwithstanding the strong arguments used by the Minister, I hold that any one who entered into the production of iron within the Commonwealth would enjoy a very large degree Mr G. B. Edwards. of natural protection in the form of the. freight charges upon the imported material. The argument employed by the Minister for Trade and Customs was a very specious one. The right honourable gentleman claimed tliat it would cost as much to carry a ton of iron from one State to another as it would from the old world to any port in Australia. But I would point out that .that argument is founded upon the cost of carrying a single ton from one State to another, whereas the rates obtained for the carriage of iron rails from the old world to any port in Australia are based upon very large freights indeedalways 1,000 tons, and sometimes considerably more. These large cargo boats are worked for a certain expenditure, and can be employed only when the rate of carriage is such as will return interest upon their capital cost and compensate the owners for the time absorbed on the voyage. Consequently the natural protection which free-traders contend that our manufacturers enjoy by reason of the distance of Australia from the iron markets of the old. world will exist for ever. ""When we do produce iron in Australia these great steamers will continue to be employed in conveying that product from port to port in the Commonwealth at a rate which is relatively as cheap as that which now obtains from ports in the old world to Australia. This Bill requires veiy careful scanning, and I strongly protest against the proposal to conter upon the Minister so much power under regulations. In measures of such first-class importance I object to leaving the application of the principle, if not the principle itself, to regulations which may subsequently be framed. It is very well for the Minister to point out that safeguards exist, in thatParlianientis afforded an opportunit)' of objecting to these regulations, but the fact remains thatsuchacourseis not frequently taken. I think it is far better to leave as little as possible to the Executive in the way of issuing regulations. Turning to the schedule of the Bill, which, of course, is the crux of the whole matter, I wish to refer first to the item of reapers and binders. TheB ill provides that a bonus of £ S each, or £4,000 in all, is to be paid for the manufacture of the first 500 of these machines. As a business man, I hold that such a proposal will have practically no effect. We shall simply be making a present of £4,000 to some firm which does not need assistance, and which would manufacture these machines without any monetary inducement being offered. The consumption of reapers and binders within the Commonwealth is very large, and it does not require a bribe of £4,000 to induce enterprising local manufacturers to turn out these machines. To that extent, therefore, J regard this expenditure as extravagant. Similarly, in regard to class 3, I notice that it is proposed to expend £50,000 to encourage the manufacture of galvanized iron and wire netting, notwithstanding tliat these industries already exist in our midst. The Government proposal is therefore tantamount to making the local manufacturers a present of the amount mentioned. can understand the basis of a Ministerial proposal to vote even so large a sum as £250,000 for the development of the iron industry, because that industiy does not exist within the Commonwealth, but when we are dealing with other items which do not involve such a large capital outlay, there is no sense or justice in selecting those concerned in their manufacture for a special paternal gift on the part of the Government. If we are tc give bonuses to existing industries, I can point to a string of them which are employing as much labour and doing as much good to the community as are the galvanized-iron and wire netting industries, .and which therefore have an equal claim to share in any such bonuses. Class2 deals with the question of making spelter from Australian ore. To those who believe in the system, perhaps some reason might be advanced why we should give a bonus for the production of this commodity. A t the present moment marketable spelter is not produced* in Australia. But how can we expect to do the industry any good by spending such an insignificant sum as £20,000? The honourable member for Barrier, who knows something about this matter, representing as he does a district where zinc largely exists, declared some time ago, when the Tariff was under discussion, that he knew of the existence of large quantities of spelter which were roughly valued at £4,000,000. Of what use is it to offer £20,000 to stimulate capitalists to deal with £4,000,000 worth of zinc ? It would be an extraordinary body of capitalists who would wait for a vote of £20,000 to enable them to deal with such a huge body of ore if chemical science could be successfully brought to bear upon it. The thing is an absurdity. Capitalists would hardly heed the additional inducement 38 M 2 which the Government propose to offer. We should be giving these people far more inducement to tackle the great heap of tailings containing this zinc if we remitted the duty upon machinery than we shall do by offering them a bonus of £20,000. As honourable members are aware, it is neces( sary to replace most of the up-to-date machinery every three or four years, and consequently by the imposition of machinery duties we are periodically penalising enterprise. I am more in sympathy with the proposal contained in class 1, because although the amount of £250,000 is a large one, esI pecially in view of the present financial condition of the Commonwealth, the iron industry is very important. If it can be shown that we can embody in this Bill efficient safeguards for protecting the revenue, I shall be perfectly satisfied. If we can insure that the undertaking will be a good commercial one all round, I shall be prepared to vote for it . A t the same time, I hold that we shall do more good by offering a bonus to encourage the industry than we shall achieve by the adoption of any system of protective duties. The proposal of the Government, however, is merely part of one great scheme, the corollary of which is that at a certain stage we shall impose protective duties. To my mind if people are induced to spend large sums of money under the stimulus of the proposed bonus, and they do not happen to make ends meet, application will assuredly be made to the Government to give them more assistance in the shape of protection, and upon the ground that we had alread}' sunk £250,000 in this enterprise, the claim for still further protection would probably meet with some success at the hands of this Parliament. It therefore behoves honourable members to look critically at the provisions of this Bill, and when .bhey do so, I am satisfied bhey must come bo the conclusion bhab bhe inberests of' bhe Commonwealth are not sufficienbly protecbed by ib. In connection wibh bhis matber, we should guard againsb simply assisting one or bwo special syndicates bo engage in company-mongering. AVe know that certain people who own certain rights to iron deposits, are unable, ab bhe .presenb bime, bo do anybhing wibh bhem. Bub the moment that this Bill is passed, these persons will be able to go to the English market and say, "" We have this property, and also a promise from the Government to grant this bonus, the payment of which is to be followed by an exceedingly heavy import duty."" properties into large companies. I sympathize with the honourable member for South Australia, previous occasion, declared' that if we intended to deal with this question upon any principle which would involve such a large expenditure as £250,000, we should do well to consider whether it would not be wiser to nationalize the production of iron. The argument used by him was that the States Governments are the largest purchasers of manufactured iron within the Commonwealth, and that, therefore, in the event of the 1 ail ways being transferred would not be a bad enterprise if the latter to establishing -our midst for the production of iron. I would rather do that, and have full control, than risk money in the creation of companies which may or may not prove a success. To that extent I would support a proposal to nationalize the industry, the proposal to be on broad lines, and to carefully safeguard the interests of the taxpayer.' But we are here brought face to face with constitutional and financial difficulties, which more than anything make me desire that this measure should be postponed. Early in the session, I was one of the first to raise the question whether the Commonwealth has power to tax the imports of the States Governments. had opinions from different legal luminaries, and, on the whole, the common-sense view, to my mind, is that the Commonwealth has this power. But we ought to have a decision by the Eederal High Courb before we subsidize the manufacture of iron, or enber upon ib as a nationalized We cannot geb bhab decision now,, and ib would be far safer bo wait until we can. Ib may be said that even if a decision were given by the High Courb, we could nob grant those who embark in the enterprise the monopoly of supplying the States with railway material. I do not know that under the Constitution we could, bub ib is open bo bhe Federal Executive bo propose, and bo bhis House to endorse, an agreement between the Federal Government and bhe States Governments by which bhe railway material required by the latter shall be supplied by some subsidized company or national I Mr G. B. Edwards. factory. The Federal Government is just as much at liberty to make such an arrangeThis will enable them tp float their ment with the States Governments as with any private individuals : and bhab course would offer greater inducements to any Mr Batchelor, who, upon a legitimate company of manufacturers or investors than a lump sum of £250,000 divided, it may be, amongst several competing firms. Under an arrangemenb of bhe kind bhere would probably be only one company making the iron, whereas, wibh a bonus, there might be three companies all fighting for bhe monev and unable to make their enterprises pay. For some years we cannot*look forward to exporting, bub musb rely on bhe local market; and if eventually too many are induced to commence, wibh to the Commonwealth, it bhe necessary capital, failure may result. Under my suggestion, however, bhere would devoted the money in question probably be one company wibh sufficienb a national factory in capibal bo produce iron at a cheap rate, and to make the undertaking pay. Objection may be raised on the ground that there is diversity of interests between the States. Queensland, for instance, might object to taking up contracts at higher prices than rule in England or America, merely for the benefit of works in Tasmania or New South Wales. But the same argument could be used against the granting of bonuses. If the establishment of ironworks can benefib only one State, a system of bonuses can do no more: but I think that the feeling of Australia is no longer divisible, and that the States Governments would be quite willing to enter into On that point we have such an arrangement as I have indicated, in view of the great benefib bhab would accrue bo bhe whole of the Commonwealth. In the State in which the works were established markets would be thrown open for the products of the other States; and such a plan would do more than any system of indusbry. bonuses to solve the difficulties which face us. If the iron companies had long contracts which would constantly increase as the railway systems extended, that would offer the greatest inducement to investors. To my mind bhe financial difficulties are bhe greatest. We are in the thirteenth month of the session, and the whole of the loan and other financial Bills arc as yet incomplete. It is impossible for the Treasurer, bhe honourable member for North Sydney, or any other financial experb in bhe House bo say whab resulb our taxing measures may have on the revenue. We do nob as yeb know the final cast which these measures may take; and if we desire to carry out the policy contained in the Bill before us, we shall undoubtedly require more revenue. We could not stand the strain with what I believe will be the outcome of the present Tariff, and I feel sure this House is not prepared to resort to any extraordinary source of taxation. In all probability, the majority are determined th.ut we shall continue to look to the Customs as the only source of revenue; ancl, under such circumstances, we could not provide £250,000 or £320,000 as bonuses for the iron industry. So far as I have seen, the Government have made no effort to secure greater revenue. On the question of the tea duties, they gave way too willingly, although, in my opinion, the House was prepared to grant a tax. on that commodity. ber must not refer to that question in dealing with the Bill before the House. Mr G. B. EDWARDS-The argument, to my mind, was irresistible. However, we ought to await developments, and see what the revenue may be before we commit ourselves to this policy. The mind of Parliament is as yet not made up on the question whether works shall be constructed out of loan oiout of revenue. My hope is that Parliament will demand the construction of works out of revenue; and this presents another strain on our resources. There is nothing to be lost by delaying this measure. The iron deposes we have will remain with us, and, in any case, effect could not be given to the Bill within twelve months. We are at the end of a very long session, and it is inevitable that we meet again almost within a month or two. The Government would act wisely if they withdrew this measure, with the object of obtaining more information, and thus sought to obtain the support of men who, like myself, are inclined to regard with some degree of favour the proposal to establish the iron industiy, whatever may be our t opinion as regards other less important undertakings. We require more knowledge of the effect of taxation and other financial proposals, ancl further information as to the possibility of an arrangement between the States and the Federal Governments, ancl as to the proposal of the Government in relation to an agreement with any manufacturer or body of manufacturers. This. is no ordinary proposal which can be haggled about, as we might haggle about a duty in the Tariff. The iron industry is, as I understand it , a pivotal industry, which is well worth some | risk. If we cannot risk money in the way j we should like, we may as well see what 1 can be clone by means of a measure such as j that, before us. I understand that the honor I able member for Bland has submitted a ; proposal with which I . personally would I have the strongest sympathya proposal to | nationalize this industry, which gives rise to j other ancl dependent industries. But we i may as well face the facts honestly. If there is anything clear about the Constitution it is that it is not permissible or possible for the Federal Government to carry on any industry. I admit that it is a pity that our hands should be so tied. We are ""cribbed, 'cabined, and confined,"" and we shall find ourselves even more restricted in tlie course of a few years. In our. rapid development I have little doubt that we shall find the Constitution an impossible ancl unworkable instrument of government. In passing, I may say that that is the reason I took the unwelcome course of opposing the adoption of the Constitution. But we, should try to make the best of circumstances. I feel perfectly clear that it is not possible for the Federal Government to undertake the iron industiy or any part of it . There is power to the Federal Government to make laws regulating trade and commerce between the States, between private persons, or with foreign countries, but there is no power to cany on any industry. There is no power to trade; there is no power to do commerce; and much less is there power to carry on an industry. Under the circumstances what is best to be done ? I do not know any better course than to risk some money in the form of a bonus; but I should like that money risked with very stringent safeguards as to wages, hours, ancl the general conditions of labour. When we are giving the hard-earned money of taxpayers to a body of men for-the purpose of establishing an industry, it is not at all unreasonable to require that proper wages, hours, ancl conditions of labour shall be enjoyed by those employed.

If the second reading passes, I ' intend to move as an amendment the addition of the following words to clause SAnd. for securing proper wages and hours and conditions of labour. Of course, I am not bound down to the exact phraseology, though I think that those words will do what is wanted. It will still be optional with the Governor General in Council, in framing the regulations under which the bonuses are to be granted, to include such conditions : but I think that the sentiment of this House is such that they will be insisted upon. WhatI suggest is quite practicable, and the regulations must be laid before both Houses of Parliament. I think it is only fair that they should be before Parliament for a reasonable time before coming into force, but I would not insist upon that if the Minister undertook to insert definite and stringent provisions in regard to wages, hours, and conditions of labour. tion between the Commonwealth the wages and prescribing the wages which are to be paid by private employers 1 a difference between my action in prescribing the wages of the honourable member's employees and paying them myself. much difference if the honourable and learned member supplied the money in either case. is going to provide money for the establishment of iron works, we should see that those who are employed by the manufacturers are paid fair wages. I do not think that the House should agree to the postponement of the measure. Of course, we shall have the iron ore to work on in the future, but it seems to me that the sooner we dig it out of the ground and make use of it the better. I have seen in Tasmania almost mountains of iron ore, and I have no doubt that in New South Wales, and perhaps in other States, there are ample supplies available. Our losses in the pastoral industry through the drought should show us that we must not remain as dependent as we have been hitherto upon what are called the primary industries I shall support the second reading. gret that the Government are pushing on with such an important measure as this towards the end of the session. During the thirteen months in which Parliament has been sitting we have done sufficient work of importance to justify the Government in postponing the consideration of the issues raised by this Bill for a few months longer. It is a pity, too, that we should be asked to consider it before we really know whether the policy upon which it depends will be endorsed in another place. The discussion of this measure will be merely a waste of time if the Senate refuses to agree to the duties which constitute part of the whole proposition. I am sorry, therefore, that the Government will not yield to the evident desire of. many honourable members for a postponement of the measure until next session, when it could be considered with fresher brains, and at more leisure, and with the knowledge that the policy upon which it depends has been endorsed elsewhere. Wibh regard to the amendment which has been moved by tlie honourable member for Bland, I am somewhat is the distincdoubtful as to whebher it is really relevant paying to the Bill.

58,,"If we passed a law which Mr Glynn Yes; bhat is anotherduring manhood, thus reversing tlie usual logic by which all these policies of encouragement, whether protective or otherwise, arc supported. I ask honourable members who are following the Government whether it is not extraordinary that we should first encourage an industry when it is found by the resolution of both Houses to be a success, and no longer deserving of adventitious aid. According to the Government it is then that we are to give it .protection, and this seems to be pushable loyalty on the production of the ore ing all the ideas of encouragement to the very limits of absurdity. One point against this proposition struck me-that is, that we are either giving a bonus to cover a loss or to increase a profit. I do not care upon which alternative the Government rely. If the bonus is granted to cover a loss, and duties are to be subsequently imposed for the same purpose, the public money will be wantonly wasted. An industry that cannot support itself must be supported by che State. If the bonus is intended to increase the profit of those engaged in the industry, where is the justification for it ? If we apply that principle to one industry we must apply it to all. If we apply it to the producers of pig-iron, why should it not be extended to the producers of an}' other class of commodity? dustries are dependent upon the iron industry. „ ought to encourage the production of men, because all industries are dependent upon them. / If honourable members so go to the root of4his matter they will land themselves in a greater absurdity than the Government proposal involves. All industries are interwoven : they are dovetailed one into the other. What becomes of the division of labour if we look upon the production of iron as something different from the manufacture of the finished product? We know that there is absolutely no distinction. The man who makes the finished product is as much engaged in production, and as much deserving of encouragement, as is the man who extracts the crude ore from the earth. Of course, if it were a question of our not being able to obtain the raw material unless it were produced here, there would be some force in the interjection made by the honourable member for Southern Melbourne. There is no reason why we should grant bonuses for the encouragement of this industry which could not with equal force,. and quite as logically, be used in asking for an extension of the policy to other industries. In the United States heavy bounties were granted for a time, and very heavy duties were imposed during the last 70 or SO years of the last century. The general result, as described by one American writer, has been that the bounties paid have been given to the monopolists of the soil. Thus, a very considerhas been paid to the owners of the mines, and the bonuses have not been directed to the encouragement of the industry itself.. It has been stated that the royalties in some cases actually exceeded the total cost of production, and it is quite possible that the same thing might occur here. Deposits of iron may be found, and the bonus may be obtained, not by the person who turns the crude ore to account, but the man who has the monopoly of thematerial. That is a monopoly which I am perfectly sure honourable members'of the labour party do not wish toencourage. Asregardsthispolicy beingopen. to subsequent abuses through demands for its extension, we have, apart from the recent instance of the wheat bounty, the fact that a continual expansion has taken place in France since it was initiated. The French Government gives subsidies amounting to £1,500,000 to shipping, and there are special bounties granted, not only for sugar production-wit h which we are familiarbut for the encouragement of deep-sea. fisheries, the breeding of silkworms, silk spinning, flax and hemp cultivation, viticulture, and the production of mineral oils. I simply mention these instances to show that once we commence the policy of bounties on production, we shall leave the way open to preposterous demands for extension which, having confirmed the principle, we cannot logically resist. The Minister for Trade and Customs put his case for these bonuses with a considerable amount of plausibility and force on the ground of the success of the system in Canada. I contend, however, that the bonus system has not proved a success in Canada. Taking the figures quoted by the Minister, it is shown that in 1SS4, 29,000 tons of pig iron were made in Canada from Canadian ore, and in 1900 the production had increased to only 34,000 tons. The object of the policy, as it was introduced, was to encourage the",23,Second Reading
59,Mr Ronald,Becaus e so many other in,24,Second Reading
60,Mr Glynn,"According to that, wemanufacture of pig iron from Canadian ore, and the result, since the Bill was passed in 1883, was to bring about an increase of only about 5,000 tons. The imports, strange to say, increased in about the same ratio. In 1884, 52,000 tons were imported , and in 1 1900 05,000 tons. These figures indicate that the increased demand, as expressed not only in the local production but in the importations in Canada was the result, not of the bonuses, but of the necessities of manufacturing. In other words, there was a spurt in internal manufacturing, which led to the ore bodies being turned to account. creased, and the importations into Canada have increased because the manufacturing industries in which pig iron is used as .a raw material have made very crreat strides. I would almost say that, so far from the bonuses in Canada having led to greater production, the greater production has led to the payment of more bonuses. The increased general production has led iron manufacturers to take advantage of the policy of giving more bonuses. Production has been stimulated and encouraged, not by the bonuses, but by something else. all reference to the 70,000 tons of iron manufactured from Newfoundland ore? to that. I am now specially dealing with the figures mentioned by the Minister. Between 60,000 and 70,000 tons of ore were imported from Bell Island, and manufactured into iron in Canada. When we consider the small amount of the bonuses, and the tremendous scope of the industiy, it is ridiculous to assume that the 67,000 tons of ore was imported from Bell Island in order to take advantage of the bonuses^ The Minister himself told us that tlie amount required for the starting of the works in Canada was enormous, and that some companies had shown a capital investment during the last five years of 50,000,000 dollars. Theimportationsand thelocalproduction were encouraged, not by the bonus, the power of which, in comparison with the extent of the industry, was exceedingly small, butb}' the increased local demand. Let us look at the figures as regards the payment of bonuses. In 1884 the bonus was 1 dollar 50 cents per ton, and the amount paid was 44,000 dollars. In 1889, with the same bonus, the amount paid was 37,000 dollars. In five years, therefore, there was a fallingoff in the amount paid away iu bonuses. What does this indicate? I am entitled to say that the bonus was a failure for the first five or six years, because it led to a diminished production. I am as' much entitled to argue from coincident circumstances, that it diminished production, as is the Minister to argue from coincident circumstances that it led toon increased production. In 1892 the amount paid in bonuses, then at the rate of one dollar per ton, was 30,000 dollars; and in 1900,at the rate of two dollars per ton, the amount was Production has in238,000 dollars. What do these figures indicate ? They prove, if we are to rely on the mere synchronism of circumstances, that the bonuses did not succeed down to 1889, because the production was less than in 1884, as measured by the amount paid in bonuses. There was a very great increase from 1892 to 1900, because manufactures had very largely increased in Canada, and because there were enormous discoveries of native ores, and veiy large importations from Bell Island. If I am not mistaken, the manufacturers were entitled to a higher bonus for pig iron manufactured from foreign ore than for iron manufactured from native ore, two dollars per ton being allowed upon the foreign ore, and one dollar per ton upon the native ore. I had intended to refer But whether that was so or not, there was an enormous increase in bonus payments in 1900. given to the Canadian ore. Several changes have been made, and it is just possible that I may not have kept pace with them. I repeat that in 1892 the amount paid in bonuses was 32,000 dollars, whilst in 1900 it was 238,000 dollars. Why was that ? The bonus system had been in operation for eight years prior to 1892. Why was it not successful? Because its adoption does not lead to success. It is the fertility of nature, when it is discovered, that leads to success. It was not till 1S95 that large discoveries of ore were made in Canada. According to the Statistical, Register very big discoveries were made in Coleraine, Quebec, in that year. To my mind these figures prove that the payment of bonuses has not been responsible for the increased production of iron in Canada. Thab increase is the result of the discovery of raw material, and the progress",24,Second Reading

If he was operative, there was a diminution in looks at the statistics he will find that the export of iron, clearly showing that the the proportion of the increase has been ore was kept back for local use.

I do not think the idea can be ' he has seen between 50,000,000 and seriously entertained that the United States 60,000,000 tons of marketable ore, but statesmen wish to borrow one of Captain Coghlan, who is another authority, seems to Cuttle's telescopes in order to obtain a view think that the amount in sight in Australia round half the globe, and to discover what is under 13,000,000tons. are the intentions of Australia in this connection. In America the position seems in Queensland which contains ten times to be that nature, not protection, is effecthat quantity. tive for two of its States-Pennsylvani a and Alabama,-produc e more iron than all the other States put together. If the payment of bonuses has made the industry a success in Pennsylvania, how is it that it has existed there for 200 years? It was only after 1840 that the production of iron in America assumed very great dimensions, and it was not t ill 1890 that its production outstripped that of free-trade Great Britain, notwithstanding the local encouragement that was given to it . What was Bhe reason of that ? Surelyi t is somewhat significant that the enormous increase in the production of iron, not only in the United States, but in the United Kingdom, took place about the time that iron and steel were first utilized in the building of ships ! Since 1840, the world's demand for iron for all purposes, and particularly for shipping, has been enormous. Therefore, we find that from the period in question there has been a very great increase in the production of this commodity in free-trade England, as well as in protectionist America. countries are nothing like proportionate. Mr Jacquet states that mentions a number of places, including Wallerawang and Rylstone in New South Wales, where iron deposits are to be found, and he declares that the total quantity in sight in Australia is under 13,000,000 tons. Buti f we have such an abundant supply of ore containing a high percentage of iron, how is it that the industry is not a success ? Must manufacturers wait for this paltry bonus to extract gold through iron from the earth ? Are we going to make Australia rich because of the payment of a comparatively small bonus, when for years past there have been at least 50,000,000 or 60,000,000 tons of excellent ore in sight? Why is the industry not a success 1 Because it does not pay to treat the ore. A t the present time the production in America and England is enormous, and the output of Europe is also very great.

The honourable member does not desire monopoly, and contends that his proposal would prevent, whilst the Government proposal would tend to, that result. The honourable member, as I say, is more logical, and yet, for the reason I have given, I cannot support his proposal. I shall vote against the Bill, at the same time feeling myself unable to support the amendment in its present shape. ber has asked a ruling as to whether the amendment moved by the honourable member for Bland is relevant to the Bill. The title of the B ill is "" AB ill for an Act relatabout the United States or the countries of ing to Bonuses for the Encouragement of Manufactures."" Clearly the object is not to give bonuses, but bonuses are the means to an end, which is the encouragement of manufactures. That view is strengthened by the short title to the Bill as described in clause 1This Act may be cited as che Manufactures Encouragement Act 1!J02. In that clause there is no reference whatever to bonuses, but to certain manufactures. Turning to the schedule we see that the largest amounts of money are proposed to be applied to the encouragement of the manufacture of pig iron made from Australian ore, puddled bar iron made from Australian pig iron, steel made from Australian pig iron, galvanized iron, wire netting, and ""iron and steel tubes or pipes, except riveted, or cast, not more than 6 inches internal diameter."" Clearly the general object of the Bill is the encouragement of manufactures, and those, for the most part, of iron. The amendment is, therefore, thoroughly relevant to the purposes of the Bill, but proposes an alternative method of encouraging those manufactures, the method suggested being by the establishment of Commonwealth or State iron works. The amendment is relevant to the subject matter of the Bill under discussion sire briefly to give a few reasons why I intend to support tlie Bill submitted by the Government. I quite admit, as has been urged by many speakers, that tills is perhaps as important a question as Parliament has to consider, and we ought to be very careful in giving a vote. I was so much impressed with its importance, and with the necessity for individual and independent inquiry, that instead of blindly following the Government, as a supporter may sometimes do, I devoted'some time in striving to get information in respect to the bonus system in other countries. I spent portions of several days in the Parliamentary Library of New South Wales, and even in that, which is supposed to be one of the best libraries in the world, I found it extremely difficult, and almost impossible, although assisted by the officials, to find any satisfactory or exhaustive information. Most of the information I obtained, referred to the Dominion of Canada; I could find little or nothing Europe. I had not the opportunity of hearing the Minister for Trade and Customs move the second reading of this Bill, nor did I hear the debate yesterday evening; but on glancing over the speech of the right honourable gentleman, I find that all his arguments are drawn from Canada, so that evidently he experienced prett}' much the same difficulties as I did in my humble way. I find that in 1897 an Act was passed in Canada'fixing the bounty on steel ingots at three dollars a ton, which, of course, is quite equal to the amount now proposed by the Government. This duty was on ingots manufactured from ingredients, of which not less than 50 per cent, of weight consisted of pig iron made in Canada. Secondly, there was a bounty of three dollars a ton on puddled-iron bars made from Canadian pig iron ; and thirdly, a bounty on pig iron -the e dollars a ton on the proportion produced from Canadian ore, and two dollars a ton on the proportion produced from foreign ore. I find, further, that the Act passed in 1898 provided that the bounties were to bein force from April, 1897, until April, 1907 a period of ten years. In the Bill under discussion, so far as iron and steel are concerned, the Government limit the period to five years. In Canada, under the Act, the ful l rate is paid for five years, but diminishes in the succeeding five years; that is to say, 90 per cent, is paid in 1902 ; 75 per cent, in 1903 ; 55 per cent in 1904-5 ; and so on until 20 per cent, is reached in 1907. The annual consumption in Canada of steel and iron products has been from 800,000 tons to 820,000 tons, or rather more than has been consumed in the Commonwealth of Australia. In my opinion",27,Second Reading

In 1900 the bounties | paid in Canada were as follows :-238,29 0 | dollars on pig iron ; 61,000 odd dollars on steel ingots; and over 10,000 dollars on puddled bars. I have already stated that I could obtain no definite information in reference to the United States, but we know that in tliat country there are bonuses, and also a protective policy. The honourable member for South Australia, Mr of coal would be needed to manufacture the Glynn, endeavoured in vain to show that development in England has been equal to that of the United States. But we find that in 1S79 the world's production of pig iron amounted to 15,865,000 odd tons, of which the United Kingdom produced 6,714,000 odd tons, and the United States only a trifle over 3,000,000 tons. Twenty years later, in 1899, the world's production had increased to the enormous quantity of 40,000,000 tons, of which the United Kingdom produced over 10,500,000 tons,and theUnitedStatesabout 15,250,000. It will be seen that in 1S79 Great Britain produced more than double that of the United States, and twenty years later produced one-third less : and the position in England to-day is worse than when these statistics were prepared. Whether protection takes the form of Customs duties or direct assistance, we have here the object lesson of the United States. ber not think that royalties have a lot to do with the position 1 sponsible, let us have royalties here. ber arguing for ? favour of assisting the industry here. The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, seemed to be doubtful about the supply of iron ore within the Commonwealth. I have no figures before me in regard to that matter, but I understand that it is beyond controversy that we have an ample supply. Australia has been importing, in addition to over a million of pounds worth of hardware and ironmongery, nearly £7,000,000 worth, or from 600,000 to 700,000 tons, of iron and steel manufactures. No sensible person would assume that if we established iron works within the .Commonwealth they would immediately capture the whole trade of Australia, because no doubt there are could not compete; but surely it is reasonable to assume that we might manufacture locally 400,000 tons of iron 1 The manufacture of that quantity of iron would mean the conversion of 1,000,000 tons of ore into 450,000 tons of pig iron. On the basis of a ton of coal to each ton of iron ore, 1,000,000 tons of coal would be consumed in that process, and another 1,000,000 tons pig iron into iron and steel. Furthermore, nearly 200,000 tons of limestone would be required for the purpose of fluxing, and other materials would also be required. Fully 4,000 men would be employed in the production of pig iron and in the manufacture of iron and steel, while the number of those engaged in dependent trades would be in the ratio of twenty to one, making the number of persons immediately dependent upon the iron industry 80,000 men. If we allow a family of three for each worker, we get a total of 320,000, and the wives and families of the various tradespeople dependent upon the industry would represent another 300,000 people : so that altogether, directly and indirectly, the industry would support 020,000 people. Of course these figures are only an approximate estimate, but I believe that they are quite within the mark. To make them still more so, I will put down the number of persons who would be supported by the industry as 500,000, and as trade expanded the number would, of course, increase. Mr Jamieson, the chairman of the Blyth Biver Companya gentleman whom I have known for many j'ears, and upon whose statements I would place implicit reliance-say s that there were imported into Australia, in 1899, steel rails, rolled iion and steel, steel sheets and wire, amounting to 247,475 -tons. He estimates the amount of ore required to supply the demands of Australia at 614,000 tons, from which he thinks 307,000 tons of pig iron could be produced, while the coal required would amount to 900,000 tons, which is a little below my estimate. Furthermore, he considers that the establishment of the industry would immediately provide work for 3,000 men, and that later on it would give work to at least 5.000 men. In explanation of the slight discrepancy between his figures and mine,",28,Second Reading

80,Mr Sawers,"I am arguing inI would point out that he has excluded iron and steel requirements, such as engines, galvanized iron, tinned plates, ifcc. Is it, or is it not, to the advantage of Australia that this great industry should be established here ? Is it worth our while to pass a Bill to make an experiment which will so largely increase the population of this country ? This increase of population would mean a great deal to our farmers and traders, because it would so greatly increase their home market. No other classes would benefit more than they would if 500,000 people were added to our population. more, the establishment of the iron industiy here would make us independent side supplies, which is a matter of great importance, especially in time of war. Is this experiment worth the expenditure of the sum which the Government wish us to vote ? I say emphatically that it is. The honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has talked of the undertaking as a risk ; but as all we do is to offer money for the purpose. That being so, it bonuses upon the iron actually produced, we run no risk at all. The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr not yet ready to deal with this big quesGlynn, wanted to know how we can expect to compete in the production of iron and steel with the manufacturers of other parts of the world. That is not a question for us to consider. If investors are willing to subscribe £1,000,000 for carrying on an enterprise of this kind, they must be supposed to know their own business, and the risk is theirs, not ours. It appeared to me to be a very weak argument of the honourable member for South Sydney to say that the Commonwealth is not able to find tlie small sum required, the expenditure of which is to be distributed over some years. I justify my support of the Bill as a protectionist. idea of protection is the encouragement of native industries in a discriminating way. It is not necessary for the Commonwealth to encourage every pettifogging but the Bill provides an opportunity for those who wish to encourage a great national enterprise to do so. can be encouraged in two ways-by the imposition of import duties, and by the granting of bonuses. ""Whether honourable members support one or the other, they are supporting protection. for Trade and Customs does not like me to say this, because in his speech he told the free-trade members of the House that the principles of the Bill are not antagonistic to Mr Sawers. the principles of free-trade. Of course, every man understands his own principles. I know what mine are, and I am delighted to have an opportunity to support in this national Parliament a statesmanlike proposal of this kind. there are extreme socialists who think that, if they were given ful l power, they could, within a year, make the social system run smoothly, and cause every one to be .happy and prosperous. In the same way the Government seem to think that they can make every Furtherone in the Commonwealth rich, prosperous, and happy. I do not, however, see any of outneed to rush into enterprises of this kind before we know what we are undertaking, and where we are to get the necessary money. The other day we were told that the Government had not sufficient money to build new post-offices, to make telephone extensions, and to carry out other necessary works, and that they must borrow the seems to me that, quite apart from our views upon the principle of bonuses, we are tion. I agree with the honourable member for New England that it is desirable to largely increase our population in the way he has shown, but in my opinion, instead of voting £300,000 to assist monopolists to establish the iron industry, the Commonwealth should start the industry for itself. It has been asserted by some of the legal members of the House that the Constitution does not empower us to do that. I would point out, however, that we have admittedly power to build post-offices and to construct other public works. In carrying out such My works we use building materials of various kinds, and it has not been held that we cannot produce those materials for ourselves-that we cannot fell the trees, industry; and cut up the timber that we require for joists and boards. Why, then, should we not smelt the ore and Industries make the iron girders that we require? If we can use iron girders we are entitled to pioduce the iron from which they are made.

But according to some honourable members we are to continue to be at bhe mercy of a number of contractors. There is no doubt in my mind that we are perfectly entitled to enter upon this industry if we can see that it will be to our advantage to do so. It may be argued that we cannot manufacture iron and dispose of it to others, but surely we should be entitled labion wibh regard to industrial arbitration. to supply the requirements of the States, which are exceedingly large so far as iron is concerned ? If we can supply the States, who are dependent on the same taxpayers as ourselves, what is to prevent us from selling our material to individuals within the' Commonwealbh ? The honourable and learned member for Soubh Australia, Mr the discussion has been strongly in favour Glynn, claimed thab we could nob advance money bo any of .bhe States Governments to enable them bo enter upon this enterprise. Section 96 of the Constibubion plainly sebs forth bhab we may granb financial assistance bo any Sbabe on such berms and conditions as we may bhink fib. This gives us very wide powers. It may be urged that what was in bhe minds of bhe framers of bhe Constitution was bhe assisbance of Sbabes which mighb run sborb of funds. If a Sbate Government should decide bo embark a large amount of capibal in bhe esbablishmenb of iron works, bhey would probably soon be shorb of money -as a consequence, ancl I claim bhab we should be clearly enbibled under bhe berms of bhe Consbibubion bo advance money bo bhat Sbate under such conditions as we might bhink fib. I would remind Ministers of the general bendency on bhe parb of Sbates and municipalities to conduct large underbakings of a public characber hibherto carried on by private enterprise. This course has been followed wibh great success iu many parts of the world, and I deny that State enterprises of bhis kind have been a failure.

It has been asserted by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that if we were to offer bonuses we should impose .certain labour conditions as bo working hours and wages; bub ib has been held by many legal aubhorities thab the Commonwealth has no power to legislate with regard to labour conditions.

Personally, I have no doubt as to the power of the Government to do everything that may be required to make the development of the iron industry a Commonwealth enterprise. The general tone of of the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland, which provides a method of securing a great deal of information. The honourable and learned member for Soubh Ausbralia, Mr Glynn, considers that a select committee will not be entitled to deal with all the questions upon which information is desired, but there is no reason why they should not give a very wide scope to their inquiries, and obtain information with regard bo indusbrial underbakings generally. We do nob \'et know what our revenue will amount to. We are told that there will be a surplus, but that this will be required to help the poorer Sbates. If bhis is so, we are nob yeb in a position bo offer bonuses bo private companies. The feeling in favour of State control of large enterprises is very strong, particularly in tlie States of New South Wales and. Queensland, and I should not be surprised to find the movement in favour of establishing national iron works in New South Wales take practical shape at any time. The proposal made in that Stabe some bime ago bo enter into an arrangement with a private company was strongly opposed, and the general feeling was in favour of making bhe production of iron a State monopoly. The New SouthI do not Wales Government have already started to manufacture clothing for State purposes, and the esbablishmenb of Sbabe work-shops will be widely extended within a very short time. In Queensland, also, the trend of public opinion is in the same direction, and bhis will find more adequabe expression as soon as a good Electoral Act comes into operation in that State.

If the iron industry were established by a private company, it would partake of the nature of a monopoly, because a large amount of capital would have to be embarked in it . The mere production of pig iron would be only one future of the enterprise. enormous capital required to engage in this enterprise with any prospect of success, and having in view the considerable risk incurred, it is not likely that sensible business men will attempt to establish the industry unless the market of the Commonwealth is conserved to them. If a select'com'mittee were appointed to inquire into the question, it might possibly be found that one of the States is prepared to nationalize the industry. I am satisfied that if we leave the production of iron to private enterprise our action will result in the establishment of a monopoly, and all monopolies are bad. I shall never be found voting the money of the taxpayers for the "" boosting"" of a private firm-to enable it to pay enormous dividends. I say nothing about the bonus principle ; probably it is better than the system of continuous taxation which is known as protection. Unquestionably, an industiy of this kind could be managed as well by the Commonwealth as by a private company. The Government can secure the requisite brains to supervise the undertaking, and can obtain the necessary money to invest in the most up-to-date machinery at a lower rate than can any private company. Therefore, it should be able to supply the material at a reduced price. The honourable member for New England triumphantly quoted the increase which' occurred in the output of iron in America during a period of 20 years, as against the increase in the production of England. He evidently thinks that the mere quotation of these figures is in itself sufficient to prove that that increase is wholly due to the operation of the bonus system, despite the fact that he previously told us that he could not ascertain that any bonus had been paid in America. But I would point out that the growth of population in America during the period mentioned is of itself sufficient to account for tlie increased production. That development is a perfectly natural one. 30,000,000 people, she anv iron. would be an extraordinary thing if amongst a go-head people like the Americans its production did not increase. It is well known that England in the commercial world does not enjoy that supremacy which she formerly held. That'is natural enough. Why should a progressive country like Seeing the America with all her resources not take up some of the work which was formerly done by England1 The same remark is applicable to Germany. In some lines of manufactures, however, notably in cutlery, England still maintains her superiority. America cannot produce cutlery equal to that manufactured at Sheffield. That, however, is by the way. The one factor which has very much retarded the development of the iron industry in England is the enormous royalties which are paid to the private owners of land. Upon coal and iron these royalties are so enormous that they have materially increased the cost of the production of iron and steel. The royalty paid upon the coal which carries an ocean liner to America exceeds the wages paid to its captain and crew. In America, where freer conditions obtain, the national character would have been entirely belied if the iron industiy had not developed extensively of recent years. In Australia, we have an abundance of coal and iron, and it would be a disgrace if we did not control the utilization of those commodities. I strongly urge the House to adopt the amendment of the honourable member for Bland. There is no need for hurry in connection with this matter, and the appointment of a select committee would place us in possession of the fullest possible information. If we pass this measure, any State which may desire to 'nationalize the industry 'will, be severely handicapped. I trust that the House will defer the consideration of this measure until next session, and will not attempt to regulate all the affairs of the universe in the first twelve months of its sittings, as the Government are endeavouring to do. I am rather sorry that the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is not present, because I understood from his remarks that he sympathized with the amendment, and was generally favorable to the establishment of ironworks by the Commonwealth ; but that because of a conproduced scarcely stitutional difficulty which he foresees, he thinks it wise not to support that proposal.",31,Second Reading

86,Mr Batchelo R (South Australia),"I regret that he has adopted that view, because if he has any sympathy with the amendment, he would be better advised if he supported it . The fact that we have not the constitutional power to establish ironworks is admitted. A t any rate we cannot declare tliat the Commonwealth has power to establish such works. But I would point out that only a few weeks ago the honourable and learned member himself proposed that inquiries should be instituted amongst the State Premiers with a view to ascertaining whether the Commonwealth should engage in factory legislation. To my mind that is precisely a parallel case. The proposal of the honourable member for Bland is that inquiry should be made regarding the advisableness of establishing national ironworks, and yet the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne objects to the adoption of that course, upon tlie ground that we have not the constitutional power to establish such works, at once. I hold that the people are the arbiters in. this matter, and surely the Constitution can be altered if that course is deemed necessary. I hope that we are not going to remain ""cribbed, cabined, and confined ""-boun d hand and foot-by the Constitution. The sooner we inquire whether ironworks should not be established by some State or by the Commonwealth suggests that we should inquire whether some of the States ought not to undertake this work. Would not that be a peculiar position for the Federal Government to place itself in ? cumstances. The Government propose to establish the iron industry in some form or other. As custodians to the public interest, we have to consider whether it is good enough to allow the iron industry to be established under the control of a few individuals? or whether it would not be better for the States to undertake it. AVe are fairly entitled to ask honourable members to consent to an inquiry as to .the possibility or practicability of the States taking that course. prefer to make the inquiry themselves ? The bonus will go to the States which establish the industry. no objection to the States making the inquiry themselves. The Commonwealth can only inquire generally for the whole of the States, 3SN who may possibly be rivals in this matter. The question was raised by the. honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne whether the Commonwealth has power to take up factory legislation ; and the objection suggested would apply equally to the matter of inviting an inquiry. The honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, agreed with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne in the belief that it would be straining the Constitution to give anything in the shape of a bonus to the States-tliat . it would be a breach of the spirit of the Constitution. But surely it would be no greater breach of the Constitution to give a bonus to a State than to give it to some syndicate? There are a great many advantages connected with the proposal of the honorable member for Bland as compared, with the proposal of the Government, thelatter of which is to lose enpay out of tlierevenue £250,000 in order to develop theiron industry. Of course, I know that if the enterprise be successful the money will not be lost; but, in the meantime, it is taken out of the revenue. If the iron industry be successful under the proposed bonus, it must mean a monopoly. More than three or four companies will not begin operations, and in these days of easy combination, it is not reasonable to suppose they will damage the interests of one another by competition. Even a dozen companies could come to an arrangement with the greatest ease, and we may look forward to the establishment of> only one company, or a very early combination. The recent shipping combination presented gigantic difficulties as compared with, those attending the combination of a few iron-works If there be a monopoly, as.. there undoubtedly will, it will control the iron supply in Australia, and thus largelydominate our railway systems. To give intothe hands of any private company the power of fixing the prices at which the States may Jay down railways, would, in my opinion, be a most dangerous proceeding, which would have an important ancl lasting effect on the railway policy of Australia. The Government propose to bottlefeed the iron industry in its infancy, and coddle it in its childhood, and the great danger is that in manhood it will prove a monster of tyranny.

In my opinion it would have been better tokeep back the Bill until after the Tariff had been dealt with. In regard to the constitutional power of the Commonwealth to undertake an enterprise of this kind, I would point out that a year or two ago it would have been unconstitutional for this Parliament to assemble and pass legislation. Since then, however, the Commonwealth Constitution has been assented to. Isi t to be supposed that that Constitution will never be altered ? able member think it would take to bring about an alteration of the Constitution which would enable the Commonwealth to manufacture iron 1 like to see the iron industiy established tomorrow, it would be better to have its establishment deferred for two, three, or five years than to allow the control of our iron deposits to pass into the hands of private syndicates. If the delay that would be caused is the only objection which the Minister sees to making this a Commonwealth enterprise, he should encourage the growth of public opinion in favour of an amendment of the Constitution which would allow it to be done, or would allow the States to do it with the assistance of the Commonwealth.

The question is, can we, under the powers gi'anted to us by the Constitution, set up in business as iron manufacturers. In the first place, I am perfecbly sure bhab when bhe Constitution was framed, it was never contemplated by the people to confer upon the Government the power to establish industries for the manufacture of iron or other producbs. Certainly under section SI the only power we have is to appropriate. money for the purposes of the Commonwealth, in the manner and subject to the charges and liabilities imposed by the Constitution.

Groom. report advocating the establishment of a national bank. The question had been discussed in the Convention, but no power had been given to creabe a bank. Hamilton set up the doctrine of implied powers, and urged that, although no express power was given by the Constitution, the establishment of a national bank was one of bhe incidental matters arising out of the powers conferred by the Constitution. The American Constibution contained a provision similar to our own, giving "" power to make all laws which are necessary and proper to carry into effect the powers"" granted by Congress for the Government of bhe United States. It was held thab under bhe Constitution there was power to bring inbo exisbence a national bank, because that power was incidental to their legislative functions relating to the borrowing of money, taxation, and such powers. The poinb which I desire to emphasize is that we can only incidentally create a manufacturing industry if it is for the purpose of carrying out some of the express powers conferred by the Constitution ibself. small-arms factory ? MrL . E. GROOM I am comiug to thab poinb. Ib is seb oub in Storey's book, The Constitution of the United States, that if you have the power to make war, you can exercise all the powers proper and necessary to bhe carrying on of war, and bhab, therefore, incidentally, the United States Government had the right to create arsenals, clocks, and so on. That is just the position I am putting here. Can we, by any means, bring the proposed iron-works within the scope of sub-section (39) of section 51 by showing that the power to establish iron works is incidental to the express powers conferred by the Constitution. In a tion for the United Stabes, the question was raised whether bhe Government could start confers a University. A special report was presented, in which it was pointed out, among other reasons, thab although there was no special power to establish a University, the power to establish it might be regarded as Then bhe question incidental to powers expressly granted under bhe Consbibubion, inasmuch as a University could be used as a means of training civil servants.

109,Mr Watkins,"Could we nob establish athe Commonwealth itself should .establish an iron industry, I regret to say that so far as I can understand our Constitution I incline to the opinion that we have nob the power to give ""effect to such a proposition. The idea is not to establish an industry as an act incidental to the exercise of the powers given under the Constitution. We are not asked to establish a factory to manufacture guns or material for defence purposes, but to carry on general iron works which would embrace all the various articles of manufacture referred to in the schedule. The establishment of a general iron works could not be regarded as merely incidental to the exercise of the powers mentioned in the Constitution. With regard to the Bill itself, I do not think that there is any straining of the Constitution in the way suggested by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn. Under section 99 of the Constitution it is provided thatThe Commonwealth shall not by any law or .regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to any one State or part thereof over another State or any part thereof. A t the same time' we are distinctly authorized by subsection (3) of section 51 to legislate with respect to bounties on the production oi* export of goods, but so that such bounties shall be uniform throughout the Commonwealth. honourable and learned member. 1 was replying to an interjection with regard to a special grant to a particular' State.

GBOOM' I agree with the honourable member for Bland that this Bill should be so framed as to give the States Governments' an opportunity to take advantage of any bonus which may be offered . if they should see fit to establish theindustry. Assuming tliat the Commonwealth were to take over this industiy, we should be placed in a very awkward position. The question would arise whether the Commonwealth -Government should comply with the States laws relating to mining, to the employment of labour, and to taxation in connection with mining. Then, again, what position would . be occupied by the jDersons employed by the Commonwealth Government in carrying on such ironworks 1 Would they come under the jurisdiction of States laws as general employees, or would they be regarded aspublic servants of the Commonwealth 1 The Bill should be framed in such a way as to give tlie States Governments a chance to benefit by its provisions. I understand that the Minister agrees to this. Governments can take advantage of the bonus. MrL . E. GROOM -The Bill would have to be amended, because the term ""persons"" does not include the States Governments. It has been suggested by the honourable member for Bland that we should ascertain from the States the extent to which they are willing that we should ' take up this manufacture, but as far as we can gather from the attitude taken up by the various State Parliaments, there is a tendency on their part to stand by the Constitution, and not to allow any addition to their powers by. the Commonwealth. They clearly have power to engage in industrial enterprise for themselves, and they have already exercised it in some cases. The honourable and learned member for South Australia pointed out that if we were to grant bonuses to the iron industry, we should have claims made upon us for bounties by those engaged in other undertakings. That constitutes no objection in my eyes. I look upon the system of granting bonuses as part of the policy of protection, and I should be disI quite agree with the appointed to learn that the Government intended to apply the bonus system to the iron industiy only. I regard the present proposal as the first instalment of.a policy which will be largely extended, and I hope that the Government will not forget the agricultural producers of the Commonwealth, who have as strong a claim to encouragement as have any section of the community. I understand from the honourable member for Bland that it is his desire that the committee should' report upon the constitutional question, but it seems to me that the honourable member is asking the committee to take upon themselves the functions of a High Court. The only way in which the House can be advised upon the constitutional aspect of the matter is by obtaining the opinion of the Attorney-General.

That provision seems to indicate that it is desirable to encourage industries in the States, and surely it is not an unnatural deduction to draw, that we may therefore manufacture ourselves instead of giving bounties to encourage production. The honourable and learned member for Darling Downs wished to know whether the Commonwealth would be subject to mining regulations if it engaged in mining, or to factory laws if it engaged in manufactures. I did not understand that the State had less power than the individual, and unless it can be pointed out that our powers are restricted in any direction, I apprehend that the Federal Government has the same powers-excep t they be residuary in the States-that are possessed by the individual, and, therefore, we may engage in manufacture. Anyhow, it is for those who deny that the amendment comes within the scope of the Constitution to prove their contention. Since there is no court to decide the matter, unless we appeal, to the Supreme Court of one of the States, it is clearly for the House to determine whether or not the amendment comes within the scope of the Constitution. If a point of order had been taken by tlie Minister for Trade and Customsi t would have been for Mr Speaker to say whether the proposal of the honourable member for Bland was outside the scope of the Constitution or not ; but until that point is taken, I apprehend that the House will be the arbiter. For my own part I decline toaccept the deduction of the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs that our powers are circumscribed to the extent that he wishes us to believe. It appears to me that under sub-section (34) of section 51 we have the power to construct railways under certain circumstances. Therefore I believe we may very readily say tliat the proposal to appoint a select committee to consider this question is in order, and comes within the scope of the Constitution. Furthermore, section 96 of the Constitution providesDuring a period of ten years after the establishpurchase the plant necessary for the efficient ment of the Commonwealth and thereafter until tlie Parliament otherwise provides, the Parliament may grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit. If it were decided that the Commonwealth as such had no power to institute the manufacture of iron, it is very clear that we could give such assistance for that purpose as would enable each or any State to undertake the enterprise. If New South Wales, for instance, having an abundance of iron ore, desired to establish the iron industry and applied to us to make good any deficit, or for any other assistance, we could undoubtedly lend the money. It appears, first, that, under section 51, the Commonwealth has powers which are incidental to those expressly vested in the Commonwealth, and, under section 96, may assist any State. What is tlie alternative T' This Bill is a measure for the encouragement of manufactures, and it has to operate for five years. The whole object is to encourage the mining and manufacture of iron from the native ore; and, as I have already said, the scheme appears to me to be largely chimerical. I do not suppose that there is any serious intention that the measure should be effective, or otherwise its operation would not have been limited to five years. It is practically an impossibility to establish an industry of such dimensions within a less period than three years, when there would be an assurance of only two years' benefit under the B ill ; and no syndicate of capitalists would invest their money on a security so slight. There are other reasons why the State should control this enterprise. In the first place we are every day advancing to a more steady appreciation of the fact that the rights of labour form so serious a factor in the establishment of an industry that, they are not likely to be neglected by any investors of capital. These rights are fairly sufficiently safeguarded in Australia by manhood suffrage. It does not appear to me, seeing the trend of industrial movements here and elsewhere-bu t particularly elsewhere-that there is any third course between control by a trust and control by the people. The establishment of an industry of so gigantic a character by an individual is out of the question; it must be by 'a syndicate, who would have a monopoly. There can be no competition, for the simple reason that the investment of a sufficient amount of money to production of iron can be repaid only by complete control of the markets of the Commonwealth. Possibly the Government may contemplate the establishment of rival works and the development of healthy coinpetition ; but, as a matter of fact, no second body of men would dream of investing the necessary capital, if one firm were doubt result in a report of a very useful already in the field. We are, therefore, and interesting character. face to face with the fact that we must create a monopoly of some kind, either by the another exemplification of the way in which State or by a trust. machinations of trusts in America are to adopt for their text the words"" Unto hardly likely to inspire the people of Auseveiy one that hath shall be given, and he tralia with any degree of admiration. shall have abundance; but from him that Every day we see those trusts -enmeshing all the minor industries, -within our own lifetime, I have no doubt come forward with a sum ranging from that we shall see the whole of the industries £750,000 to £1,000,000, the Ministers rush -of the great sister Commonwealth in the round and try to discover some means of hands of a few individuals, whose numbers extracting money from the pockets of the may be counted on one hand. tralia there is still greater room for the view.

We have no doubt that iron can be smelted from the ore here, and there is no reason why the man who is engaged in delving for gold should not receive as much encouragement as the State is willing to after to those who are engaged in iron production. We know that iron can be smelted, and the question as to whether our deposits are of value to us is dependent entirely upon the expense involved in converting the ore into a marketable commodity, and the relation which such expense bears to the ultimate value of the product. What right have Ministers to guarantee to those who engage in the production of iron that they shall make no loss upon their operations? The Ministers, as the guardians of the public purse, have no right to withdraw money from the whole of the people of the Commonwealth and hand it over to one or two individuals. come along and say that they have a million of money to invest, but will not make use of it unless we give them £250,000 out of the public exchequer, the Government propose to collect the sixpences and shillings of the people, many of whom have not 5s. to call their own, and hand it over to those who are already wellto-do. [House counted.] The Government have no right to ask us to consider this Bill until the Tariff has been passed, because all our labour in connection with this proposal may be brought to nought by an amendment of the Tariff Bill. If this' matter is of such importance as the Minister for Trade and Customs seems to think, it should not have been brought forward at this stage of the session, when honourable members are in no fit state to consider it . I am pleased that an alteration is to be made in the form of the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Bland. The select committee to be appointed will be asked to hold an inquiry, and to consider the evidence given for and against the Bill, and, in addition, it is proposed that they shall be asked also to report upon the advisableness of establishing the iron industry, either under the control of the individual States or of the Commonwealth, and a great deal of valuable evidence may in that way be brought before us. I think it was the honourable member for Parramatta who, when Minister of Mines in New South Wales, obtained a very valuable report from the geological surveyor of the department in reference to a great many matters which. ought certainly to be put before us. We know that there are deposits of iron ore all over Australia; but the question is whether they consist of large bodies containing sufficiently pure ore to enable the manufacture' of iron to be carried on at anything like reasonable rates. No one would contend for instance, that if 100,000 tons of pig-iron were produced at a loss of 10s. per ton, it would be a good thing for us to increase the output by 1,000,000 tons. Little as the Ministry are acquainted with the principles of political economy, I do not know that they would carry their doctrines as far as that. They betray an indifference in dealing with the public funds, but if they were expending their own money, they would not dream of putting it out at a loss. If they were growing f r u it for example, at a cost of £-5 per acre, and Because certain individuals obtaining a return of only £ 4 per acre, they would not perform that peculiar feat in arithmetic for which the honourable member for Melbourne Ports is particularly famous. They would not say, "" £ 5 is the cost of production, and we get back £ 4 , therefore,£ 5 and £ 4 make £ 9 . "" Yeti t was a very long time before we were able to explain to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, that any one who adopted that system would very soon become bankrupt. If the Minister for Trade and Customs paid £ 1 in mining calls, and received a return of 10s., he would say it was nonsense if he were told by some of his protectionist friends that he was thus better off to the extent of 30s. He would consider that he had lost 10s., aud that the whole community had lost by the transaction, because the money would have given employment, year after year, if spent upon a productive undertaking. We know, however, that that principle is sometimes followed with other men's money, and that those men prosper least who are most regardless of that insidious protection which the privileged classes, with the help of certain people, like the Minister for Trade and Customs, are generally so ready to bestow. This Bill"" is simply protection in another form : the only difference is that the money proposed to be paid away will come from the whole community, and therefore will not be so much of a class tax as are certain other taxes. When the great bulk of the people understand whab the proposal means they will ask why bhey should be called upon to contribute to an industry carried on by a certain man, when that man does not contribute to their undertakings. tributed very largely towards gold and copper mining, but the Government have never offered to reimburse me, although surely I am as much entitled to consideration as any one else. There is no reason why they should not give me the right to collect from the people £300,000 this year, and a further £300,000 next year; for, according to their doctrine, I would spend all that money in the country, and give employment to the people. The real point is tliat not one of us has a right to call upon the people to contribute by us from which they derive no benefit. They, will derive no benefit these industries, are productive, the profits will go into tlie pockets of those interested in them. There is no more risk in iron-mining than there is in gold-mining; whether the risk is so great. If we take into consideration the element of chance and the attractiveness of gold-mining, we shall find that as a rule more money is spent on labour connected with the production of gold than in any other branch of the mining industry. a good tiling, but I contend that every penny which is spent unproductively is a loss to the community. cently tliat we learned that the Ministry carried tlieir doctrine so far as to say that what is one man's loss is another man's gain. That is a false and pernicious doctrine, under which nations and people have suffered. We know that tlie true doctrine is that one man's loss is every man's loss. We realize that the loss now being suffered by the pastoralists in New South Wales and Queensland is a loss to the whole community, members see that if a community produces a thing at a cost of £1 which is worth only ISs., there is an absolute loss of 2s. ? It is true that in this case men will not readily perceive that fact, because the money will be spent over a large area; but it is none the less an economic fact. Let me give an illustration limited capacity of the Ministry to understand : If a small municipality raised a sum of money from each of tlie ratepayers, and proposed to impose a permanent tax for the purpose of keeping an unproductive industry going, the people who were engaged in Mr Conroy productive work there would veiy soon say, ""We camiot keep this unproductive work I have congoing."" The principle in this case is the same. Why should the whole community be asked to keep going what may be an unproductive work? If it is unproductive, the less the community have to do with it the better it will be. If it is productive, these large sums of money which it is proposed to expend upon it will not be returned to the people. The Minister of Trade and Customs will say, ""We havedrawnthatmoney from the whole community, and handed it direct to the manufacturers. Now we will go still, further, and if we are successful in to industries carried on getting other proposals finally accepted by Parliament, under the disguise of protection, from we will make a particular class continue because even if they to contribute to these industries."" The difference between the bonus system and protection is in name only. A bonus is a sum contributed by the whole of the community, indeed I doubt and in that sense it is less objectionable than protection, because every one can see what is being done; but under the protective system a sum of money is taken from the particular class which happens to use the article taxed. \House counted?] If this Bil is carried, the money proposed to be expended I do not say that it is altogether under it can come only from the producing classes of the community. But they have already a sufficient burden upon them. If It was only rewe go on increasing taxation year after year men will find it impossible to obtain employment, as people will not go in for production if taxation is made to press so-heavily upon them. The moment that taxation exceeds a certain limit the people will relinquish the struggle in which they have been engaged, and go elsewhere. We could i not have a better example of that than is provided b)' the State of Victoria, where taxation has pressed so heavily and why cannot honourable upon the people that-they have left the country. If we continue to exact large sums of money from tlie taxpayers, the time must come when they will be unable to endure tlie pressure. The Government ask the House to Vote £300,000 to assist in the development of the iron industry. Why do they not give that money to the which may be within the farmers of the country, who have lost their crops and stock as the result of drought ? If they adopted that course, increased wealth to the community would result. But no. They say to the poorer classes of the community"" Hard up as you may be, we intend to collect another £300,000 from you and hand it over to some one else."" Assuming that the consumption of iron in Australia is 500,000 tons annually, and that there is a loss of 10s. per ton upon its production, the community will he called upon to contribute £250,000 a year in this connection. That loss has to be borne by those engaged in the production of wealth, and yet we are told that under the operation of the bonus system additional Wealth will be created. I object to this Bill upon the ground that we have no right to guarantee to any man a return upon his capital. We cannot guarantee to the workman that he will continue in health and find constant employment. Why, then, should we guarantee to one or two syndicates a return upon their capital ? If the Ministry are anxious to disburse money it should be in the direction of assisting the great mass of the people who are unable to help themselves. But the policy of the Government is to grease the fatted Pig£1,200,000 in order to provide the amount which they ask for. system which compels us to collect all the. revenue we require through the Customs house, we shall have to exact £1,200,000 from the taxpayers before we can obtain the £300,000 which .the Government propose to disburse under this Bill. If the Commonwealth is already spending all that it is entitled to draw before it does, unless great care is exercised. A Loan Bill for £1,000,000 has already been introduced to the notice of the House. When will the people secure relief from taxation? I believe that that result can be brought about only by a change of Ministry. Until we get a body of men who understand that they are tlie guardians of the public purse there can be no sound administration. Surelyi t will not be argued that, because iron will probably command a high price in the near future, wages will also be high ? In this connection Thorold Bogers saysHigh prices do not raise wages. Those who assert tliat they do or will, speak either ignorautly or dishonestly. No doubt the Ministry will call that by the aid of Congress, the members of "" theory,"" quite forgetful that theory which entirely failed to do their duty is bhe explanation of the relationm ship Avhich facts bear to one another. In any system of raising revenue, it is the great mass of the people who have to contribute, as is shown by the fact that it is never suggested to levy duties on articles which are not iri general use. The Treasurer cannot be blamed for that; but my objection is to the poorer classes. being made the victims year after year. A t the very outset of the Commonwealth, we are met with this call for £300,000 ; and I am sure that it will not be denied that the suffering farmers of the country have just as much claim to a bonus as have two or three individuals. The Government do not apply these bonuses merely to industries which have to be established, but also to industries which have for some time been carried on at a profit. It is true that a very large quantity of galvanized iron is not made here, but the iact remains that the industry is in existence; and, as for wire netting, that has been produced in New South Wales for seventeen years, for a greater part of the time without any duty, and certainly without any bonus. Iron and steel tubes and pipes are also made in the Commonwealth. The Bill simply means handing over a certain sum of money at once to a number of men who are fortunate enough to be first in the industries I have mentioned. The honourable member for New England, after some extraordinary calculations by a mathematical process known only to himself, has said that about 600,000 people will be employed in consequence of the establishment of the iron industry, but he would have been as near the truth if he had made the number 6,000,000. The real idea of the Government is to collect money from 600.000, and distribute it amongst half-a-dozen. The honourable member for New England said not one word about the great mass of the people who have to contribute this money, nor did he suggest tliat bonuses should be given to men who have suffered greatly in other branches of industry. There is no doubt that the profits from the manufacturer of iron are infinitely greater than those enjoyed by any farmer. the steel trust was 18 per cent. serves, was wrung out of the people",40,Second Reading

But, if the Commonwealth is going to help this particular class of inmanufacturers dividuals, we must exercise the right of controlling them in their works. As a body of men, we are, as a rule, ignorant of the facts in relation to the great trades and commerce generally, but transcending the mere reaper it is too late now for any man to say that he is against the interference of the State in any industry, because circumstances are too much for him.

We often speak as if all advanced legislation was to be found only on this side of the globe, but in England there is an amount of genuine solid legislation on some of these subjects which perfectly astounds one. There the Government control a clothing factory for the manufacture of clothes worn by I should the Government officials, and the factory seems to be working uncommonly well. They leave the management of it to trusted officials and there is no political interference. That portion of the proposal of the honourable"" I have the member for Bland which provides for an inquiry into the whole question might well be supported. Even honourable members who are opposed to the Bill can vote for that. I do not suppose that any honourable member will go so far as to condemn all control by the Government. Of course, it may be argued that, as a rule, enterprise cannot be managed so well by the State as-, it <ean by private individuals. In thousands of cases that is absolutely true. But there is no reason why the State should not obtain the services of men to conduct enterprises for it, so long as it exercises control over them. The advantage of such a system has been evidenced in connection with the management of the New South Wales railways. Those railways, when managed by the Government, were not a financial success, but immediately the management was intrusted to commissioners who were qualified and skilled men, under the control of the Government, they became reproductive, though the Government of course still exercises control. Why do not honourable members act upon the principle that we are all interested in the production of wealth, and ought not to endeaveur to divert capital from its proper channel ? The Constitutional aspect of this question was referred to by the honourable and learned member for Darling Downs, who relied upon paragraph 3 of section 51 of the Constitution, which says that Parliament shall have power to make laws with respect toBounties On the production or export of goods, but so that such bounties shall be uniform throughmake me suspicious.

State control has in some instances proved advantageous, although it possesses eertain drawbacks, and until we know the particular industry in regard to which it is proposed to legislate, we cannot say offhand whether we are in favour of such a step being taken. the Constitution, to my mind, prevents the Commonwealth paying a bonus to a State; the Commonwealth itself must take control. Nor do I agree with the contention of the honourable member for Bland as to the powers conferred under section 96, which I think refers merely to general financial assistance. If an appeal were made to the Federal High Court, I do not Mr Conroy. thinki t would be 'held -that the section justifies the rendering of assistance such as is now proposed. I altogether object to the Bill, and shall vote against it . I shall support the amendment of the honourable member for Bland, the first part of which merely provides for an inquiry; and' it cannot be said that the facts are sufficiently before us at the present time. As to the second part of the amendment, no one can object to a report, because we must not prejudge the case. By recording my vote in favour of the amendment, I do not express my opinion that under all circumstances and conditions the Commonwealth or the States are to take everything under their control or management. There are many instances in which that should not be done. I support the amendment as a means of eliciting information to guide us in our decision. opinion it was a mistake on the part of the Minister for Trade and Customs, and also on the part of members sitting behind the Government, to introduce the word ""protection "" in connection with the proposed bonuses. As a revenue tariffist, when I hear the word "" protection "" it is liable to decided that I could not support these bonuses; but on taking into consideration the fact that the system has operated very What was contended was favourably in connection with the butter industry of Victoriai t seems to me possible that it might have similar results in reThat may seem merely a techgard to the iron industry. I was somewhat surprised by the fear which has been be observed; and under expressed by several honourable members that a monopoly will be created if we vote these bonuses. That fear, appeal's to me to be absurd, because if by any chance a monopoly were created, and prices unduly raised, it would be perfectly possible for the Federal Government to admit iron duty free, and at once bring the Syndicate or company into competition -with outside sources of supply. The honourable member for Section 51, sub-section 3, of South Sydney was inclined to support the Bill, but in the face of the fact that not even the Treasurer can tell what the revenue is likely to be during the next twelve months, he has some doubts as to the wisdom of taking that course.

If the Treasurer's Estimates are correct, there will be a certain surplus this year, and as prosperity returns with good seasons, the revenue will become more elastic. If the majority of honourable members believe that it is a good system to encourage industries by means of bonuses, there need be no delay from any fear of our not,being able to provide the money when required. There are immense bodies of ore in several parts of Australia, including Tasmania, and the smelting industry has already been tried. Nearly 20 years ago, something like £100,000 was invested in that industry in Tasmania, but. I am sorry to say that failure was the result. The ore which has been discovered since is totally different to that treated in Tasmania; but we cannot hope to induce men to embark in industries of the kind, unless there they are shown some reasonable prospects of success. I should never support any form of protection; but knowing tliat we are, comparatively speaking, a young country, with immense sources of wealth in a state of nature, which we have not sufficient capital ourselves to develop, and knowing that capital will flow from every part of the world if there is reasonable prospect of a profit, I am, as a taxpayer, prepared to make some sacrifice in ""the hope of benefiting the community as a whole. It seems to me that the bonus system is about the fairest that could be evolved with this object; and I am perfectly prepared, so far as the iron industry is concerned, to support the proposals of the Minister. I want it to be clearly understood, however, that if at the end of the term provided in the Bill, any further propusals for assistance are introduced, I shall, assist those engaged in that industry. The if a member of the House, oppose them. A fair and straightforward course for the Ministry to take would be to say that while they are prepared to give a syndicate assistance for so many years, in the shape of a bonus, they will not be prepared to continue that assistance any longer. To grant any extension would be neither more nor less than protection. On these terms I shall support the second reading; but while I shall vote for bonuses being excended to pig-iron, puddled bar-iron, and steel, I cannot see my way to give the assistance promised to the manufactures contemplated in classes 2 and 3 in the schedule. The spelter industry has already been established. Welsh workmen and experts have been introduced, and I see no reason why assistance should be rendered to those interested. also apply to the manufacture of iron 1 iron is being manufactured in any of the States. It was tried some years ago, and those interested, who were Australians, were ruined by the lamentable failure. Since then fresh vast deposits of iron ore have been discovered, and proved to be exceedingly rich and valuable; but .the first failure has prevented the investment of Australian capital. I know very little about galvanized iron, but I understand that its manufacture is carried on in Victoria at the present time, and as that commodity is at present the subject of a protective duty, which assists tlie industry to some extent, I am not prepared to extend any further assistance. In regard to wire netting, we know that a large factory has been in operation in Sydney for some years, and as the proprietors, Messrs. Lysaght Brothers, have acquired control of the whole of the markets of Australia, I fail to see why they should need any help. I am not prepared to give special support to industries which have already been successfully established, but the bonus system might, be extended to a number of enterprises which are not likely to be embarked upon unless some special encouragement is aflbrded. for instance. ture the iron plates necessary for use in ship-building we might offer a bonus to production of mineral oil is also a"" matter that should engage our attention.

However, by pubbing my views as temperately and briefly as possible, I hope to prove that the popular opinion regarding the right honourable gentleman is altogebher unjustified.

144,Mr Eowleb (Perth),"The condibeeii the ability to bring the raw materials together at a very low cost; and we have to consider the flux and coal as well as the iron. While I have no doubt that there is at least one company prepared to go on with the industry if the very munificent proposal of the Government is accepted by the House. I hope it will not bo established merely in one particular State. I do not see that Western Australia would derive any particular advantage from the expenditure of the money, say, in New South Wales, or even in Tasmania. lian point of view 1 Western Australian representative who considers the general interests of the Commonwealth: and if I can show that the Government proposal is neither to the interest of the general community nor to that of my own State, I go far to justify the vote I shall give. Either the conditions are favorable to the establishment of the iron industry at the present time, or they are not favorable; and if they are favorable I fail to see why a bonus is required. Wherever conditions exist which are likely to enable capital to be advantageously employed, there capital will go; we see that all the world over. One reason which has prevented Australia entering on this industry is, in my opinion, the fact that a very large consumption is necessary before investment of the capital required can be justified or undertaken. 1 doubt whether, even at the present time, the consumption of iron in Australia is sufficient to justify the expenditure necessary to establish the industry. Sir proved over and over again. We may have one company starting in a kind of way, but it would be nothing short of a calamity to Australia if the industry were attempted in any but the most up-todate and thorough-going manner. If the time is not suitable for the establishment of the industry, do the Government imagine tliat a bonus will overcome the difficulty? Supposing a temporary impetus were given to iron production, are the Government prepared to come down and ask'for still further assistance when tlie present bonus has been expended and further help is said to be necessary? I do not think it a temporary decline in England. would be safe for the Government to attempt any such course. If the in dustiy cannot be started without a bonus, it -is certain that a further sum of money will be required as soon as the term mentioned in the Bill has expired. It takes a considerable number of years to establish an industry of this magnitude in the proper way ; it is not a case in which a man may commence operations today, and turn out his material for sale tomorrow. We have been told of the large amount of capital expended purely by way about the Austraof experiment, and I feel sure there will be many difficulties to overcome, and that we must expect much expenditure which, in a I am speaking as a sense, will be money thrown away, before the actual commercial production of iron is established in the Commonwealth. The Government ought to hesitate before they commit themselves to a course which will inevitably mean a set-back for the iron industry, or a demand for more assistance. Under the circumstances, the very least the Government should do, in their own interests, is to have an inquiry, to enable them to lay before the House and tlie country some definite information which would possibly justify us in taking the very course they propose. I do not wish to deal with the fiscal question, although it is very hard not to refer to it incidentally. I should like to say, however, that even in the United States, which is held up to us as a striking illustration of the benefits of a protectionist policy, the shrewdest and most capable thinkers-eve n the great economist, Carey-ar e pretty well agreed that the conditions which enabled that country to develop such a magnificent iron industry were essentially, first, her natural her population. Those were the two conditions required, and when the increase of population justified the step, the industry was undertaken on a sound and, at the same time, very large scale. From that time until now the progress of the industry, has been in proportion to thegeneral development of the country and the increase of population. In England there has been some decline in the industiy, and the causes have been very clearly shown. Therei t is largely a matter of royalties-the owner of the natural resources coming in to exploit the community.",51,Second Reading

148,Mr Joseph Cook,"There has been onlythose which I have indicated.. If the British Government will take the; necessary steps to remove these depressing and oppressive charges, the iron industry will be revived to its old magnitude at the very least. good deal of leeway to overtake yet. In Groat Britain and Americai t is not so much a question of fiscal policy as, first, a question of the accessibility of the raw material, and, secondly, the increase of population. In view of the problem we have to solve, the Government ought to take time to consider whether the necessary conditions exist in Australia to justify our embarking on this very large venture. An honourable member has expressed the opinion that if influences hostile to the people as a whole were created by the polioy of the Government, the fiscal barrier could easily be removed. Buti t is very difficult indeed to remove such a barrier when once it has been created ; it is much easier to create an evil of (the kind than to kill it . In the United States the people are seriously considering the gigantic task of killing these trusts and syndicates which exploit the community. Although here, and there some action has been taken-and in one particular instance the Government took very strong action successfully-it is undeniable that these trusts and syndicates are likely to continue to flourish to a degree which it will tax the utmost resources of that resourceful people to overcome. honourable members had a lesson as to the effect of developing industries by the means now proposed. artificial development, wo shall create a Frankenstein monster which will ultimately rule even the Commonwealth Parliament. I for one would hesitate before committing myself, even tentatively, to a policy of the kind. The alternative proposal is ono which by no means can bo regarded as wildly experimental. I refer to the proposal that this particular industry should be made national, in the sense of being owned and regulated by the Commonwealth or by one of the various States. The time has gone when the principle of collectivism needs to bo strenuously defended. That principle is actually being vindicated by those who are Bland. most strongly opposed to it in the United States. Even the syndicates, which are composed of men who urge freedom of contract and private enterprise, are essentially carrying out the principle. A few years ago it was the fashion to decry anything that savoured of socialism, as being opposed to the spirit of .private enterprise, which had built up many marvellous industries, especially in the mother country. Buti n the United States the magnitude of the industries surpasses even many in the mother country, and the former are essentially the result of collective action on the part of individuals-essentiall y the operations of a scheme which is socialistic to a very high degree. A t one time we heard a great deal about the necessity of commercial schemes being supervised and controlled by those directly interested in them. That argument can no longer be applied, for the simple reason that a syndicate is in precisely the same position as a State in respect to any enterprise it may have undertaken. A syndicate would hand over its responsibilities of management entirely to a paid individual, in just the same way as a State Government would do. If it were considered desirable for the Commonwealth or one of the State Governments to establish the iron industry, we could easily obtain the services of one of those marvellous captains of industry in the United States who would undertake to produce iron on commercial principles under the control of the Government, just as he would perform the same service for a syndicate. It would not be wise for the Government to engage in the production of iron, except upon a reasonable During a recent debate commercial basis. We cannot escape from the commercial principle, however much we might like to do so. I believe, however, If we follow a policy of that iron could be produced under such conditions of nationalization as would enable those who require the raw material to obtain it from the Government as cheaply as they could procure it elsewhere, and at the same time to secure the Government a considerable profit. I see nothing in the alternative proposal that need make any honourable member hesitate to accept it , providing that we are satisfied that a reasonable amount of success will attend our efforts. Without such evidence, I shall not agree to the present proposal, and I hope, therefore, that the Government will accept the amendment of the honourable member for",52,William Lyne That Has Been Resources And Secondly The Development Of
