177,The Speaker,"Order! It being 5 pm,Thursday, 12 October 2006 ----National Mental Health Week Ms HALL (Shortland) (9.30 am)-Daniel Hadson is a second-year social work student at Newcastle university and is in Canberra with me this week. He wrote this speech-these are his words, his thoughts. This week, 8 to 14 October, is an important week in our nation. It is National Mental Health Week. There are many worthwhile national health campaign initiatives and events taking place across the nation, especially in my electorate of Shortland and indeed in the greater Hunter and Central Coast area. There can be no question that we live in an age of constant change. It is an age of rapid technology, instantaneous communication, fast food, long working hours, congested traffic, political instability, media saturation and social pressure. We settle for familiarity over variety, exploitation over exploration and hype over heart. This year’s health week theme is ‘Relationships at Work and Play’, which is a timely one with a strong emphasis on stress management and self-care. This week people in the Hunter and Central Coast are taking advantage of, among others things, ‘stress less’ days, Tai Chi demonstrations, relaxing morning teas and stress management workshops. Awabakal and Hunter New England Health Service also held a traditional games day on Tuesday. It is not all fun and games, however. Mental Health Week is all about education. It is a time of elevated public awareness of the facts and realities of mental health. It is no secret that we live in an era where one in five people will experience mental illness during their life. I applaud the many proactive campaigns taking place this week that seek to facilitate the fostering of mental health. These programs that prevent the development of foreseeable mental health issues are imperative. Even as we sit here today, our communities are being enriched through education forums, preventive workshops and information stalls. The strength of the members of our community who are consumers of mental health services is being highlighted through, among many other events, arts displays, theatre presentations, movie screenings and the launching of poetry books written by people living with mental illness. I urge that we be proactive in dispelling ignorant myths and squeeze the very life out of cruel and unfair stereotypes that are compounded by government legislation and policies that serve only to discriminate against these members of the community. People with mental health issues are not dirty, contagious or incapable, and they are certainly not crazy, yet these stigmas hang as dark tempestuous clouds over the heads of many people who suffer from mental health issues. This is why occasions such as the Destigmatise Mental Illness March, to be held in Newcastle on Saturday, are of great significance. I congratulate ARAFMI for their work in organising this event and wish them a highly successful day. Anne Frank once wrote: We all live with the objective of being happy-our lives are all different and yet the same. She makes a crucial point about the human experience that we so often miss, so often discard, in our judgements, in our labels, in our dropping of people into boxes. It is this difference that makes the National Mental Health Week so vitally important for our nation. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE",125,Notices
178,The Deputy Speaker ( Mr Causley) Took The Chair At 9.30 Am.,"After-Hours Medical Services in my electorate, have been calling for medical services to be instigated in their area. In 2001 a 24-hour medical centre was established in Palmerston to look after families in that area but, immediately following the election that year of the Clare Martin government, the 24-hour medical centre was reduced to simply an after-hours medical service. It was not a 24-hour centre at all. Very recently the Northern Territory government announced that they had completely withdrawn funding to the Farrer Medical Centre, which is located in that health precinct, and the medical centre will be forced to close at some time in the future. At the time that the Territory government made this announcement they said it was because the Commonwealth government refused to fund the centre and it was all the fault of the Commonwealth government, irrespective of the fact that they had withdrawn their funding and had made no application. Just last week, Senator Trish Crossin sent a letter to residents in Palmerston, decrying the lack of GPs in that area and, again, blaming that on the Howard government. She said in that letter: ‘In the last year, the Howard government has given grant funding to more than 60 GP services around Australia to provide after-hours services. Only one of these has been in the NT, located at Stuart Park, but $380,000 was given to support a private after-hours GP clinic in Albury in New South Wales.’ For the information of Senator Crossin, this was the only round of funding that has been announced by the federal government and there was only one GP service in my electorate that applied for that funding, and that of course was the Stuart Park medical centre. A hit rate of 100 per cent is not bad for any electorate. Trish Crossin further says in her letter: ‘Territorians need better support from the Commonwealth government when it comes to supplying GPs and especially after-hours services. If it has funded after-hours clinics around Australia, why hasn’t it also funded one in Palmerston?’ For the information of Senator Crossin, the reason one was not funded in Palmerston is that one in Palmerston never applied. There has been no application by the Farrer Medical Centre or any other centre in that round of funding. Senator Crossin, come to me and tell me who deserves to be blamed. (Time expired) Housing crisis. The Howard government ignored the skills crisis for 10 years, so I am hoping, and I am begging, that the government does not do the same and ignore the housing crisis that we are experiencing today. Do not ignore it. Do not let this go on for another 10 years. One of the biggest issues that affects families today, especially young people, is being able to afford to stay in a home and pay a mortgage or even pay rent because prices and the cost of living now are so high. The most basic need in life of course is having the security of a home. That security of having a roof over their head is important for families, and it is important for young people to feel safe and secure so they can afford to have a home. Under this government, buying a house today is almost impossible for young people. Today, under this government, if you do not already own a house, it is likely that you will not be able to afford to buy oneMrs Gash-I remember 16 per cent and 17 per centMAIN COMMITTEE",126,Statements By Members

Instead of just criticising the government, what I want to do today-unlike what the federal government does, which is to just blame the states for absolutely everything-is to say to the government that there is something that it can do: it can put the foot back on the accelerator and make housing affordable once again. I want to commend the work done in Victoria by Senator Kim Carr, shadow minister for housing, urban development and local government and territories. Labor wants a minister for housing appointed. Unless we focus on this issue, we will never be able to deal with it. I agree that we need to develop a national settlement strategy at all levels of government. Federal government must work with the states not against the states and must not continually criticise the states. We need to work with local government as well. It is particularly important at this time when local government has so much impact on housing developments and infrastructure at a local level. We also need to boost the number of skilled tradespeople so we can build homes and have enough people with the skills required to construct the massive amount of homes that we need. We need a government that is prepared to invest in the productive capacity of the economy. We actually need to address those issues-housing affordability and skills. We need the examination of a government backed scheme, a shared equity scheme, that would enable hard working young families who do not own a home today to have that start, that little boost, to get them into homeownership for the very first time. This generation could be the first generation in Australian history that, by the actions of a federal government, has been locked out of homeownership forever. This is the real tragedy of what is taking place. Unless the federal government concentrates on this issue, it will never be fixed. (Time expired) Port of Hastings Strategic Plan Heritage) (9.39 am)-I want to set out on record for my constituents my views in relation to the recently released Port of Hastings strategic plan draft comments. In particular, I want to set out what I am for and what I am against, because I believe that my constituents have a right to understand precisely where I stand on this issue. The first thing I want to address is the proposed bitumen facility within the heart of Crib Point. Crib Point is a thriving community. It is a group of wonderful people. It was formerly an industrial site, but it has become, increasingly, a residential site as the industrial purposes were abandoned over the previous decades. In that context, after having considered it for some period of time, I believe clearly and categorically that a bitumen plant in the middle of that community would be wrong and inappropriate, and it would not have my support. I say this for two reasons: firstly, the risks in relation to the plant itself and its likely impacts on residents in terms of the environment year round and, secondly, the number of Bdouble truck movements in and out of the town and right through the middle of Hastings on a daily basis. These two factors combined together-firstly, the environmental effects on and within the local community and, secondly, the B-double truck movement through the heart of Crib Point and through the heart of Hastings-make this an inappropriate place and an inappropriate facility, particularly given that there is a viable alternative to the north of Hastings in between the Esso and BlueScope steel plants, an industrial zone that is available today.

I think that development in the northern sector between Esso and BlueScope has been contemplated for 40 years, has been set aside, is an industrial zone and is for an entirely appropriate use. I do, however-and this brings me to my third point-reject the notion that land between the towns of Somerville and Tyabb should be used for industrial purposes. That is a residential area. It is farmland, it is community land; it is not the place. There is very little prospect of federal intervention here. Some have asked, but we do not have the powers.

The issue I raise today is the increasing use of civilian terminology to describe military activities. Specifically, I want to talk about the issue of using the term ‘injured’, rather than ‘wounded in action’, to describe battlefield casualties. I have received many complaints from the veterans’ community with regard to this issue. My office has heard from individuals and groups. One group that has been very strong in its advocacy on this issue has been the Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia, an organisation which does a very good job on behalf of its members. I may not always agree with its position but I cannot fault its dedication. The organisation fears that the historically important distinction between those who are injured and those who are wounded as a result of enemy action is being eroded. There are two separate issues with regard to this. One is related to the new set of distinctions under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme. The second is the loss of a term that carried with it a measure of honour. On the first issue, can I be clear: Labor supported the new Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Scheme, and my purpose today is not to propose any legislative changes to this scheme. I understand that the scheme has proven to be quite controversial within the veterans’ community, but I think we are still monitoring its implementation, and it is fair to say that we should wait for a clearer picture before we can judge its success. The second issue is the one I want to talk about today. It relates to the erosion in descriptions of battlefield casualties of the distinction between those who are wounded as a result of enemy action and those who are injured. Increasingly we are seeing politicians, senior public servants, the media and the general public describe battlefield casualties as injuries. CanI say frankly that this is a disturbing change in the language we use to describe casualties suffered by our servicemen and servicewomen. The general public should be aware of the fact that the term ‘wounded in action’ has attached to it a certain honorific for the person involved. To be wounded in the service of one’s country is much more than simply suffering an injury. In saying that, I mean no disrespect to those injured in the service of our country. Their suffering is real and ought to be recognised and respected. However, this distinction is part of our military tradition and is something that is worth protecting. I call on members of this House, senior public servants and the media to be careful in their use of language when describing battlefield casualties. These casualties are not injured perMAIN COMMITTEE",128,Statements By Members
183,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (9.42 Am),"I rise today to talk about an issue that is important tosonnel, but personnel who are wounded as a result of enemy action, and should be described as such. Using the term ‘injured’ demonstrates a lack of knowledge, at best, and a lack of respect, at worse. Administrative and bureaucratic necessities must not be allowed to see this distinction pass from use. This may seem a small distinction to some, but to many Australian service men and women, past and present, this is a very important distinction. Therefore, I think it is incumbent on us all to watch our language. Surely this is the least we can do for those who give this country so much. (Time expired) Employment financial security for all Australians. Without job security there can be no security for Australian families and their homes. Homeownership is vital to the security of Australians and their future. Without a job and employment security there can be no home security in the lives of Australians. TodayI address my remarks to the people of Ryan and again let them know that the Howard government is working hard to ensure that the record 30-year low unemployment figure of 4.8 per cent will continue. The Howard government will continue to put that at the top of its agenda-ensuring job security, economic security and national prosperity. This will remain its first priority. Does anyone in the Ryan community believe that a Beazley government would have the policy mix to sustain this 30-year low unemployment figure? Of course not. The Labor opposition do not like to be reminded of this, but the Prime Minister and the coalition government will continue to remind them that fairness in the workplace begins with a job-as a very distinguished Labour Prime Minister, the Hon. Tony Blair of the UK, has put on the record. Since March this year, when the Workplace Relations Act was introduced-historic legislation that is all about creating economic prosperity for this country-over 175,000 jobs have been created. So now 175,000 more Australians can contribute to their families and the security of their homes. This legislation will make a big difference to the economic architecture of this country. The people of Ryan will be interested to know that some $11,200 of their taxpayers’ money is spent per minute on benefits for their fellow unemployed citizens. No-one would begrudge the importance of taking care of Australians who need to be taken care of. But the Ryan constituents, whom I have the great honour of representing in this parliament, would equally expect their fellow Australians to seek work where they have the capacity to work and where the jobs are available. In this country employers and businesses are crying out for Australians to fill job vacancies, yet hundreds of thousands of Australians are still not working, notwithstanding our record 30-year low unemployment figure. I commend the legislation to the parliament. (Time expired) Canberra Symphony Orchestra Ms ANNETTE ELLIS (Canberra) (9.48 am)-I want to take the opportunity this morning to talk about the Canberra Symphony Orchestra. Just over 40 years ago the then newly arrived founding director of the Canberra School of Music, Ernest Llewellyn, took the reins as conductor of a small amateur orchestra ensemble which became, under his direction, the Canberra Symphony Orchestra. The CSO has grown and developed over the years since, with great pride within this community. Sadly, however, a question mark has been put over the CSO as the result of a recent decision by the Australian Ballet not to come to Canberra next MAIN COMMITTEE",129,Statements By Members
184,Mr Johnson (Ryan) (9.45 Am),"Employment security lies at the heart of economic andyear, claiming that it is not worth their while as the orchestra is too expensive for them and not up to scratch and that our theatre here is inadequate for them to continue touring here. Honourable member-Rubbish! Ms ANNETTE ELLIS-Absolutely. There is always room for improvement, of course. Ian McLean, the chief executive of the orchestra, is doing wonderful things in leading the CSO through further development of the orchestra into what we know will be a positive future. I am very pleased to know that there are discussions of a positive nature now occurring between the Australian Ballet and our CSO. Hopefully, we are all looking forward to a good outcome from those discussions. I would like to take the opportunity to put some facts before the House regarding our Canberra Symphony Orchestra. They are in fact holding scholarships through October-six unique scholarships for young people to gifted honours and postgraduate students from the Canberra School of Music. Next year, in conjunction with ArtSound FM, they are going to introduce a young performer competition. Most importantly, Opera Australia has confirmed that the CSO is to provide the orchestra for its blockbuster production of The Pirates of Penzance in the Canberra Theatre during November of this year. Opera Australia management are delighted to be coming here and to be doing that work with the Canberra Symphony Orchestra, unlike the Australian Ballet-but of course I am not here to criticise the Australian Ballet; I am here to talk about the CSO. The ACT government assists the CSO with funding. I am very pleased to welcome the recently announced federal government funding of $400,000 over four years through the Australia Council to assist the CSO. Of course it should have been happening prior to this time. I am not going to be mean about this, but it is the Canberra national capital symphony orchestra we are talking about. I am very pleased to see that eventually some funding has come from the national parliament, from the government here, to assist the Canberra Symphony Orchestra. I want to wish the Canberra Symphony Orchestra, Ian McLean and all of the students of music in this town all the very best for a very positive future. I look forward with all other people in the Canberra arts community to welcoming the Australian Ballet back at an appropriate time in the future. Central Queensland University: STEPS Program University hosted the 20th anniversary celebration of its STEPS program, one of the most useful tools the university has to help potential students get ready for tertiary studies. Short for ‘Skills for Tertiary Education Preparatory Studies’, the STEPS program is a pre-university course that gives adult learners the necessary skills and confidence to take on the challenge of university via a 12-week accelerated course or a 24-week flexible program. In many cases students enrolling in the STEPS program have had an unhappy or damaging school experience, but this program has a friendly, open-door approach. STEPS covers core subjects such as academic communications, mathematics, computing, independent learning skills, study skills, library information and literacy skills-in short, the nuts and bolts of understanding needed to kick-start academic studies.

One such student, Taryn Jeffery, who recently graduated from the program to start a nursing degree, said: I really want to do a bachelor of nursing degree, but I hadn’t been to school in a while, so I thought I might not be the best writer, but I am a lot more confident now. The 20th anniversary celebrations were a chance for past STEPS students to catch up with former teachers, and to meet today’s students and compare notes as to how the program helped them with their further studies. I commend CQU for the success of the STEPS program and the opportunities it is opening up for prospective university students in central Queensland. I also commend CQU for its excellent facilities that it has provided for students. In recent weeks I had the pleasure of officially opening the Bundaberg campus’s new information commons, which was built with the help of a $1.47 million program from the government’s Capital Development Pool program. These facilities have come on line at Bundaberg and Gladstone campuses and are due to be completed at the end of the year at Mackay campus. CQU’s Bundaberg Library Information Commons is providing far better ICT infrastructure for its students and staff, which is vital in today’s world, where access to state-of-the-art computer and information technology is crucial to extending each student’s learning-a job well done. Canberra Symphony Orchestra making a case for the Canberra Symphony Orchestra. As she has said, the CSO has become embroiled in controversy recently as a result of reported remarks by the executive director of the Australian Ballet, Richard Evans, that one of the reasons the Australian Ballet will not be coming to Canberra in 2007, apart from problems of cost, is possibly the quality of the CSO. This was a very embarrassing situation for me; I am a fan of both the CSO and the Australian Ballet, and I am a friend of many people associated with the CSO and I am a friend of Richard Evans. SoI spoke to all concerned, and to some extent I think the matter is the product of a misunderstanding. But there are some facts that we have to accept. The marginal cost of turning a part-time orchestra into a full-time orchestra, sometimes with the need to be supplemented by interstate players, is clearly more than the marginal cost of one extra performance for a full-time orchestra like the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra, especially as the CSO has had zero dollars from the federal government until now. It will get $100,000 a year, but that is much less than the millions provided to the state symphony orchestras. But musicians I have spoken with who have played with the CSO and, for example, the Opera and Ballet Orchestra refute the argument about the difference in quality. I note the member for Canberra said that the CSO will be playing for Opera Australia in the forthcoming season, and all the information I have points to Opera Australia being very happy with that arrangement. My advice to the Canberra Symphony Orchestra was: turn this adversity to your advantage; use the criticism to rally fans behind the CSO here in Canberra and in the wider region. I urge all Canberrans to look for opportunities to show their support for our local orchestra-show them we want them and that they deserve support. There are three opportunities coming up for people to show that support: on Friday, 13 October, the Canberra Pops Orchestra are playing a Friday the 13th concert-that is nearly sold out, but there are still tickets; on Wednesday MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Statements By Members

Seize one of those opportunities, I say to Canberra citizens; you will not regret it. Let’s take a positive message out of this contretemps-that the people in Canberra and the people in the wider New South Wales region are proud of the CSO, that it deserves our support, and more support, and that we want the Australian Ballet back here in Canberra in 2008 performing with the Canberra Symphony Orchestra, which would be to the delight of citizens here in Canberra and the region. Employment John Laws show yesterday about people who clearly prefer to bludge off the taxpayer rather than work. On the other side of the coin, it is frustrating for people in my electorate wanting jobs and not being able to find them. It is not so much that the jobs are not out there; after all, we have the lowest unemployment rate for decades. Rather, it is the fact that the jobs are somewhere in another state and the job seeker does not have the means to move there, let alone attend an employment interview. I had heard of the jobs boom in the west and the intensity of economic activity in the mining states. I just wish we had the same happening here in New South Wales. SoI spoke to my colleague the member for Kalgoorlie. The potential was obvious, but there was no device in place to assist people to move from my electorate of Gilmore to that of Kalgoorlie. The system just did not allow any assistance for people wanting to relocate to take up the opportunity of work in another state. Luke Hartsuyker, the member for Cowper, and I took this to the government, and it was not long before the merits of the proposition were embraced, the result being the scheme that was recently announced. I stress this is a pilot program involving the electorates of Cowper and Gilmore. That means that adjustments may need to be made, with the system tailored to meet reality. But, as a starting point, the concept has merit and is worthy of further development if we want to ensure all Australians have first crack at all the available jobs. For my part, the simplicity of the scheme is its strong point. If you want a job and you are prepared to move to get it but cannot afford the move, the government will assist you. There have been some comments that the allocation of $5,000 will not be enough, and in some cases that may well be the case. I think if we are genuine about the need to place people in employment, to encourage their work ethic and to get people off their dependency on social welfare then it is a cost that is worth bearing. It is a system that necessarily will be cultivated to meet the need. Perhaps, with success, others might follow suit. I accept that not everybody is going to be a willing participant for a variety of reasons, but at least this government is doing something positive about encouraging job take-ups nationally. I concede that it is difficult for some people to take up their roots, move away from their comfort zones and take a punt, but that is what life is all about and the government is not there to support people in their preferred lifestyle. The scheme has been described as innovative, and it is. What we need is more lateral thinking and creativity to take up the opportunities that are on offer. What we do not need is to be stuck in a box of our own making while the rest of the world passes by. The scheme is just MAIN COMMITTEE",132,Steps Would Help Me Make It Into The Course

I am gratified in playing the role that I did in this scheme and I sincerely hope that it takes off. At least we have tried and we will keep on trying to get it right. Again, I would like to thank my colleagues the member for Cowper and the member for Kalgoorlie for their assistance in this area. the time for members’ statements has concluded.

The Trade Marks Amendment Bill 2006 will amend the Trade Marks Act 1995. The current act was introduced as the result of a working party set up to review and streamline trademarks legislation. The act replaced legislation that had been in place since 1955. The act has now been in force for 10 years. The government has carried out a review of trademarks legislation in keeping with our policy to keep legislation relevant and up-to-date. The review sought comment from interest groups. The government released three issues papers and received comments from interested parties, including intellectual property professionals and small businesses. An industry reference group consisting of intellectual property professionals and industry representatives was set up to help in the consultations. The review found that the trademarks system was working effectively, but there were some changes that could be made to enhance the system. This bill implements changes to the trademark system arising out of that review. A strong trademark right is a valuable asset that can help increase recognition of a brand. Registered owners have the exclusive right to use their registered trademark on their goods and services. They can sell or license the trademark. They can also ask Customs to seize goods coming into Australia if the goods infringe their trademark, to prevent the flow of counterfeit goods. A strong trademark system provides a benefit to the public. It provides members of the public with assurance that when they buy something, they are buying genuine goods that have the quality they have come to expect from that brand. The changes made by the bill will improve the trademarks system in a number of ways. The bill will strengthen trademark rights, providing greater certainty to trademark owners and the general public. The bill includes provisions that will reduce the regulatory and administrative burden on the users of the system. It will also increase the transparency of the trademark system, and increase alignment of the trademark system with other intellectual property rights. The government is committed to encouraging innovation and to providing Australia with a strong trademark system that meets the needs of all Australians. We are also committed to MAIN COMMITTEE",133,Steps Would Help Me Make It Into The Course

189,Mr Baldwin (Paterson,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourismreducing the regulatory burden on Australian businesses in registering trademarks. This bill reflects those commitments. Amendments in this bill strengthen trademark rights by enabling trademark owners to more effectively protect their trademark. For example, owners of trademarks with a reputation in Australia can now more readily protect their trademarks against registration of other trademarks whose use is likely to lead to confusion in the marketplace. A trademark can be opposed by members of the public if it will affect their business or they believe the trade mark should not be registered. Amendments in this bill will clarify the basis on which an opposition may be taken, and allow a trade mark to be opposed because it was made in bad faith. This will increase the strength of registered trademarks and help weed out bad ones. Over half of the trademark applications are filed directly by the owner of the business. Many of these are small and medium sized enterprises. These smaller businesses can be greatly affected by the burden of regulation and administration in the trademark system. It is our policy to reduce this burden wherever possible. Amendments in this bill reduce the administrative and regulatory burden on trademark owners in a number of ways. Some of the changes reduce complexity in the system while other changes make it easier for trademark owners to correct their application if they do make a mistake. Trademark owners will also find it easier to request Customs to seize goods that might infringe their trademark. Notices requesting seizure will stay in effect for longer and trademark owners will be able to provide a written undertaking to repay any expenses incurred by the Commonwealth, instead of paying a cash security up-front as is currently required. Small business owners, in particular, will find it easier to use the trademark system to prevent importation of counterfeit goods. A trademark is a valuable right and certainty of ownership is necessary for both the owner and also for anyone who may have an interest in the trademark. Amendments set out in this bill increase certainty of ownership of a trademark and increase the public’s certainty that the information on the Register of Trade Marks is correct and up to date. Amendments in this bill also clarify parts of the Trade Marks Act that have confused trademark owners in the past. By clarifying these requirements, it will make it easier for people to apply for a trademark. The amendments set out in the bill also increase transparency and alignment with other intellectual property acts. Many businesses hold a number of intellectual property rights. For example they may own a patent for an invention and a trademark for the invention’s proprietary name. It is more convenient for the owner of these rights if there is consistency when seeking patent and trademark protection. The amendments in this bill bring some of the administrative aspects of the trademark system into line with the patents and designs systems. The bill will result in stronger registered trademark rights and improve the administration of the trademark system. Bill 2006 and offer Labor’s support for these measures.

190,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (10.06 Am),"I rise today to speak on the Trade Marks Amendmentgeneral public. It also includes provisions that reduce the regulatory and administrative burden on the users of the system. The bill also increases the transparency of the trademark system and increases the alignment of the trademark system with other intellectual property rights. The major provisions of the bill will enable owners of trademarks with a reputation in Australia to more readily protect their trademarks against registration of other trademarks whose use is likely to lead to confusion in the market place. It will also clarify the basis on which a trademark may be opposed and allow a trademark to be opposed if it was made in bad faith. It also makes it easier for trademark owners to request Customs to seize goods that might infringe their trademark, and notices requesting seizure will stay in effect for longer. Trademark owners will be able to provide a written undertaking to repay any expenses incurred by the Commonwealth instead of paying cash security upfront as is currently required. The bill will also clarify parts of the act that have previously confused trademark owners, making it easier for people to apply for a trademark. The amendments contained in the bill are sensible though overdue improvements to Australia’s trademark regime that enhance efficiency, improve transparency and reduce the regulatory and administrative burden on trademark applicants and owners. That is why Labor supports these measures and welcomes them. The second reading debate on this bill also gives me an opportunity to outline some of Labor’s proposals in this area which I think are very significant. I am referring specifically of course to Labor’s innovation blueprint. Labor’s innovation blueprint is a plan to turn Aussie brilliance into Aussie dollars to make our economy competitive with the rest of the world once again. Innovation is central to the nation-building agenda and will deliver for this country. A federal Labor government will kick-start the next generation of innovation in the private sector. Reform is urgently needed in areas such as research and development investment arrangements. We need to look more closely at developing the capacity and diversity of our universities, not just trying to seize control, which the current government is doing. We also need to rebuild Australia’s great research institutes, including the CSIRO. These are the innovative drivers-the forces and the levers-that government has available to it to ensure that we drive innovation and that we provide the tools necessary for Australians to move forward in this area. There is a lot of brilliance in Australia but young people and start-up companies are often not assisted by government or regulation in providing the necessary push to achieve their dreams and their goals. This government has failed abysmally, particularly in the area of R&D, to provide the right mechanisms and tools. More thought needs to be put into research and development and how those investment arrangements are made. Certainly the government needs to form greater partnerships with our universities to develop innovation, technology and new systems-from ideas through to in-country development-and to turn them into Australian dollars and Australian jobs, which would enable our skilled people to achieve much more. The key initiatives that a Beazley Labor government would put into place on coming to office would include enterprise connect centres, which could be used as the conduit between the marketplace and universities and innovators out there on the street doing their work. Knowledge transfer partnerships are a better mechanism for taking initiatives from a knowledge MAIN COMMITTEE based start through to creating systems. Venture capital reforms in this country have had very little attention. Venture capital in most countries is a key driver of innovation that develops those new ideas into products in the market. That is something that Australia could do much better. Health research is another area. Australia has a great reputation in the area of medical and health research and that needs to be focused on more heavily. More needs to be done in the area of modern information and communications technology. We need to rebuild our national icons, for example the CSIRO, and make sure they are independent and that they have the funding available to them to do the things they are chartered to do. Labor will commission the Chifley Research Centre to report on the future of R&D incentives-in particular, the greater incentives for increased and additional R&D investment rather than just the overall levels. Labor will look at better targeting the money to be spent. We will look at converting the benefits of different rates into a single concession for new investment. We will look at expanding the base of the current concession on increased and additional investment and converting the R&D concession into a program of loans and grants. Labor will provide more mechanisms and tools and a greater focus in the area of research and development, which this government has not done. In respect of innovation centres, we need to adapt new ideas in research. We need to take up new technology. We need to test new products, new ideas and new processes. But all of this does take time, and it costs money. There needs to be that partnership between government, people and institutions to see this through to the market. Labor’s commitment is to initially establish up to 10 enterprise connect centres, including one for advanced manufacturing. This is a very important issue that this government has not looked at. Labor will contribute up to $20 million to each centre over four years-a solid, worthwhile commitment. We also need to find a new collaboration of at least one business and a university, a public research agency or a TAFE, to work on specific projects such as improving production and management processes or building and testing new prototypes or a new product launch. Labor commits to providing $10 million in each full year to fund up to 200 knowledge transfer partnerships for projects of up to two years. This is needed urgently in this new-age economy where there is a skills crisis. The jobs of tomorrow will be built around innovation and skilling people, and there needs to be a partnership between all of the institutions involved and government. Lastly, I will make a couple of comments on venture capital. Labor intends to consult on the establishment of an enterprise investment scheme similar to that adopted in the United Kingdom which provides tax incentives for investors who subscribe to innovative companies and on the establishment of a new venture capital exchange to help foster a risk capital market for emerging companies. I commend this bill and Labor supports it. It contains a number of measures that are worthwhile, that strengthen the trademark rights of individuals and companies. It is well and truly overdue. chair has been very generous and may not be so generous in future about speaking to the bill. tant legislation.

191,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Ir Causley),I remind the member for Oxley that the,137,Trade Marks Amendment Bill 2006
192,Mr Cadman (Mitchell) (10.15 Am),"The Trade Marks Amendment Bill 2006 is important for our nation that we protect our innovation and our innovators. People around the world are seeking to knock off Australian creativity and ingenuity and we must protect and safeguard it. Some of our great brand names are now owned by foreigners. It is a tragedy that Vegemite is no longer Australian. But that is not what this is about. They have not bought the trademark; they have bought the business. So that is a different issue. Today we are looking at some of the changes to the act. In general terms-I will turn to the specifics shortly-what this legislation does is to decrease the administrative and regulatory burden that confronts applicants when they apply for or seek to vary a trademark. This is a very welcome change. The complexity of the current act has led to a number of inconsistencies, which I am aware of, that make it difficult in some instances for Australian trademark applicants to succeed. We welcome measures to toughen trademark legislation and reduce the administrative and regulatory burden to make it easier for people to find their way through a process which can be quite complex. The process is certainly not as complex, in many ways, as it is when applying for a patent. A trademark does not provide the same sort of protection as a patent but, nevertheless, it is often the lifeblood of a company. A well-known trademark is something to be valued and prized; it is of great merit and great financial value. The legislation provides greater certainty once a trademark has been issued. Once a trademark right is issued, the scope with which people can come in under that trademark with something similar is more restricted than was the case previously. That is also a welcome measure. The parliamentary secretary will be aware of a particular interest I have in an Australian company. An overseas firm was seeking to come in under an Australian firm with similar presentations-I forget the legal term-and almost show itself off as the Australian company. This legislation will restrict the prospect of that occurring. The increase in the predicability of the trademark system and clarity of the Trade Marks Act is welcome. Transparency and alignment with other intellectual property acts such as the Patents Act are the broad issues that the bill seeks to deal with. I guess most people in this place would say that this is a pretty dry old subject, but it is a very intense and important subject for Australian business. It should not be underestimated. It is the very key to advertising, market recognition, promotion and advertising. The extent of market reach can be so strongly identified with a trademark. It is a critical commercial product that we should not dismiss lightly. We need to take a great deal of care in the way in which trademarks are managed. It is one of the most critical and commercially viable parts of the intellectual property of a business. The enhancement of the trademark system reflects the government’s commitment to encouraging innovation and protection of Australian business. It provides Australia with a strong trademark system that meets the needs of Australian business. This bill, which will become the law of Australia, follows an inquiry and review of the 1995 act and associated regulations. It is probably about the right length of time to have a review of these sorts of things after 10 years. Some may complain that it is too long since the Trade Marks Act was reviewed. That is not the case. A 10-year span is needed for people to become aware of an act but also to be able to manage their business and their trademarks and their intellectual property with certainty. SoI congratulate the government on the review and these changes. As I have indicated, the bill reduces the administrative burden on those trying to register trademarks and it also gives the MAIN COMMITTEE Registrar of Trade Marks the power to initiate court action in trademark matters. All of those are welcome points. I want to refer to some of the details of the bill itself and comment on the reader’s guide, which is a welcome innovation and is part of legislation to make it easier for those seeking information about trademarks to access some of the details before they start paying lawyers. One of the amendments, an important amendment, relates to section 6 of the Trade Marks Act. Section6 defines ‘person’ as including ‘a body of persons, whether incorporated or not’. That leaves to one side the capacity of trusts, business names, trading names and partnerships. They are not usually able to own property, and ownership is an important part of the trademarks system. Ownership is generally limited to people who have a legal personality. However, there has been some confusion in this area about who can own a trademark, in particular in relation to trusts and business names. There is an exception in the definition of persons able to own a trademark. International agreements oblige Australia to allow an association to own a collective trademark. The current definition of ‘association’ in section 6 excludes incorporated associations, of which we have many, and it has been the practice in Australia to incorporate associations because of legal protections, insurance and a whole range of other things. Item 64 of the Trade Marks Amendment Bill 2006 seeks to remove that restriction and allow incorporated associations to apply for collective trademarks. The rights of unincorporated associations to own collective trademarks are preserved. So it is a very good suggestion, a very good change. The grounds for rejecting an application are not in the same place in the act but in section 31 of the act, which states that the registrar must examine and report on whether or not there are any grounds, under division 2 of part 4, for objection to the application. So what this section does is bring together the grounds for objection and opposition, which are important provisions. Further on in the bill there are provisions about a registration opponent’s earlier use of a similar trademark-this is an area which is often contested-and I read from the explanatory memorandum to clarify the point: A person may obtain acceptance and registration for a trade mark under section 44(4) even though an earlier similar trade mark has been registered for similar goods and services. The person must be able to show that they have used the trade mark before the filing date of the earlier trade mark on those particular goods or services. It goes on: However the owner of the earlier trade mark may have used their trade mark before applying for trade mark registration and accrued common law rights. As it stands the owner of the earlier registered mark has no basis on which to oppose registration of a trade mark accepted under subsection 44(4), even where their use pre-dates that of the accepted application. And: The new section will provide a basis for the Registrar to give consideration to these issues in opposition proceedings. That brings us to the case that the parliamentary secretary brought up and that I am aware of-and it applies to the goods scheme. This fixes up the problem that the Pirotelli family have found, and the attack by Estee Lauder on this Australian company. Estee Lauder employed a firm of solicitors to go hunting for trademarks and names that they could use for their cosmetic products. The Pirotelli family had those brands and had the products up and MAIN COMMITTEE running. They had applied for registration and, owing to some fault in the advice they received, whether from IP Australia or others-I suspect IP Australia-they withdrew one trademark and Estee Lauder were able to get in there and say, ‘We claim this trademark.’ Ms HallMr Deputy Speaker, I seek to intervene. give way? Ms Hall-As reluctant as I am to draw the member’s attention to the legislation, I feel he is straying very dramatically from the point of the legislation. for Mitchell is speaking to the bill. Ms Hall-Talking about Estee Lauder? is what it is about. They are trying to grab the trademark of an Australian company. This bill fixes the problem. What we are talking about is protecting trademarks of Australian companies. That is an important thing for Australian business. Being sure of their trademarks applies to employment and opportunity for Australian companies. I am explaining why this amendment to the current act has been necessary. It is necessary to protect Australian business against raiders like Estee Lauder who seek to knock off Australian companies. It is a very important issue and it is right on the button of what this act is about. That just explains that the Australian Labor Party are off the mark in everything that they do-in the parliament, on the economy, on Work Choices and everything else they get into. They do not understand the implications for the Australian community, Australian workers or Australian businesses. I return to the topic. In this instance, the Australian family who were owners of the trademark thought that they were covered by the current act, and the amendment certainly improves their prospects of success. However, part of this act really does open up some difficult issues, in my opinion, about the capacity for non-Australian companies or, for that matter, Australian companies to seek information, under freedom of information, about the nature of the trademark application. They can seek to gather the papers behind the application, the details of that application for a trademark, and examine them, tear them apart and challenge them under freedom of information, and I believe that information is commercial-inconfidence. Anybody applying for a trademark does so believing that they are applying to a government agency that will safeguard their commercial property. It is no fault of the department, IP Australia or anybody else; it is the way the act works and it needs to be changed. I am unhappy with this process because the capacity for somebody to get behind an application and gather commercially confidential information-because we have a Commonwealth arrangement for freedom of information-allows them to go into an area where I do not believe they have any right to go. I believe that IP Australia and the agencies of government need to make the decisions. If their decision is flawed, that should be challenged, but not the nature of the commercial application. That should not be challenged. MAIN COMMITTEE",137,Trade Marks Amendment Bill 2006

197,Mr Cadman,"The matter is the claim by Estee Lauder of an Australian trademark. ThatIn this instance, this family have put forward papers to back up their trademark and explain why it needs to be as it is. They are required to present their marketing plan, their target market and details of their product-not the total chemistry-in their application for the trademark. That information under freedom of information can be available. The officers of IP Australia, who manage trademarks, can look at the release that they are about to make and decide-and we are asking a person who is an employee of the Commonwealth to decidewhat is commercially valuable and what is not. It is not the role of a trademark official to be able to do that sort of thing. I do not believe that we should be putting those people in a position of deciding issues of commercial significance when an application for a trademark or to grab a trademark has been made and is being challenged by an overseas company, as in this instance. When the application is being challenged by an overseas company, the officer of IP Australia should decide issues of commercial significance. I guess that is my one complaint against the legislation. What has been done by the government has been excellent. It needed tidying up. All of the measures contained in this legislation are a vast improvement. They are really good. But the freedom of information area is not covered by this legislation; it is covered by the general freedom of information legislation. I do not think the drafters ever considered trademarks when they drafted that original legislation. The original legislation was to allow the public to see whether proper decisions were being made, whether things were being hidden by the executive government and whether things were being done that were open and fair. But to allow that process to go one step beyond what is open and fair and permit an examination of details of policy and decision making within government, and in this instance encourage it to go beyond that and examine the details of the commercial background of a trademark application, I believe is absolutely wrong. It should not be allowed. Those companies are dependent on their trademarks for their future. To allow the details of that trademark and the marketing plans and all the rest, which are a critical part of the application and must be provided with the application for a trademark, to be accessed by a raider cannot be tolerated. I know that in his area the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources and the government have done everything possible to assist these circumstances. This legislation goes one step further, which is excellent. My complaint is that the only flaw now resting in trademarks for Australian trademark applicants is that the freedom of information legislation almost destroys, in some way, the protections that this legislation grants. I thank the parliamentary secretary, my colleague and friend, for his support on this issue. Ms HallMr Deputy Speaker, I have a question to the member. question?

The amendments arose out of regular reviews of the act which were carried out by IP Australia, the government agency with responsibility for administering the Trade Marks Act. There was extensive consultation with the public and stakeholders as part of that review. During this consultation, IP Australia utilised the expertise of an industry reference group to help assess the merits of the issues that were raised. The industry reference group comprised dedicated representatives from key stakeholders who willingly contributed their time, and I thank them for their efforts. I thank the member for Oxley for his comments today. In a total of eight minutes, the only part of the bill that he addressed properly was the title and his concerns about the time frame. He said that it had gone on too long. The government has a general policy of reviewing legislation every five to 10 years. This review was undertaken as a part of that general policy. This review commenced in 2002 and took a considerable time because of the extensive consultation with industry and with the people whom we seek to represent in the trademarks area. We make no apology for being thorough in our job. In contrast, the member for Mitchell is one of the most passionate advocates on IP and trademarks that I have seen in this parliament. The gall of the member for Shortland to stand up and ask the member for Mitchell to be brought back to the bill shows her ineptitude-she did not even read the bill.

He made representations to my office and had a partial result on that in the previous IP bill, which amended parts of the Freedom of Information Act. There is no greater passionate advocate for intellectual property or his constituents’ rights than the member for Mitchell. That stands in contrast to the ineptitude and arrogance of the member for Shortland, who is nothing more than a time waster in this parliament and in the community broadly. The member for Shortland, who did not even bother to read the bill to familiarise herself with its content, then raised questions against the member for Mitchell. This shows her absolute arrogance, illiteracy and ineptitude. Getting back to this bill, the Trade Marks Act provides for registration of trademarks and sets out and protects the rights derived from the registration. Trademarks assist Australian businesses to increase their competitive advantage. Trademarks signify the origin of goods or services to the public so the public can recognise the trade origin of the goods or services. The member for Mitchell correctly said that trademarks are an asset of the business. Recently, IP Australia held a contest for the favourite trademark of the century. The trademarks entered were narrowed down to 10 finalists: Qantas, the Wallabies, Arnotts, Weet-Bix, RM Williams, Penfolds, David Jones, the ABC and Woolmark. They were judged and assessed by outstanding people, such as Ken Done, Carla Zampatti, George Gregan-the Wallabies captainand Simon Reynolds, who is an industry leader in this area. They understand the value of a trademark-and so does Coca-Cola. A trademark can be valued in the billions of dollars. That is not something that is easily given away. It is a critical asset, a bottom-line measure to a company. I am glad that the public voted for Weet-Bix as the top Australian trademark of the century. We understand the value of trademarks. We also understand the need to protect trademark rights. This bill makes a number of changes to the act that will simplify aspects of the trademark system, particularly for small businesses. Over 50 per cent of trademark applicants are self-represented. Many of these applicants will benefit from the changes that clarify and simplify provisions in the Trade Marks Act. In general, the amendments made by the bill will improve the administration of the trademark system to make it easier to use. The bill reflects the government’s commitment to encourage stronger trademark rights that meet the needs of all Australians. I thank all of the members for their contributions. As I said, the most outstanding contribution, delivered with passionate advocacy, was that of the member for Mitchell.

Second Reading Debate resumed from 11 October, on motion by Mr Billson: That this bill be now read a second time. on the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006. The impact of the armed forces in the area of my electorate is really significant. In the electorate of Blair, one of the major industries is the defence forces, particularly through the RAAF base at Amberley, and that is becoming more and more a significant part of our community. The bill we are debating today helps to transfer the benefit of armed forces deployment to RAAF Base Amberley right down to the grassroots level. It results in greater local investment in housing and construction. It helps to drive the local economy and it demonstrates to local people what a magnificent investment it is, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to continue to raise, train and sustain our armed forces in the defence of our country. The link between the electorate of Blair and the RAAF goes back a long way. In fact, it goes way back before the electorate of Blair was named the electorate of Blair. It goes back to December 1938 when an area of 882 acres in the parish of Jeebropilly, as it was then, was identified for RAAF Base Amberley. That has become a driving force for industry in the area. This Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006 means that what was a bare paddock in 1938-882 acres with a few cows on it-has become a powerhouse of our local economy, with 3,500 service personnel involved in a range of pursuits. MightI say, under this government, it is a base that is growing dramatically. We have seen, from the Commonwealth in recent times, the investment of $2 billion in the purchase of C17 aircraft and that investment is flowing directly through RAAF Base Amberley because that is where the C17s are to be located. At that base, we have the Wedgetail surveillance aircraft under construction. Those aircraft are going to be based at Williamtown but they are currently located at Amberley under construction, and the RAAF and the defence contractors are doing a brilliant job there in creating this wonderful new capability for our defence forces. But those are just a couple of the facets of the work that is being undertaken by Defence personnel on RAAF Base Amberley. We have a massive redevelopment going on at Amberley. In the 2006 budget, $285.6 million was allocated to the redevelopment of Amberley for accommodation, workshops and other upgrades. We have seen the relocation of the 9th Force Support Battalion and with that allocation has come other personnel. In recent budgets we have seen allocations to the construction of new homes. At Grammar Park Estate eight new four-bedroom homes were reconstructed as a result of the 2004 budget at a cost of $2.3 million. We have had $5.6 million allocated to 22 new ADF homes around Forest Lake and Springfield Lake, 10 new homes at Winston Glades and another 20 at Kensington Lakes. These projects together have generated 195 new jobs locally-and that is just in housing construction. As I said, there are 3,500 service and civilian personnel at Amberley. Those people generate tremendous impact on our local economy. We have got a big project underway in the provision of 295 new singles accommodation at Amberley-this is part of the MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Trade Marks Amendment Bill 2006
209,Mr Cameron Thompson (Blair) (10.41 Am),"It is a great privilege to be speakingSingle LEAP project which is going on across Australia-and recently announced, in March 2006, was $50.7 million for 162 new homes at Fairview Rise in Amberley. That investment in homes and construction and support of the defence capability at Amberley is just one facet of the investment coming from our government. That is a part of the direct investment. What we are talking about today is the indirect investment, the opportunity for people located at Amberley because of their service employment to be able to access home loan assistance from the Commonwealth. The Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006 is designed to extend the operation of the Defence HomeOwner Scheme for 12 months beyond its current finishing date of 31 December 2006. Under this bill Defence Force personnel who have been in their work for five years or who have been posted overseas on warlike service have the capacity to access a subsidy from the Commonwealth on loans of up to $80,000 for the purchase of a home. We all know the tremendous difficulty faced by service personnel who are moved backwards and forwards across Australia in the pursuit of the defence of this country. It can be very hard for them to invest in homeownership because six months down the track they might be off somewhere else. This is a real incentive. I say to young people considering a career in the defence force: do not just look at the salary; look at issues such as this. Where else in society can you look to get access to a subsidy of 40 per cent of the interest costs on an $80,000 loan? It really is a fantastic allocation and program and an excellent incentive for people to consider the Defence Force as a career. Later in my speech I will look to the fact that currently we are reviewing that scheme, but the purpose of this particular bill is to extend the current scheme for a year to give certainty to people who are in the Defence Force who want to access that subsidy and to reassure them that the government remains committed to their entitlement and to their opportunity to participate in homeownership. This was a scheme originally implemented by the former Labor government with a cap of $40,000. In November 1996 the Australian government passed legislation to amend the act to reduce the basic service qualifying period from six to five years full-time service, to increase the maximum amount of the loan to $80,000 and to extend eligibility to active and emergency reserve personnel. That change by the government has served us well. I will go through initially what people receive as a result of this. If you look at the entitlement of 40 per cent of the interest expense on a loan amount of $80,000 you are talking about a subsidy which is currently worth about $120 a month over a 25-year loan. And it is not just once you can access this as a member of the defence forces; you can access it repeatedly on subsequent homes that you may purchase. What a great incentive this is. One of the important things that you should consider is that, if you are married to someone who is also in the defence forces, you can access that amount of $80,000 twice-you can have a subsidy applying to a loan of $160,000. As things stand the act specifies a finishing date of 31 December 2006 to this loan, which is linked to the National Australia Bank. As I said, there is currently a review going on and honestly it just would not be possible to complete the review and get it signed off on prior to 31 December 2006, which is why we are looking at the bill today-to extend it by another year and to give the certainty that members crave. I did speak about the fact that there are particular advantages. Not only is there a five-year qualifying period for people who are in the services, who can access a loan of up to 20 years, MAIN COMMITTEE but also for people who have operational or warlike service that five-year qualifying period is waived and the maximum period of the subsidy is up to 25 years. This program has a particular objective, which I have already touched on-to attract and retain ADF personnel, to encourage home ownership during service and to assist members who are in the ADF to reintegrate into the community on their return to service life. This program has been open to permanent Defence Force members who enlisted on or after 15 May 1985. To give members of parliament an idea about how well it is being taken up, the statistics show that the value of Commonwealth subsidy paid through this program in 2003-04 added up to $8.269 million; in 2005-06, $9.289 million was paid through this subsidy, up from a figure of $4.4 million back in 1999-2000. The number of payees has almost doubled in that time, from 3,970 back in 1999-2000 to 6,683 in 2005-06. Statistics for 2003-04 show that at that time 845 people were seeking to buy homes-that shows that it is an effective program-365 were refinancing, five were enlarging their homes, 160 were building their homes and 53 were renovating their homes as a result of this program. It really is a very strong incentive for Defence Force membership and something that I strongly endorse. However, as I said at the outset, there has been a request for quotation put out to the market by the Commonwealth to ask interested organisations-obviously banks and other lendersto prepare a report on the Australian home loan market, to look at the current scheme and at issues such as calculating the net present value of the subsidy available under the defence home ownership scheme and to look at other facets such as a description of the types of home loan products and services out there. At the time that the former Labor government first initiated the home ownership scheme there was not the range of banking options people have today. There was not the range of home ownership and loan providers that are currently out there because of the immense growth that this government has generated in the economy, the immense positive development that we have seen and, of course, the new opportunities. So we want the scheme to be competitive. We want it to be out there in the marketplace doing what it can for these defence personnel so that we are getting the maximum benefit in terms of all those objectives I spoke about earlier. Four options are currently being considered for a scheme to replace the defence homeownership scheme. We are looking at issues such as providing a scheme under which subsidy assistance would not be tied to a particular home loan provider, assistance tied to a single home loan provider or a panel of home loan providers, deposit assistance linked to career retention or mobility points within the defence forces, and an allowance for owner-occupiers. These are the types of options that are out there. There is a website for defence personnel to give feedback on the defence homeownership scheme and this current review. I urge members who have not given their feedback to that I am talking about Defence Force members-to do so, because we do want it to be competitive. I would like to compliment the Defence Families of Australia organisation, because if you go to the website you will find that this organisation has already had quite a bit to say about the shape of the scheme it sees as being worthy going forward. I have the submission of the Defence Families of Australia organisation with me. In their submission to General Evans they say that, of the range of options, they believe that more than one should be available to families because, of course, at different times in people’s lives there are different facets of those options that would be desirable. MAIN COMMITTEE Let’s go through the options and talk about the kinds of things that Defence Families of Australia have had to say. The first option is an open market subsidy. Defence Families of Australia say that the idea of a wider panel gives greater choice in fees, interest rates and accessibility to the provider of choice. They make a very valid point about the great diversity of property values. They cite, for example, the case of considering the cost of housing in Sydney or in Rockingham. They want to see options that take that into account. One option, they say in their submission, may be to link the length of service to the subsidy amount. For example, if you had served in the defence forces for more than five years you might receive a subsidy on $200,000, but if you had served for 10 or more years you might receive a subsidy on $350,000. That sort of incentive, they say-and I think this is a very important point-would be a weighty consideration for someone at the sevento eight-year mark in their stay with the defence forces. It would provide a real incentive for them to stay on, perhaps, for 10 years and thereby overcome what is currently a departure point for Defence Force personnel. The second option is a tied homeowner subsidy. The Defence Families of Australia organisation says that for a lender to qualify to be on a panel under such a program-although, as I said before, you could have just one provider or a panel of providers-that lender should bid for its position on the panel and be reviewed on a regular basis. I think that is a pretty good and perceptive suggestion by Defence Families of Australia. The way the market changes, you do want to have regular updates of their position to be assured that they remain competitive. Under the graduated deposit scheme the Defence Families association says that we could look at a tiered system. For example, if you have served five years you might get five points along the graduated deposit scheme program, but if in that time you have moved three times you might be given an extra three points, giving you a total of eight points towards your entitlement. I think that is a very incisive measure, too. They do speak under option 4, which is about owner-occupier allowances, about the issue of a redraw facility. On that, the Defence Families association makes what I think is a very interesting alternative submission. They say a concept which has not been covered in the papers but which has previously been floated with Defence is a part ownership and lease arrangement with the Defence Housing Authority. There could be a 49 per cent to 51 per cent ownership arrangement, with the member holding 49 per cent and the DHA owning 51 per cent. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I think you will recall only about a year ago this was an idea that was floated more generally by one of the think tanks-I cannot remember which onesuggesting ways by which we could encourage homeownership in Australia more generally. I think the defence homeownership scheme taking up such a suggestion would be a great way to advance the concept out there in the Australian community and perhaps pilot it. I urge the government to consider that opportunity, because of course you are completely reducing the threshold of what it means to get into homeownership in the first place. You are halving it. Why should it be that you have to have 100 per cent in effect to have title over your home? Why shouldn’t it be that you should be able to operate at a 51 per cent level? I think that is a very good submission that comes from Defence Families of Australia and I commend that to the House and to the defence department in considering the various options. (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006 today. In so doing, I would like to talk about the content of the bill but, importantly also, the context of the bill because very little operates MAIN COMMITTEE",144,Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Amendment Bill 2006
210,Mr Fawcett (Wakefield) (11.01 Am),"I would like to rise to support the Defence Forcein isolation. This bill has appropriate measures that have been taken by the government in respect of the context, the environment, that we are working in at the moment. I would then like to look, in contrast, at some of the alternative approaches. Firstly, the content of the bill, as previous members have described, is fairly simple in its outcome, which is to extend the operation of the Defence Home Owner Scheme from 31 December for 12 months. The immediate purpose of this is to permit certificates to be issued so that ADF members can access that assistance up until December 2007. It preserves the entitlement of those people who have not yet accessed it and it gives effect to an agreement between the Commonwealth and National Australia Bank to extend the franchise through until December 2007. This existing scheme provides members of the ADF with a subsidy on the interest and expenses incurred on a home loan to the maximum value of $80,000 and is currently tied to the National Australia Bank. The issue is that it is still tied back to a time when pretty much all home loan lenders were the banks. These days there are a range of institutions which are providing finance and, more importantly, there are a range of ways that finance is presented. I think one of the encouraging things about this review is that it is looking to try to find some of those more innovative ways that will encourage people to retain or remain in the service. In context, this is not a new issue. In fact we can go right back to the establishment of Australia and the First World War and we can see that there are a number of ways that we tried to tie homeownership or landownership with service as an incentive or a recognition of service by Australians. The soldier settler scheme is one. There were war service loans and some old schemes that were in place when I was still serving, such as the $25,000 that was available. In the context of the day, that was a sizeable deposit and contribution on the way to actually owning a home. Obviously in the context of today, $25,000 does not go very far at all, which is why this review is important because it is looking at the context of the cost of living, the style of living, the style of finance. Some of the ideas that are coming forward from the defence community itself are very innovative and I encourage the defence department to accept their comments and consider them seriously and be prepared to move beyond the paradigms that have perhaps governed how we have approached these things in the past. The world out there is moving pretty quickly, and if we want to attract people to remain in defence we need to be giving them the same kinds of innovative and flexible opportunities that many other employers and financial institutions are giving. One good example of that is the concept of a graduated scheme where we recognise what service life has imposed on people in terms of the number of moves or the number of years of service and graduating that towards the level of support that they are given. In context, these measures are important because the issues of recruitment, retention and resettlement are fundamental to the conditions of service for people who volunteer to sign up and serve Australia. These are not new issues. In the days when Britain ruled the waves, they got around their recruitment issues with things like press gangs, which went ashore with a squad of marines and rounded up whomever they could find, took them back to the ship, sailed off and that was it. You were then in the Navy and subject to all those forms of discipline. Even in Australia we have looked at conscription at various times-in World War I, although conscription was rejected; through to Korea and Vietnam, where conscription was MAIN COMMITTEE adopted for a period to overcome recruitment issues. In respect of the contemporary Defence Force, in the late 1980s the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade held an inquiry into the number of people leaving the Defence Force. In a transcript of proceedings in November 1988, Senator Maguire said: ... the wastage rates in Australian Defence Force have for several years now significantly exceeded historical levels ... Even in our contemporary environment we can see that it is not a new problem to be looking for ways to encourage people to remain in the Defence Force. An issue that comes out later in that transcript is an important one for us to understand in the broader context of retaining people and maintaining a capability in the Defence Force. Senator Maguire said later: A central issue there is the pattern of wastage, that is, who is leaving and when. It is also important to remember that the lead time to replace a highly skilled and trained individual can be at least as long as that required to introduce into service an item of capital equipment. Further in the document, he said: The extent and magnitude of wastage in some areas is such that it will adversely affect the ADF for at least the next decade. In sum, the effects of wastage identified by the Joint Committee amount to a loss of operational capability. It is manifestly obvious that the prevailing excessive level of personnel wastage is damaging the organisational health of the ADF. Wastage is undermining the experience and competence levels of personnel. That finding was made back in the late 1980s and I guess that was the genesis for the development of some of these incentives, including the 40 per cent discount on home loans-the amount after May 1985 that went up to $40,000. It is interesting to note, though, that the press article in the Sydney Morning Herald that announced the 40 per cent discount also noted that a member of the public would pay 16 per cent whereas a member of the Defence Force would pay only 9.6 per cent. I am glad to say, in the context of today, that on the open market you can get interest rates of well under eight per cent without any subsidy. It is important to also consider, having recognised this problem with wastage-the loss of skills and competence in the ADF was affecting capability-what the Labor government did. A corporate support program was initiated in the early nineties, and the downsizing of the ADF from 1989 to 1995 by some 6,500 had a big impact on the capability, experience levels and moral of the ADF. Some of those impacts, particularly with CSP, continue today. They also have an impact on the recruitment and retention of people within the ADF. To contrast that, there has been a good investment by this government in obvious areas of the ADF. The 2006-07 budget committed some $194 million over four years to boost recruitment and retention, with bonus payments for key personnel in 31 selected trades; rehabilitation programs for injured personnel; the raising of the awareness of high school students and cadets in the large range of careers available within the ADF; and revisiting and reinvesting in options-whether through the regular forces or the reserve forces-for people to get a technical trades qualification with the ADF. So this boost in funding aimed specifically at recruitment and retention is important. The investment in raising two new battalions is important in reducing some of the pressures that are on people’s operational tempo, which has a direct impact on their families and on their willingness to remain in the ADF. Those are important measures. It is also important to see, though, that in the capital acquisition program for Defence, in the defence capability plan for 2006 to 2016, there is some MAIN COMMITTEE $2.4 billion, which continues the additional three per cent funding over 10 years that was announced in the 2000 white paper. The important thing to notice here, though, is that we are not just talking about equipment. It is vital that in each of our equipment decisions we also consider the impact on personnel and the requirement of personnel to make that a capability. The Army for a long time has used the posted construct where it looks at a capability as consisting of the people as well as the organisation, the support, the training, the equipment and the doctrine that goes with that. So, as we look at things like the $3.7 billion that has been put aside to reduce the number of helicopters in ADF use, that is not just about modernising the fleet. It is important to see that one of the underpinning elements of that decision is to make sure that in terms of our training system and our support system-even through to operational levels-we are reducing the number of personnel and the number of trade sets that are required to support a capability. Where you can have common training systems and common logistic systems you are reducing the requirement for the total number of people, which frees us up to move those people into other areas of Defence that desperately need people to commit to the Defence Force. In a similar manner, the ADF’s maritime patrol aircraft, the replacement for the Orion, will be looking not only at a manned platform but at UAVs-unmanned aerial vehicles. I was recently down at Edingburgh at one of the trials that was launched out of Edinburgh to operate off the North West Shelf. That is going to see us obtain a reconnaissance and particularly a surveillance capability that will be operating for extended periods over remote areas with a requirement for far fewer people-both on the platform and maintaining it. So there are a number of ways we can be smarter about the way we purchase equipment such that we are smarter about our requirement for personnel within the ADF. Moving on from the purchase of equipment, the next area that is important to look at is the investment in defence industry, because defence industry forms an important part of our capability. Part of the skilling and training of our people is to give defence industry the capability to respond quickly to government requirements. And that quick response and appropriate equipment protects our people in the field and gives them the confidence that this government is looking after their interests and giving them the equipment they need to carry out the tasks that we assign to them. So, although it seems a bit far removed from recruitment and retention issues, even the investment that this government is making through the Skilling Australia’s Defence Industry program, SADI, is an important step to making sure that we are providing the right people with the right skills to support our men and women in uniform so that they have confidence, and so that their families have confidence that this is a place where their husbands and wives, and sons and daughters, should enlist and work to serve this country. So there are a number of ways that this government has taken significant decisions to support defence industry and the whole defence industry roundtable-which has been kicked off again-to look at the best way we can engage with industry. It is just one more plank. Again, from a systems engineering perspective it is one more interface that the government needs to be working with to make sure that recruitment and retention issues for our people are addressed. MAIN COMMITTEE So, whilst I welcome this bill-and particularly the intent behind it to have a review to give our servicemen and servicewomen more options in terms of how defence can reward their service to the country, with options to support their housing-there is more to be done, particularly in the area of overcoming some of the unintended consequences of decisions from the late 1980s with the CSP program and the way that that has broken the chain of command in some areas. It has turned a lot of our leaders into managers and taken away their focus from command to managing stakeholder relationships. Both the department and the government need to be prepared to challenge some of the mores and the fads, if you like, in the business community of the late 1980s and bring back the balance, not only in the policies such as the housing assistance but also in the force structures and the personnel, to make our Defence Force a place of first choice to work for the young men and women of Australia. ter for Defence) (11.15 am)-in reply-Thank you for your invitation to sum up the debate. I would like to thank all those contributors from both sides of the chamber. Many of the contributions remind us about the etymology of the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill 2006, how things have changed and the influences on what encourages and rewards members of the Australian defence forces to join, perform magnificently and then extend their career within the ADF. Many of the contributions, particularly the very insightful and well-informed contribution from the member for Wakefield, touched on those things. There is an interconnectedness of many themes and challenges and I tried to say that our goal should be to make sure that we have the world’s best ADF, involving world-class people that have fulfilling experiences in their careers with the defence forces. There are a range of influences on that, such as making sure that they are properly supported, properly equipped and properly remunerated in a contemporary and competitive labour market. We must have due regard, as I said in the House yesterday, for the fact that we might recruit the member but we need not only to retain the member but to retain their family. I know your good self, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, and Mrs Scott is probably as influential as Mrs Billson is, in that I might have many good ideas, but if she is in my earhole, as I imagine if Mrs Scott is in yours, that is very persuasive. This recognises the crucial role of families and the support of families in making sure that the assistance is there for those who are members of the ADF, recognising the many other aspirations they have for their lives. This particular bill touches on one of those matters. A number of speakers talked about the history and have shown some understanding of the changes not only in the property market and the finance market but in the nature and tempo of what is being asked of our men and women of the ADF. All of these have an impact on how well a benefit such as is embraced in the Defence HomeOwner Scheme plays out, rewards, recognises and supports those members of the ADF. That complexity and those interrelated factors are many, and that is why the review that the government has instigated to look at the best future shape of the homeownership assistance scheme is so important. But that complexity also means the work needs to be done well, and this bill seeks to provide that opportunity. Of course, we all would have liked this extensive review to have been concluded so that we could seamlessly transition from the current scheme MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Amendment Bill 2006
211,Mr Billson (Dunkley,"Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Minister Assisting the Ministo the future arrangements. But, given the complexity of the issues that have been touched on in the debate, that has not been possible, and that is why we are seeking this extension. I welcome the opposition’s contribution, where they largely echoed the government’s statements about what we are seeking to do, the aspirations we have for the homeownership assistance scheme for members of the ADF and the influences and options that need to be considered. My colleague the member for Blair has a very substantial population of serving members and their families in his electorate and his comments were quite insightful and very well placed and well informed as well. I commend him for that contribution. The member for FisherI think addressed some of the incorrect assertions of the member for Barton, talking about military bases being placed willy-nilly around the country in marginal seats, and I am grateful for the member for Fisher’s considered response, because we all know that kind of loose talk is completely unhelpful and undermines the great deal of analysis that goes into placing military installations and equipping them to meet the national security and defence challenges of our nation. Let me remind us all of why we are here discussing this legislation. The Defence HomeOwner Scheme is being reviewed with the aim of updating the scheme to make it more supportive of personnel recruitment, retention and resettlement. Defence is seeking to identify ways of improving the current homeowner scheme, which has been in place since 1991. Our aim is to develop a contemporary homeownership scheme that will support Defence Force recruitment, retention and resettlement, recognising the changes in the property market, the finance market and other influences on the scheme itself. The existing loan franchise arrangement with the National Australia Bank was due to expire on 31 December this year. Agreement has been reached to extend the contract by 12 months while Defence finalises proposals for a new scheme. Of course, the Australian Defence Force members may still access subsidised housing loans while replacement arrangements are being contemplated and developed. Accordingly, enabling legislation for that purpose was introduced to extend the legal authority to issue certificates of entitlement until 31 December 2007. I look forward to being able to bring a revised arrangement for consideration into this place in the new year. All of us in this place would agree our combined intent is to recognise and support our outstanding men and women of the Australian defence forces. On that, we are one. We admire their work, we respect their competence, we commit ourselves to support them in their important work in our national interest and I commend the bill to the Committee. Question agreed to. Bill read a second time. Message from the Governor General recommending appropriation announced. Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment. MAIN COMMITTEE Second Reading Heritage) (11.21 am)-I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill. I move: That this bill be now read a second time. The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006 amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the BSA, and the Radiocommunications Act 1992, the Radcoms Act, to provide a framework to implement the model agreed with WIN and Prime for the conversion of their commercial television broadcasting services in regional and remote Western Australia from analog to digital. The bill will facilitate, as part of the digital conversion model, the joint provision by WIN and Prime of a new, third digital commercial television service under section 38B of the BSA for people living outside Perth. For the first time, regional Western Australians will be able to enjoy a level of television services similar to those currently enjoyed by viewers in Perth. The bill will extend the same arrangements to the commercial broadcasters in the other remote licence area, remote Central and Eastern Australia, should those broadcasters choose a similar digital television conversion model for their market. The BSA currently does not specify detailed measures for the introduction of digital television services in remote areas. This was in recognition of the need to give consideration to the special circumstances of remote areas. The Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, is required to make a legislative instrument-a Commercial Television Conversion Scheme-to set out the terms of that conversion process. In addition, section 38B of the BSA allows commercial broadcasters in licence areas with only two commercial licences to jointly-or one broadcaster individually-elect to provide a third, digital-only service. Under the current provisions, where they elect to do so jointly, they must provide each of the digital versions of their analog services, and the new joint service, on a separate television channel, and provide high definition television-HDTV-programs. Items1 to 8 of schedule 1 to the bill contain amendments to the BSA that define the circumstances where remote area licensees can elect to provide a section 38B service. Remote area licensees who have elected to provide jointly a section 38B service will be able to multichannel the three commercial digital services on a single radiofrequency channel, with exemption from HDTV quotas. Similarly, if the section 38B service is provided by only one of the two licensees, that licensee will be able to multichannel the digital version of their analog service and the section 38B service on a single digital channel. This represents a significant saving for the licensees concerned. Instead of having to establish and maintain two or three sets of digital transmission infrastructure, with capacity for HDTV, they will be able to establish only one shared set of infrastructure, without the additional cost of investing in HDTV equipment. This also represents significant cost savings in respect of the public purse because funding assistance to the broadcasters under the government’s Regional Equalisation Plan, REP, to help meet digital conversion costs is reduced, corresponding with the reduced digital converMAIN COMMITTEE",151,Defence Force Home Loans Assistance Amendment Bill 2006

213,Mr Hunt (Flinders,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment andsion costs to broadcasters. Nevertheless, the government will provide substantial REP assistance to WIN and Prime of $19.36 million over eight years to support the implementation of their digital conversion model in regional and remote Western Australia. Items9 to 11 of schedule 1 to the bill contain corresponding amendments to the Radiocommunications Act relating to the transmitter licences that authorise the operation of WIN and Prime’s shared set of digital transmitters in regional and remote Western Australia. Passage of this legislation will enable ACMA to proceed to develop the Commercial Television Conversion Scheme for Western Australian regional and remote areas, allowing digital broadcasting to commence in these areas and the new services to be provided. The digital television conversion model, which would be enabled by passage of the bill, represents a balance between public interest considerations and the special circumstances of remote area commercial television broadcasters. These broadcasters face significant cost pressures due to the wide geographic areas they service and the sparse population. Delivery of HDTV to all viewers in this market would be a very significant cost to broadcasters. Viewers will benefit from the new third digital service, delivering a substantially increased range of information and entertainment. Nevertheless, the bill makes specific provision for remote commercial broadcasters to change their digital transmission arrangements in the future to provide HDTV services, if they choose to do so. This bill represents a further demonstration of the government’s commitment to facilitate the availability of digital television broadcasting services throughout Australia. I congratulate the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Helen Coonan, on her work. I thank the members of her department and I am delighted to commend this bill to the Committee. Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006. Labor welcomes the fact this legislation has finally made it to the floor of this Committee. This short bill contains a number of technical amendments, which should allow the commencement of digital television services in remote parts of Western Australia. If this legislation is passed, people in places such as Geraldton and Kalgoorlie will be able to enjoy a similar range of services to people who live in Perth. They will also, for the first time, be able to enjoy superior picture and sound quality offered by digital television. Labor supports the objective and will support this bill through the Committee. Digital television broadcast commenced in metropolitan Australia in 2001 and broadcasters in most regional areas of Australia began transmission in 2004. The rollout of infrastructure for digital broadcasting has progressed well since. The free-to-air digital TV is available to about 85 per cent of Australian households and the state capitals and around 31 regional centres have access to all of their existing free-to-air television channels in digital. However, there are currently no provisions in the Broadcasting Services Act which establishes a framework for establishing digital television in the remote parts of Australia. These are large areas of territory that are serviced by only two commercial broadcasters. In places like outback Western Australia, the population is disbursed over long distances and broadcasters need to invest in many transmission sites in order to reach their audience. This legislation MAIN COMMITTEE",153,Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2006
214,Mr Ripoll (Oxley) (11.28 Am),"I rise to speak on the Broadcasting Legislationseeks to reduce the costs of making that investment and improves incentives for remote broadcasters to invest in digital transmission equipment. I turn to a couple of specifics in the bill. The bill provides that, in remote licence areas, broadcasters will be permitted, either individually or through the establishment of a joint venture company, to broadcast a new digital-only service. The new service will also broadcast the digital version of the existing analog services on the same channel. In technical terms, that is what is known as multichannelling. Digital broadcasting is about six times more efficient than analog broadcasting in its use of specific spectrum. Broadcasters will also be able to comfortably transmit three digital services within the space occupied by one analog channel. The bill also contains a further measure to reduce the cost of establishing a new digital service in remote Australia. In metropolitan and regional markets, licensees are required to broadcast 1,040 hours per year in high-definition digital format. The costs of triple-castingthat is, broadcasting in analog, standard definition digital and high-definition digital-are of course substantial. This is particularly the case for small broadcasters. To address this issue, the bill allows remote licensees to elect to broadcast only in standard definition format. The ability to opt out of high-definition broadcasting will significantly reduce the cost of providing digital services in remote areas. Labor understands that, on the basis of the provisions of the bill, Prime and WIN have indicated that they will form a joint venture company to introduce a new digital-only service in remote Western Australia in 2007-next year. The new service will consist primarily of content from the Ten Network that is seen in Perth. Over time, these changes could lead to the commencement of digital services in other remote licence areas in the Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales. Labor welcomes these measures to give broadcasters and viewers an incentive to invest in digital television and will support their passage through the House. I would like to take the opportunity provided by this bill to also make some comments on broader aspects of digital television. The policy changes that are required in this area are obviously not limited to digital television. It is now more than five years since free-to-air digital television broadcasts began in this country. Unfortunately, the take-up has been disappointingly low and slow. According to industry data, about 25 per cent of households have purchased the necessary equipment to receive terrestrial digital free-to-air broadcasts. If you add in the households that receive digital television through pay TV, take-up rises to around 30 per cent, but not all these households can receive the digital free-to-air channels as well. Back in 2000, the government set a target to switch off analog broadcasting by the end of 2008, which today is not too far away. Of course, it has been clear for some time that there is no way this target can be met. No government could turn off analog broadcasts and leave millions of families staring at blank screens, with useless equipment. The government has accepted that the digital television policies that it has pursued for the last eight years have failed. In July, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts announced that she had postponed the analog switch-off until some time between 2010 and 2012. For many in the community, the switch to digital television is a somewhat esoteric issue. There is a very low level of awareness in the community about the benefits of digital television and why it matters-not just for viewers but also for the broadcasting industry and the economy in MAIN COMMITTEE general, and I think that is a view held by most people on both sides of the House. It is certainly my personal view as well as that of the broader Labor Party. As I mentioned earlier, digital broadcasting is far more efficient in its use of sparse spectrum. There are large gains to be made, though, from freeing up the spectrum currently used for analog broadcasting for alternative services. Reclaimed spectrum could be used to provide a host of new services to the community. The part of the spectrum used by broadcasting is known in the industry as ‘the sweet spot’. Its characteristics mean that it is perfect for wireless broadband. In the future, business and consumers will want to be able to get broadband any time, anywhere. There is a clear direction and a path in view of that. We need to make sure that there is sufficient spectrum to provide these new services as they become needed. Reclaimed spectrum could also be used to deliver several new television channels and increase choice for consumers. This is particularly important, I think, for consumers in regional and rural areas or in remote parts of Australia. These could be community channels, channels catering to special interests or in fact new commercial networks. In the digital divide, the benefit of redeploying the spectrum currently used for analog broadcasting could be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Australia. In Britain, for example, the government has estimated that overcoming the digital divide is worth up to £2.2 billion to their economy. We do not know what size the benefit could be for Australia because the government simply has not made an effort to calculate or pursue that. This is, of course, not a surprise: a study of the benefits of digital transmission would only highlight the real cost to Australia of the flawed policies that the government has pursued over the last few years which have in fact held back digital television. Rapid transition to digital is important for the local television production industry. In countries like the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany, consumers are rapidly embracing digital applications like interactive television. We only need look at the internet and sites like YouTube and others that are making headlines around the world to see the rapid pace at which consumers will adapt and adopt new technologies if given the opportunity. I think Australia would be in that same category. Again, I say this would be a real bonus, a real choice for consumers, particularly in regional parts. I note the member for Hinkler in the chamber, and I am assuming he would agree that it would give more choice and more opportunities for rural consumers. If the producers of Australian content do not keep up with these developments this country is at risk of losing lucrative export markets. Exports have historically played an important role in underpinning domestic production. A lengthy transition to digital television also imposes a direct cost on the Commonwealth budget. According to the government’s own figures, every year around $75 million is required to meet the analog broadcasting costs of the ABC and SBS and to assist regional broadcasters. The economic case for switching to digital is clear-without putting a pun on it! It should be a national priority to achieve the switch-over to digital as soon as possible, as soon as practicable, and the government should be working very hard in that direction. If we are to achieve switch-over by 2012 the government needs to develop a set of policies to drive a rapid takeup, education and an explanation of what the benefits are. I do not think the vast majority of consumers have got any idea why they should spend any money to go to digital. We actually get quite a decent service as it is, so if they do not know the benefits they are not going to switch over. Digital take-up in Australia lags far behind comparable countries. As I said beMAIN COMMITTEE fore, the United States, Britain, Germany, Ireland, Canada, Norway and Sweden are all countries way ahead of us in the game. Last month the minister announced that the government would develop a digital action plan for take-up. This plan is long overdue. Let us see what the government will provide. The government needs to provide some detail on how switch-over will be coordinated. Consumers need to understand how this will actually work. A concerted effort needs to be made to increase consumer awareness of the process of digital transmission and its benefits. A survey conducted last year by the Australian Communications and Media Authority shows that there is much work to be done. It found that about 17 per cent of responders had never heard of digital television, 45 per cent did not know if digital television services were even available in their area, 42 per cent said they were just not interested in switching to digital and 38 per cent were not aware that digital television would replace the current analog service. They are pretty frightening figures. There is still no requirement that analog equipment will be properly labelled so that consumers will know that it needs to be replaced or converted when the switch-over occurs. Another significant policy gap is the fact that no details have been provided on what assistance will be available to the disadvantaged who are left behind when the switch-over occurs. In the US, the congress allocated nearly $US1 billion for subsidies for the purchase of set-top boxes. In Britain, £400,000 has been set aside from the BBC licence fees to assist the disadvantaged to switch over. So the task of achieving digital switch-over is a huge policy challenge and does involve a cost to government. In the UK, where 72 per cent of households have access to digital TV, it has been estimated that only 40 per cent of televisions have actually been converted. Evidence from Australia and around the world has also shown that the best way to drive up digital take-up is to allow media companies to provide consumers with access to attractive new content. So far the government has made only modest steps in this direction. The government has said that there will be new digital services but has provided little detail on the services that will be permitted. On Tuesday the minister stated that the new in-home digital channels will be datacasting or narrowcasting services. Labor is concerned that the conditions on the minister’s promised new and innovative services will be so restrictive that they will not be attractive to media companies or prospective viewers, and you can easily understand any associated problems if that were to be the case. The minister has talked about niche services like a boating channel or a classified advertising channel. While these services will attract some consumers, it is highly unlikely that narrow services like these will attract significant numbers of people to invest in digital set-top boxes. You also have to ask whether it is good value for taxpayers to tie up hundreds of millions of dollars worth of valuable spectrum providing services of such narrow appeal. Labor does welcome the government’s decision to allow free-to-air broadcasters to run a second digital-only channel. In the UK, multichannelling has been the main driver of digital take-up, and it should be noted for Australia. For the one-off cost of a set-top box, British consumers are able to access around 30 digital channels. The government has sought to restrict multichannelling, however, in a way which will limit the potential of the new multichannelling to drive consumer take-up. Until 2009, broadcasters will be able to multichannel only in highdefinition format. High-definition equipment is at least three times more expensive than stanMAIN COMMITTEE dard definition equipment, a cost that most family households cannot afford. Only around seven per cent of Australian households have actually got HD equipment. It must be doubtful whether any commercial broadcaster will target a market so small in size. The government has also agreed to relax the absurd genre restrictions which currently limit what the ABC and SBS can show on their digital channels. Labor welcomes this direction. Lifting the genre restrictions is a policy that the opposition has advocated since before the last election. As always, it is good to see government taking up good opposition policies in areas such as this and others. Under the current rules the ABC and SBS are permitted to multichannel. The ABC has used these provisions to establish ABC2, and SBS has launched a World News Channel. Labor commends the ABC and SBS for trying to drive digital take-up despite their limited resources and challenges from government. To date, the efforts of the national broadcasters to stimulate consumer interest in digital TV have been hamstrung by the restrictive rules which limit their programming. The ABC cannot show a national news bulletin, national current affairs programs or drama on ABC2. Similarly, while SBS can broadcast foreign language bulletins on its World News Channel, it is not able to broadcast English language bulletins from countries like Germany, Israel or New Zealand. The genre restrictions make distinctions which are arbitrary and illogical. For example, ABC2 is permitted to broadcast public policy programs, such as Insiders, but not current affairs programs, like The 7.30 Report. In the UK, extra channels and interactive services offered by the BBC have made an important contribution to generating consumer demand for digital. Under its new charter, the BBC will be given a leading role in building a digital Britain. Labor believes that our national broadcasters need to be given the regulatory freedom and financial resources to undertake a similar task in Australia. In July, the minister announced as part of her media package the government’s intention to relax the genre restrictions. As I said, the announcement is welcome, but extra funding is also needed if the ABC and SBS are to make the most of digital broadcasting. In the last budget, however, the government rejected bids by the ABC and SBS to produce new digital content. The government should go back and re-examine this decision so that the national broadcasters can play a significant role in driving digital take-up across the country. In conclusion, it does have to be noted that the government has been extremely tardy in progressing the changes contained in this bill through the parliament. We hear a lot of noise from those opposite about their commitment to regional and remote Australia, but the practical measures contained in this bill have been very low on their list of priorities. The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) was introduced into the other place in June 2005. It was not until August 2006 that the government saw fit to bring it on for debate. Since July 2005, the Howard government has had a majority in the Senate. Since it took control of the Senate, the government has made time in the program for things that it really cares about but not for others. It made time to ram through the legislation for the full sale of Telstra. It has made time to pass its extreme industrial relations legislation. These are the things that have been the government’s priorities this term: setting up the fire sale of Telstra, cutting workers’ penalty rates and allowing workers to be unfairly dismissed. This is the real reason why sensible, practical measures like the ones contained in this bill have been delayed for so long. Labor is pleased that the government has finally given this legislation an opportuMAIN COMMITTEE nity to be debated. Labor will be supporting this bill so that remote digital television services can begin to be rolled out across remote parts of Australia. 1) 2006 will help expand the range of television services available to people living in remote areas of Australia and was developed with communities in remote Western Australia specifically in mind. In effect, the bill was developed to allow commercial television broadcasting licensees in remote licence areas to jointly multichannel their digital services, if they chose to do so. It will also give a single broadcaster the option of providing a third digital-only service as an individual entity under section 38B of the Broadcasting Services Act. These amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992 will give licensees an exemption from any mandatory high-definition quotas where they elect to provide a third digital-only commercial service and multichannel their digital television services. This bill was developed with the specific cases of WIN and Prime in Western Australia in mind, where they are converting their television services from analog to digital in remote areas of Western Australia. It will allow these two broadcasters to adopt more flexible technical and programming solutions in the outlying areas of Western Australia by letting them share digital transmission infrastructure. I commend this. I think it is a very practical and sensible measure. The government recognises that regional commercial broadcasters face proportionately greater costs in establishing digital television compared, say, with those in metropolitan areas. It just stands to reason that anywhere in regional Australia, in country areas, economies of scale will be a lot more strained, but when you get to Western Australia they are strained even further. To illustrate this, in Prime’s case I understand that around 200 digital transmitters are needed to stretch across regional Australia for it to reach a potential audience of 4.8 million people. In comparison, a mere half-a-dozen transmitters are required by Sydney metropolitan broadcasters to reach almost the same number-a potential, in that case, of 4.3 million people. So here you have 200 transmitters for 4.8 million people and there you have six or so transmitters for nearly 4½ million people. When you consider the costs associated with broadcasting digital transmissions, licensees in remote areas have the additional expense of installing satellite and microwave bearer networks, which are needed to deliver the broadcast signal to the transmitters. Of course, other things like maintenance are also a quite heavy burden. I welcome the government’s contribution of $19 million towards this program. It was long awaited and will be of great benefit to people in the remote parts of Western Australia-in fact, just about all of Western Australia outside the Perth area. The measures contained in the bill have been drafted to allow incumbent broadcasters in a two-commercial operated regional market to jointly or individually provide a third digitalonly television service. That is not just for Western Australia; parts of the Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales have similar problems. Licensees electing to provide a third jointly operated service will do so using a full seven megahertz digital channel and will be subject to the requirements to provide a quota of programming in highdefinition digital mode. However, if one of the licensees individually provides the additional service, under section 38B that licensee can choose to multichannel the digital transmission of the parent service and provide the new service in standard definition digital mode using a single seven megahertz channel, with an exemption from high-definition television requirements. MAIN COMMITTEE",154,Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2006
215,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (11.44 Am),"The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No.Some purists will say, ‘That’s not good enough for the bush.’ I think this is a very good compromise. Standard definition is going to be such an improvement over the current analog services, especially in a remote area, that I think most people will be more than happy and grateful to have it. I, for one, am not a great devotee of the high-definition medium itself, although I recognise that a lot of people want it. I like digital television for the range of services that it can potentially provide. The arrangements we have been talking about, which would soften the rules, might not have been in the best interests of the television stations-or the viewers in remote parts of Australia-if the stations had been pinned down to more prescriptive transmission requirements. Had there not been common sense on the part of existing broadcasters and the government, people in the remote areas of Western Australia may never have seen the best features of digital television. The needs of audiences in regional Australia coupled with the regulatory requirements for local content prohibit regional broadcasters from simply providing a homogenised program and advertising feed to all regional areas. They should not be allowed to do that anyhow. As much localism as possible should be introduced into news bulletins, for example, and advertising should be relevant to the market. It is a criticism of some of the satellite services that you get advertising that is in no way relevant to your area. Regional broadcasters have an obligation to service their smaller submarkets in order to meet audience need and to comply with government regulations. They must also be able to maintain their commercial viability, which is the other side of the coin. All Australians, regardless of where they live, should have access to a superior television viewing experience, and that superior experience comes from digital services. Digital television offers viewers greater picture clarity and enhanced sound. Digital television is broadcast in wide-screen format-the 9:16 ratio-which certainly gives you a greatly enhanced picture. It also has the capacity for subsidiary channels, multichannelling and interactive services and will eventually deliver different forms of datacasting which will extend the function of our television sets. The member for Oxley made some interesting points. I stand to be corrected on this, but I think the government’s original intention was that the switch-off date would not be for 10 years and that either an agreement with, or an amendment by, the Democrats brought that back to 2008. Certainly 2010 is a more realistic date. I hope that it does not go out to 2012. I favour some further relaxation of multichannelling. I know there are balances in multichannelling between the free-to-airs-the ABC and SBS and the commercials-on the one hand and pay television on the other hand. I am not suggesting that there should be a bloodbath in that respect. But while I welcome the multichannelling announcement of the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the ArtsI urge her and the government to bring that forward as much as possible. If we want people to take up digital television we must provide them with a greater television experience. My view is that, notwithstanding the fact that the ABC’s second channel and SBS’s news channel are both good services, they need greater enhancement. I welcome the lifting of the genre restrictions on the ABC and SBS and I think, as the member for Oxley said, there is a case for increasing the funding of the ABC so it can build good programming formats around the lifting of the genre restrictions. I welcomed in this year’s budget the extra $88 million to the ABC which allowed it to put $13 million into country areas and $30 million into drama. I thought that was a great thing. If the ABC is not doing drama at a high standard it will be hard to get other people in Australia MAIN COMMITTEE to do it. We should provide avenues for the young people we train in this country to have a future in theatre and television. We can do that only if we enhance the new mediums in such a way that drama is called for. A second digital channel-not only for the ABC and SBS but perhaps even for the commercials-would give the drama and production industry of television a great boost. As I have said, we need localism wherever possible. We need diversity and we need competition. In Western Australia, for example, there will now be three commercial channels to choose from. We should bring forward the multichannelling agenda. That is important from the point of view of encouraging the public to buy sets. IfI were a passive person-identified, like the member for Oxley was, from that survey-I do not think that I would be rushing out to buy a digital television set. One of the things I would like to see in the three commercial sectors would be a subsidiary channel showing two football games on a Sunday. Why are we restricted to one? Why can we not have the game of the day in high definition and the second game on a subsidiary channel? Say there is a game of state or interstate interest. In the NRL, for example, if the Broncos are playing the Cowboys there will be great Queensland interest. If two South Australian teams are playing in the AFL there will be a great deal of intrastate interest. It is a bit strange that we cannot have a second game on the subsidiary channel. It is a great medium. We have great sport in this country. All three of the commercial channels from time to time have paid huge money for broadcasting rights. It is churlish to have tough or tougher antisiphoning rules on the one hand and to restrict the ability in some ways of the television stations to be able to get the maximum benefit out of live television on the other. I am not suggesting, in using a multichannelling facility, that we should necessarily allow two night games. I am talking about Saturday, Sunday and public holidays. Perhaps at night the channels should be required to show a regular program and one game. These things have to be kept in balance. Also, as I said before, the brakes on these things should be taken off with consideration being given to keeping a spirit of balance between the commercials and pay television in the market. You cannot just throw all the balls in the air and hope they will come down with a spirit of fairness. I also welcome channel A, the digital data facility. I think there is a great opportunity there. In addition to good data services, stock exchange and weather information, rural reports and so on, news with 10-minute film inserts will be of great benefit to busy people who want to get things on the television set. There is a good case for multichannelling. I may be speculating, but a little further down the track, in the markets we have just been talking about in today’s debate, we could give incentives to extend digital data services into remote areas. That might be something that the minister and the department could look into now, rather than have the criticism we have experienced today of leaving this a bit late. We will also have channel B, which will be for handheld devices. You have only to see how young people are engaging with these new forms of communication-the internet, television, iPods and all sorts of other things-to know that that will eventually become a very popular medium. I also welcome the minister’s announcement that channel B will go onto a neutral platform and that there will be strict access arrangements. I think access arrangements in Australia could be a lot better in a lot of fields, not just in broadcast communications but also in telecommunications. I have great ambivalence about what has been going on with Telstra; I MAIN COMMITTEE also think that the pay agenda on television could have been handled a lot better and a lot more fairly when that was rolled out some years ago. I will not comment further on that, because it is a matter before the courts, other than to make that general observation. You can see that we are moving into very interesting times, and for people in remote Western Australia this is the first step forward. I would encourage the government and the department not only to look at providing this third channel for people in remote Western Australia and later on in other remote parts of Australia but also to see how we can get other services to them so that in the fullness of time they too can enjoy the benefits of digital television. I commend the bill to the Main Committee. some comments from the member for Hinkler which I found resonated very much with those of us who sit on this side of the political divide. When the member referred to considering the matters of diversity, localism and competition to be of great importance, all I can say is hear, hear and amen. He went on to remark later in his speech that he had some ambivalence about Telstra; I think we share some of that ambivalence. I do want to acknowledge that the member for Hinkler has played a very constructive role, particularly for his constituents, in the debate and in the deliberations and policy outcomes as a consequence of the activity in this parliament, and in the introduction of other legislation concerning media which has been the subject of an enormous amount of public interest. But notwithstanding his comments, as he would be well aware, Labor still retains very strong concerns about the impact of the overall media package. I also want to make some reference to the remarks of the member for Hinkler in encouraging the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts to consider both the timelines on the switch-off from analog to digital and those issues that both the minister and the department need to give some consideration to in order to expedite that. I will return to that a little later on in my comments when I refer to the inquiry into the uptake of digital television in Australia, which I, the member for Werriwa and others sat on and which brought down some recommendations that we thought were pretty useful in this debate. The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2006 amends the Broadcasting Services Act and it will allow commercial television licensees in remote licence areas the opportunity to multichannel their digital service-and that certainly will be a good thing for people in these remote licence areas. The fact that we have the possibility, in fact the likelihood, of a third commercial service coming into a remote licence area is certainly something Labor support and, as a consequence of course, we support the bill. I want to make one comment at the beginning of this speech-that is, to encourage licensees, in particular if using Channel 10 material, to consider the broadcasting requirements which I think are both implicit and explicit in parts of the act but certainly are implicit in the exercise of the licence, particularly going into remote areas. A number of these areas will be places with high Indigenous populations, and it is very likely that over time, given population growth amongst Indigenous communities in remote Australia, particularly in Northern Australia, there will be a substantial viewing audience that is constituted by Indigenous people. I think any licensee has a primary responsibility to respond to that audience-and I know they will certainly wish to be aware of that audience’s needs-but also to be aware of the circumstances that those communities find themselves in, particularly with their viewing patterns MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2006
216,Mr Garrett (Kingsford Smith) (12.01 Pm),"I will take the opportunity to respond toand viewing habits and the kind of material and information that they may need delivered in the best way that media can, not only to entertain but also to inform and educate. It strikes me that that is an extremely important part of the overall responsibilities that a licensee would have. If, in fact, it is Golden West Network and WIN in Western Australia that will jointly launch a digital service to remote parts of Western Australia, this obviously becomes important. With towns like Kalgoorlie, Port Hedland and Geraldton getting the benefit of a new service commencing in 2007, as we understand, with a lot of Ten Network sourcing material, it will be particularly important for the licensees to consider the nature of the material they are sourcing and the impact and good purpose that that material will serve to that viewing audience. But there is no doubt that regional viewers will get high-quality digital TV and an extra commercial television service, and that is a good thing. We also hope that these changes will lead to other digital services being taken up in other remote licence areas, including the Northern Territory, Queensland and Tasmania. Certainly, the take-up of digital television means that spectrum can be returned for other services. We are really on the cusp of a quite exciting period, albeit challenging and in some ways frustrating because of some of the policy deficiencies of the Howard government. Nevertheless, it certainly is an exciting period more generally in terms of media access, media delivery, content delivery and the different technological models that are going to be available particularly once we have a freeing up of spectrum. I certainly see a very valuable role to be played in remote Australia for community broadcasting in particular, and that is something to be greatly encouraged. I was alarmed to see that the one aspect of the community broadcasting program delivery content that was not given the support that it needed in the last budget brought down by the Treasurer related to the Australian music programs which could be networked across community broadcasting. I think they have played a very valuable role for both Indigenous and nonIndigenous performers and musicians to have their music heard in remote areas, and it was regrettable indeed that the resources for that program in particular were greatly reduced in the budget allocation. I want to pick up very quickly on one of the comments from the previous speaker, the member for Hinkler, when he spoke about the desirability of making sure that the ABC, in this rapidly changing media landscape, is given sufficient resources to enable it to fulfil its functions, particularly with the additional capacity that it now has. I make the point that the additional funds that were made available in the last budget, including those funds that were directed into remote Australia and, in addition, the funds that would be identified for the production of drama content, were welcomed by us, but I think it needs to be acknowledged again here that they came on the back of some significant funding restrictions that had been part of the Howard government’s policy since the time that it took office. So, really, that was the government playing a little bit of catch-up, recognising in fact that by starving the ABC of funds up to that point in time it had to do something, particularly given the deficit of local drama and local stories appearing on the ABC, which traditionally had been one of the nurseries of film talent, television talent, writing, producing, acting and so on. I very much want to endorse the remarks of the member for Hinkler when he pointed out that the need for a greater MAIN COMMITTEE enhancement of the ABC’s capacity is an absolutely essential prerequisite for the ongoing policy output in this new and changed media landscape. One of the things that is interesting in this debate is that digital TV has not been taken up in any big way by the Australian population. Even though digital free-to-air TV is available to about 85 per cent of Australian homes, the take-up has been particularly poor here. I think the government must bear some responsibility for that, including the business of dates of switchoff, which has confused many of the public. In any event, under this bill, hopefully there will be more incentive for remote broadcasters because there is the capacity for multichannelling. In metropolitan and regional areas now, they have a requirement to broadcast over 1,000 hours per year of high-definition digital signal. Now that remote broadcasters are enabled and, in fact, required to broadcast in standard digital format their costs have come down, but it means that the take-up of digital as a consequence, hopefully, will be greater. It certainly means that remote broadcasters have an incentive to invest in digital TV whereas previously the costs were considered to be fairly high. Other members have spoken of the benefits of digital and I agree. I think the fact that we focus on the availability of sporting events and we want to see more sporting events on television is natural in this country. I have a great affection for sport, as I know most members of parliament do and the public does as well. But, as we explore and examine the capacity for events of that nature to be seen more frequently and more accessibly, we also should think about other events including-in my capacity as shadow parliamentary secretary and Labor spokesman for the arts-arts events, which would probably generate a greater audience pickup and interest than people might expect. Why do we lag behind the world in standards of the take-up of digital TV? In the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications, Information Technology and the Arts report Digital television: who’s buying it? that I referred to earlier, we found that take-up rates in the UK were 63 per cent, 17 per cent in Italy and 15 per cent in the US. The switchoff date that Senator Coonan has announced is intended to try and increase that amount of take-up, but there is clearly a lot of work to be done in the meantime. Labor does support this legislation, but it recognises the kind of work that has to be done by the government in providing sufficient public information and education about digital. It is really a shortfall and a shortcoming of the minister. ACMA released research last year which found that some 17 per cent of respondents did not know about digital TV at all, 45 per cent did not know if they could access it, 42 per cent simply were not interested and 38 per cent did not know that at some point in time digital TV would replace analog TV. We have a long way to go. The minister has a lot of work to do. On the broader question of media reforms, I hope members will be granted many opportunities to debate more fully the so-called reforms that the minister has introduced and that are travelling through this House. I want to put on record the very high level of concern that I have about the likely impact of the reforms as announced in their final form by the government. In particular, I want to note the possible and likely impacts upon the journalists’ profession in potential job losses. Most clearly, there is the likelihood of the reduction of a diversity of voices, particularly in the metropolitan markets. It is the lifeblood of our democracy. There have been many comments of this sort made, but it is true and it needs to be said. The lifeblood of democracy is to have a diversity of voices, particularly in news and current affairs, MAIN COMMITTEE and information available to people to enable them to participate and make judgements about civil society. As a consequence of those reforms and those laws that are coming through this parliament, we have had our democratic capacity as consumers of media significantly truncated and reduced. I do not think there is any doubt that a number of the arguments that were put up by the government were not about diversity or new technologies or anything of the kind; they were arguments that had been driven by a need to do something. And it will be commercial interests, more than anything else, that will drive what the media landscape will look like in a few years time. On the basis of those comments, to which I hope I will have the opportunity to refer again later on, we do support this bill. We recognise that the government has a great deal of work to do in educating and speeding up the switch-over from analog to digital. Additionally, we do urge licensees to consider the kind of material that they are able to provide to people in remote communities. For my part, I very strongly urge them to consider their Indigenous audiences in that respect. (No. 1) 2006 is important legislation, and of course it is doubly important to people like me and the member for Canning, who sits alongside me, as it contains specific references to the dissemination of digital television services and additional services within remote areas. That is particularly so for those in the footprint of the two commercial stations that cover virtually all of rural Western Australia, impinging on areas of responsibility for the member for Canning and covering my electorate entirely. SoI welcome this initiative. Nevertheless, there are other comments that I am anxious to make, the first of which is that, in digital technology, the set-top box does a huge amount of the interpretation, allowing for all sorts of mixed signals to be sent over the airwaves-the spectrum as we know it-that can be sorted out at the point of receival. That is in great contrast to analog television, where the signal has to travel in its entirety through the air to effect the operations of the TV set. As a consequence of course, as has been reported in the past, the amount of spectrum required to distribute an analog television signal represents the same area needed for 100,000 mobile telephones. So the spectrum is a very important issue. Interestingly enough, as I understand it, in my electorate the transmission via satellite into the footprint is already digitised. But clearly the problem arises when that signal arrives on the ground. If you are in an individual homestead somewhere with your own receiver dish, presumably the signal that arrives from the satellite presently will be transferable into your equipment. But what we find in the small communities that I represent-for instance, there are 50 individual local authorities, many of which have two or three towns-is that the townsfolk do not want a dish apiece; they want some locally transmitted service which has typically been provided by the community and, in particular, local government. I sincerely trust that when, as this legislation provides, the Australian Communications and Media Authority, ACMA, is required to make a legislative instrument relating to a commercial television conversion scheme to set out the terms of the conversion process they will make sure that every time we get a technological change these community bodies are not forced to spend more money to be able to retransmit the new service, as has occurred in the past. MAIN COMMITTEE",162,Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2006
217,Mr Tuckey (O’connor) (12.15 Pm),"The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment BillThat is quite a serious issue because that is where some of the complexity resides, and it has been my experience that when the digitised signal came down from the satellite these community facilities were literally handed a domestic set-top box and told to put in their little television station-their little retransmission facility. Now that is just not of a quality sufficient to do the job in that circumstance, and is less so if one is talking about a high definition digitised signal. That is a matter I hope those at ACMA who might review the speeches made in this debate take note of: that when they set the rules for this purpose they make sure that there is an obligation on those who get a substantial income from these services to ensure that the smaller retransmission services-the stations providing the service in the larger communities-are not financially disadvantaged again in retransmitting that service. That is an important factor that has to be taken into account. I noted a number of comments made by the member for Kingsford Smith to which I would like to respond, but I support his argument that there should be something different on the additional channels that are being provided. I saw GWN, as we know it, virtually covering my electorate. They were consequently able to cherry pick the most popular programs of the three commercial stations, and with one dish and one set-top box you got the lot. Then all of a sudden along came WIN to improve the service, and suddenly one had the rugby and the football. Of course, the retransmission of the WIN service took time, and people who had been able to make that choice on a single service were suddenly without the service. It was just too bad if you preferred AFL to rugby league or whatever-you suddenly only had half of it. But the other point was about what else they got. One mob got Neighbours and the other got-what is the other program called? ischannel representing another advertising stream that runs the same sort of rubbish. Yes, they have got plenty of that; certain people enjoy it. But for goodness sake! As the member for Canning is well aware, there is a significant debate going on in the coalition about wheat marketing. You might wonder what in the hell that has got to do with this. Those who use the internet as a means of communication can, with the appropriate skills, access the website for the Chicago Board of Trade. They have discovered that in fact the price that someone could afford to pay them for their wheat in this era of drought, if they have that thing, is about $40 per tonne more than the monopoly marketing system is offering. And if you are down to a third-or luckily a half-of your ordinary production, 40 bucks a tonne means a lot. Of course, that is a contradiction to the argument that this process always delivers better returns. But the point I make in this debate is that if everybody can turn on channel 3, or whatever it is going to be called, the datacasting channel under these new arrangements, and get that information on their television screens-and of course you can, particularly if the broadcaster is prepared to provide it-then everybody knows about it and they become a much more informed body.

The last thing in the world we want is anotherI note today that the Canadian government has just issued an order upon its monopoly wheat marketer to stop it spending money on promoting itself and its benefits-in other words, the government wants an open debate. It is a pity we have not had one here yet. I say to the members of the opposition present that it is about time your representatives asked our ministers a few questions about the $40 differential. This has nothing to do with the philosophy of a single desk. How is it that the perfect system is going to cost one grower, a very big grower in my electorate, $1 million? That will not make him want to approach it. The point I am making is that, if this legislationMs Burke interjectingmore growers to become aware of where the dollars are, that might help. Please keep giving us the usually unsubstantiated information about individual workers, considering only 11,000 change their jobs every week in Australia, instead of looking at, for instance, the rights of people in other areas. That is your choice as the opposition. I have made the point that I hope that this legislation will provide an adequate opportunity for datacasting and also the information that people require, not another series of Neighbours or Down Our Street or whatever else. That is an important thing. I was interested to hear the member for Kingsford Smith say-I think in a broader reference-that he was concerned about the jobs of journalists if changes coming up in other legislation were accepted. Everyone worries about media proprietors dictating what journalists should write. I am not sure that that happens. I think journalists have significant control over the products we hear over the airwaves or we see in print journalism. The possibility of who will own a newspaper is open slather, except if you own a television station. Those sorts of matters are of importance. But I always thought that the best way for a journalist to keep their jobquestion in relation to that? question? Australia and the United Kingdom gave universal editorial support for participation of the coalition of the willing in the war in Iraq? at all surprised about that. I am further informed of a matter of history of which the member may not be aware. On one occasion when a former President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, gave an address to the nation, nearly all the newspapers in America had printed two front pages before the speech was made-one applauding it and another condemning it. As the speech ended, the pollsters hit the phones and the community said, ‘We like the one applauding the address,’ and all the newspapers ran that page. You tell me that that was a decision of the media proprietor. Yes, the media proprietors, including Mr Murdoch, had two pages ready and ran the one that they thought the community wanted to hear.

Also, I know that the ‘single media proprietor’ is not very popular with the Labor Party because in the first instance-and this question is using up your time-he supported Whitlam, because Whitlam promised him that he could import newsprint. Whitlam broke his promise and the proprietor took him to the cleaners the next time. If you want to play those sorts of games, you suffer that sort of problem. I believe that I have adequately answered that question with historical fact and that I should come back to the comments of the member for Kingsford Smith. It interested me that the member for Kingsford Smith talked about the future of journalists. I think there are two factors to this.

Mr Norm Gibbs Ms BURKE (Chisholm) (12.30 pm)-In the adjournment debate I wish to place on record my absolute praise and delight at the news that Norm Gibbs, Mr Waverley himself, has been nominated for and awarded the Premier’s seniors award for 2006. I know Norm personally and I can think of no more deserving person in our community to receive this award. Norm Gibbs has been an active community member all his life. Norm is the epitome of a volunteer. No task is too great or too small and all who ask will receive. I can speak with personal authority on this truly fantastic member of the community. Norm has been a vital asset to my annual Caroline Chisholm Awards as chair of the committee. I rely upon Norm greatly as a sounding board about the needs of our community. Norm began his community involvement as a Sunday school teacher and gym instructor at the Hughesdale Community Church, where his involvement lasted for 15 years. When Norm married Topsy-Topsy is also a fantastic community member and a great asset to Norm; much of his work could not have been achieved without her-and they moved to Mount Waverley, he was a charter member of the Waverley JCs. He became very involved with St Phillip’s Anglican Church in many groups but was instrumental in the formation of its youth group. In 1970 Norm became an honorary probation officer and is the longest serving honorary in this field. He still works as an honorary probation officer to this day and attends the Oakleigh police station once a week to provide JP services. Norm worked tirelessly and visited many homes in his role as honorary probation officer and this role earned him the tag of ‘ Mr Waverley’, the man who would be able to help. He was often called out at many hours of the night and it was never too great or too small a task; Norm would always attend. MAIN COMMITTEE",167,Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Bill No 1 2006

230,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (12.30 Pm),"I move:Next for Norm was the establishment of the Zodiac Dance and Zodiac Youth Group. He and Topsy were heavily involved in the Life Be In It campaign. Norm secured a bus for youth activities through local fundraising. Zodiac turned its attention to fundraising for relief after Cyclone Tracy and Norm spent three weeks in Darwin. As a trained plumber, he was a vital asset in part of the rebuilding process up there. This experience led Norm to think of a career change and when he returned from Darwin he applied and became a welfare officer with the Waverley City Council. He spent many years in that vital role. Norm first got involved with the Rotary Club of Waverley in 1976 and continues that association to this day. Norm exemplifies the rotary motto of ‘service above self’. Norm became a Paul Harris Fellow in 1998 and named a Companion of the Australian Rotary Health Research Fund for his unceasing work for this organisation. Zodo the clown was born in 1978 and he continues to this day. Norm, as Zodo, entertains the elderly, the young and the disabled-anyone who is in need of cheering up. A visit from Norm as Zodo never fails to achieve this end. Norm also spends a lot of time as Santa or the Easter bunny, visiting kinders, schools, nursing homes and hospitals-any special occasion and Norm is there in his trusty MG in full costume to please and delight. It is quite a sight to see Zodo the clown zipping around Waverley in his MG. Norm is always on call to help and respond whenever asked. Off his own bat, he travelled to Portsea to visit the Kosovo refugees when they were here, as he knew the children could do with cheering up. Norm is very active to this day with Very Special Kids, the Down Syndrome Association, Camp Quality, Copeland Street, the Variety Club, the Rotary Club of Waverley, the Child and Family Care Network, the Monash volunteers association and many more we do not even know about. Norm has been actively involved in the Monash City Council for many years, where he served as councillor and mayor in its previous incarnation as the Waverley City Council, and attends all council meetings. You cannot go to a Monash City Council meeting and not see Norm in the audience. Norm is the most worthy recipient of this award and I cannot sing his praises highly enough. Quite simply, Norm is one of the reasons Waverley is such a great place to live in. It was an absolute delight to hear that he was awarded the Premier’s Senior of the Year award for 2006. I know it was an absolute privilege and delight and the making of his life. We should all bear in mind that Norm is a spritely 79. Two other people in my electorate were also nominated for these awards: Marion MacKenzie, who is 93 and attends St Christopher’s Primary School in Syndal each week, where she volunteers as a teacher assistant; and Dot Schmidt, who is a younger 79. Dot is also a fantastic member of our community who works with many organisations including the Red Cross, Salvation Army, Clean Up Australia and Meals on Wheels in Glen Waverley. Without these sorts of volunteers in our electorates, in our communities, our communities would not be the great places they are. We often talk about community being dead, but I know it is not because I have such great people in my electorate who are giving of their time generously as volunteers. I would like my remarks in Hansard to show the great respect I have for these individuals. MAIN COMMITTEE Skills for the Future Ms GAMBARO (Petrie-Parliamentary Secretary (Foreign Affairs)) (12.35 pm)-I rise to make comments on and support the statement that has just been delivered by the Prime Minister on providing assistance for skills shortages and skills training. I rise to support his statements particularly. The world has changed. There are many mature age workers out there whose skills have become redundant because of the changing technological advancements in society and also the fact that they may have been away from the workforce for a long period of time-for example, mothers who have stayed home for a number of years to rear children or who left school at a time when a limited number of skills were required and many people left school in the junior year. The way that things have changed in the workplace today, many of those skills need to be updated. When I go around and speak to employers, what is becoming increasingly obvious to me is the skills gap that exists out there. Many employers express a great deal of frustration to me, particularly when young people applying for positions do not have the literacy skills to fill out an application form. That is of great concern. It is important that we make sure that those literacy skills and also other job skills are updated. More so now than ever before, the technological age has meant that there are many careers that are no longer applicable, and one that I can think of is the old-fashioned world of cartography and map drawing. It is now being surpassed by computer technology. That particular industry is a bit of a dinosaur. In cases like that, there are many people out there who would have originally trained in the old ways that now have to come on board and embrace the new technology. We have such a strong economy at the moment that employers regularly say to me they have trouble finding employees. I was speaking to a company the other day that was having extreme difficulty in attracting truck drivers. We have such a low unemployment level that the workers of this country, which is in a period of unprecedented economic strength, are in the greatest position of bargaining power that has ever existed in terms of the types of jobs that are out there, and employers are very mindful of that. It is a terrific situation to be in, but it does cause skills shortages and skill demands. So this $837 million policy that has been announced by the Prime MinisterI would like to endorse. Anyone over the age of 25 without year 12 equivalent skills will be eligible for a $3,000 voucher. The cost of funding the voucher is $408 million and the voucher will be able to be used in places like TAFEs, private providers or community colleges. It will upskill unemployed workers and welfare recipients, it will give them a chance to participate in the workforce and it will also give them a formal qualifications path and a career path. This is the type of educational opportunity that people are looking for in this very modern, robust and strong market. Workers who have gone into specific jobs in the past now want changes of directions and want to supplement their skills through their working lives. The training that they require must be flexible and it must be deliverable in the classroom or the workplacewhatever is needed. It is a much more flexible work environment. The days of apprenticeships only being for younger people are over. As I travel around, more and more mature age people are wanting to become apprentices and we have invested $307 million over five years to support mid-career workers. We have seen successful examples of that in the defence industry, where mature age workers are going into technical and electrical areas and the Department of Defence has embraced that wholeheartedly. From1 MAIN COMMITTEE July 2007, the incentives will be available each year for up to 10,000 people aged 30 and over who are starting an apprenticeship at the certificate III or certificate IV level in an occupation of high demand, and those 30 and over undertaking apprenticeships in these occupations in July 2007 will also be eligible. The amount paid by the government will be $150 a week, or $7,800 a year, in the first year and $100 a week, or $5,000 in a year, in the second year. I endorse this important measure because it will have a profound effect on the skills and the upgrading of skills in this country. It will mean greater engagement for mature age people and it will help many in the workforce who, through no barrier other than a financial barrier, will be able to participate again. (Time expired) Law and Order Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (12.41 pm)-I wish to bring to the attention of the House the events of Friday, 6 October this year in my home town of Rockhampton. Our local paper’s headline on Monday the 9th read ‘Massive street fight erupts’. The paper went on to say: Up to 50 people are believed to have been involved in the disturbance on Johns Street on Friday night with Police alleging some were fighting with metal bars, bottles and fence palings. On the face of it this could be said to be a law and order matter, and indeed the Queensland police are to be congratulated not just for their quick response but for the work they are doing to defuse the situation. Last year all of Australia watched in horror as the riots in Sydney’s western suburbs were flashed around the nation, and here we are now with the quiet streets of Rockhampton being turned into virtual battlegrounds. The question is whether there are any similarities between the riots in Macquarie Fields and the events in Johns Street, Rockhampton. Sadly, the answer is yes. The riots in Sydney were sparked by the death of a young man, while the events in Rockhampton last week were triggered by the tragic suicide death of a young woman. I ask myself: how many other towns and cities around Australia are seeing these human tragedies played out on their streets? I believe that we in this place need to consider these frightening disturbances not as law and order issues but for what they really are. They are an expression of the hopelessness felt by some sections of our community. We had a government minister tell the House yesterday that we are living in a glorious age and that we have never had it so good. This may be true for the Howard and Costello families and it may also be true for the families of the CEOs of Telstra, of Qantas or of our major banks; but hidden just under the surface of our society are pockets of overwhelming misery and a sense of frustration and hopelessness that we never thought we would see in the land of the fair go. We have to ask ourselves: how did we get to this sad point? The Howard government has abandoned a basic maxim of all Australian governments since Federation. Whether you talk about Deakin, Lyons, Chifley or Menzies, all of our previous governments believed that we must set a standard below which we would not allow Australians to live or to work. I have to say that the Howard government is guilty of abandoning this sacred principle, and the result is social alienation and even the violence that we are seeing in some of our towns and cities. John Howard’s mindset and rhetoric are stuck in the 1950s, but he does not seem to understand that the policies of his government have destroyed much of the fabric of society that existed to help and support people in that earlier time. In Mr Howard’s world of the 1950s, MAIN COMMITTEE there was a safety net for people of church, community and government. In the world of 2006 that John Howard has created, you are on your own and good luck to you. I know that, had the families involved in the tragic events in Rockhampton last week been given support in their time of need, there would not have been the battle that we saw in Rockhampton on 6 October. We now hear the completely out of touch Minister for Human Services, Joe Hockey, referring to a class of people out there who need to get off their backsides and go to work. I say to Mr Hockey: as I move around my electorate I cannot find these people who do not want to work. Indeed, Mr Hockey is welcome to come to Rockhampton and I will introduce him to young men in their 20s who have no drivers licence, who have no Medicare card, who are at odds with Centrelink and whose teeth are in such bad shape that they cannot eat an apple or any proper food. Mr Hockey wants these men to work, but the Howard government, thanks to its policies of neglect, has abandoned them and consigned them to life on the margins of our society. I would say to Mr Hockey and to all members of the government that it is the Howard government that needs to get to work to address the results of its failed policies of the last 10 years and help bring these people back from the margins of society into the mainstream, where they can do what this government requires them to do. In short, the task which is obviously going to be left to the next Labor government is for us once again to set standards below which we will not allow people to live or work. The sooner we have a Labor government which will set about this task, the sooner we will all be safer on our streets. Telstra ger at the decision by Telstra to close the Beach Road, Maroochydore call centre in about eight to 10 weeks, along with another call centre at Cairns in Far North Queensland. I appreciate that Telstra operates as though it is a private company, that for many years it has been corporatised and that these decisions are, as far as the management of the company is concerned, handled by the board of directors. But, as the local member, I was very annoyed that there was no sense of consultation and there was no talking to the local staff. The decision to close the award and winning call centre came right out of the blue. An announcement was made late on Tuesday, and I have to say that this decision is entirely unacceptable. I do not understand why Telstra would look at closing a call centre in a rapidly growing area like the Sunshine Coast or, for that matter, in Cairns. These call centres have highly skilled people and, while I am aware that because of the high level of skills of the people at the call centre many of them will be offered jobs quickly, the timing of the Telstra announcement was absolutely appalling. I understand that 83 Sunshine Coast families will have a bleak Christmas insofar as the jobs will come to an end very close to the yuletide season. Telstra clearly is diversifying in a range of ways, but I am quite sure that Telstra will not be diversifying into a public relations consultancy business. It is one thing for the chief executive of Telstra to be paid such an enormous amount of money-and it is a matter for the board of Telstra as to whether he is worth that; I have to say, looking at the performance of Telstra, that I find it interesting that the board has clearly gone through that process and come to that decision, but I recognise that the board of Telstra does in fact operate the Telstra company-but I thought it was absolutely appalling that, without consultation with the workers, without consultation with the local community and without consultation with local members of parliaMAIN COMMITTEE",168,Adjournment
231,Mr Slipper (Fisher) (12.45 Pm),"I rise in the chamber today to express my extreme anment and local councils, such an appalling and outrageous decision was announced by Telstra, which will see the breadwinners of 83 coast families no longer bringing home pay packets. Not only will this affect the 83 families who lose their jobs on the Sunshine Coast and about the same number at Cairns but there will be a multiplier flow-on effect for the Sunshine Coast economy. These people who work at Telstra shop locally, go to local restaurants and use local services, so the effect on the broader community will be very substantial. I think it is unfortunate that Telstra is able to make these sorts of announcements without taking into consideration the effect on local people and local communities. I have been telephoned by quite a substantial number of people who are losing their job. It is rather interesting, actually. Those people who are losing their jobs I think got advice only yesterday that they were being offered discounted shares in the T3 offer. They are obviously part of the family for one purpose but not part of the family for another purpose. Mr Martin Ferguson-Are you recommending that they buy? to make with respect to investing in Telstra. Telstra has said that those staff who face job losses will be offered redundancy packages, that where possible alternative employment will be given-hopefully on the Sunshine Coast-and that there will be assistance from Telstra to help the employees find positions with other employers. When I was telephoned by Jason Law, the Telstra Country Wide manager, who I must say does an absolutely outstanding jobhe was the messenger; he was notified and had no role in this decision-I asked him whether the jobs were being exported to Bangalore in India. But I was told that that was not the case and that Telstra does not actually have offshore call centres. To sum up: this is an appalling decision which adversely affects the financial situation of coast families who have undertaken commitments and bought houses with the expectation of an ongoing role with Telstra. Telstra’s public relations exercise is appalling. The board stands condemned. Tourism to make a few remarks about the state of tourism, an industry I have been a close observer of for some time now, even before I accepted responsibility as the shadow minister on behalf of the opposition. Tourism is a marvellous industry, contributing significantly to Australia’s economic prosperity. Most of us by now are familiar with the figures. For example, tourism employs over 550,000 people nationally, it contributes about four per cent to Australia’s GDP and it injects $18.8 million into our economy. It is an industry built on the fine reputation of the predominantly small to medium sized businesses that define it and that are often based in regional areas, producing a quality service. It is in understanding the significance of the industry that I raise serious concerns this afternoon about its ailing health. Over the past year, we have seen fewer international arrivals to Australia and an increase in outward-bound travel, which is a recipe for an unhealthy sector back home. The latest overseas arrivals and departures figures released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics earlier this month show a drop in short-term visitor arrivals to Australia, down 2.9 per cent in August 2006 from the same time last year. The drop continued a worrying trend. While those figures were bad enough on the surface, a more thorough analysis reMAIN COMMITTEE",172,Adjournment
232,Mr Slipper,That is a decision that individuals in our Australian community will have,173,Adjournment
233,Mr Martin Ferguson (Batman) (12.50 Pm),"I want to use this time this afternoonvealed that the problem is much worse. Real gains have been made in attracting more Chinese and Korean tourists, but that has come at a heavy loss, with a bleeding of the highly lucrative and long-term Japanese market down 10.5 per cent. The alarm bells are ringing loud and clear. Replacing the Japanese market with the new emerging Chinese and Korean markets is not like trading apples for apples. Japanese visitors are traditionally considered high-yield tourists, since they spend more than the average visitor. Chinese and Korean tourists, conversely, are considered low-yield tourists and often travel in tightly planned tours that do not allow for the maximum possible spend dispersal amongst businesses. This was not the only worrying truth in the report. As the international market shrinks, in contrast the figures show consistent monthly increases in resident departures for the last 12 months at an unprecedented level. From March 2004 to March 2005, the number of Australians heading overseas for their holiday rather than spending time in their own backyard increased by a massive 26 per cent. This is at a time when fewer and fewer of us are actually taking time out. As a nation we have stockpiled-and this is an incredible figure-70 million days of annual leave. It is about time that people started thinking about having a holiday back home. The report confirmed the speculation by many within the industry that the decline in tourism health experienced over recent times was not just unfortunately a temporary downward glitch but a reflection of a serious problem. Domestic tourism has stagnated, and this has serious ramifications not just for the capital cities but perhaps more importantly for regional Australia. The domestic tourism sector makes up 70 per cent of the industry’s GDP. Industry is predicting that the tourism slump is about to plateau and may even very marginally rise, but any growth is only in comparison with its recent poorest performance period on record. It should not be forgotten that the results are well down on the general trend levels and well under par for the industry’s full potential. The opposition has given bipartisan support to Australia’s much touted ‘Where the bloody hell are you?’ campaign. It was launched in February this year, but results appear thin on the ground. Enough time has elapsed for questions now to be asked. I therefore suggest to the Minister for Small Business and Tourism that it is about time she gave an explanation. Where are the international visitors? Why aren’t Australians spending holidays in Australia? Why aren’t they taking their holidays, and what is the government going to do about it? There have been recent reports about Korean tourists being ripped off on the Gold Coastactually being charged to walk on our beaches. There was a Queensland state government system in place which is about accreditation with respect to proper standards of tourism providers. The Tourism Services Act must be picked up by the Australian government and spread across all states and territories so as to protect our future by making sure that unsuspecting tourists are not ripped off. Imagine reports of charges of $150 per tourist to walk on a beach on the Gold Coast. This will only further harm our international reputation and further diminish our capacity to actually attract not only low-yield tourists but also high-yield tourists. (Time expired) MAIN COMMITTEE World Poverty electorate of La Trobe to invite two students from each school to attend a Make Poverty History forum at the Belgrave Heights Christian School in my electorate. The forum was organised in conjunction with Vision Generation, VGen-the 15to 24-year-old arm of World Vision-and generously hosted by Belgrave Heights Christian School. I thank Andy Callow and all his staff and students for doing a fantastic job in hosting this function. VGen aims to ‘inspire, educate and empower young people in the fight against global poverty and injustice’ through fundraising and advocacy initiatives. In attendance were VGen chair, Miss Alana Smith, and vice chair, Mr Mark Cox. I congratulate Alana and Mark. I have met them on numerous occasions. They are exceptionally passionate, have a great vision and are fantastic ambassadors for VGen. The forum, which was held last Wednesday, 4 October 2006, was a great success. It provided an excellent opportunity for the young people of La Trobe to share their views with each other. Students from each school represented delivered presentations to the forum, voiced their opinions, passionately debated ideas and exchanged views. It was an incredible thrill to see how inspired our young people are to make poverty history. There was a real buzz in the room. Students Tim Streckfuss and Erica Brant and teacher Mr Colin Payne represented Kambrya College. Tim handed out candles and sang a song he had written about poverty, and I congratulate him for doing so. Erica asked the forum to imagine the horrors of poverty. St Joseph’s Regional College was represented by students Joshua Hore and Lukas Lum and teacher Mr Michael Turner. Joshua and Lukas performed a role-play comparing a child from the USA with a hungry child from Ethiopia. Representing St Francis Xavier College were students Beauheme Prussner, Joshua McKendry-Dow and Alyce Johnson and teacher Mr Adrian Peacock. Alyce and Beauheme discussed Third World debt relief. Hillcrest Christian College was represented by students Bevan Wang and Adele Teden and teacher Mr Geoff Grace and actively participated in group discussions. Beaconhills College was represented by students Sarah McNeilage, Lauren Prosser and Madelaine Brooke and teacher Mr Will Hones. The girls delivered a very passionate presentation about what could be done and what they were intending to do at their school to make poverty history. Students Liam Harris and Jacqui Ryder, accompanied by the principal, Wayne Burgess, represented Emerald Secondary College. I congratulate Wayne as a principal for getting involved with this project. Liam and Jacqui talked about Millennium Development Goal No. 1. Belgrave Heights Christian School was represented by students Amber Thiele and Isabell Holt as well as the principal, Andy Callow, who hosted the event, and teacher Mr Lance Davidson. and concluded that microcredit is an excellent form of aid.

They are very young, passionate people-very persuasive too. I congratulate all those participants from all the schools and the teachers on making this a fantastic day. I have made many speeches now on Make Poverty History and I fully support the MDGs. I congratulate our federal government on the recent announcement which the Treasurer made in South Africa. Australia made a commitment of $136 million to the World Bank to relieve debts of some of the world’s poorest countries. This payment was in addition to the $12 million which Australia has already provided to the World Bank and International Monetary Fund for debt relief.

(4) Will the Government seek to ‘claw back’ ITCs that have previously been granted by the ATO to affected investors. rial responsibilities. The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows: (1) Supplies of accommodation in commercial residential premises are taxable, unless the existing option to input tax long-term accommodation in commercial residential premises is exercised. (2) The decision of the Full Federal Court of Australia in Marana Holdings Pty Ltdv Commissioner of Taxation [2004] FCAFC 307 (Marana) was about whether the sale of a unit, which was previously a room in a motel, was the sale of ‘new residential premises’ and thus subject to GST. A person who entered into an investment following the Marana case will be treated in the same way as the majority of taxpayers who relied upon the Australian Taxation Office’s (ATO’s) published view in GST Ruling 2000/20. They will not be able to claim an input tax credit on the purchase price. However, as the supply is input taxed, they will not be required to remit GST on a later sale of the property, nor on rent received. (3) and (4) There is only a very small number of input tax credit claims in respect of premises in question that are pending with the ATO. There is only a handful of taxpayers who will have to repay input tax credits as a result of the amendments.

Doxycycline is the principal anti-malarial prophylaxis prescribed by the Australian Defence Force to Defence personnel deployed overseas. Mefloquine Hydrochloride (Larium) is only prescribed where doxycycline is not tolerated well by an individual. Mefloquine is also not approved for use by Australian Defence Force aircrew. Mefloquine was introduced into the Defence pharmaceutical inventory on 13 September 1990. The information sought in the honourable member’s question on how many personnel were prescribed Mefloquine is not readily available. To collect and assemble such information solely for the purpose of answering the question would be a major task, and I am not prepared to authorise the expenditure and effort that would be required.",178,Questions In Writing

241,Dr Nelson,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:Defence: Employment (Question No. 3990) 4 September 2006: (1) Further to the reply given by the Minister Assisting the Minister for Defence to question No. 3010 (Hansard, 22 June 2006, page 128): (a) did the investigation of the incident referred to in part 6(b) conclude that a breach of the procurement policy had occurred; if so, how serious was the breach considered to be; (b) what action was taken against the officer or the company involved in the breach; (c) was his department aware of the breach of proper tendering processes prior to the close of tenders for the project; (d) on what basis was “retrospective approval” given for the officer’s offduty employment; and (e) when was this retrospective approval (i) granted and (ii) applied for. (2) Is he aware of the report published on 14 December 2005 in the Australian Financial Review that the officer claimed “signed approval” to do the work; if so, is the officer’s claim correct. (3) Was it originally indicated that the project tendering process referred to in Part1 would be determined by May 2006. (4) When is it expected that the tendering process will now be determined. (1) (a) The investigation concluded that a breach of procurement policy had not occurred. The investigation also concluded that the individual did not possess or previously have access to privileged information pertaining to Defence Regional Information Communication Technology (ICT) service management. (b) Formal administrative sanctions were imposed on the member as approval to work in off-duty hours should have been sought before the work was undertaken. There was no action taken against the company involved. (c) Notice that the Inspector General was investigating a possible breach of the tendering processes was received by the Regional ICT Market Testing Project (tender authority) a few days prior to the close of the tender. (d) The work in question was undertaken during a period of long service leave and did not conflict with the member’s official duties. (e) (i) 24 November 2005. (ii) 23 November 2005. (2) Yes. The member received signed retrospective approval for the work undertaken. (3) The Australian Financial Review article did state that an announcement of the preferred tenderer was expected by May 2006. This was based on an estimate derived on the number of anticipated responses from industry. The number of responses received exceeded expectations and the period required to undertake a full assessment has had to be increased. (4) It is now expected that a recommendation will be made to the internal Defence Information Technology Board by December 2006.",219,Questions In Writing
