12,Mr Pollard,"I have said that the manufacture of wire netting and fencing wire that a desperate shortage of these materials does exist in Australia. If the honourable member suggests that the Australian Government should commence manufacturing wire netting and fencing wire and recruit the labour required for this purpose, I shall be prepared to consider his proposal. All honourable 'members realize that these materials are in short supply, but every possible action is being taken to overcome the scarcity. The honourable member will also be aware that my very active colleague, the Minister for Immigration, is working day and night in an endeavour to ensure that every available ship that we can obtain from the people who own them shall come to these shores laden with migrants who will be willing to engage in our heavy industries and produce our requirements. Further, I direct the attention of the honourable member to the fact that the problem of keeping down vermin in Victoria is the responsibility of the State Government, gentleman should also make representations on the subject in that quarter. Ammunition, too, is scarce for the same reason that wire netting and fencing wire are scarce. Again, I admit, that the production' of this commodity is in the hands of a very efficient private enterprice and a first advance. The Barley prise in this country, but, until production difficulties can be overcome, with the assistance of the Minister for Immigration, the improvement will be rather slow. letters to nearly every member of this Barley Board .receives 10,000,000 bushels Parliament on many occasions explainof oats this season and exports 5,00.0,000 ing that the levy on rabbit skins was at 10s. a bushel and sells 5,000,000 in this imposed by the Menzies Government with country at 5s. a bushel, the equalized the support of the Opposition of the day. price to the oat-grower will be 7s. 6d. a iSo, if there is any blame attaching to bushel less the cost of administration, this action, we are all blameworthy in which is estimated at lOd. a bushel. some measure.

The rabbit skin levy does not have any material effect on the activities of those who carry out rabbit destruction in JAPANES E PEAC E TREATY . this country because the high prices ruling overseas for rabbit skins provide ter indicate when the^conference to draw ample incentive for this work. Last year, rabbit skins exported to the United States of America and other dollar area9 realized 6,000,000 dollars.

OATS. arrangements that are being made in respect of the price and marketing of oats this season, can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform me whetherTasmanian oat-grower3 will receive a share-of the export price?

17,Mr Ryan,"Can the Prime Minisup the terms of the Japanese peace treaty is likely to assemble? Is he not of the opinion that the sooner the treaty is drawn up the better, and can he give a reason for what seem.s to be a long delay in calling the conference together? not possible to announce a date for the assembling of the conference to draw Tip the Japanese peace treaty. A deadlock has been reached in regard to this matter. I believe that the Soviet Government takes the view that the treaty should be dealt with in the first place by the foreign ministers of the four major powers. Of course, that is not acceptable to Australia, and I believe that it is not -ncceptable to a number of other nations. It is generally considered that all those nations which participated in the war --against Japan in the Pacific area should take part in the peace conference. Every endeavour has been made to overcome the present deadlock, but I cannot say whether the suggestions that have been made are acceptable or not. The answer to the honourable member is that the deadlock occurred because of a difference of opinion regarding the composition of the body to deal with the treaty. At present F can give no indication of the date when the treaty will be considered. representing the Minister for Supply and .Shipping inform the House whether control of steel, supplies by the Commonwealth is still in operation? If so, can he explain why there is a great shortage of steel in South Australia, parwhich Mr Roach was said to have made ticularly of steel required for the manufacture of ploughshares, discs and other agricultural implements? Furthermore, is there any truth in the report that the Government to have the ban on the approximately 60,000 tons of steel is lying transportation to the Netherlands East at Newcastle awaiting shipment to South' Australia ? whether there are any supplies of steel awaiting shipment at Newcastle. I shall have inquiries made and inform the honourable member of the .facts. It is true that there is a general shortage of steel throughout Australia, and that control over steel supplies is exercised by the Commonwealth. As far as I am aware. done nothing about it ! tach State is provided with an allocation and it is then the responsibility of each State government to distribute its quota amongst the different industries. Until such time as the production of steel increases considerably the shortage will continue. I shall make further inquiries, and if I obtain any additional information I shall convey it to the honourable member. BAN ON DUTCH SHIPS. ister seen the statement made on the 31st January by the secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, Mr Roach, that the wa terside workers' ban on Dutch shipping still operates? Has he also seen Mr Roach's further statement that the ban bad been imposed at the request of the Indonesian trade union movement, and would be lifted or modified only when that, movement asked the .federation to do so? Is the ban still in existence? If so, does the Prime Minister approve the Government abdicating its responsibility to govern in favour of an outside body? latter statement attributed to Mr Roach. However, a most reputable person did bring to my notice a statement made by Mr Roach some time ago, in the course of which he was reported to have said that the ban on Dutch shipping, which had been imposed, with the concurrence of federal unions within the Australian Council of Trades Unions, could not be lifted until the decision of that body had been reversed. The copy of the statement did not contain any reference to the union, with which Mr Roach i9 connected. Endeavours have been made by Indies of civilian goods, as opposed to arms, lifted., and it was hoped that the establishment of the Committee of Good Offices, whose members are now reporting to the Security Council, would result in the ban being lifted. The Government has never acquiesced in the imposition of a ban on the transportation of civilian goods to Java.",15,Vermin Destruction Shortage Of Wire Netting

The Wheat Growers Federation met simultaneously with the conference of Ministers and submitted its proposals, which were then considered.

Leader of the Austr:;li;-;i Country party) [3.33] -This debate affords me an opportunity to make a. few observations regarding the potentialities of the tobacco industry in Australia. The advantages to be gained are twofold. First, we' would be establishing a very important industry on a sound basis, and, secondly, the production of tobacco in this country would ease our dollar difficulties considerfor which therewould be fully a 90 per ably. Sixteen years ago, in March, 1932, I,personally carried out considerable research into tobacco-growing in Australia and had prepared and printed a. review of the investigations. I was particularly interested in the tobacco industry at that time because of the acute economic conditions then'existing in this country. It will be recalled that during the depression there was considerable unemployment throughout Australia, particularly in Queensland, and I considered that the establishment of the tobacco-growing industry in that State would do much to alleviate the economic strain. statistics that I gathered in the course of my inquiry, are, of Gourse, out of date tq-day, and the conclusions may not have application to existing circumstances. However; I ascertained that only 2 or 3 per cent, of the trade of the largest tobacco companies operating in Australia was in Australian tobacco, and that only between 2 and 3 per cent, of Australian smokers would smoke composite tobacco. Growers then were producing only enough bright leaf to enable the manufacturers to include about 2 i per cent, of Australian tobacco in every pound produced. Mr pounds of this readily marketable type G. P. Darnell-Smith, a Doctor of Science and Director of the ' Sydney Botanic Gardens, sajd in 1-932 that Australians were growing tobacco in districts not suited to the production of the type of leaf demanded by Australian manufacturers and consequently by. Australian smokers. Giving evidence before a select committee which had been appointed to investigate the tobacco industry by a government composed of the parties now in Opposishe. Mareeba district in northern Queensland, there were large areas of land which appeared to be ideaL for the production of tobacco suited to. Australian requirements. His evidence also indicated that the future of the tobacco industry for the production of light leaf and cigarette tobacco lay north of Bowden, about 2.0 degrees south latitude. An official survey, including examination of the results of test plots, conclusively proved that Queensland was pre-eminently suited to the production of bright leaf tobacco of superior texture, colour and aroma, a type cent, demand in Australia and in other English-speaking countries. Small quantities of tobacco have been grown in Queensland almost since it was established as a colony. In 1894, qver 1,000,000 lb. of cured leaf was produced in Queensland from 900 acres of land. However, after 1896 the industry slowly declined in Queensland and production contracted to an area of less than 100 acres in 1925. After 193Q there was an expansion of cultivation in all States. Production was so increased in Queensland that, in 1944-45, that State produced The about 50 per cent, of the entire Australian crop. The remainder was grown in Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. ""Of the 1,300,000 lb. of dried leaf produced in that year off 1,800 acres, 60 per cent, came from the Mareeba district of the Atherton Tablelands. Most of the remainder was grown in the Townsville, Mackay, Bowen and Gladstone districts. As long ago as 1932, I declared that Australia could produce all .the bright leaf tobacco required for home consumption and that, in addition, production eould he ""stepped up so that millions of of tobacco would be available for export. Expert tests have proved that light Australian tobacco produced in northern Queensland districts is comparable with the best light Virginian leaf. Had this industry been fostered in northern Queensland, Australia would have been able to save millions of dollars pf expenditure on imported tobacco. We could have built up a splendid Australian industry and also we should have had the chance to establish export markets both in Great",23,Customs Tariffbill 1948
52,Mr Fadden >'Dr.rling Downs,,24,Customs Tariffbill 1948
53,"Tion, Mr Darnell","Smith stated that, inBritain and in other English-speaking countries. A thorough investigation of the needs of the industry and proper encouragement of growers even at this stage can be of great value to the nation. The increase of production which did occur after 1933 was due largely to the encouragement given to the industry by the government of the day. That government decided to pay £20,000 annually to economic and scientific research in the industry. This was of great assistance to the industry. A further grant of £62,500, increased later by £11,250, was allotted by the Commonwealth Government for periodic distribution, . commencing with the year 1939. Then, of course, the inter-vention of war interrupted the plan which had been operating since 1931. This plan did much to develop disease-resisting Tarieties of tobacco. It improved the smoking qualities of Australian leaf and enabled the growers to deal with diseases such as blue mould. However, much still remains to be done. The Australian tobacco-growing industry has never received the encouragement which it has deserved and which it is -entitled to receive in the interests of Ausment of experimental stations and other tralia generally. A superficial survey of ithe industry indicates its potential value. ""The dollar .situation to-day is most acute. And it will continue to be so even if the position is not aggravated. Consequently, -we should do everything possible to entourage production. of our own requirements within Australia. That is our -responsibility as Australians. I emphasize that Australia can produce sufficient tobacco to meet the needs of Australian smokers in terms of both quantity and quality. There has been -a great deal of prejudice against Australian leaf and in -many instances that prejudice has been -ill founded. The researches of the Council-for Scienport diminishes the'pool of dollars availtific and Industrial Research and the evidence submitted at tariff inquiries and to a Royal Commission which sat in 1929 provide adequate proof of my statements -should proof be required. I hope that this -Government will authorize a survey of the industry with a view to its future development. ""We have plenty of idle land that -can be adapted .to tobacco production because, paradoxically, expert opinion is that poor land is most suited to the successful growing of good tobacco. Allthe facilities are at hand for the development of the industry, and present economic conditions, particularly in thelight of the dollar situation, demand that we should do everything possible to expand Australian industries ' and make ourselves indepenassist the States to continue dent of imports. The Council for Scientific and Industrial Research should be instructed to carry out a survey of the industry, and to resume the work which it was carrying out until 1932. The industry can be of great value to Australia. It requires a great deal of husbanding and all of the scientific 'assistance that can be given to it. Tobacco growing has been described more than once as scientific gardening. It is hard work; the crops have to be watered continuously and given constant attention, and expert advice and guidance is required not only during the growing period but also during the treatment and curing of the leaf. I trust that the Government will continue the operation of the scheme decided upon by the Lyons Government, and will make available annual grants for the establishscientific facilities, because the industry is destined to be of great .importance to Australia. I spoke on this matter yesterday, I emphasized the importance of the tobacco industry to Australia, and referred particularly to the possibilities of increasing production. , I explained that the product-ion of local .tobacco leaf would ease the dollar situation, not only for Australia, but also for the United Kingdom. WhilstI do not regard tobacco as a completely avoidable import, the fact remains that every pound of tobacco which we imable for the purchase of unavoidable imports from, dollar areas.' Furthermore, it draws upon the dollars available in Great Britain, and this is important because now, as always, we rely upon the United Kingdom to make good our dollar deficit Conversely, every pound of local tobacco leaf which we export to the United Kingdom represents a savings, in dollars to that",24,Customs Tariffbill 1948
54,Mr Mcewen (Indi) [3.46],"Whencountry. Those are obvious facts, and, to me, it seems incumbent upon the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) to make a statement of the Government's policy in regard to the encouragement of Australian tobacco production. The*schedule now before us is more than a mere revenue-producing or protective one. Indeed, it is of a most unusual nature, in that it proposes to consmokers in this country. That intention fer upon the Minister for Trade and Customs discretionary power to prescribe the proportions of Australian leaf which may be mixed with imported leaf, thereby absolving imported leaf from payment of a high rate of duty. Notwithstanding this, the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has listened to this protracted debate without attempting to make any statement of policy, and I protest against the attitude he is adopting. I believe that it is his duty to state clearly blended with imported leaf were later the policy which the Government intends to follow-if it has any policy-in regard to the stimulation of tobacco production in this country. The Lyons Government, which I supported before I became a member of it, took what I believe to be the most constructive step yet taken in Australia to foster the development of the Australian tobacco industry. which it devised was no mere, unscientific protective tariff, but was one carefully deapplication of that policy. Although the signed to enlist the active support of manufacturers and importers to stimulate the production of Australian leaf. Indeed, that was the first time in the history of this country that importers of 'a particular commodity were deliberately encouraged to stimulate local production of that commodity. achieved by the' imposition of a variable duty. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White), who was then Minister for Trade and Customs, was responsible for the introduction of the legislation, and I pay tribute to him for it. That legislation provided that if cigarettes blended from imported and local tobacco contained 2-J per cent, of the latter, the duty payable on the remaining 97i per cent, of imported leaf was to be subject to a substantial "" drawback"". Similarly, if pipe tobacco blended of imported and. Australian, leaf contained 13 pei cent, of the latter there was to be a considerable rebate in the duty on the imported leaf. This policy not only overcame the difficulty of smokers having to choose between tobacco mixtures containing only imported tobacco and other mixtures containing only Australian leaf, but it was also designed to cultivate a taste for Australian tobacco amongst was quite a proper one. If one were to go to Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Rhodesia, or any other country which grows tobacco in any quantity, one would find that the people of that country appreciate and demand the peculiar flavour of the local product. Therefore, it is only proper that the Australian Government should seek to cultivate a taste for Australian tobacco and its distinctive aroma. The percentages of local leaf permitted to be increased from 2-J per cent, lo 3 per cent., and from 13 per cent, to 15 per cent., in the case of cigarettes and pipe tobacco respectively. At the time it was announced that as sufficient quantities of Australian leaf became available the statutory minimum percentage of local tobacco would be raised, and no one has ever criticized that policy. The tariff schedule now before the committee does The tariff schedule not propose to abandon that policy, but it does propose to alter considerably the Minister has not yet spoken, the proposed tariff schedule contains, in itself, an admission that sufficient Australian leaf to meet the statutory minimum percentage is no longer available. Sufficient Australian leaf is not being produced to provide an admixture of 3 per cent., in the That result was case of cigarettes, or 15 per cent.,, in the case of pipe tobacco. Adoption of the proposal before us would authorize the Minister for Trade and Customs to prescribe from time to time the proportion of Australian leaf to be blended with imported leaf. The fact that it is necessary to make such a provision is in itself a serious reflection on some one. The honourable member for Griffith( Mr Conelan) pointed his finger at the farmers, and obviously either the farmers or the Government are responsible for the present decline of production. I shall discuss this aspect of the matter presently, but at the",25,Customs Tariffbill 1948
55,Mr Mcewen.,"moment I point out that it is a very serious thing for the committee to authorize any Minister to say to importers and manufacturers: "" In my judgment you are entitled to be absolved from the obligation to pay vast sums of money in duby "". And it must be realized .that, the amounts involved will be very large. extracted figures showing that in the year .1945-46, in the course of the operation of the law, duty .concessions on cigarettes totalled £592.000. The concessions were made because the manufacturers used 3 per cent, of local leaf. In the same year, duty concessions to manufacturers using the statutory minimum admixture of 15 per cent, of Australian leaf in ' pipe tobacco amounted to £845,000. In that year, in respect of cigarette and pipe tobacco, manufacturers were granted a concession of £1,437,000. The figures for 1946-47 are, for cigarette tobacco. £-910,000, and £1,1.38,000. The total concession to manufacturers in that year was £1,953,000. In those two years duty concessions were approximately £3,500,000, but those concessions are now to -be given on the personal decision of the Minister for Trade and Customs and not in accordance with the specific operation of a statute. We have allowed ourselves to drift into a posion a continuous and unarrested slide. tion in which we are required to repose in a Minister the power to grant a rebate of £'3,500,000 in two years. I hare no doubt, that that fits in with the policy of 4,000,000 lb.; in 1944 it was 3,800,000 lb.; the Labour party, which seeks to .avoid the specific application of statutes and to it was 2,400,000 lb. I do not know what -centralize authority in officials and in particular Ministers. I protest against the drift that has resulted in this most obnoxious result. ber serious ? MrM c EWEN I have no doubt that the honourable member for Hume. ( Mr growers determined positively by the Fuller) regards this as a joke. It is wrong that a policy with such far-reaching and serious implications should be brought before the Parliament without any explanation being given by the Minister concerned. I delivered my second-reading speech the honourable member was absent from the chamber. The Minister's speech contained none of "" this information. game played by-the honourable member. to be granted by the Minister principally I have to one company. It has been pointed out from all sides of the House in debates on tobacco that the British-Australasian Tobacco Company Proprietary Limited produces 90 per cent, of the tobacco manufactured in this country. I do not know whether that figure is correct, but there is no doubt that it produces the great majority. This is the company upon which a former Minister for Commerce and Agriculture made a violent attack last night. It is not a satisfactory state of affairs when a member of the Cabinet makes such an attack in the course of a debate upon legislation defor pipe tobacco, signed to repose in a Minister personally the right to grant or withhold these vast concessions. The root of the trouble is to be found in the serious decline in the production of tobacco in this country in recent years. It is a crop that is bound to fluctuate from year to year. Production, however, has not only fluctuated but has gone down In 1941 tobacco production was rather more than 5,000,000 lb.; in 1942 it was almost 7,000,000 lb.; in 1943 it was in 1945 it was 2,500,000 lb.; and in 1946 the figure will be for this year, but I have no reason to believe it will improve. The explanation of this decrease in production is to be found not in seasonal conditions but in policy. Since 1941 the tobacco-growing industry has been virtually under absolute government control, with the prices to the Government. There is not the slightest doubt that a man's decision to accept a certain job or to grow a particular crop is largely determined hy his estimate of the return he will get. From his meagre knowledge of the industry, the honourable member for Griffith( Mr Conelan),. speaking as a supporter of the Government, said last night that the explanation for the decrease was that the farmers",26,Customs Tariffbill 1948

60,Mr Mcewen,"Thes e concessions areturned from the production of tobacco to '.'he raising of other crops. I disagreed with most of what he said, but on that -point he was right. In the exercise of their discretion, the farmers turned to the production of other crops. By its ill 150; 1945, 150; 1946, 165; 1947, 187.5. judged policy of maintaining too low a price for tobacco, the Government is discouraging the production of this crop. It -is one that we need more than tomatoes, maize, beans, peas and the other alternative crops that the farmers grow. It would have saved us dollars; if production had risen instead of falling, a tremendous contribution would have been made to the easing of the acuteness of our present dollar position. I propose to quote figures showing how the Government handled the price factor. A system of appraisal of tobacco leaf was introduced. It was somewhat similar to the system for the appraisal of wool. That was a good decision, and one that I have advocated for years. But the whole success of the appraisal system in respect of its impact upon the volume of production lies in the price level of the table of limits. The Government took 1939 as the base year; .and for the first year to which appraisals were applied, namely, 1941, the table of limits was worked out on the basis of a 25 per cent, increase of the 1939 price. In 1942 there was a further 10 per cent, increase upon the previous year's table of limits, which was the base year plus 25 per cent. In 1943 there was an additional 10 per cent, on the base year; and in 1944 there was the same figure as in 1943 plus a 10 per cent, subsidy. In 1946 there was the same figure as in 1943, again plus a 10 per cent, subsidy; and in 1946 10 per cent, was added to the total of the previous year's actual table of limits. For 1947 there was a 13 per cent! increase on the figure for the previous year. In view of those figures, honourable members and listeners may be inclined to ask what one is moaning about, because those figures seem to present a continuous upward curve in the price which ought to provide an adequate incentive to production. This magnificent and .continuing increase of price will be more readily understood when I quote from the corresponding table of indices. Taking 1939 as the base year .with a base index figure of 100, we find that the fixed price on the table of limits in respect of subsequent years expressed in terms of index figures was as follows: 1941, 125; 1942, 137.5; 1943, 150; 1944, Those figures sound all right but let us see how they actually worked out in money to the farmer. In 1941, the first year of appraisal, the average return to the farmer was 29.06d. per lb. In the next 'year, after receiving a 10 per cent, increase, the farmer received 29.94d. per lb. The next year, when he was receiving ani'other I'O per cent, increase, his return -was 30.86d. per lb.; and the next year,, when he was still receiving an increase of '10 per cent., and when the index figurewas 150, h'is return was 2S.'87d. per lb.. In theory, he was receiving 50 per cent.. more for his tobacco; but, in fact, hisre'turn was a half-penny per lb. less than he received in 1941. In 1945, when the index figure was still 150, or an 'increase -of 5'0 per cent, on the base year, his return was 27.07d. per lb. or 2d. per lb. less than he received in 1941. subsidy. r return hirn another 2Jd. per lb. In 1946,. when no subsidy was paid, and when theindex figure had risen to 165, he received,, despite the increase of 65 per cent, in theindex figure, only 3d', per lb. more than, he received in 1941. Having regard to. the. increase of the index figure by 65 percent, on an original price of 29d. per lb.,, an increase of 65 per cent, on the base year index, at a quick glance, would represent an increase of 20d. per lb., but, in fact, the farmers received only 3d. .per lb. more. .. Mi'. POLLARD -The honourable memberis assuaning that the leaf is always of the same quality. what the farmer actually received; and it is the money which the farmer receives that determines whether he will go on growing tobacco.

In, respect of the tobacco industry, it has exercised uninhibited powers and it has destroyed the industry, and has thus helped,to put this, country "" in the cart"" with respect to our, dollar problem; but not satisfied with its ineptitude in applying price control to one industry, it now seeks to apply price control to all industries. An examination of the control exercised by this Government over the tobacco induatry reveals a sorry state of affairs. I challenge honourable members to mention any other industry that has thus been brought to its knees during the term of office of this Government when it has been armed with every control and authority it could imaginably possess. It. is the duty of the Minister to stand up and tell the committee what is the policy of the Government with respect to stimulating the production of tobacco in Australia.

My mind goes, back nearly twenty, years, to the problems of tobacco production in Victoria, when,, in the. Ovens Valley, in, the very electorate-that the honourable member for Indi. now represents, a, vast expansion, of tobacco production was taking place. That expansion occurred largely as the direct outcome of the incentive given to the industry, by the Scullin Labour Government. It is. true-and 1 want to. be. perfectly fair-that that incentive-was s.o. great that it stimulated the formation of bogus companies, or., to say the least, companies with little substance and little knowledge of the propositions that they were 'embarking upon. It' encouragedin. theind-ustry people with neither the production nor thetechnical knowledge required in such, a difficult industry;, but, at least, itdid bring forward vastly increased! production both there and; in other parts of Australia. It is true that for a period in the 'thirties, there was again some degree of expansion of production. But always, in certain circumstances, this industry has taken, from time to. time, a serious backward step. It is useless any one in the Parliament or anywhere else trying to tell me that that nan be. attributed to the Government..

To me, it looks as though it was picked immature or placed in an inefficient drying kiln. Anyway, it did not result as a high-class leaf. Also .amongst the samples are samples of leaf for which no price was offered because of its inferior quality owing to poor kiln-drying, picking or some other cause. Those are problems that cannot be overcome solely by the price factor. The people in the industry must know how to engage in it . Science must be applied to it. Shortages of material and labour for irrigation, which is required particularly in Queensland, must be overcome. It is said by investigators that irrigation is essential in Queensland. further research work is essential by the State authorities and the Councilf or 'Scientific and Industrial Research. That work is going on all the time. The problem finally in regard to prices is one that -c:ir.nct be overcome, despite what the honourable member for In d i says, unless he is prepared to accept the responsibility -of saying to the people who are almost .the sole purchasing authority, "" You have to take this leaf into your factory and pay so much per lb. for it "" .

I ask the honourable member to state whether he is prepared to support -a proposal to force the company to pay a certain price for the leaf, whether it considers the leaf is worth that amount or not, and to compel the company to take into the factory for manufacture into cigarette or pipe tobacco a type of leaf which it considers does not measure up to its requirements. it, but the Minister is now doing so. -did suggest it . ment is doing is to continue the policy -of the Government of which the honourable member for In d i was a member, of allowing tobacco to be imported at a reduced rate of duty in accordance with the proportion of Australian leaf which is incorporated in it for smoking .in Australia.

80,Mr Pollard,"A f t e r all, thatappraisal scheme, it is -essential to continue in the post-war period some form of marketing control. With that .object in view, the Commonwealth representatives at the meetings of the Australian Agricultural Council in July, 1947, submitted to the State Ministers for Agriculture the proposition that the States should cooperate in such a plan. They expressed their concurrence with the proposal, and the Australian Government thereupon decided that, the States having indicated their willingness to co-operate in such a plan to continue appraisal and Commonwealth marketing, it would introduce the necessary legislation, provided the State Governments brought down similar legislation. At a meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council last week, the Victorian Minister for Agriculture indicated that his State was not interested. In those marketing cannot be continued. The result will be that tobacco-growers in Victoria will market their leaf as a separate entity, and tobacco-growers in Queensland will market their leaf as. a separate entity. There will also be a division of appraisal authorities. Indeed, the Commonwealth appraisal authority will cease to exist. happen? season. Unfortunately, there may be several marketing authorities, and only one buying authority. That situation may lead to a differentiation in price systems in the'two States, with substantial ultimate disadvantages to the tobacco growers of Australia. Any hope that one might have of dealing with any sinister practices,, as they have been termed, can be realized only through a co-ordinated all-powerful marketing authority, having the blessing and .legislative assistance of the respective State parliaments. Unfortunately, that will not be possible. I can only hope and pray that matters will turn out all right, but I have grave fears indeed about the ultimate result. Reference has been made to sinister influences in the industry. I believe that we should say .less about sinister influences, and get down'to facts. After all, sinister influences do not count very much if one produces a first-class leaf. Where co-ordinated Coimnoiiwealth-Statc a first-class product is available, the protection afforded by the tariff should, in itself, result in the purchasing authority at least endeavouring to "" play the game "", I know that, in the past, it has not been in the interests of buying companies to encourage Australian production, but I am' extremely doubtful if to-day they are deliberately standing in the way of increased tobacco production in Australia. If the Australian tobacco-grower, aided by scientific research and adequate marketing facilities, produces a quality leaf, the buying authority can be brought to a sense of realism, and will face up to its responsibility, provided always that some body is vested with a residual power to deal with it, should it not face up to its responsibility. > put whole districts out of the industry. out that the Commonwealth tobacco marketing authority, because of the objections of Victoria, is virtually dead. If we are to have several States marketing tobacco and only, one buying authority, they all might be put out of the industry, but I do not believe that will happen. In my opinion, we must concentrate on helpwill that ing the tobacco-grower, particularly with scientific advice, and ensure that, wherever possible, suitable persons engage in tobacco culture. At present, the Bureau of Agricultural Economics section of the Department of Commerce and Agriculture has under consideration proposals for tobacco-growing in Northern Queensland. I consider that there is scope in the tobacco industry for the .right class of ex-serviceman, contiguous to people who have a lifetime of experience of the industry. Making allowances for all the war-time disabilities, the Government has always demonstrated its earnest desire to assist this industry. We shall continue to do so, and anything within reason that we can do to increase the production and quality of tobacco in Australia, we shall certainly do. The following premium system has been adopted for the 1948 crop, on the basic value of the leaf. The prices quoted in the table of limits, without the percentage",31,Customs Tariffbill 1948

If the basic value of the leaf is from 18d. to 26d. per lb., a premium of 6d. per lb. will be paid. If the basic value of the leaf is from 15d. to I7d. per lb., a premium of 3d. per lb. will be paid.

I replied to an attack .by the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully) on the company, and pointed out that the Government had treated it in that way. tway as .other .importing -companies were treated. Mr AttlTH'OMT (Richmond) [4 -35] The Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) has given to honourable -members an illuminating account of the' tobacco industry, and its trials and tribulations. As one who had some experience of the industry in the early years of World War II . , I sympathise -with his ^admanistrative difficulties. He 'has confessed that in spite of everything that the Government has attempted, and the nirgent need for the production of tobacco in this country to conserve dollars, tobacco-growing has declined rapidly. According to figures given by the honourable ' .member for Indi( Mr MeEwen), seven years ago, in 1941-42, approximately 2.000,000 lb. of tobacco Was produced; to-day production is a mere trickle. That is conclusive proof, of proof be required, -of a reg.rettaole failure somewhere, and -if the Minister does not know where the failure has occurred or what can be done -to prevent its recurrence, the industry -faces complete extinction.' As the honor.Mfi -member for Indi has pointed out, in.ountive is an important factor. It is im'pontant in every trade and occupation. As one who has had some experience of igrc.ving various .primary products, I -am-expectanc y not merely.of a marginal profit but of a handsome profit-grower s .will not continue their activities. I say that itbere must be a handsome profit heeause -.such a profit is -required, in some years at least, to offset losses in adverse rseasons. All .primary producers are faeed with the possibility of extremely lew incomes or evenflossesin some seasons .and they depend .upon their ""bumper"" -crops ito carry .them over -.those periods.

Profit should be averaged over a number of years. In my electorate in the northern part of New South Wales tobacco-growing has practically ceased although a considerable -volume was produced in years gone by. L i the Tenterfield district, and along the Queensland border, can be seen disused toba.cco kilns' by the score.

86,' Mr Pollard,"In exactly the -sameinsect pests, and adverse seasonal conditions. I have no doubt, however, that with the incentive of profitable prices, there would be a drift back from other industries-perhaps less important industries-to tobacco-growing. As the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture has said, tobacco production is a .highly-skilled and specialized industry. It is also a tedious industry and few Australians have had the patience to .stick to it. In areas adjacent to my -own district the industry is almost entirely in the hands of Italians. I do not intend to disparage these people in any way, but tbey are the only ones who are prepared to spend many hours, day and night, planting out the roots, watering, .spraying to prevent diseases and to combat insect pests and attending the drying 'kilns. Australians .certainly will not tackle this industry to-day when they can find much more remunerative occupations -elsewhere. Another thing that is stifling tobacco-growing, and the Minister has rightly put his finger on this point, is -the scarcity of labour. In every country -district of Australia almost impossible to find farm employees. The problem is not always the wages that are offered. Men just will not go into the country districts. -country working conditions with those in more lucrative industries in the cities. They realize that by remaining in the metropolitan areas they can enjoy a 40hour week, receive higher wages, and have more opportunities for sport and recreation, so why should they go into the suggest that consideration be given to' bush? The drift from rural areas to the -cities is unchecked. Recently .1 visited many parts of the Commonwealth and -everywhere the farmers told me the same story. At Mildura, in' the electorate of the' honourable member for Wimmer'a. ( Mr Turnbull), fruit-growers said that they' did not know how they were going to harvest their crops. In the past, they had been getting all kinds of. casual employees but this source of labour was drying up. Many casual fruit-pickers had come to the conclusion that the little extra they received after paying taxes was not worth the effort, and they were no longer 'interested in temporary jobs. Similar conditions exist in the sugar injur. Anthoiiy, I'ustry, as honourable members representing cane-growing districts will testify. Order! The honourable .member must confine his remarks to the items now before the committee.. what is happening in the tobacco industry to-day is characteristic of the conditions obtaining in other primary industries. The point I am making is that unless the Government takes steps to ensure that primary producers shall receive adequate returns for their labour, there will be a continued drift to other avenues of employment. It is all very well to say that tobacco-growers should offer higher wages to attract labour; but how can they pay higher wages unless their returns are sufficient to enable them to do so? ""Wages depend entirely upon the price that can be realized for the tobacco leaf. I agree with the Minister that a premium .should be paid for first-grade leaf. It is no use this country growing ten times .the quantity of tobacco that to-day. it is we are now producing if it is to be of a quality not acceptable to Australian smokers. When all is said and done, the man who smokes the-tobacco is the arbiter. They compare He determines whether he will smoke Australian leaf or whether he will pay a fancy price for imported tobacco, as he is doing to-day in the main. Therefore, I welcome the encouragement that has been' given to growers by providing for a premium price for superior leaf. In fact, I increasing the margin payable for better grade tobacco, because the production of such leaf is considerably more difficult and more expensive than the production of lower grades. More art and more careful attention in the drying and other processes are required to produce high quality leaf, and the product is certainly worth much more than poor leaf. I view with concern the far-reaching powers possessed, by the Minister for Trade and Customs to fix the amounts payable to 'the tobacco companies under certain conditions. As1 the honourable member for Indi( Mr McEwen) pointed out, he has the disposal of £2,000,000 or £3,000,000 under his personal control and subject to",33,Customs Tariffbill 1948

It was introduced into the legislation about the end of 1946, and I do not know to what extent the power has been exercised up to date. It would be interesting to have a statement from the Minister on that subject. While the Minister has power to distribute bonuses, or whatever one might like to call them, amounting to millions of pounds, there is a possibility of things happening of which we have seen and heard more than enough in the last few weeks. I hope that the Minister will be more successful in stimulating tobacco production in Australia in future than he has been in the past, because unless something is done soon we shall not have much Australian tobacco to worry about at all.

95,The Honourable Gentleman Mr Harrison,"The processes inTherefore, it is in the main what .one might term a peasant industry. That is why, as the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) pointed out, the industry is being gradually taken over by aliens who are accustomed to lower standards of living than Australians. These immigrants are taking over the industry because it cannot be developed under present conditions on. a basis that will give the farmer a return per acre comparable with that which .he can obtain from other crops which are more cheerfully looked upon by the present Government. This committee, will soon be considering another part of the schedule dealing with our trade agreement with Rhodesia. This contains some reference to tobacco, and honourable members will find that Australia has made an arrangement .with Rhodesia for the acceptance of Rhodesian tobacco. That arrangement was made at a time when there was a flush period of tobacco production in this country. I wonder what will be the ultimate result if we continue to develop trade agreements of this nature to the detriment of our own tobacco^growers. AlthoughI was the Minister who negotiated that trade agreement with Rhodesia, I say that we should examine the agreement again in the light of the present situation of the Australian tobacco industry, which seems to be fading out of existence. It seems to me to be ""going down the wind "" because of the failure of the Government to encourage an industry which should mean so much to Australia at this time of dollar restrictions. wind "" when the honourable member was Minister for Trade and Customs flush in production at that time. The encouragement given to manufacturers and importers to utilize increasing, quantities of Australian leaf by means of the ""drawback"" provision in the duty payable on imported leaf which had been blended with a sufficient percentage of local leaf, did increase the production of Australian leaf.' The industry has had . its ups. and downs, and the application of an artificial stimulus to Australian production did result in Australian tobacco gaining a bad name because vast quantities of inferior leaf were foisted upon the Australian -smoking public. I realize also that large sums of money were spent to establish the industry in this country, and ihat the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research made energetic and protracted efforts to combat the various diseases and pests which beset Australian tobacco crops, and I appreciate the splendid job done by that hody. The fact remains, however, that tobacco growing is an industry of fluctuating fortunes. If things had gone light with the industry it.might. at this time of acute shortage of dollars, have been of untold value to our national economy. Nevertheless, one cannot overlook the fact that 'because of the short-sightedness of the Government, and of the Minister .for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) in particular, the industry has received no assistance, and that is largely responsible for its present condition. The treatment . meted out to the tobacco industry by the Government is in line with its attitude towards many rural industries. The further contribution which I desire to make to the debate is to bring to the attention of the committee a telegram which I have received from Mr Shorten, president cf the Southern Queensland Tobacco Growers Association, who telegraphed me after he had listened to a broadcast of the debate last night. He states that the first mOve which the Government should make is to ""improve marketing so as to assure growers' full commercial value for leaf produced "". 1 was most interested to hear the speech of not ""up the the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard), and I appreciate the problems and difficulties confronting the Government in regard to this industry. However, the Minister says we have no light to use' the term "" sinister"". as applied topurchases. Mr Shorten does not employ that term, and I hesitate to use it. However, I am satisfied that growers have good reason to be dissatisfied with the methods' of marketing which have obtained in', the industry. The first sales of tobacco crops* in any season, invariably realize the best prices. It is said that the majorcomp'any buying for all. manufacturers pays the better",35,Customs Tariffbill 1948

98,Mr Adermann (Maranoa) [4.56],"price, until the. demand's of the smaller manufacturers are met, when the prices have fallen. That happens year, after year-, and although growers have in many years held back samples of* the first part of' their crop sold fop purposes of' comparison with the latter part, the large companies, invariably allege that the tobacco, which they purchase is of inferior quality to. that sold earlier, arguingthat, in consequence, they are entitled to p.ur-. chase it at. a lower price. When things like that happen year after, year they cannot be due to mere coineidertce, and this is an injustice suffered by growers to which I have drawn attention many times previously. Before any otheraction is taken to improve the lot of tobacco growers that is something, which should be remedied. Mr Shorten then urges tjie payment of ""government assistance to solve production problems "". I do not know exactly what he had in mind, but frorn the latter part of his telegram I assume he means the payment of financial assistance for the purpose of combating disease and pests. Like many gphers, f believed that mould, the principal disease to which tobacco crops' grown in this country ar,e susceptible, could be overcome by spraying with ljenzo'1, but evidently that is not sp.

I disagree with that contention, because if it is capable of being mechanized at all, it could be mechanized only to a limited degree. I cannot imagine how a machine could be utilized to pick grubs off tobacco plants every morning, or to gather leaves as they mature. An entire tobacco crop is not harvested at one time, the operation is progressive. Difficulties, would present themselves to the use of machinery in several cultural operations. If this, indusquires the use of kilns. To meet the try is to succeed we must be prepared to supply labour. I rose to put before the committee the point of view of the growers, who say unanimously that their proposals provide the solution of the main difficulties. Unless a price is given that will encourage growers to produce-no t a borderline price-w e shall never get the production that is needed. [5.6] I spoke last night upon this important industry as it affects Australia. J was surprised to hear the Minister make the best speech for the monopolist that I have ever heard from, a member of a so-called democratic Government. He probably spoke as he did because of his ignorance of the real position, but nevertheless his speech was merely a defence of the monopolist. He concluded his wandering remarks by saying, in effect, that if the quality is good the price will be right. That means the price paid by the manufacturers, hut I do not trust them any more than anyone else does on this side of the committee. The Government is throwing this industry into the hands of a foreign element. Only certain types of persons will be able to make a success of tobacco-growing in Australia and they are the people accustomed to a lower standard of living than Australians, such as Yugoslavs and others from south-eastern Europe. Some fifteen years ago the Canadians fought to save their agricultural industry and to prevent their standard of living being lowered by reason of an influx of immigrants accustomed to a lower standard than 'themselves. The same position is now arising in Australia. Honourable members on this side of the chamber want a prosperous yeomanry and not the indigent peasantry that this Government is sponsoring by its actions. It is probable that the Minister made his defence of the monopolist, as it was in effect, because he had not taken the trouble to ascertain the technique of tobacco-growing. Other honourable members have referred to it and to the patience that is required, but only in passing. I have grown tobacco from a seed bed. We used to cut whole stalks down, put two across a pole and carry them into a tobacco -shed. That was the procedure 30 years ago, but the technique now represent requirements of the cigarette market, the tobacco leaf has to be stripped periodically, in other words, it is necessary to adopt the technique of the Hollanders in countries like Sumatra. Honourable members opposite would be enlightened if they visited that country and talked to the people who are making a success of tobacco-growing there. I do not wonder that the Hollanders are fighting the barbarians for their rights and for the return of their plantations. When tobacco-growing land there has bean used for five years, it is spelled and not used again for ten years. The private companies of the Hollanders, have research organizations continuously at work, but in Australia the policy is haphazard and go-as-you-please, despite the fact that we have established the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. I do not know of one government experimental farm that is assisting the growers here in the same way as the private research organizations in Sumatra and Malaya are helping growers there. The tobacco leaf grown in eastern Sumatra is produced essentially for cigar coverings and is so assiduously culled that much of it is destroyed. I was reliably informed by a Hollander that there are about 30 different classifications of leaf. There are some for length, some for colour and others for flavour width and so on. If we are to put the industry on a proper basis in Australia and to have a prosperous yeomanry rather than an indigent peasantry, the price of tobacco leaf to the grower must be guaranteed by the Government. It is useless for the Minister to. run away from the problemand to say that if the colour or the quality is right the price will be right.

Items' agreed to. Item 180 agreed to. Item ,229 (Petroleum and shale products)a comprehensive item covering naphtha, benzine, benzoline, gasoline, pentane, petrol and any other petroleum or shale spirit. I believe that the reduction of duty is not sufficient to encourage the project of the National Oil Proprietary Limited at Glen Davis. I have had considerable experience of that project, not only in my present position as a liaison between the mining unions and the Government but also as chairman of the Public Works Committee when it inquired into the project from 1943 to 1945, and even farther back than that, in connection with the American commission's proposal for a hew plant to extract oid from shale known as the Renco or Jackmani retort. Works Committee included representatives of all the political parties then, represented in the Parliament. After exhaustive inquiries, the committee submitted to the Parliament certain recommendations, including one that while the committee agreed that the Pumphers\on retorts should be improved, it considered that a pilot plant should be erected to try out the American idea in order to ascertain whether we could recover from 120 to 140 gallons from a ton of shale, which, it was claimed, Lad been shown to be possible by laboratory tests. We found that the retorts had been set up in various places. The Americans claimed that the retort "" delivered the goods "", but we were not quite satisfied for ence to the subject he has been discussing, we wished to see it operate on what may be termed run-of-the-mine shale instead of selected shale without the dirt that would go through with run-of-the-mine shale. That recommendation was carried out in part, but, on my recent visit to Glen Davis, I found tliat the plant has never been completed, let alone tested. That indicates to me that we waste money in setting up parliamentary committees whose recommendations are not carried out. The committee of which I was chairman was of the opinion that, the system should be given a fair trial, but the excuse now offered is that not sufficient shale is being mined to supply the present plant, despite the fact, that it was put to me, as a miner, that if we could induce the miners at Glen Davis to agree to a system of extraction of pillars by machinery, sufficient shale would be mined to supply not only the existing plant but also the new Renco or Jackamani retort. There must be some reason for the failure. I make it quite clear that miners fear extraction of pillars by machinery. They believe that it endangers their lives. But many of the miners have invested their life savings in homes at Glen Davis. They do not want the project to close clown as a losing proposition, as it has been for a period of years under the control of the National Oil Proprietary Limited. The project has been able to carry on only because the Labour Government has carried the losses. I was at Glen Davis only a fortnight ago and The PublicI spoke not only to the miners but also to a public meeting in an attempt to keep production at as high a level as possible. They have agreed to do so. The honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison), as a member of the Public Works Committee when I was chairman, will agree that Glen Davis is completely isolated. It has no amenities, no bathing facilities, no hospital and no hall for pictures, bar a bug and flea-ridden bag place. The people there are living in isolation trying in a period of national emergency to get shale for the nation. Order! The honourable member is a little wide of the matter before the committee.

In 1946 the British preferential tariff was reduced The from 9d. to Sd. a gallon, the intermediate tariff from Is. to l i d . and the general tariff from Is. to l i d . However, those reductions do not restore the pre-war rates. These duties, we know, are imposed for revenue producing purposes,, although they also afford some degree of protection to our local industries. The Minister should also explain to the committee the reasons for these variations. These duties have been validated over a number of years, and honourable members will be interested to know exactly why the duties have fluctuated as they have done. A similar explanation is due to the committee in respect of item 277, carbonic acid gas. In .1933-39, the British preferential tariff was 2d. per lb. and the intermediate and general tariffs were 3d. per lb. In 1940 the rates were increased to Is. 2d., .Is. 3d. and Is. 3d. per lb. respectively. In 1946 the British preferential tariff was reduced to 2d. per lb. and the intermediate tariff and general tariff to 3d. per lb.

The description of the goods follows the wording of item 19 appearing in the Customs Tariff. As the result of the alteration of the wording of tariff item 19 proposed by the Customs Tariff resolution of the 14th November, 1946, it is necessary to make a consequential alteration to the schedule of the Customs Tariff (Southern Rhodesian Preference) Act. The alteration to which I have reItem ferred, was the provision that the minimum, quantity of Australian tobacco leaf which could be blended with' imported cessional rates of duty, was to be varied in accordance with-the size of the Australian tobacco crop. Previously, provision was made that a fixed percentage of Australian leaf was required to be blended with the imported leaf. Honourable members will see that the proposal is on all fours with the proposal in relation to tobacco imported from sources other than Southern Rhodesia. Question resolved in the affirmative.

123,Mr Pollard (Ballarat,"-Minister for104 in Committee of Ways and Means: 'Consideration resumed from the 14th November, 1946 (vide page 262, vol. That the schedule to the Excise Tariff 1921-193!) be amended . . . {vide page 260). Item1 (Beer) and item 11 (Petroleum or shale products)-by leave-considere d together. for Commerce and Agriculture) [8.33]. -The amendments now proposed to the Excise Tariff are associated with 'Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1, of the 14th November, 1946, and are designed to implement reductions of duty as part of the Government's 1946 budget .programme. The reduction of Id. a gallon, in the rates of duty specified in item 11 of this resolution is complementary to the reduction of Id. a gallon in customs duties on petrol and allied petroleum products provided for in Customs Tariff Proposal No. 1 of the 14th November, 1946. Honourable members will note from the memorandum of alterations that a number of changes in item 11 have occurred since it was enacted in 1939. First, the rates were increased by 3d. a gallon from the 3rd May, 1940, as a revenue measure. On the 21st August, 1940, the item was amended to cover coal tar and coke area distillates other than benzol, and the rates on liquid fuel produced from both indigenous shale and coal were reduced to encourage and speed up production of fuel in Australia. At the time the Menzies Government gave an assurance to producers that, provided they were in production by the 2.1st August, 1942, they would be given protection against imported petrol for a period of fifteen years. The item was worded accordingly. . War-time circumstances prevented some producers from commencing production by the date stipulated and the item was subsequently amended to remove this condition. The amendment of the 5th March, 1942, was effected to make the item more comprehensive. Tbe definition of "" beer"" is also being amended for administrative purposes. I am rather interested in what the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture Tariff Proposals 1946. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Tariff Proposals 1946. ( Mr Pollard) has said. I realize that certain administrative changes are provided for in the proposals that the committee, is considering, but so f a r we have not. heard very much about them. I invite the Minister to tell the committee just what is intended, and how the changes are likely to affect tariff and excise duties generally. I take it that we are now dealing comprehensively with the entire schedule. That means that we have an opportunity to discuss, for instance, an amendment to the definition of beer. We are also able to discuss excise duties imposed upon "" Petroleum or Shale Products, viz.: Petrol, Benzine, Benzoline, Gasoline, Naphtha, Pentane."" and so on. This, of course, opens up the entire field of petrol rationing and the production of oil from shale-the matter with which the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Jamas) was dealing so ably a few minutes ago. We are also at liberty to discuss, I take it, "" Coal Tar and Coke Oven Distillates"" &c, mentioned in item 13 (c) and ""Petroleum and Shale Distillates"" &c, mentioned in item 11 ( B ) . First, I should like to know the reason for the addition of the definition of beer. This, of course, is a suitable subject for discussion on a hot evening in. Canberra, and, although, I am not one who is addicted to this beverage, I am so intorestp/1 that T should like to know the meaning of the wordsFor the purposes of this item, beer means any fermented liquor brewed from a mash of malted or other grains or extracts from malted or other grains with or without sugars or glucose or both sugars and glucose, hops or other vegetable bitters. That all sounds very nice. AmI to assume that we now have better methods of brewing? No doubt the Minister, with his vast knowledge and great experience, will be able to tell me what is meant by 'hat, definition. I come now to certain remarks made earlier in the debate by the honourable member for Hunter. It is true that' I was a member of the Public Works Committee when, in the early days of World War II . , it investigated the production of oil from shale at Glen Davis and Baerami. I was vastly interested in the possibilities of these fields, and of others including Latrobe, which we all believed, gave great",43,Customs Tarif F Southern Rhodesian Preference

126,Mr Harrison (Wentworth) [8.36].,"liopas of the production in this country of necessary wartime fuels. In the course of our investigations we came across a retort known as the Renco retort which, it was claimed, gave a yield that was staggering compared with that of other retorts. The company interested in the Glen Davis deposits took over this retort with the idea of using it as a pilot plant, and, in the event of satisfactory operation, installing others throughout the works. It was taken up to Glen Davis. The committee saw the plant in its dismantled state where the foundations had been set for its erection. We were then told that it would be erected within a.period of ten months. The honourable member for Hunter greatly interested himself in this matter on behalf of hi9 electorate and because of the great knowledge which he. has of the subject. As chairman of the Public Works Committee, he received assurances that the Glen Davis management proposed to go ahead with the erection of the retort. The committee was informed in evidence that great losses had been sustained in the Glen Davis field. We knew that private, enterprise was waiting to develop the ""Baerami field and was awaiting a report as to the suit-ability or otherwise of the Renco retort before setting up retorts at Baerami. However, the management at Glen Davis, for its own reasons, did not go ahead with the erect-ion of 'that retort. I am not sure, but I believe that it has not yet been installed. Itsvast possibilities have neverbeen explored. The losses, sustained by the. present method of retorting might well be reduced considerably if the Renco retort were installed and put into operation. Early reportsas to its efficiency should be tested. At, the time the Public Worksi Committee visited Glen; Davis,, it was said that the company operating at Baeramihad every intention of installing Benco retorts in .that, field if the installation at Glen Davis proved to be successful. It was claimed that the more efficient results obtainable from the Renco retort would have-paid handsomely in the early days of retorting, even at the higher excise duty applied by this Government. However, the retort is still lying idle at Glen Davis. I do not know whether it has rusted away completely, but at any rate its possibilities have not been exploited. I suggest to the Minister that action should be taken to bring that retort up to date. The results obtained from it might justify the installation of a battery of similar retorts. I shall not discuss the subject further because I know that the honourable member for Hunter wants to deal with it. Because of hisearlier difficulties in attempting to discuss this subject on another item, ' have endeavoured to give him an indi -. '-ation that he can discuss it now..

If I have any further insolence frona him I shall ask him to resume hisseat immediately. intend to say the word ""wrongly"", and I tried to make an adequate apology. I have visited Glen Davis, as the honourable member for Wentworth knows, on three occasions. I have learned that the retort mentioned by the honourable gentleman has not yet been installed although the Public Works Committee recommended to the Government that it should be erected and tested'. It has been only partially erected. When my remarks were ruled out of order earlier this evening, I was endeavouring to point out that sufficient shale could not be produced to supply the Pumpherston retorts, which are now in use. I went to Glen Davis at the request of the miners federation, to ask the men to extract pillars by machine, which is a very dangerous process. They agreed to do so in order to try and save the homes which they had established there.",44,Tariff Proposals 1946 Excise Tariff Amendment No L

131,Mr James,"Very well. I did notOther governments as well as the present Government have been interested in the extraction of oil from shale under the management of National Oil Proprietary Limited. The project has been a losing one, but we want to try to make it profitable in order that the employees who have gone to Glen Davis to live will have at least some security. These men have put all of their assets into that place, and they want the project to become an economic success. I have never known men and' women more willing to make their town a congenial place. The men are working hard in an endeavour to keep up the output of shale. Many factors contribute to the fact that the maximum possible production is not being maintained at Glen Davis. One of these is the lack of a satisfactory housing scheme. Homes are not provided for married workors. A man does not like to maintain two homes, one for himself at Glen Davis and another for his wife at Lithgow or elsewhere. The State Government has been asked to build homes in that locality in order that the population may be increased and the output of tained. However, the Premier, Mr mentions ""beverages"", which, of course, McGirr, has "" passed the buck"" to the Australian Government and has said that the matter is one for National Oil Proprietary Limited, which is dependent on this Government. That is what has been reported to me. I do not say that it is correct, but it calls for an answer by some responsible person. Furthermore, the State Government will not consider erecting a hospital or even a child welfare clinic. These things affect the success of the Glen Davis project. The building of houses and a hospital would contribute towards saving the money that has been sunk, or at any rate invested, in the Glen Davis proposition by this Government, and by previous governments. We want to make the project a profitable one. If my ideas, which are the ideas submitted to me by the people who live at Glen Davis, are carried out, I sincerely believe that the project can be made to succeed and the homes of the people saved. The Joint_ Coal Board would not interest itself in providing houses and amenities for the workers at Glen Davis. Mr James. It asserted that it had no right to do so, because the word "" coal"" is not mentioned in relation to the process. The Joint Coal Board, therefore, washed its hands of the matter, stating that it could, not provide the same amenities for shale workers as for coal-miners. In my opinion, it would he an easy matter for the Government to bring the employees of National Oil Proprietary Limited within the ambit of the Joint Coal Board so that they may share in the improved, amenities which are to be provided for coal-miners in the near future. Why should the sick child of a miner employed at Glen Davis have tp be transported 50 miles to Lithgow hospital? It is ridiculous that people employed at Glen Davis should he denied ordinary hospital facilities. No provision whatever is made for maternity cases, and the result is that expectant mothers often give birth to babies while PT>, route to the maternity hospital at Lithgow. It is tragic to think that people who are engaged in <i vital national enterprise should be treated in such H fashion. A erpat dp.al will have to hp done to provide reasonable amenities. shale mainThe schedule under discussion specifically includes beer. It is the right of a working man at Glen Davis to enjoy a drink of beer at the end of his day's work, just w black-coated workers do in metropolitan areas. But for three days in every week no beer is available, to him. What is the result? Pedlars of ""plonk"" visit the valley and. sell it to the miners. Those who consume this cheap wine and have a drink of water the following morning find themselves "" on the booze "" again. honourable member must confine himself to the item, under discussion. greater output of shale there must be contentment amongst the miners. The complaints of the miners which I have mentioned contribute largely, to the fact that insufficient shale is mined to justify the operation of all the retorts. I support the recommendation of the Public Works Committee that Renco retorts should be taken into use.

I am wondering, whether, as has often happened in respect of other promising oil-bearing deposits, an attempt is being made to discourage Latrobe deposits. first time in . our history, and for the reasons I have mentioned, a sincere attempt is being made to produce petrol in Australia. All shale deposits, wherever they exist throughout the Commonwealth, including the Latrobe deposits should now be genuinely tested and such efforts should not be abandoned until every possible test has been made. I repeat that no such attention has yet be>eii given to the deposits at Latrobe. Even if the field could be operated for Tasmania only, it would be of tremendous assistance, as all our petrol is imported from the mainland, and that, of course, at times causes us great concern as well as higher costs. SoI put these facts to the committee in order to k«»ep the matter before us that the possibilities of Latrobe shall not he regarded as hopeless. Our Government ' should be inspired to every «.dfort, oven though there may be losses in the initial stages, to get the desperately needed petrol from our own shale deposits. was a member of the Public ""Works Committee that was authorized during the war to inquire into our shale deposits. deposits throughout Australia. We-did not consider there was any possibility of the successful use of the Latrobe deposits. There had been at some long distant date an attempt to produce motor spirit from that shale. The deposit is slight. There are ,a-great many disabilities in its use. There is a hard pebble through a great section of it. Our opinion was that it was quite impossible to produce shale oil at a figure that would encourage any government, even in a time of war, to use it. We decided that there was a possibility of success at Glen Davis. We believed that with the use of Renco retorts there was a chance that we might be able to produce motor spirit there at a cost that, in war-time conditions, would justify the Government in spending money on it. I. do not believe that in-time of peace 'iny government is justified in spending a considerable sum. of money on any of the shale deposits. I believe that there is a. possibility that we should be justified in considering the production of oil the development of the from coal. . We have wonderful coal To-day, for the deposits in New South Wales, but, unfortunately, our experience has-been for the last four or five years that we cannot produce sufficient coal from the New South Wales fields to carry on essential industries-ga s works, steel works and railways. I believe that in Victoria possibly the best opportunity of producing spirit from coal is provided by the vast brown coal deposits of Gippsland, about which the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Bowden) can speak authoritatively. When one considers that there we have deposits running a distance of 100 miles' and varying from 100 to 150 feet in depth one can imagine that with the adoption of the proper method, of hydrogenation, the, method used in Germany, there is a possibility of producing motor spirit at a cost that would justify the Government in spending money on it. I do not believe that the Government would be justified in spending money on experiments in the production of oil from the coal in New South Wales-the deposits there are too --1 valuable from otherpoints of view-bu t the second-gradecoal of Gippsland provides justification for the Government to bring the best experts available to AusWe inquired into shale tralia from Germany where, owing to absence of natural oil, they were forced to produce oil from coal. The Government would, be justified in spending a large sum of money in developing the Gippsland coal deposits for the production of oil, but, as the results of the investigations of the Public Works Committee, .1 do not' believe that the shale oil deposits are worth developing' in any circumstances, other than to meet the exigencies of war.",48,Tariff Proposals 1946 Excise Tariff Amendment No L
140,Mr Rankin (Bendigo) [9.21!,"Lame ENID LYONS (Darwin) [9.25]. -J . support strongly the remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) and other honourable members who have urged the necessity for experimenting with Australian shale by the use of the Renco retorts. In common with the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie), I know something of the Latrobe deposits and something of the report of the committee that investigated the whole' proposition some years ago. The honourable member said that it was 35 years since motor spirit was produced from the Latrobe shale, but I know that motor spirit was being produced from that shale twenty years ago. Bronter retort was in operation and quite a lot of fuel was produced. 1 used some of it on occasions I can verify the honourable member's remarks about the vapours that resulted from its use. Hudson and getting about 10 miles a gallon. W it h a certain amount of commercial petrol in my petrol tank, mixed with the local product, I went from Latrobe to Wynyard, a distance of 40 miles, on just over a gallon. Believe it or not! Mr. ' FADDEN member had the road to herself. Dame ENID LYONS -There was no one behind me for many miles. I was not happy about the smell, myself. But the power was there, without doubt. It was an enormously powerful spirit. The one difficulty, of course, was the lack of refining, and the odor was terrific. Of -course, some damage would be done to, the car engine if one ran too long on the spirit. ' The real trouble was the sulphur content, which, at that time, .could not he eliminated. It so happens that about eighteen months ago I met , Mr George Bronter, who was then -operating the.retort. It was his father, an American, who designed' it . He has now severed all connection with that kind of work, certainly with the Latrobe field -produced. They did not function, for But he assures me that, as the result -of knowledge gained from recent experiments, it would now be commercially possible to undertake the refining of the -output from Latrobe. He says that, in his opinion, because of limitations of which the committee has been informed, petrol produced from Latrobe shale would never be able to compete even with petrol produced from other Australian . shales. It cannot be produced economically enough to' make it worth exporting from Tasmania. He spent two or three years on a complete survey of the field, and' he assures me that it is capable of producing sufficient petrol to meet all Tasmania's needs. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Bankin) said that, in his opinion, as a member of the committee that, investigated the Australian shale deposits, it would not be feasible tp produce petrol The from Australian shale, except under conditions of war. Quite obviously, you cannot begin to produce from shale under conditions of war. The foundations must be laid before the emergency arises. So. I suggest that now is the time to begin I was running a ten-year-old the experiments. The general situation in regard to petrol and, I say with great reluctance, the general situation with regard to war, are such that it would be wise to make whatever provision for the production of petrol within Australia we possibly can. So, I commend to the Government that it proceed with the use of theRenco retort, which has I imagine the honourable proved to be so very much more capable of results than any other retorts hitherto used in Australia. I particularly ask that in the event of any such work being carried out, the Latrobe field be examined most carefully, having regard to' the fact that, as far as I am aware, at any rate, it is the only petrol-bearing mineral in Tasmania. Another subject apropos this is : what ia to be the fate of the power alcohol distilleries that were erected during the war to produce motor spirit from wheat? Tn an answer to a question asked by me, 1 ascertained that about £2,000,000 was expended on these distilleries and that about a dozen pints of spirit was what reason I do not know. In an.v event, wheat is too valuable to be used in the production of spirit. Has the Government disposed of those distilleries?

Year by Gommon.wenl.th .in this undertaking has been increasing. Advances-made'by the Commonwealth during the twelve months ended .the 31st December, 1946, amounted to £3S5,91S, bringing the total Common( wealth'loans at that , date to £3,291,735. Only the original advance of '£334,000 has been covered by a deed of covenant, and charge. When this undertaking first began to operate, Australia was engaged in World War II . , and it was considered that the physical -means of conveying petrol to this countryimight be. completely cut off by enemy action. That .danger does not exist to-day, and the question which 'honourable.members should now ask themselves is whether it is worth -while that the Australian public, who .are-sorely harassed by taxes, (should be burdened with this great incubus, of the< Glen.Da'vis project under National'Oil Proprietary Limited. Financially, the Australian GoverniwaMt, and the Goverainient of New South Wales, are heavily involved. When -we examine the AuiditorGeneral's report relating to piockiction, we find that none of the estimates of production, either at the -beginning or during, the period of the existence of this undertaking, has been realized. In particular, I dii'oct attention to replies which the Minister for Supply .and'-Shipping (Senator Ashley) gave to questions asked by ox-'Senator Eteatnd about this matter. iOn one occasion in 1945, ex-Senator iBrand asked when it w.as considered that N-artional Oil Proprietary Limited's undertaking would reach the target figure of 10,00.0,000 gallons per annum. In a most 'optimistic spirit, the Minister said that it was expected -that the undertaking would reach the production of 10,000,000 gallons in March, 1946. From an examination of the Auditor-General's report, ""I find that the company produced 1,303,000 gallons in 1944, 2,224,000 gallons in 1945 and 4,0.7^000 gallons in 19.46. I .shall be interested to hear the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) inform the committee what-was-the production by the undertaking in 1947, because National 'Oil -Prop-sietary Limited -is not meeting -the estimates of production that were made -in respect of the Glen Davis project. According to the Auditor General's report, the .selling price of -year, the expenditure of the petrol, after excluding excise, was Is. 3.42d -a gallon -in '1946, Is. 5d. a gallon in L1945, and Is. 7£d. in .19,44, and sales of petrol realized £199,720 in 1946, £127 623 in 1945 and .£80,854 s in 1M4: The losses on -operations in those years, were £301,000, -£342;000 and £303,000 respectively. .It ^seems to be extraordinarily bad ' business that in-the production and sale of -£199»OG0 worth of a product -a 'loss of £401,000 should be incurred. Isi t -any wonder that the people of this country-are unable to obtain any -relief from high taxes? Is it right that this great undertaking should he permitted tq, continue to lose approximately £500,000 a year ? Provision has been-in a'de in the -Estimates for the current 'financial year 'for assistance to the Glen Davis -project .amounting to £239,'<300. That figure . seems very low indeed when one considers that the loss on the undertaking has grown steadily from '£263,000 in 1'942, to £4O1,'00O in 1-9.46. I should he interested to hear from the -Minister what .loss -has been incurred in the current financial year. In -reply to a question earlier to-day, the honorable -member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) -was informed that it was not possible to manufacture larger .quantities of wire netting, steel fencing posts, and oilier articles urgently required by the man. on the land if he is to produce the commodities that are necessa:y to alleviate the food shortage inGreat Britain. The reason given by the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture for the inability to increase production of these requirements was the shortage of manpower; yet the Government is prepared to continue to foster' a project which has proved wasteful, not only of man-power, but also of revenue contributed by Australian taxpayers. A loss of approximately £500,000 a year is not insignificant. One can only assume that with losses increasing not in arithmetical progression, but in a manner reminiscent, of steep taxation curves, this little bouncI moveing baby will proba.bly be losing £750,000 or more a year in the not distant future, because, as the infant's age increases, it becomes more and more voracious in its demand upon the taxpayers of this country. might well consider whether the continuance of the Glen Davis project is jus'.ified, or whether it should be scrapped entirely, -particularly in view of its inability to produce even half the estimated quantities of petrol. The continued losses are adding enormously to the capital indebtedness of the undertaking, and the Government cannot hope to recover its investment. of the project would release man-power for the production of essential requirements such as steel for housing. The undertaking was established purely for war purposes It was a safeguard against the risk of Australia being cut off from its overseas oil supplies; but apparently once this socialist Government, which believes that no socialist administration ever makes mistakes in planning, starts the flywheel going, it cannot be stopped. increasing speed, year after year, creating so many vested interests in Government departments that opposition to it is swept aside. . At Glen Davis to-day, petrol is being produced at enormous cost and can only be sold for much less than its real value. AgainI say that the project should be. thoroughly investigated ' with a view to diverting the man-power now engaged in it to more essential occupations than the production of minute quantities of petrol. Labour is Mr Abbott. required urgently for the production of commodities, export of which willassist materially the dollar battle that is now taking place, and of food for the people of Great Britain. In addition there is a shortage of certain commodities such as textiles in this country. Throughout the Commonwealth hundreds of homes await roofs and fittings, while Australian citizens are denied their rightful inheritance. . Items agreed to.

Under the provisions of the Wine Export Bounty Act 1939-1944, an amount of 2s. 6d. a gallon from the excise duty imposed on spirit for the fortification of wine had been transferred to a trust account from which bounty had been paid. With the cessation of the payment of bounty by the expiration of the Wine Export Bounty Act 1939-1944 it was unnecessary to transfer this amount from excise collections and it was therefore decided to reduce the rate of duty on fortifying spirit by 2s. 6d. a gallon. A further amendment to the item was the elimination of the provision for special rates of duty on spirit used in fortifying grape must prior to the 13th March, 1930. The quantity of such spirit yet to bu cleared from bond is negligible and tlucontinuance of special provision was not considered necessary. The simplification of the item results in a flat rate of 4s. a gallon being applied to spirit for the fortification of wine. Question resolved in the affirmative. Resolution reported.

Commerce and Agriculture) [9.56] This proposal is the first of a group of four tariff proposals which were tabled in Parliament on the 14th November, 1947, viz.:-Customs Tariff Amendment No. 2, Customs Tariff (New Zealand Preference) Amendment No. 1, Customs Tariff (Canadian Preference) Amendment No. 1, and Customs Tariff (Exchange Adjustment) Amendment No. 1. The Government made certain decisions in respect of the basis of value for duty of imported goods which were jointly implemented by the four tariff proposals tabled on the 14th November, 1947, and I propose now to refer in detail to these decisions and allow it to serve mainly as an explanation of the associated tariff proposals, which will be dealt with later by the committee. Towards'the end of last year, Parliament approved of a bill to amend the Customs Act to provide for the calculation of value for duty of imported goods in Australian currency and to abolish the addition of the statutory 10 per cent, to the f.o.b. value of imported goods. Prior to this amendment, the Customs Act provided that all duties should be paid in British currency and that the value of goods shown on invoices should he converted to British currency. While Australian currency was on par with that of the United Kingdom the position was satisfactory, but when Australian currency was depreciated in 1930 the paradoxical procedure arose of calculating the value for duty of goods in ' United Kingdom currency, applying a rate of duty of, say, 1.0 per cent., and accepting the resultant figures as duty in Australian currency. .A further practice which was in operation was the loading of the f.o.b. price of imported goods with a statutory charge of 10 per c u t before arriving"" at the",54,Tariff Proposals1947 Excise Tariff Amendment No 2

175,Mr Chifley,"Supply and Shipping has supplied the becoming following information:.1. I have not seen the statement referred to by the honourable member, attributed to the chairman of the Clan Line of Steamers. 2. It is a fact that ships spend veiy considerable .periods in port. There is no necessity for the Government to commence an immediate investigation into all shipping facilities in Australian ports since the Government has had this matter under close investigation for some years and is stiil actively inquiring into it and taking such action as is within its power to improve conditions. The powers of the Commonwealth Government, however, have not. speaking generally, been such as enable it to deal, apart from war-time emergencies, with harbour equipment and installations, with the routing or programming of ships, nor with the transport of cargoes to and from wharfs. Nevertheless, the Government has interested itself in such matters and in respect to the port of Sydney, for exam,ple, in collaboration with State authorities, has initiated action within the last few days to e.\]>cditc clearance of cargoes from wharfs and -wharf sheds where congestion has had a marked effect in delaying ships. Similar conditions exist at other main ports in the Commonwealth and it is the function of State authorities to deal with harbours and railways serving harbours, and of private enterprise to arrange transport for clearing cargoes from port installations and to arrange programmes for ships (except ships belonging to the Commonwealth L in e ) . The Stevedoring Industry Commission, on which both shipping employers and waterside workers are represented, is in almost c6nstant session regarding the manning of the ports with waterside labour and the industrial conditions of waterside labourers. Within the last three weeks, arrangements have been made for 750 additional waterside workers to the previously existing labour level at that port, and the position in respect to labour at all ports is under continuous and close review. From the refrences made above to other factors which affect the total position in relation to turn-round of ships, it will be recognized by the honourable member that the difficulties he alludes to cannot be solved by merely adding to the labour strength at ports. 3. The Government 'will continue to take such steps as are within its power or can be achieved in collaboration with State authorities and as are from time to time recognized as necessary to improve the turn-around of ships in Australian ports. for the Attorney-General, upon notice1. Has he seen the statement made by Mr and whether, in view of the fact 'that the T. Dougherty, federal secretary of the Auscouncils are not operating at *a profit and tralian Workers Union, at the recent federal convention of that union atCoolarigatta, are merely rendering a public service,, Queensland, to the effect that no provision' would the Minister give consideration toMinister for existed under the Commonwealth arbitration law whereby unions could prevent Communists or remaining members of a union? 2. Further, has he seen the reported views of Mr Dougherty that he would be happy if a position could be created to ensure that worthwhile unions could prevent Communists from Attaining office?. 3. Has consideration .been given to the creation of such a law; if not, why not?' honourable member's questions are as follows:1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. It is considered that union members should have a substantially free right of choice from amongst themselves of candidates for office. MR. FALLON. for the Attorney-General, upon notice1. When Mr Fallon. Queensland secretary of the Australian Workers Union, speaking at the annual convention of the union held at Coolangatta on the 29th January, said that those responsible for the hardships -which the people of Australia are suffering to-day because of all kinds of shortages could definitely be regarded as guilty of treason to this country, and treachery to the working people, was heexpressing views which are synonymous with those of the Commonwealth Government? 2. ' If so, when does the Government propose to take action to eliminate such treachery and treason ? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. and 2. I have no information as to what Mr Fallon said at the recent conference of the Australian Workers Union. I will, however, ask Mr Fallon whether he made the statement referred to by the honourable member and will then he in a position to furnish'a reply to his question. last, the honourable member for Cook( Mr Sheehan) asked whether it is a fact that import duties are imposed on' equipment South Wales for their cleansing services,",61,Delays

Where imported equipment is of a class or kind not commercially produced in Australia, consideration is given, upon application to the Department of Trade and Customs, to the question of admission of the equipment, under a customs by-law at a concessional rate of duty -or free of duty whichever is found appropriate.
