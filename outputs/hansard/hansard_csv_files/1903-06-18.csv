I desire to point out that I have delivered, only one speech upon this question, and that that speech was in opposition to the B ill . There must have been some misapprehension in the mind of the writer of the paragraph to which I refer, but I should not like a wrong impression to be conveyed to the public.

If he does so, he will confer a great benefit upon the whole Commonwealth. ber must not debate the subject. able member . himself brought under my notice this morning the following pi-ess report:Mr George Compere, entomologist to the .West Australian Agricultural Department, returned to the State last week, after a lengthy trip through America and Europe in search' of parasites for pests that have given trouble to local orchards. In Spain he found six different parasites of the codlin moth. One of these had completely eradicated the codlin moth in one Spanish district. Mr Compere did not bring any of the codlin moth parasites with him, in consequence of their not being required here. I do not know in what light the action suggested, if taken by me, would be viewed by but I shall consider the question with the desire to do anything that lies in the power of the Government to. assist the States in.

6,Mr Speaker,"'Ihav e received an in t imake no apology to honourable members for taking this step, because I find that 150,000 people have been disfranchised by the incomplete collection of the names for the proposed Federal rolls. This House took a great deal of trouble to provide a most liberal franchise for the Commonwealth electors. The Adult .Franchise Act, which confers the franchise upon females as well as upon males, was assented to by the Governor General on the 18th June, 1902, so that it has now been in operation for twelve months, and the Electoral Act was assented to on the 10th October following, HO that it has been in operation for eight months. Honourable members may, therefore, ask how is it that the rolls necessary under those Acts have not been prepared ? In the remarks which I have to make on this subject, I shall speak more particularly of what has been done in New South Wales, because I know more about the state of affairs there than in other States, and I shall leave other honourable members to speak in regard to the States which they represent. Although the Commonwealth electoral law differs very greatly from the electoral law of New South Wales, being much more liberal than it, the Minister for Home Affairs has taken as the basis for the Commonwealth roll the State roll for males which was collected in A p r i l , 1902, and revised in October of the same year. tween the provisions of the Federal law and those of the State law, I may mention that whereas a man is entitled to vote at the Federal elections after he has resided six months in Australia, no person who has resided in New South Wales for less than twelve months, even though he may have been a resident of Australia for twenty years, can obtain an elector's right and be enrolled, and every, elector must have resided for a month in the division for which he is enrolled before he can vote at an election. Under the Federal law a man who had resided in Australia for six months and had taken up his resideuee in any State for one month could vote at the Federal elections, but in New South Wales he would not elections until he had resided there for twelve months, and in the division for which he was enrolled for one month. Then, again, under the Federal law, persons in receipt of assistance from the Government are entitled to vote; but under the State law such persons are disfranchised. Furthermore, the members of the military and naval forces in receipt of full pay are entitled to vote at Federal elections, but they are not entitled to vote at the State elections. The State law also contains other disqualifications which are not imposed by the Federal law, and makes it necessary for intending voters to procure electors' rights, which are not required under the Federal law. Yet, notwithstanding these great differences between the law of the Commonwealth and the law of the State, the Minister for Home Affairs has taken no steps whatever to obtain the compilation of an electoral roll iu accordance with the law of the Commonwealth. A roll has been collected upon tlie basis of the State roll, but there is a discrepancy between the census returns and the names on that roll of about 42,000 males, and about 29,000 females, or about 71,000 in all. Sir ""WILLIAM LYNE -That is not the information which I have given to the Housewhen the honourable member looks into tlie matter, he will find that my figures are correct. The roll in the hands of the Minister omits several thousands of electors qualified undertheFederal law, because it was compiled under the State law. If allowance is made 1 for the omission of the names of such persons, the discrepancy will be seen to be still To show the difference begreater. No doubt the honourable gentleman will tell the House that he has had a Federal roll prepared, but I would inform honourable members what has actually been done. The New South Wales Government authorized the collection of the names of persons entitled to vote under the State law without reference to the Federal law, and on the 24th September, 1902, a circular was issued, also by the State Government, directing the collection of the names of females entitled to vote, not under the Federal law, but under the State law, which, as I have shown, contains many disqualifications which are not in the Federal law. The roll of female voters collected in New South Wales by the State authorities has never yet been revised, and yet the Minister be able to vote at the State for Home Affairs wishes honourable members to believe that he has taken every step to so prepare the Federal rolls that every male or female entitled to vote under the law passed twelve months ago shall be placed on the roll. I find that in 1891,",12,Adjournment Forma Electoral Rolls
7,Mr Sydn Ey Smith (Macquarie),I,13,Adjournment Forma Electoral Rolls
8,Mr Sydney Smith,"I think thatwhen no electors' rights were issued, after deducting those who were entitled to vote under a property qualification, the difference between the number-of persons on the roll and the total male adult population of New South Wales was 45,362. When we deduct from this number those who were disqualified from one cause or another, there was a difference at that time between those who were actually on the roll and those who were entitled to vote of ou\y 7,163. From the time that the electors' roll in New South Wales was used in 1901, up to October, 1902, when the last return was submitted, there has been an increase of 14,000 in the number of male adults in the population of that State. Yet we find that, whereas in 1901 there were 318,370 electors' rights issued, the rolls as compiled at present contain the names of only 303,000 male electors. Notwithstanding the fact that there has been an increase of 14,000 in the adult male population of the State, and that many persons were disfranchised in 1901 because of their not having resided in one place for a sufficient length of time to qualify themselves under the State law, and the further fact that the Federal electoral law is much more liberal than the State law, we find that there has been, a decrease of 15,000 in the number of male voters as compared with two years befxwe. This shows clearly that there is a real deficiency, and that upwards of 40,000 male electors in New South Wales have not been placed on the roll. enter into the question of the rearrangement of the electoral divisions of New South Wales, because I do not think that honourable members have any right to introduce that subject unless they are asked to submit suggestions from the electors. ""Under the Federal electoral law, the Minister is required to appoint a chief electoral officer for each State, but I would ask if he has done so? . He is also reguh-ed to appoint a Commonwealth electoral officer for each division. I would again ask if he has done so ? has not reason to complain very often about the Minister not making appointments -whethe r he has taken up his elector's true. It is also provided tliat an electors' roll for each State shall be prepared as soon as practicable. That provision was made eight months ago, and the Minister has not appointed any officer to prepare the rolls, or to ascertain the exact number of persons to whom the right to vote should be extended. I have taken a good deal of trouble to go through the rolls, and I have found a number oE decreases. For instance, although there has been an increase of population in Sydney, the number of electors in every one of the eleven divisions of that city show a decrease, compared with the roll of 1901, the total being 4,842. In the suburban' electorates there is a decrease of 3,600. crease. all know that. In the country electorates to the south, there is a decrease of 2,809 ; in those to the west, a decrease of 2,710; and in those to ihe. north, 1,056 ; or a total decrease for the State of 15,0-58 compared with the roll of 1900. The Minister has done nothing to ascertain the number of persons who are entitled to vote, and, although I do not for one moment expect that he should give his personal attention to every detail of the work of his office, I think that perhaps he would have been better engaged in looking after the administration of this Act than in travelling about to some of the States. He might at least have secured the services of a competent officer to ascertain the facts of the case, and to make sure that every man who is I need not at this stage entitled to vote is placed upon the roll I ask the Minister whether he has any Federal roll whatever at this moment -whethe r he can show that any roll has been prepared under the conditions of the liberal franchise provided for in the Federal law 1 The basis of the. rolls which he has must have been the State rolls which have been prepared under .an entirely different law, and a large number of persons who would be disfranchised under the State law would be fully entitled to be placed upon the Federal rolls. There must have been fully 30,000 or 40,000 persons who have never taken up their electors' rights, but under the Federal law every person who has resided iu Australia for six months right or notis entitled to have his name upon the Federal roll for the division in which he lives. Supposing that my name were on the roll for.the Bathurst",13,Adjournment Forma Electoral Rolls

12,Mr Sydn Ey Smith,"Of course wedivision, and that I moved from Bathurst to Perth, about four miles distant, I should have my name struck off the State roll unless I resided in Perth for one month; but that would be no reason for omitting my name from the Federal roll. The Federal roll has been framed solely upon State rolls, -and apparently no inquiry has been made as to the disqualification attaching to those whose names are not included on the State rolls. I do not wish to detain honourable members any further, but I felt that it was my duty to . direct attention to this important matter, and to, if possible, stimulate the administration into taking the steps, required to secure the preparation of proper rolls. If we allow matters to drif t as the Minister has done, we shall probably find that from 100,000 to .150,000 persons who .are entitled to vote, will be left off the rolls. It was the desire of every member who supported the Electoral Act that -every man and woman entitled under the law should be afforded an opportunity -to exercise the franchise at the next Federal -election, and therefore it is important that -every precaution should be taken to secure this end. The decreases to which I have -referred should have been the subject of inquiry by the Minister, and he deserves -censure-for.not having taken proper steps to administer his Department. He was warned by the leader .of the Opposition that he would probably find himself in some such position as that in which he is now placed, because he appointed as the officer in charge -of the Electoral Department a gentleman who was recommended for retirement from the public service of New South Wales in 1884, and who was retired in 1896. It was shown at an inquiry into the administration of tlie electoral office in that State that 55 officers were employed, and the staff was afterwards reduced to fourteen, at which strength it remains to the present day. I trust that the Minister will see that prompt step3 are taken to insure that -every person entitled to vote under the Federal law shall be placed upon the rolls. happy instance has been afforded of the muddle into which a department can fall. It is a pity -that, although the likelihood of thi«posibion being brought aboutwas pointed out to the Minister, no provision was made against it. I do not think that we can altogather blame the Minister, because when we put a man into a position which he is not capable of filling we can expect only one thing, and that is muddle. We did expect a muddle, and we have got it , and those honourable members who support the Government are to blame for continuing to give the Minister their countenance. It is plain that at least 150,000 electors have been disfranchised. If the Minister for Home Affairs had had no time to carry out the requirements of the Act, there might have been some excuse ; but over twelve months have elapsed since the passing of one Act, and eight 'months since the passing of the other, and yet nothing has been done. The collection of Federal rolls in New South Wales, under proper administration, should not occupy more than two months, and if the work were carried out in connection with the State Electoral Department, the expense need not have exceeded about £1,000. I dare say that fully that sum has been muddled away in other directions, with the result that there is nothing to show for the expenditure. It was pointed out to the Minister at the time that there was a strong probability' of confusion arising; indeed, the leader of the Opposition went so far as to absolutely declare that confusion would arise It has -arisen. Of course it may seem hard that the blame should fall upon the Minister for Home Affairs, but upon whom else should it rest 1 When honourable members find that the same conditions which prevail in New South Wales obtain in the other States, we are afforded an excellent illustration of how much time may be wasted in doing nothing. The 150,000 electors who are at present disfranchised in New South Wales, as well as the 60,000 or 70,000 who oocupy a similar position in Victoria, are entitled to lay the whole blame for the loss of their votes upon the Minister himself. A t the same time the Government cannot escape from their responsibility in the matter if they allow the Minister for Flome Affairs to continue to fill an office which he is incompetent to administer. By the same process pf reasoning, Ministerial supporters, if they permit the present muddle to be continued, cannot evade their share of responsibility. In two months this confusion could be rectified. The whole of the Federal rolls could be compiled afresh. I understand that in New South Wales an expenditure of £1,000 will be necessary to bring the Commonwealth roll to a proper",14,Adjournment Forma Electoral Rolls

But the chaotic conditions of which I complain are not confined to Western Australia. In New South Wales thedifference between the census returns and the electoral rolls represents 90,000 namesof electors, and in Victoria, 40,000. In those two States, therefore, there are.130,000 electors whose names are entitled I have in my hand a to be placed upon the electoral rolls, but which do not appear there. I contend that any division of the electorates, either of Victoria or New South Wales, which is based upon' such rolls, will not be a just one. There has been a blundering and neglect which is not creditable to the Department for Home Affairs, or its Ministerial head.",15,Adjournment Forma Electoral Rolls

20,Mr Kirwan,"I can assure him thatUnder the circumstances, only one of three courses can be adopted to rectify that blundering. It has been suggested that the elections for the House of Representatives might be postponed until its members retired by effluxion of time. I ani sure that if anything of that kind is done, it will be against the wishes of seven out of eight of the members of this House. It would be contrary to the best interests of the Commonwealth if the. elections for the Senate and the House of Representatives did not take place simultaneously. The elections for the other Chamber must be held in December, and the people would be called upon to submit to unnecessary expense if those for the House of Representatives were not held at the same time. not receive the support of a majority of honourable members of this House, and I am equally certain that it is opposed to the wishes of the great bulk of the people -September 22 -Exhibitio n of the lists, and needed for the Senate. objections which have been urged to the present rolls of electors for the House of Representatives are equally applicable to the rolls for the Senate. There is another proposal which has been made in some quarters, namely, that the elections might be conducted upon the divisions at present existing in the various States. course has to be adopted it will certainly be the fault of the Department for Home Affairs, and it will also be contrary to the desire of honourable members as expressed when the Act was passed. law. ber reminds me, it would be necessary'to pass an amending Act before such a step would be in accordance with' the law. There is only one othei; course which can be pursued, and that is to endeavour to have all the rolls ready in time to enable the elections for the two Houses of this Parliament to be held-as was originally intended-simul taneously. The elections for the other Chamber must take place prior to the 31st December. If the electorates are to be recast, the Department will have to make almost a-superhuman effort to have the rolls ready in time for the elections. I notice that in the press this morning a time-table is published regarding the fixtures for the elections so far as Victoria is concerned. That table is very much behind the time when compared with the fixtures for the other States. If it were possible for all the divisions of the States to be completed by the 1st July there would be the greatest doubt whether all the necessary work could be accomplished before tlie elections should takeplace. The time-table to which I haw referred readsJuly1 -Division of States possibly completed. July 31 -Plans will have been exhibited for 30 days in accordance with the -Act. August4 -Plans laid before Parliament. August 18 -Eesolution s passed by both Houses, approving of divisions in all the States.

Under the circumstances the Government are undoubtedly at fault for not having made J;he As the honourable memnecessary preparations beforehand.

26,Mr Kirwan,"A start should havei t . But the impression I have is that which any outsider might receive, and the Minister, if he has a good case, ought to be glad that the matter has been brought forward, and an opportunity afforded him to justify himself in the opinion of honourable members, and also in the opinion of the country. As already pointed out, there is a deficiency in two States alone of 130,000 names, and that is a matter an explanation of which is due from the Minister. The Minister would have been far better employed in administering his Department than in gallivanting around Tasmania, telling the people of that State how much he has been attending to the wants of the community. I . w is h it to be clearly understood that I am not in any way averse to Ministers delivering political -speeches so long as the work of their Departments is attended to ; that is their first duty, and political speeches might be left for their leisure. It is in the interests of the country that Ministers should travel about the Commonwealth, but it is not in the public interest that, in thus travelling about and delivering speeches, they should neglect their work. that there are deficiencies in certain electorates which I know very well cannot be attributed to data of recent compilation. In Sydney there are certain districts with .settled and fixed populations, which may become more dense each year; while there are other districts in which the population is becoming less, owing to the fact that dwellings are being razed to the ground for the purpose of erecting warehouses and other business premises. I see that the re-adjustment of the Federal electorates has been based on the old State rolls -manifestl y an ""incomplete and imperfect basis; and in my opinion this House ought to insist on the rolls being compiled by the Federal, and not by the State authorities. I observe that in the Glebe electorate in Sydney there was a voting strength of 3,2S0 in 1901, and that in the intervening period there has been a decrease of 361. I do not know how that result has been arrived at, but it must be within the personal knowledge of the Minister that a fluctuation of that sort is more likely to be accounted for by removals, aud by the neglect of new arrivals to apply for electors' rights, which is not essential under Federal law, than in any other way. It is quite true, as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie said, that the Minister for Home Affairs has been making himself well acquainted with the requirements of this great continent; but the honourable gentleman ought to have left some competent authority to attend to the business in his absence. That, I am afraid, the Minister did not do. As I have already indicated, I am of opinion that the re-adjustments of the Federal electorates ought to be based on data furnished by the Federal authorities. The Minister appointed some presumably competent person to perform the necessary work, but it is quite clear that nothing was done by that person towards compiling the rolls on which the Commissioners were to be asked to complete their work. Under the circumstances the Minister should take a conciliatory attitude, and give the House some sort of assurance that that which has not been done should be done immediately. These is no reason for assuming that this motion for adjournment is hostile; and I am sure honourable members are very much indebted to the member for Macquarie for introducing the subject. I had no idea, and I feel sure other honourable membeirs had no idea, but that the rolls were compiled by the Federal authorities. The female portion of the electors are indebted entirely to the States authorities, although they received the franchise for reasons unconnected with the States, and may vote on considerations different from State considerations. I should like to hear what the Minister has to'say to account for the extraordinary lassitude in this particular Departmenta lassitude which is only partly explained by thecriticism levelled against the head of the Department by the leader of the Opposition, who described that gentleman as utterly incompetent. ""Whether that is sufficient to explain the lassitude of the Department I do not know, but I can never consent to allow the whole of tlie blame to rest on the departmental officers. The Minister in charge of the Department must shoulder tlie responsibility if he chooses to employ incompetent persons. a position to know the cause, but I think the Minister will admit that matters are in a very unsatisfactory condition, in view of the action taken for mapping out the States into new electorates. I do not know that the difficulty could be altogether avoided by the Department. In New South",17,Adjournment Forma Electoral Rolls
27,Mr Hughes (West,Sydney) I notice,18,Adjournment Forma Electoral Rolls
28,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"I am not i nWales, on account of the severe drought during the past twelve months, large numbers of electors have been driven away from their usual places of residence. grazing, and mining pursuits have been compelled to leave the western parts of the State and go towards the east; and 1 am reminded by the honourable member for Bland, who, like myself, represents a western district, that in a great many cases, although the male population remained, the female population were sent into the towns and cities. In a number of the western centres those entitled to the franchise were temporarily absent when the names were being collected, and in some cases their names were on that ground refused by the police. It is very doubtful whether the names of these people were collected in the districts where they happened to be temporarily resident, and I know of cases where, under the latter circumstances, the names were refused on the ground that the residential conditions had not been fulfilled. These facts account very largely for the big difference which has been discovered between the census returns and the rolls, and seem to indicate the possibility of a very big injustice to country districts under the proposed redistribution. So far as New South Wales is concerned, the political weight in this House has shifted from the country to the city in the case of one representative; in other words, the country has one representative less, and the city one representative more, as compared with the present arrangement. In view of the abnormal conditions, and of the unsatisfactory state of the rolls, the present attempt to carry out the divisions of the State is simply farcical. The whole question of allocating the electors should .be considered before a decision is finally arrived at. Those electors whom the Department believe to be in the State, but who cannot be discovered, should be found, or some attempt made to find them before the final decision. The machinery employed by the Statesi n this work up to the present time has been very imperfect. A considerable number of electors, who are qualified under the Federal law are disqualified under the State law, and no account is taken of these. Then so far as my inquiries go, no complete list of the female voters in the State of New South Wales has yet been compiled. The only list which the Federal Electoral Department has, or which is in any way available to the public, is one on which appear the names of those females who themselves apPeople engaged in agriculture, plied for electors' rights. ber should know that that statement is absolutely wrong. I thought he had sense enough to know better. An Honorable MEMBER The police collected the names. police collected the names, but I am not aware that rolls containing the additional names have been issued, and there is no certainty as to when they will be issued. My contention is that until very recently the only names of females appearing on the rolls were the names of those who applied personally for elector's rights to the different electoral registrars of the States, and not the names which were handed to the police. Sir WILLIAM . LYNE -That is not correct. The police canvassed the whole State. tour through my eleccorate, and when there I was asked by female electors how they could ascertain if their names had been collected by the police, and were on the Federal rolls. I could not give them any information on the subject, but if the Minister can do so, he will be conferring a great benefit upon them. Of course, I was able to inform them that the Minister had intimated that, if they wrote to the Electoral Officer for the State, their cases would be inquired into ; but unless some other method, is adopted, the Electoral Officers will require large additions to their staffs to enable them to deal with the correspondence which will come to them. The whole matter is in a very unsatisfactory .position. The Minister should devise some scheme which will enable electors to know definitely if their names are upon the rolls, and to take steps, if they have not been enrolled, to get their names placed on the rolls. If the States are divided in accordance with the States rolls the division will be of very little use. What is necessary is that the Federal rolls shall be brought up to date, and that then, they shall be open for the inspection of the public. Then, when they have been finally revised, the States should be divided. But if the redivision of the States takes place before the Federal rolls are complete, it will be simply farcical, because the work will all",18,Adjournment Forma Electoral Rolls

31,Mr Brown,"I have recently made ahave to be done over again. I do not approach this matter in a spirit of hostility to 'the Department, but I desire that there shall be no delay in the completion of the rolls. If the present anomalies are not removed, the probabilities are that a very large number of the electors of New South Wales will be disfranchised when the Senate elections are held at the end of this year, and if the Government see fit to send the members of this Chamber to tlie country at the same time, the injustice will be intensified. Therefore it is necessary that consideration should be given to this matter at once, especially as not only is the State of New South Wales affected, but also the States of Victoria and Western Australia, and probably the other States of the Commonwealth, too. -electoral rolls in Queensland are concerned, -everyone is perfectly satisfied with them. my own electorate, which covers more than half of Queensland. Some honourable members have electorates which might almost be effaced with a postage stamp, but it would take more than a blanket to cover mine. The police have had the greatest difficulty in collecting the Queensland rolls, but the -consensus of opinion in my electorate is that the work has been well done. Those whose names have not been collected have in many cases gone to the nearest police station, and had them put on the rolls, and in this way thousands of names have been added since the first collection. are mostly the names of the nomadic population, which is very numerous in the western portion of the State-name s which the police cannot very easily obtain, because it is impossible for them to visit every water-hole and billabong in the State. Buti f in New South Wales there has been no systematic enrolment of electors, the dereliction of duty by the officers of the Department is very serious. I know that a house in the middle of Grafton, in New South Wales, was unvisited by the police. If that can happen in Grafton, I do not know what might not take place in the western parts of the State. It is not to be wondered at that 42,000 names have been left off the roll. No one has called at the house where I am staying in Melbourne to collect the names of the inmates, and I have advised them to write to the Chief Electoral Officer. But, as the honourable member for Canobolas has pointed out, if it is left to the individual electors to get themselves enrolled, a great many will be disfranchised. The intention of Parliament was that every man and woman in the Commonwealth, of the full age of 21 years, should be able to vote at the Federal elections, and I am at a loss to understand why there should be such a discrepancy between the number of such persons in New South Wales and the number of names on the Federal rolls for that State. I know that the Minister is fully alive to the facts, because, in conversation, he told me that he could not account for them. any satisfactory step to prevent the disfranchisement of electors. himself later on There was a very amus: ing paragraph in the Age this morning, in which it was was stated that a policeman had forgotten to hand in 1,000 names which he had collected. I have heard of men' in New South Wales holding 500 electors' rights, but this policeman was even a better politician, and could keep twice -as many names up his sleeve. The fact of the mutter is that, as everything is new, it is difficult to make the arrangements work smoothly, though I believe that everything will be right when the proper time comes. There is . one question, however, which I should like to ask the Minister. According to statements which appeared in the Queensland press during the recess, no Those adequate provision has been made for the printing of the Queensland rolls. As Queensland covers a vast territory, it will take some time for the rolls to circulate through the different electorates. There' fore the sooner they are sent out the better. Buti t is said that the authorities do not know how to get them printed-whethe r they should purchase linotypes, or buy more type. If proper arrangements are not made quickly, however, the rolls may not be available when the elections occur, and we shall then be in a worse position than in the first instance. In Queensland they hold revision courts in November, to purge the rolls, and they do it with a vengeance. One court struck off 400 names at a sitting. They do not ask whether the electors are still qualified : they simply strike their pens through the names, and often men are unable to get themselves re-enrolled before the next election.

I should like the Minister for Home Affairs, therefore, to inform us what provision has been made for the printing of the Queensland rolls, and if everything is in readiness for their publication at the 'earliest moment 1 obliged to the honourable member for Macquarie for bringing this matter forward, because, although the Department has had .difficulties to contend with which were almost inevitable, I do not think sufficient -expedition has been exercised in the collec-. tion of the rolls, and in the adjustment of the -electorates. It seems to me that, as things are going, the rolls will not be ready at the time of the Senate elections, and, of course, would not be available if the elections to this House occurred at the same time, as I think they should. they must. manner in which tlie Department is allowing matters to drif t is likely to result in -our having either to fall back on the old rolls, or to postpone the dissolution of this House for a longer time than is necessary. The report of the New South Wales Commissioner will not be available for presentation to this House for some weeks to come, and in some of the States even a longer period will elapse.. I do not know whether we shall have any opportunity of criticising the reports or referring them back to tlie Commissioners for further consideration. If Ave have an opportunity for criticism we must consider the time that will be available to the Commissioners forgoing through the various divisions once more, and allow for a month after they have completed their labours to give time for the lodging of objections. That is an aspect of the matter which shows the necessity for hurrying the work on, because, once the divisions are settled, the rolls will have to be made up for the different districts from the lists now sent in. That will take some time. Then the rolls must be exhibited for a certain period to enable persons to see them before the Revision Court sits. That will mean another month's delay, and after the revision has taken place the rolls will have to be corrected again in order to make them complete, in view of the decisions given by the courts. Eveni f we accept without question the decisions of the Commissioners the complete rolls cannot be issued before at least the end of October. On the other hand, if the House refers any of the reports back to the Commissioners for further consideration, or if the Senate exercises its right to take a similar course, another five or six weeks' delay will be involved. This being so, it seems to me that the Minister and the officers of his Department have something to explain. I know that the Minister has shown a desire to push matters on, but his efforts have not been fully seconded by his officers, if one may judge by results. I . think that it is time some change was made in the direction of affairs if we are to have the rolls prepared in time for the next general election. I believe this can be done even now, if the work is taken in hand vigorously, and pushed on with all possible speed. MrA . C.

They will belong to the honourable member for Gippsland, if the new boundaries recommended by the Commissioner are adopted; but, until the new subdivision is confirmed, the}' belong to me. If the mistake to which I refer had not been made there would have been no necessity to alter the boundary of the Flinders division, and to bring it within a mile of the town of Brighton in order to include a number of suburban residents, and thus make up the number of electors required for the constituency. In this one instance, a serious mistake has occurred in my constituency, and no doubt the same could, be said regarding others ; and, if there is anything like such a large, discrepancy as reported iu the press, a very searching inquiry should be made. It has been stated that the police have made a house-to-house visitation in the whole of the electorates in order to enrol electors; but they did not come to my house, and I ' do not believe they have ever been near the place. One honourable member told me that a short time ago the police visited his house, when he was absent, to obtain information with regard to the roll. The policeman interviewed the housemaid and got information which satisfied him. We know what takes place on such occasions, and, as a matter of fact, in this case the information given was entirely wrong. If that was the general plan/adopted to obtain information for the compilation of the rolls, we can quite understand how the discrepancy occurred. hope the Minister will have the maps withdrawn and new ones issued when the rolls are complete. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) The object of passing the Electoral Act last session was to afford the Government plenty of time to make the necessary preparations for the forthcoming elections. So far as Queensland is concerned, I must admit that the roll compiled for the purposes of the next Federal election is very mush larger than the old State roll, but still a number of mimes have been omitted. I do not intend to find much fault with this, because I can quite realize the difficulty of collecting names in outlying places, especially when it is remembered that the drought has probably driven some of the country residents into quarters where even the police would not be able to find them. During the last two or three weeks I have received communications from several persons who complain that their names are not on the roll. They do not blame any one for the omission,, but they want to know howtbeycan repair it,, and it is difficult to obtain information. I communicated with the Electoral Department, and was told to write to the police, or to send direct to the Federal Electoi-al Registrar in Brisbane. I have adopted thelatter course, but whether this will bring about any result I do not know. My principal complaint is that, although the Electoral Act was passed early in October, 1902, it was not until nearly the end of February last that the Electoral Department started, to compile the rolls in Queensland. I understand that some difficulty occurred between the Federal, authorities and the Queensland Government as to the mode to be followed in collecting the names. The Queensland Government desired that the .State electoral registrars should collect the names, but the Federal Government insisted, and properly so, that the police should collect them. I want to know how it was that such a long time was allowed toelapse before negotiations were entered into? Several months were allowed to pass without any steps being taken ; but if the Minister and those under him had been alive to the position they would have taken steps immediately after the"" passing of the Act toarrange for the compilation of the rolls. Then we could have had. the lists printed, and the final reports of the Commissionersmight have been presented to the House at I the opening of this session. To all appearances, however, it is not likely that we shall receive the report of the Commissioner forQueensland for another two or three weeks. It will be another week or eight days before the maps can be printed. These will have to be sent to the various centres of population for exhibition, so that objections may belodged, and three weeks must pass from the time the maps are sent out before they can reach such distant places as Camooweal, Burketowri, or Windora. What possiblechance can residents in such places haveof registering any objections they may take to the boundaries defined by the Commissioners? A good deal of blame must be attached to the Department for havingallowed a state of confusion to be brought about. It has been statedI do not say that the report is true-that the Government do not want the election for the House of Representatives to be held in December. If the elections do not come off then, the country ought, to rise up in arms against the Government. I am as sympathetic as most honourable members towards the Government, but I would not screen them if they brought about such a state of confusion that the elections could not take place at the most convenient and desirable time If the Government do not want the elections to come off in December, why do they not get up and say sot a fact.

Then a large number of persons were omitted because of their removal from one part of the State to another. It seems to me unfortunate that any Commissioner should be asked to settle the boundaries of the new electorates under the peculiar circumstances in which we find ourselves. When on a recent visit to my electorate a number of residents inquired of me how they could insure getting their names placed upon the Federal roll. I adascertain if their names did not already It is very unfair appear there, adding that, if they did not, under the Federal electoral system it was I am not making very easy indeed for an elector to get his Several questions have name upon the roll, and very hard for him wise step to take, seeing that postmasters",21,Adjournment Forma Electoral Rolls

I suggest that the present difficulty could be met, to a large extent, by making use of . the services of the police aud postmasters. In the country districts the police are acquainted with almost everybody resident there, and if they were asked to search the State rolls to ascertain whether any names which should appear there have been omitted, and if so, to see that the fault was remedied, I think the discrepancy which now exists between the census returns and the Federal rolls would be considerably diminished. The Minister for Home Affairs, I admit, has already taken some steps to overcome the difficulty by advertising, but I would point out that there are many people who do not see the newspapers, and who therefore are particularly liable to be disfranchised. I think that if we made use of the services of the police officers it would be possible, within the limited time still available, to have the rolls ready for the senatorial elections. A t the same time, if the elections for this House are to take place simultaneously with those for the Senateand I have already expressed myself in favour of the adoption, of that course-it will be utterly impossible to decide upon a fair division in connection with the new electorates unless extreme activity is displayed iu the preparation of what is practically a new roll. The failure of the Department has been largely due to its dependence upon the State rolls, although I think that, when the Electoral B ill was under consideration, most honourable members favoured the idea of making use of the services of the police. I know of one instance in which a voter obtained his elector's, right as far back as the 5th June of last year, and yet his name does not appear upon the Federal roll. I can offer no explanation for this, but we ali know that hundreds of similar cases occur in connection with the preparation of the State rolls -case s which are not remedied before the Revision Courts hold their sittings. I think that if the officers charged with the work of compiling our rolls displayed a little more activity, it would be quite possible to have them ready in time for the elections in December. to me that our object in passing the Electoral Act last session was to place every female roll has not been printed, much less adult in the Commonwealth in a position to ' revised. record his or her vote at Federal elections. If the motion submitted this afternoon by the honourable member for Macquarie achieves that result this discussion will not have been in vain. If I followed correctly the figures quoted by that honourable member, it is evident that the last speaker has been misinformed. According to the honourable member for Macquarie, 65 or 70 per cent, of the electors who areat present disfranchised belong to the metropolitan districts. take.

We know, however, that in New South Wales the franchise for the return of members to the State Legislature is so different from the liberal franchise for the Commonwealth elections, that unless special instructions were given to the officers charged with compiling the rolls there, they would naturally fall into error. I understand that no such instructions were given, and the result is that a very great discrepancy exists between the census returns and the Federal rolls. I was really surprised to hear that the female electors had been so overlooked by the Department for Home Affairs. Honourable members have been informed that the female roll has not been revised, much less printed. learned member is basing his argument upon an assumption which is not correct. assurance from the Minister.

Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume-Minister for Home Affairs) -In some instances a great deal of feeling has been imported into the discussion. I do not object in the slightest degree to the motion submitted by the honourable member for Macquarie; indeed, I am rather indebted to him for it, because it affords me an opportunity of justifying everything that has been done by my Department, and of clearly proving that there has not been that neglect and delay which some honourable members attribute to my officers. The Electoral Act was assented to on the 10th October last, and immediately afterwards preliminary steps were taken with a view to ascertain the conditions under which the cooperation of the States officials would be available in the collection of the lists. When the Electoral Act was before this House, as will be admitted by honourable members, a great desire was shown for economy; and, therefore, in' the compiling of the lists, my object was, as far as possible, to keep down expenditure. It did not seem to me possible, I would call the attenin a reasonable and complete manner, to collect these lists without the aid of the States. Apparently the proper course was to endeavour to get their assistance through the police. The only other course I could have taken was to appoint special collectors throughout the various States, and pay them large sums of money for the work done. I might, of course, have obtained the assistance of the various post-office officials; and, indeed, in some of the northern parts of Western Australia that was done. On the 17th November a circular letter was issued to each of the States, with the exception of New South Wales, asking officially for the services of the States officers in collecting the names of electors. To that circular letter replies were received from Victoria on the 22nd November, from Queensland on the 26th November, from Western Australia on the 1st December, and from Tasmania on the 6th December.

The authorities in South Australia were prepared to take their rolls as completed at the last revision; but I did not agree to that, and after correspondence, an arrangement was made under which the plan suggested by the South Australian authorities was carried out in the northern parts of that State, but in the settled parts in the south the aid of the police was called in. Immediately on receipt of consent from the States to the members of the police force collecting the names, it was arranged that the necessary books and printed instructions should be issued. Government should pay to each foot policeman, and each mounted policeman, so much for the day or week he was employed in the collection of the names. The books and instructions were issued to Victoria at dates from December, 1902, to January, 1903; to Western Australia in January, 1903; to Tasmaniai n January, 1903. The preparation of these book-lists, as they were called, took up a great deal of time, considerable difficulty being experienced in getting the printing done with reasonable celerity. I ask honourable members if there was any delay up to 'this stage ? after the passing of the Act. approved pn the 10th October, and communications were sent to the various States on the 17 th November. later, and in the meantime considerable work had to be done in devising the scheme under which we were to work.

A similar difficulty arose in one or two of the other States, but a little longer time was occupied in the case of Queensland, in arranging definite terms, than in other cases. The lists were then collected by the police, by whom the work was completed in Victoria, Queensland, and South Australia in May, and in Tasmania in June. The completion of the work in Western Australia is promised by the end of this month. When once the books had left my hands I had no control over the action of the police, but I repeatedly corresponded with the Premiers of the I arranged that the Federal various States, and, through my officers, with the police authorities. I was in Western Australia in February, when I ascertained that difficulty had arisen because the police did not desire to do the work.

It was not, however, until after a great deal of trouble that the arrangement was made for the police to collectthe names in that State. Hadi t not been for the action taken by Mr James, the Premier of Western Australia, when my officerarrived there, I should not have been able to have tlie rolls compiled by the police in that State; but I understand that sincethen the work has gone on satisfactorily.

We must remember that, between the publication of the maps and the final forwarding of them to the Mr Lewis has Federal Government, there will be an opportunity given of rectifying any omissions. As soon as the matter has been dealt with by Parliament another revision court must be held; and, therefore, if a few names have been left off, they may very easily be placed on the roll. There are two periods of a month each in which electors will have an opportunity of getting their names on the roll. there will be no officer other than the Electoral Officer for the State, of whose existence very few people are aware, to apply to. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have appointed an officer"" in New South Wales, whose office is in Sydney, and I have extensively published the fact that all information on the subject is obtainable from him. The discrepancy to which reference has been made is between the number of adults LYNE -The officers residing in the State according to the last could have nothing to do census returns and the number of names appearing on the lists.

In connection with the LYNE -In New South collection of the female rolls, I agreed with the Government of New South Wales to pay a portion of the cost, because it was more economical for us to pay part instead of the whole cost, since the New South Wales rolls are practically the same as the Federal rolls. Those rolls have now been collected, and No ; the Minister most of them have been printed. But when I discovered the discrepancy which has been referred to, I at once arranged with the Premier of New South Wales and the Government Printer of that State to have all the rolls printed.

The honourable member's question brings me to a matter which has caused a great deal of difficulty. The Act says that in the final arrangement of the rolls, each roll must show the polling places at which the electors must vote. roll for each polling place. very inconvenient arrangement, because it will necessitate the printing of twenty or thirty very small rolls ; but it is my duty to conform to the provisions of the law. The rolls, -however, cannot be arranged in the manner I speak of until I know what the divisions will be, and what arrangement will be made in regard to polling places. Not only have I sent the rolls to every post-office in New South Wales, but I have asked the Postmaster-General to instruct his officials to pay particular attention to the matter, and to give every facility to persons who wish to inspect the rolls or to make application for enrolment where their names have been omitted. that done ? night ago. expect to be able to make up the new rolls I could not do which will include the names which have been sent in to the Chief Electoral Officer? Sir WILLIAM LYNE I hope, because of the active measures which have been taken, to be able to place the Commissionerfor New South Walesi n possession of all I hope with the names so sent in before he finally forwards his proposed divisions to the House, which will probably be done during the first week of next month, because the addition of a large number of new names to the roll* may have the effect of causing him to alter his divisions to some extent. All I can do, however, is to try to induce the public to take sufficient interest in the matter to get rid of the present discrepancies, and not allow themselves to be disfranchised. Honorable members who accuse the Department, and myself in particular, of not taking active measures to do what is necessary, have not understood what has been done. When the matter has been dealt with by the House, every opportunity will be giveu to persons whose names still do not appear on the rolls to be enrolled, because a revision court will be held after an interval of a month. I do not know what people want more than that.

The trouble which has been referred to as existing in Western Australia does not exist there. which I had received from a member of the Federal Parliament, who is now in Western Australia. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I know that that is so, but I may mention that I was told the other day at Menzies' hotel, where I stay, that no one had taken the names of the persons living there. When I made an inquiry on the subject, I found that my officers had collected every name. I have investigated three or four complaints of the same kind, and in each instance I found that the names had been collected. People often found statements upon surmises which 'are not true.

On the 30th June, 1887, when in receipt of a salary of £490 per annum, he was retired from this position owing to the abolition of the office consequent on the reorganization of the Department, and the introduction of the scheme of decentralization. Prior to this retirement, Mr that allowance only until the House deLewis (together with the Surveyor-General, the Deputy Surveyor-General, the Chief Draftsman, and many other senior officers similarly situated) was granted three months' leave of absence, and was paid by the Government the unpaid superannuation deductions, in consideration of meritorious service. On the day that the three months' leave should have commenced, the late Sir Henry Partes sent for Mr. Lewis and appointed him as Local Government Officer with electoral reform at an advanced salary of £000 per annum. More recently this position was continued by Sir George Dibbs, and, as Commissioner for the subdivision of the State of New South Wales into districts under the new (State) Act for electoral purposes, Mr Lewis was entirely responsible for the organization of the new system which came into operation in July, 1894..

If ever a Department deserved a rating, at the hands of a Minister, it is certainly that tween the electoral rolls for 1900 and 1902. The Minister admitted that he practically no such discrepancy. Too much can be accounted for by the floating population. I trust that the Minister for Home Affairs will not regard the motion which has been submitted as partaking in any way of the nature of a party attack. I hold that it is the duty of Parliament to puts its electoral machinery in the most healthy condition possible. Thati t is not in such a condition at present is evidenced by the fact that the names of 150,000 electors have been omitted from the Federal roll.

A t the same time it is positively shameful that this discrepancy shonld have beeu discovered only after tlie quota has been decided upon and the districts have been mapped. tention of taking part in this debate until the Minister for Home Affairs declared that he did not propose to make the same effort to discover the electors whose names do not appear on the Federal roll in Victoria that he intends to put forth in New South Wales. He bases his reason for making this distinction upon the expense which would be involved. ' It has been stated in the press that of the 35,000 electors who have not been enrolled in Victoria, 30,000 are resident in the country districts. It is very probable that that isa fact, becausein the drought-stricken districts of this State, whatever may be the positioninNewSouth Wales, regarding the distribution of the electors who have not been enrolled official returns. so far as Victoria is concerned, that the names of a large number of the dwellers in the northern areas do not appear on the rolls. A t the time that the rolls were collected they were absent from their homes. The whole of the small holders in the mallee district were compelled by the drought to leave their homes and go south, taking their stock with them. This is a most important matter, because 30,000 electors in the country represent not merely a quota, but the maximum for an electorate. still be upon the roll. has been entirely cut out of the plan of the Act. new districts, and if that has been done by reason of the residents being absent from sorry that many honourable members have their homes, and becoming enrolled elseseen fit to attack Mr Lewis so bitterly, where stock in the metropolitan areas, surely. member does not know as much about this in every possible way to facilitate the An extraordinary matter as I do. I am aware that the whole of the stock in the district which I have mentioned was removed to districts south of the Dividing Range. Assuming that I . have no desire to blame these people were enrolled outside of their own district, the effect must still be the loss of the electorate from which they came. The Wimmera electorate was reduced by 5,000 votes. Seeing that the temporary absence of these electors from their homes would .have that effect, I do not think that the Minister, because of the expense that would be involved, should stay his hand in endeavouring to find them. He says that such action will cost only £ 3 5 0 in New South Wales, whereas in Victoriai t would cost £3,500. Buj , even if it did cost that sum-assumin g that a country electorate has been wiped out of existence because of the abnormal 'conditions prevailing when the roll was being compiled-it is surely worth the expenditure to have it restored. When the Electoral Bill was under discussion, the matter to which I am now directing attention was very strongly argued by the representatives of country constituencies, and was eventually settled in a fair spirit. I hold that, as far as possible, the country districts should be given reasonable representation a larger representation than I was quoting from the that to which they are numerically entitled as compared with the city electorates. I am perfectly satisfied, That was conceded when Parliament fixed a margin of 20 per cent, either above or below the quota in connection with the representation of rural districts in this Parliament. If the country is not diligently searched for these electors, and if an electorate has been struck out, the whole advantage which Parliament proposed to confer upon those districts. has vanished. I hope, therefore, that the Minister will reconsider his attitude upon this matter.

My contention is that the State roll was taken as the basis for the mapping out of the new Federal electorates, whilst in the matter of the female roll, a circular was sent out by the State Government of New South Wales directing it to be collected according to the law of New South Wales, and not according to the Commonwealth law. That roll has been collected, and has not been revised. If the Minister had only taken the trouble to look into this matter some months ago, he would have seen that, comparing the State roll for 1900 with the new Federal roll for 1902, there was a deficiency-whe n there ought to have been a large increase of 15,000 electors in New South Wales. The deficiency is made greater when we take into account the increase there should be in the number of electors under the extended Federal franchise.

WhatI contend is that the Minister or the Department ought to have taken steps immediately after the Electoral Act was passed to have a proper roll compiled, a work which I do not suppose would in New South Wales have cost more than £1,000 if the police had been employed. I am referring now, of course, to the mere work of collecting the names. I understand that the police in the State of New South Wales last year collected the roll of female names at a cost of about £900. In my opinion, the names could have been collected, as in 1900, by the police, under the supervision of the State, the Government of which would have been only too glad to afford the necessary assistance. But the Minister has never obtained a Federal roll in New South Wales of either male or female voters, and the consequence is the large deficiency .of 70,000 names. No instructions were given to collect the names under the Federal law, and they were collected under the State law. I felt it my duty, in the interests of the public, to submit the motion, not for any party purposes, but in order that the matter might be fully ventilated. I am afraid, however, that the explanation of the Ministeri n regard to New South Wales will not be regarded as satisfactory.

146,Mr Deakin,"In the temporary abproceeding to say that now we have come to the consideration of this clause, we have reached the parting of the ways. It seems to methat if we adopt all that the framers of the Bill propose, those of us who think it highly desirable that there shall be a High Court, will run the risk of seeing our end frustrated; because an attempt is being made to establish a High Court which w ill , be greater than the Constitution requires, and more extensive than the people areprepared to accept. Honourable members discussed the clause last evening very much as if they were debating the second reading again, but I think there was no help for that, because the whole fate of the measure depends upon the decision which we come to in regard to the clause. If it is struck out the whole Bill will have to be re-cast. That being so, it is perform the equally important, if not more almost impossible for honourable members to confine their remarks within the limits of discussion allowed in Committee. The clause confers upontheHighCourt a wider original jurisdiction than is provided for in the' Constitution, but I understand, from the speeches which I have heard, that as time goes on it will not be found much wider and that the cost of the court will therefore not be limited to the £23,000 mentioned by the Attorney-General, or even to £30,000, but will run into very much higher figures. For that reason I shall oppose this and the succeeding clauses. While I oppose it for one reason, other honourable members will oppose it for other reasons, but each must defend his own reasons, and therefore I desire to occupy the time of the Committee -for a few minutes in explaining my position in regard to the clause, and generally towards the provisions of the Bill. It was my original opinion that it would probably be unnecessary to establish a High Court, but I was convinced of"" the necessity for its establishment after I heard the very able addresses of the Attorney General, the Prime Minister, and the honourable and learned member for Indi. It seems to me that the splendid train of reasoning followed by those three speakers who, I hope, will be the forerunners of a long line of statesmen who will protect the Constitution, and see its provisions carried into prior to federation, fewer than five Judges effect-shoul d convince everyone that the establishment of a High Court is absolutely necessary, as the crown of the Constitution, and to protect it , and the rights of States and individuals under it. Personally, I am fully convinced that a High Court of some kind must be established, and to my mind the fact that its establishment will cost money does not weaken the position of those who support it . If its establishment is necessary under the Constitution, we have not to consider ""the question of cost. The Commonwealth would have saved money if the framers of the Constitution had conferred upon the States Legislatures the right to nominate representatives to this and to the other Chamber, but, I am convinced that no one contemplated the saving of the £50,000 or £60,000 which we shall have to spend upon the Federal elections every few years by the adoption of such an arrangement. For the same reason we cannot question on the score of cost the establishmentof a High Court of some sort to important, work of interpreting the Constitution, and preserving the rights of States and individuals under it. There has been a great deal of clamour in regard to this measure outside, but when it is said that those of us who support the measure are indulging in extravagance, I , for one, reply that I am prepared to meet my constituents at any time to defend my action in supporting the proposal to establish this necessary body. Furthermore, I feel convinced that if the States had not federated, the time would shortly have come, and would probably have come as early as now, when they would have created a Court of Appeal for Australia. I recall several discussions upon tliat question, .notably in the old Federal Council at Hobart; and I have been informed by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, that a Bill was drafted in Victoria for the establishment of such an Appeal Court. Everything pointed to the fact that sooner or later some some sort of Appeal Court for Australia would be established, and the cost of such a court would not have been less than the cost of tlie High Court which I am prepared to see established under the Constitution. IintendtovoteforaCourtbf five Judges for reasons which I will give later on. I do not think that if an Appeal Court for the whole of Australia had been established would have been appointed. My idea, when the Bill was brought before Parliament last session, was that we might have in the first instance an interim arrangement, under which the Chief Justices of the Supreme Courts -of the States would perform the necessary duties for a time ; but, as I stated last night, that idea has been exploded, partly because of the period which has elapsed since the Bill was introduced-which makes it too late to think of anything but a permanent arrangement;-but chiefly because of tlie precise and definite wording of the Constitution, which does not contemplate in any line of it that Parliament should have power to adopt any temporary expedient in this matter. very definitely that Parliament shall create a High Court whose Judges shall be appointed for life, subject to their good behaviour. No provision is made for the creation of a temporary court. whatever Judges are appointed will be appointed for life, and there will be no getting rid of them except on the vote of both Houses, on the ground of misbehaviour or failing abilities. But apart from the effect of the Constitution, it seems to me that there would be no more wisdom in selecting the Chief Justices of the six States to form a Bench, than in selecting the six tallest or six shortest Justices in the States Courts. It is notorious, though I am not speaking of the present state of affairs, that in the history of the Judicial Bench of Australia, as well as elsewhere, the best men have not always been the Chief Justices. pends in tlie creation of the High Court upon the personnel of the gentlemen who are first appointed to occupy positions upon the Federal Bench-its confidence of the nation, and the gradual development of a Judiciary which in course of time will gain full power to finally determine every legal question which may arise in Australia, will be greatly influenced by the character of the first appointments. I regret tliat the power which was asked for in the draft Constitution confine appeals in certain cases to the High Court in its appellate jurisdiction, was not given in its entirety. with the views of those who have spoken highly of the Privy Council. The Privy Council, like many other institutions, is a time-honoured body, but it no longer meets the exigencies of the Empire, and much less the needs and necessities of Australia. is an accidental thing, and quite out of touch with our conditions. there are fifteen members of that court, and that its quorum is four, so that it may happen that four of its weakest men are called Mr O. B. Edwards.'' upon to decide cases of the greatest weight and moment. Where questions of commercial and ordinary law are in dispute, I think they can be settled by the Privy Council as well as by an Australian Court, but in purely Australian cases, and especially in constitutional cases, the members of thePrivy Council would be less fitted to deal with disputes than the best men we could select in Australia. If the Ministry appoint to the High Court as Judges men who are The Constitution lays it down selected for the excellence of their intellect and abilities, five will not be too many, and we shall have a court which, as time goes on, will get more and more appeal work under the provision of the Constitution Therefore, which gives this Parliament the right to limit appeals in certain cases to the Privy Council, and because it will command the increasing confidence of the nation. I cannot see any advantage in perpetuating the right of appeal to the Privy Council. In deed, in constitutional cases, there is. very grave danger in having to appeal to that body. Our Constitution should be interpreted by an Australian Court. In this way we -shall get definite decisions upon several doubtful points, and probably, as has been the case in the United States, the decisions of the court will in effect amend the Constitution to meet the Much depopular will in several particulars in regard to which it is not worth the trouble and expense of going through ""the forms of amendment provided for in the Constitufuture success, the tion. If we did not create the High Court, bnt took our interpretation of the Constitution from the States Courts, with the right of appeal to the Privy Council, we should run the greatest danger. That body has in many instances interpreted the Canadian Constitution, but I think it is notorious amongst legal men that the judgments given, Bill, to were almost invariably those of the late Lord Watson, who for twenty years made the provisions of thatConstitutionhisespecial study. I do not sympathize In giving these decisions he apparently had. the approval of every member of the Privy Council, simply because he above all the others, had made the subject his special study. I do not think we could depend upon anybody to take a similar interest in It our Constitution. Lord Watson probably performed very great service to Canada in I believe that devoting his time almost exclusively to the work of interpreting its Constitution. Owing to the fact that the Privy Council', has now on its records many decisions with regard to the Canadian Constitution, we should, in the event of our applying for an interpretation of our Constitution, run the risk of having certain decisions in Canadian cases read into our Constitution, which is not upon exactly the same lines as of that of Canada. Our Constitution is sui generis. follow Canadian lines, and differs from the United States and Swiss Constitutions. It is a Constitution of our own making, and consequently it ought to be interpreted by Judges of our own creation --by men who have grown up amongst us, and who are permeated with Australian ideas. I think we can find all the necessary Judges amongst ourselves. require to restrict our choice to Judges of the States Courts, or to men of eminence in public life, but if we choose the best men available in the Commonwealth wherever they may be, we shall create a Court which will grow more and more into the confidence of the people, and which will be able to safely direct us upon all matters affecting the interpretation of our Constitution and our laws. That is the ideal which I desire to work up to. It has been very eloquently and lucidly set forth by the supporters of tlie Bill, and I shall do all I can to realize , it. When we come to consider the Bill, we find that its framers, actuated by a desire to erect a strong Court of five Judges which would command respect, have gone further than is necessary in order to afford full reason for their appointment; I go the length of saying that if there were no work to be done by the Judges at present, we should still appoint them. A very old friend of mine used to pay £ 2 0 per annum to a doctor to attend upon his rather large family, but he did not require the services of tlie doctor from year's end to gear's end. He did not complain, because he regarded the absence of sickness as an excellent state of affairs. Similarly, if we have five Judges and they have nothing to do, we ought to congratulate ourselves upon that fact. So long, however, as we have no High Court, and no means of settling our own disputes, we may expect an increase of litigation. If five Judges are appointed, with the limited duties to which I would confine them, they will not cost the Commonwealth, more than about £20,000 per annum. Unfortunately, they will cost us that sum as soon as we create the Court, but I do not think that the outlay will be 4c any greater in. twenty years hence, when they will have much more work to do, and will be much more necessary for the protection of our growing interests. I am satisfied that such a Court is required, and that we cannot do with less than five Judges. If we appoint only throe Judges, we It does not may save £5,000 or £6,000 per annum, but we shall have an emasculated Court that will not command the same respect as a Bench of five Judges. We should frequently be compelled to accept the decision of two Judges out of three, and we could not feel satisfied with such a Court having the final word upon important subjects. In the United States they started We do not their Supreme Court with six Judges, and that Court had not the same extensive functions that we propose to confer upon our High Court. Their duties were confined to the interpretation of the Constitution and to cases arising under the Constitution or between States or parties in different States. When that Court was appointed the United States were not in as good a position as is Australia to-day. Their population in the last decade of the 1.8th century was about 1,00.0,000 less than ours at the present time. They had no large cities like Melbourne, Sydney, or Brisbane, because Philadelphia, the largest centre in those days, had a population of only 42,520, ' New York came next with a population of 33,131, and there was no other city in the Union at the time the Federation was started that had a population of more than 20,000. They had a number of small towns scattered throughout the Union. The famous Boston, their intellectual centre, had only 13,000; Charleston had a population of a little more, and Baltimore only 14,503. While the United States had far less population than we have, the extent of her trade and commerce was relatively still smaller than ours ; because, as the world progresses, all communities have relatively more trade and commerce than was the case with similar populations in days gone by. The American Union, knowing f u l l well the necessity for the Supreme Court, appointed six Judges, although, as I have stated, the functions of the Court were limited -to the decision of Constitutional questions. I do not know why they appointed six J udges, because it seems to rae that it is desirable to have an odd number, and therefore I favour the appointment of five Judges. When I am asked what these Judges are to do, I do not think it is necessary to do more than point to the Constitution. Where is the necessity for creating work by granting extended original jurisdiction? Isi t not plainly apparent that it has been feared by the framers of the Bill that there would not be sufficient work for five Judges, unless some extra jurisdiction were given to them? I think it is singularly unfortunate that this view was taken. All true lovers of the Constitution, with a patriotic desire to see the Federation progress, would have willingly supported the appointment of five Judges, if for no other purpose than that set forth under the Constitution, and I regret that ! the Bill has been hampered by other provisions which, to my mind, rather mar its .effect. I intend to vote for the strikng out of the clause now under discus.siori, but I shall support the appointment of five Judges. There is another reason why we should have five Judges. If only three Judges are appointed to constitute the High Court at the commencement of its career, the inevitable increase in the work of the Court in the near future will soon necessitate an increase in the number of its members. But in the mean time serious constitutional questions may have come before the Supreme Courts of tine States for their decision, or may have been warmly discussed in the Federal Parliament and in the-press of the Commonwealth, and the selection of the additional Judges for the High Court will inevitably be influenced by their known or suspected opinions on the questions under discussion in the political arena, or in the Supreme Courts of the States. An illustration of such an influence in the selection of additional Judges is found in the history of the United States of America, in ' connection with the long controversy upon the question of the power of Congress to issue paper money. In consequence of the quarrel between Congress and President Johnson, an Act was passed by Congress to prevent the President filling up any vacancies that might occur on the Bench of the Supreme Court until the number of the Judges fell below seven. Towards the close of the President's term of office the number of the Judges of the Supreme Court had become reduced from ten to seven, and at the time at which the Court consisted of only seven Judges the question of the power of Congress to issue paper money came before the Court for Mr G. B. Edmardt. decision in the case of Hepbv/rn v. Grimcold. The Court, by a bare majority of four J udges against three, decided that the issue of paper money by Congress was illegal. Shortly afterwards General Grant was elected President, and the Act of Congress, which prohibited the appointment of additional Judges, was repealed. The new President immediately appointed two new Judges, who were known, or believed to be, of the opinion that Congress had the power to issue paper money. One of them, Mr. Justice Strong, had previously delivered a judgment in the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in support of .the legality of such money; and two years after the two new Judges were appointed, the same question came again before the Supreme Court of the United Statesi n the cases known as "" The Legal Tender Cases,"" and judgment was given in favour of the legality of the paper money issued by Congress, by a majority of five Judges out of the total number of nine which then constituted the Court. These historical events clearly demonstrate the desirability of appointing a sufficient number of Judges of the High Court of Australia at the commencement of its career, in order, to prevent a prospective increase of r work being converted into an excuse for increasing the number of Judges for political purposes at a subsequent time. If we start with five Judges we shall probably find them sufficient for a very long time. If the only argument against the appointment of that number is based upon the expense involved, I would rather face the consequences in tliat direction at once than risk the necessity of strengthening the Bench later on under conditions such as I have indicated. I feel that I must support the Bill, but as some of its provisions are unnecessarily wide, I shall endeavour, to modify them. I am satisfied that if we agree to this clause we shall confer on the High Court a wider original jurisdiction than it is necessary to clothe it with, that five Judges will not be sufficient to transact its business, and that the estimated expenditure of £30,000 per annum will prove utterly inadequate. If we invest this tribunal with original jurisdicbionj in connection with matrimonial and bankruptcy matters, fifteen Judges would not be able to do the work. Buti f we confine the functions of the Court to appellate jurisdiction, the interpretation of the Constitution, and the primary jurisdiction conferred under the Constitution, . satisfactorily enough in the absence of this I think tliat the expense of its maintenance tribunal, and the public have not exhibited will be about £20,000 a year.

147,Mr Brown (Canobolas),"As this parent, I shall be quite prepared to sancdeal with all Federal matters, we shall effect great savings. If afterwards our experience shows that there is sufficient work to warrant the creation of a High Court as a court of appeal, we can enact the necessary legislation, thus providing for our needs as the} arise. We must always remember 7 that the cost of the Federal, as well as the State administration, is borne by the one people. I have in my hand a return prepared by Senator Zeal which shows the amount of money that is annually expended by the various States upon their judiciaries. From this document I find that the salaries of the Judges throughout the Commonwealth total £ 6 6 , 9 0 0; the expenses in connection with them, £35,989. The District CourtJ udges draw £22,000; the law officers, £118,431 ; the sheriffs, £51,062 ; the Mastersi n Equity, £ 1 6 , 3 4 2; the Stipendiary Magistrates, £ 6 3 , 9 2 0 ; whilst the pettysessions cost £128,024; miscellaneous expenditure is responsible for £68,638 ; making a total of £571,306. That amount does not include tlie cost of providing police protection, but ""simply covers the courts of justice and the paraphernalia immediately connected therewith. That total is disdistributed over the States 'as follows :New South Wales, £255,994: Victoria, £135,701 ; Queensland, £75,906 ; South Australia, £ 2 7 , 8 4 0; Western Australia, £ 5 7 , 1 4 2; and Tasmania, £18,723. Senator Zeal compares this expenditure with that which takes place in the sister Commonwealth of Canada. He says chat, compared with Canada, the extravagance of this Commonwealth is remarkable. In the Dominion the annual cost of the judiciary and police combined is £474,221, or £97,0S5 less than the cost of the judiciary of the Commonwealth. does not include the cost of the police. Canada the maintenance of the police is included in the sum I have mentioned. I am informed that the judiciary of Canada amply supplies oil wants ; and, if that be so, we ought to be satisfied with more reasonable proposals than those submitted by the Government. The States have incurred great expense in establishing the present judiciary, and the machinery at our disposal ought to be utilized as far as possible ; certainly we should not duplicate the tribunals in the way proposed by the Bill. There are many other directions in which nioney can be usefully expended on good government for tlie benefit of the Commonwealth ; and all that is necessary a t present is to clothe the States Courts with thenecessary Federal jurisdiction. If there isneed for a High Court of Appeal Jet such a. Court be established, but, in our present circumstances, there is no necessity for a duplication of jurisdiction. It has been urged that the proposal of the Government will cheapen law within the Commonwealth; but in my opinion the man who can solvethe problem of how to lessen the cost of litigation in this community will be a genius.. I am glad to say that I have had nopersonal experience of law courts ; but from what I can see he is a wise man who keeps out of litigation. In nine cases out of ten the parties on both sides are the losers, the only persons who seem to reap a rich harvest being the legal gentlemen employed;. and that experience will, I am afraid, berepeated in the Federal High Court. It must be remembered that a Federal tribunal sitting in Sjfdney, Melbourne, or Adelaide will only constitute a-part of the High Court, and the probabilities are that in many cases the decisions will form the subject, of appeal to what will be known as the Full Court. The honourable member for Tasmania, Mr O'Malley, claims to have had special experience of the High Courti n another Commonwealth, but the conditions, there are very dissimilar to our own ; at any rate, I do not think we shall see such a free use of the revolver as the honorable member seemed to indicate in the High Court of which he spoke. If it were possible under the Constitution to establish a purely Australian High Court, in the sensein which the word ""Australian"" is ordinarily used, there might be some reason for agreeing to a proposal in that direction;. but the decisions of the proposed Court, with the exception of those relating to the interpretation of the Constitution, and cases originating in the States Courtswith Federal jurisdiction, may be taken to the Privy Council While our needs are not very pressing, I do not think weneed fear following the example of Canada so far as questions affecting the interpretation of the Constitution are concerned ; and I shall endeavour to give Federal jurisdiction to the States Courts, with the High Court as a court of appeal. I do not seeany need for the original jurisdiction",41,Judiciary Bill
148,Mr Conkov,The cost of our judiciary,42,Judiciary Bill
149,Mr Brown,"-That is so, whereas inJudiciary proposed to be given to the High Court, nor am. I of opinion that so large a number of Judges as proposed ought to be appointed. We ought to start with the lesser number, and when the need becomes evident appoint more Judges. I strongly protest -against what appears to be the policy of the Government in establishing an ornamental judiciary, an Inter state Commission, and other expensive bodies. If these bodies be established, and an appeal is .made for legislation in other directions of more vital importance to the community, such as the establishment of Courts of Arbitration and Conciliation, the reply will be made that our resources have been exhausted; and, therefore, I shall support the amendment which I understand has been moved to eliminate from the Bill the clauses which give original jurisdiction to the High Court. have been very pleased to find, during the -course of this debate, that we have in this Chamber a number of lawyers, who, although they would derive personal advantage from the setting up of the High Court proposed by the Government, are patriotic enough to remember the interests of the general pu blic, -and therefore hesitate about committing the -country to the large expenditure which the proposal would entail. It is a very difficult thing for any of us to say what the cost of the proposed High Court would be, but in a matter of this kind we must i*ely greatly upon the opinions expressed by the legal members of the Committee, and after listening to the very able speeches delivered by members of the legal profession, I have -come to the conclusion that the proposal should not be adopted. Of course, we are -all of opinion that the public should be given the right to proceed, if they think fit, against the Federal Government. I know that difficulties have arisen in the past, and I was one of those who complained -of the delay on the part of the Government in not providing for some court-no t an -expensive court such as is now proposedwhich would be given jurisdiction to hear -cases brought against the Federation. When, towards the close of last session, the Attor'not require it to be given. The Governney-General submitted a short Bill to enable the public to bring suits against the Federation, an attempt was made to amend it so -as to extend the jurisdiction, and I believe that if that amendment had been carried it would have been to the advantage of all [18 JOSE, 1903.] BUI. 1133 I concerned, though it might have been inconvenient for the Government. But while, as I have said, difficulties have arisen, f think that they could be met for the present by extending the jurisdiction of the States Courts pending the establishment of a High Court. Those of us who voted against the Bill did so, not because we are opposed to the establishment of a High Court as a court of appeal, with the original jurisdiction provided for in the Constitution, but because we object to the expenditure which a High Court, established on the lines proposed, would entail. the honourable member voted against the principle contained in it . The question of expense is a matter to be dealt with in Committee. great difference between a court such as many of us would like to see established and that proposed by the Government. My honourable friend will have an opportunity of justifying his vote before the country, but' no one ever thought that the Government would propose to establish such a court as is provided for in the Bill. What does the proposal of the Government mean ? They propose to go much further than the Constitution contemplates. The Constitution provides for an appeal to the High Court in certain cases, and for a certain limited original jurisdiction, but it does not take away the right of. appeal to the Privy Council, which some people think would often be better than an appeal to the High Court, because the Privy Council is far removed from all local jealousies. That view is taken by many prominentlawyers. ButtheGovernment propose to go much further than is -contemplated by the Constitution, and to place under the jurisdiction of the High Court many matters which.are not specifically referred to it . MrL . E. GROOM -The Government can give to the High Court only the jurisdiction provided for by the Constitution. that the Constitution allows this jurisdiction to be given, to the High Court; but it does ment propose to go beyond what is contemplated by the Constitution, and they provide for the establishment of a Court with such a wide jurisdiction that it would practically be necessary to set up a number of Courts in each of the States, although a",42,Judiciary Bill

153,Mr Sydn Ey Smith,"I am awaremuch less expensive arrangement could be made to meet the needs of the public. I am very strongly opposed to the Government proposal, because of the expense which it will involve, and because I know how necessary it is that we should be careful not to increase the burdens of the people more than we can help. If the clause is not struck out, instead of five Judges being' able to do the work which will be required of the Court, at least fifteen Judges will be necessary. I have risen to enter my protest against this attempt on the part of the Government to increase the expenditure of the Commonwealth. I feel sure that they are asking us to embark upon an undertaking which .will involve us in an expense which they themselves do not anticipate, whereas a simple and inexpensive court might be created which would meet all the requirements of litigants, and would safeguard the interests of the Commonwealth, the States, and the people. with some interest to the discussion upon this important proposal. I did not intend to join in the debate, because to my mind the question is one upon which legal minds should best advise us, but, having listened to the speeches which have been delivered by the legal members of the Committee, I find . them so contradictory-as lawyers often are-that I feel in great danger of being led astray altogether. I have, therefore, endeavoured to sift tlie arguments on both sides, and I find that, while some are afraid that the proposed High Court will have so much work that three times the number of Judges proposed will be unable to cope with it, others oppose the Bill, because they believe that the Court will not have any work to do. It will he a good thing for .Australia when the Courts have no work. I believe that'instead of our having Tooley-street, think they can run theto increase the number of Judges^dn the country. Even some of the opponents of future, tlie. work of the Courts will decreasey the measure admit that only a year or because .thefpeople will trouble the lawyers two can elapse before we shall haveless and less as they become more intellito create the High Court, which, acgent. So far as I can understand, it is genecording to the Constitution, we should rally admitted by honourable members on bring into existence without delay. both sides that the Constitution demands believe that the Government proposals are the establishment of theHigh Court,but they being opposed by an interested press, becausesay that the present time is not opportune. the Federal Parliament has shown itself too Pursuing their line of argument still democratic for some people who do not likefurther, we .find that the whole question the work which it has done, and who, thereresolves itself into one of saving a few fore, would like to prevent it from passingpounds. It is hinted that public opinion further legislation. The opposition which generally is in accord with .that 'opinion which seems to be manufactured in the city of Melbourne. Some one has said that public opinion is opposed to an increase in the expenditure of the Commonwealth, and the poor unfortunate taxpayer has been dragged into the matter in much the same way that the poor widow used to be pathetically presented to us during the Tariff debate. Honourable members know perfectly well that the taxpayer will not benefit to the extent of one farthing if we refrain from establishing the High Court, and that, on the other hand, he will not pay one farthing more if we carry out the Government proposal. There are considerations of much more importance than those connected with expense. I have listened carefully in order to ascertain how long honourable and learned members consider it necessary for us to wait before establishing the High Court, and I gather that most of them hold the view that we should not be able to get along without it for any great length of time. I cannot help thinking that the mixing up of the time limit with the question of spending a few pounds and the so-called expressions of public opinion will lead to a confusion of ideas. The half-dozen men who have been expressing their views before public meetings in Melbourne, in such a way as to exhibit their utter ignorance, do not represent public opinion, nor do thoseirresponsible persons who write letters to the newspapers occupy any representative position. If these gentlemen who make so much of tlie cry for economy desire to represent the real trend of public opinion, why do they not quote the resolutions of the Political Labour Council or of the Trades and Labour Council*-bodie s which represent perhaps 60,000 or 70,000 electors 1 They should not quote the ideas of a few . menwho,""'like the three tailors of . . p» I",43,Judiciary Bill
154,Mr Spence (Darling),"I have I istenedhas come from this quarter has made me feel the more satisfied to cast my vote in favour of the measure. I do not regard a few men in Melbourne, or the editor of a newspaper, who writes articles to order, as representing public opinion. There are principles more important than money, and there are some things which money cannot buy, and I shall vote for the establishment of the High Court because I fear that something disastrous to the future of the Commonwealth may happen if we leave the interpretation of our Constitution to those ' who cannot know much about our aspirations, conditions, ideas, or sentiments. I am not prepared to run the risk of submitting the interpretation of our Constitution to the Privy Council, which may lay down a precedent binding upon us for all time. It appears very much as if some honourable members were willing to sacrifice the interests of the people of the Commonwealth for the sake of a few thousands of pounds. matter of this kind, those who object to give effect to the clearly expressed wish of the people, because of the small expense that may be involved, are taking the very lowest possible ground. The people of Victoria who are now clamouring against the carrying out of the provisions of the Constitution, were those who were the most anxious to have federation accomplished. Some of us in New South ""Wales voted against the Constitution, but now that it has been adopted we are prepared to throw our weight in with the majority in order to see that its provisions are faithfully fulfilled. If the people of Victoria voted in ignorance of the cost of federation, they will now learn a lesson which should prove of use to them in the future. Have those honourable members who are objecting to the establishment of the High Court on the ground of expense considered that if we throw the whole of the Federal work upon the States Courts we shall be expected to pay for it ? Is there not a strong tendency on the part of the States Governments to require the Federal authorities to 1 pay for services rendered by their officials to the Commonwealth ! If they adopt a 1 similar attitude.with regard to the Courts, where will be the saving? We should not for the sake of a few pounds abstain from carrying out the expressed will of the people as embodied in the Constitution approved by them. We know very well [ that there are a number of cases awaiting the decision of the High Court, and there is every prospect of many others of great importance arising in the near future. We shall be called upon to consider a proposal for the establishment of an Arbitration Court, and if that tribunal is created, we shall very probably have to call upon the High Court to define its jurisdiction. It may not suit the purposes of the Employers Federation to have the High Court and the Arbitration Court established, but it will suit the people who desire to see more peaceable methods adopted for settlingtrade disputes. Although we have had a great deal of 'assistance. from the States, I do not think our experience enables us to say that we can get along very well without having our own departments under direct Federal control, and this applies with as much force to the Judiciary as to any other Department. I shall support the Government proposal for the appointment of the In considering a five Judges, and I am also in favour of conferring upon them original jurisdiction. I hope honourable members will very earnestly consider the serious effects that may follow any postponement of the appointment of the High Court. It is true that the Constitution adopted by the people provided for the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council, but because we have not been able to secure all we want there is no reason why we should not obtain all we can. I think we should establish a High Court, if only for the purpose of interpreting our Constitution. not intend to prolong the agony by indulging in a second reading speech under cover of this clause. Upon the motion for the second reading of the Bill, after a fair fight, we have been handsomely beaten, aud we have taken our gruel like men. I strongly object, however, to taking another dose of gruel, and that is the position which 1 occupy at present. Oliver Wendell Holmes says it is a special virtue in a sporting man when he is in luck to crow gently, and when he is beaten to own up, pay up, and shut up. Fortunately, we have another chance upon the present occasion. The Government have successfully "" bullocked "" through the second reading of the Bill, and now find themselves in an ""angel"" of a fix to provide work for the J udges. .What is the expedient which they propose to adopt in this connection It is nothing more or less than an attempt to",44,Judiciary Bill
155,Mr A. Patebson (Capricornia),"I dodivert the legal business of the country from its natural channels to the High Court. They wish to dam back the current of litigation until it rises to the altitude of the High Court. I think that the honourable aud learned member for Northern Melbourne showed very clearly the absurdity of passing the doors of the States Courts in order to take litigation to the higher Court. I am thoroughly of his opinion that it is a stupid thing to do. I cannot see any object in adopting that expedient, unless it be to provide new billets and new officials under the Government. If the Government intend to force litigants into the High Court, why do they not go a step further and issue coupons to all suitors before that tribunal.entitling them to a pound of tea weekly, for the term of their natural lives. The proposal is utterly ridiculous. Merchants and business people do not usually adopt such practices, nor do large corporations. Can honourable members imagine the Harbor Trust saying to the people that they have found the Straight cut to Port Philip which has been made at an enormous expense is of very little use to them and that they proposed to construct a new canal by way of Bacchus Marsh or Warrenheip to the Bav. Such a proposal would resemble the methods of the Government in connection with this Bill. It is altogether beyond a joke. As tlie Government carried the second reading of the Bill simply upon the contention that the establishment of the High Court was mandatory under the Constitutiona contention with which I thoroughly agreed1 do not think that we ought to give them oue ounce more than the Constitution directs. What does the Constitution say 1 Section 75 refers to five matters upon which the High Court is to have original jurisdiction. It saysThe High Court shall have original jurisdicthe opposition to this clause having' been tion, &c. That is mandatory. But in section 76 the words used areThe Parliament may make laws, He. Those words are optional. The same remark is applicable to sections 77 and 7S. these provisions show that it was the intention of the framers of the Constitution to confer original jurisdiction upon the High Court in the five matters mentioned in section 75, but in no others. absurd to talk of investing the High Court Mr Paterson. with further power before it has even been constituted. Honourable members will recollect a scene in the ""Merchant of Venice,"" in which Portia saysThen take thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh ; But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate Unto the State of A enice. T That is exactly the position which I assume in regard to this matter. 1 would concede to the Government all that is mandatory under the Constitution, but not a pennyweight more. mean to insinuate, that the Government are Shylocks1 the highest respect for Jews. I think they are the noblest race God ever made. Honourable members have, recently heard a good deal about that mysterious modern disease which has troubled all the world, called appendicitis. It cannot be cured by medicine. It can be removed only by the knife-by cutting the appendix off. I regard this clause as the appendix of the Bill, and will not be satisfied until it is removed. Under this provision we have to find some work for the Judges. We cannot pay them high salaries for doing nothing, and as a way out of the difficulty I would recommend that we form the High Court into a Court of Arches. A Court of Arches is used for the purpose of debating spiritual causes. It may be said that we have no established church, and that no ecclesiastical disputes will arise, but I am sure that the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister are ingenious enough to find something to connect cases under, say, Customs administration with spiritual causes. Some mention has been made of prompted by party motives. I am quite sure that the Attorney-General will acquit me of being influenced in this matter by any such motives. My vote upon the measure will be cast in the direcAll tion which I conceive to be best iu the public interest, and no blandishments will affect me. I simply desire to see justice done.

173,Mr Conroy (Werriwa),"I do notdone, it must be paid for. tinue to be done by the States Courts. Buti f jurisdiction in Federal matters is not given to the inferior States Courts, we shall have to appoint inferior . Federal Courts to bring justice within reach of the people. One of the reasons for Judges going on circuit, is to make the Courts accessible to the people, although the arrangement is a very expensive one. The honourable and learned member for Bendigo has shown that in Victoriai t costs £11,000 a year for one Judge alone. But if the Court sat only in Melbourne, the expense of bringing witnesses here from other parts of the State would be so great that litigants could not afford to bring their cases before it . What we object to is this : The Ministry, seeing that the work of a Federal Appeal Court could not be much, have given to that Court a wide originaljurisdiction, and to satisfactorily exercise that jurisdiction a great many mere J udges would be required than the number provided for. Of course, if the Constitution is mandatory on the point, we must obey it ; but I say that it is not. judicial powers of tbe Commonwealth shall be vested in a Federal Supreme Court, to be called the High Court of Australia, but if the framers of the Constitution-man y of whom were lawyers-ha d wished to make the provision mandatory, they would have said "" A Federal Supreme Court, to be called the High Court of Australia, shall be created, and the judicial power shall be vested in it . "" All that the Constitution says is that when the. Federal Court is created the judicial power of the Commonwealth shall he vested in it. If we create only an appellate court, we shall avoid the necessity of doubling our legal machinery, and thus of creating unnecessary expense. If the clause stands, no one can say where the expense will end. We propose to strictly Limit the jurisdiction of the High Court in the first instance. Then after two or three years, Parliament can, if it thinks the experience which has been coerce, but merely to throw the door of the gained warrants it in doing so, extend the jurisdiction of the Court, and appoint additional Judges.

That is the whole substance of the clause. ing with clause 40. We must consider that clause on its merits. a whole.. no relation to this clause, although this clause, if it is passed, will have relation to clause 40. Obviously the C o r a m it t e e is against me in this matter, and the honourable member for New England was correct in stating that, by moving the omission of paragraph (o), I have prevented the consideration of the most important paragraph in the clause, though not that under which the greatest amount of business would arise. Section 71 provides that the If the High Court is entitled to exercise original -jurisdiction of any kind, it is entitled to deal as a court of first instance with cases arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation. A strong argument can be presented in favour of the retention of each of these'paragraphs, and undoubtedly the strongest argument can be advanced in favour of the retention of that to which I refer, and I think that a number of those who are opposed to the clause will, on further consideration, see reasons for reinstating it . .

We have no right to insert any such limitation in this -clause. honourable and learned member for South Australia is one of interest. author of this particular -clause, I am impressed with any reading which he may have .to offer, but to me its words seem to impose only one restriction upon this Parliamenta restriction against the insertion of -any restriction. We do not impose any restriction, but we find that one has been imposed under an Order in Council. That restriction is that the amount involved must not be less than £500. We do not propose to increase that restriction but to decrease it . As I understand the Constitution, we cannot increase the restriction imposed so as to make it more difficult to appeal from the Supreme Court of a State to the High Court than it was, at the time of the passing of this Bill, to appeal from the Supreme Court of a State to the Queen in Council. As long as we remove restrictions, instead of imposing them, it seems to me that we are acting within the powers conferred by section 73 of the Constitution. I understand that clause 35 which has been passed relates merely to appeals from Justices of the. High Court, and from the Supreme Courts as courts of first instance. But I apprehend that the clause under discussion is meant to apply to appeals in matters of Federal jurisdiction or otherwise? clause is to define the limitations of the power of appeal -whether in Federal -matters or not-fro m the decision of the Supreme Court of a State. May I therefore ask the Attorney-General if he has considered whether this provision confers upon the 'High Court-as ib oughta clear right to hear appeals from the Full Court of a State? It declaresThe appellate jurisdiction of the High Court with respect to judgments of the Supreme Court of a State, or of any other court of a State, from which, at the establishment of the Commonwealth, an appeal lay to the Queen in Council, W h y not? shall extend, &c. It was certainly the intention .of the framers of the Constitution to give the High Court the right to hear ordinary appeals from the Full Court. In our ordinary practice a Judge of the Supreme Court first decides any case which comes before him. Then if a litigant is dissatisfied he appeals to the Full Court. If defeated there, he can, at present, appeal to the Privy Council. The intention of the As the framers of the Constitution was to give the High Court the right to deal with those cases which would otherwise have gone to the Privy Council. I apprehend that the Attorney-General has no idea of robbing the Full Court of its right to deal with appeals in the first instance ; and I merely wish him to consider whether .under this clause he has secured to the High Court a right to deal with appeals from tlie Full Courts. The Supreme Court of a State has been taken to mean only one Judge. of the Constitution the Judiciary Committee intended to cover, by the general words which are there used, an appeal not merely from a Judgei n the first instance, but from the Full Court. I agree that technically the Supreme Court is the Full Court. point which has been raised by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne . is a very important one, but it is not within our power to take away from the Supreme Courts, however they may be constituted, the right of appeal to the High Court. Amongst the. appellate powers conferred upon the High Court by sub-section (2) of section 73 of the Constitution is the power to hear appeals from the Supreme Court of any State. It does not matter whether the Court is composed of one Judge only, or two or three Judges: it is the judgment of the Supreme Court. There may be internal arrangements, according to the State laws, as to how the Supreme Court jurisdiction shall be exercised. If a litigant obtains a judgment from the Supreme Court of a State irrespective of whether that tribunal consists of one Judge or six Judges, it seems to me that such judgment clearly come3 within the scope of section 73 of the",52,Judiciary Bill

Nothing we. can do can derogate from that. ness, I-think that when we speak of appeals from the Supreme Court we ought to say "" Full Court."" port to give any appellate jurisdiction. It assumes that appellate jurisdiction is conferred by the Constitution. It then proceeds to exercise restrictive powers, and to say that the appellate jurisdiction of the High Court with respect to the judgments of the Supreme Courts-plainl y referring, it seems to me, to the jurisdiction already existing under the Constitutionshall extend to certain judgments and to no other. That is an exercise, not of enabling powers, but of the restrictive powers conferred by the Constitution. Therefore, it seems to me that the words "" Supreme Court of a State"" must be interpreted to mean what they undoubtedly mean in section 73 of the Constitution. the Attorney-General if this provision does not infringe the provisions of section 73 of the Constitution ? power of appeal from the Supreme Courts of the States to the High Court. to which I should like to call the attention of the Attorney-General. It is contained in sub-clause («), and it may require considering from the aspect indicated by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn. The concluding lines of sub-clause (a) are. . . hut so that an appeal shall not be brought in the case of an interlocutory judgment Courts as may be created. except by leave of tbe High Court. That may mean that, even although the Supreme Court of a State granted leave to appeal upon an interlocutory judgment, it would not He. There is a provision in the Order in Council, which existed at the time of the establishment of the Commonwealth, by which the Supreme Court may grant leave to appeal from an interlocutory judgment, and I am afraid that these words might be read as taking that power away. in the lightof the illustration just given, that we may possibly have transgressed here, and I shall reconsider the matter.

The principle of the drafting of this Bill may be very good, but it is very puzzling, because we confer powers', and then proceed to limit and cross-limit them. We must watch a clause like this, because it is very general, and unless one understands the subsequent limitation, we arepuzzled to know to what extent powers are conferred. This clause confers all the powers, original and appellate, onall the Federal Courts; but there is only one court under the Bill, namely, the High Court, though others may be created subsequently. tory of the Constitution. put in, seeing there is only one Court in the Bill, the High Court? may be created by Act of Parliament. declares is that judicial power shall be vested in the Federal Supreme Court.

MrM c C AY (Corinella) -It seems to me that a High Court, when constituted, can exercise original jurisdiction without any declaration in this Bill. If this Bill, as clear, and if it is merely wished to give an Act, comes before a court, especially before the High Court, for interpretation, the Judge, in the absence of the words ""be it declared,"" or any sign of its being declaris already in the Constitution, and will be atory, will ask what is the meaning of tlie words. Judges, as we know, try to give a meaning to everything in an Act, but even they fail sometimes. Clause 31 is at present out of the Bill, and if the Bill be finally passed without it , the Judge may say"" Here is a clause not vesting jurisdiction, but declaring that the Court should exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth, which includes the optional original jurisdiction under section 76."" This clause would have been in entire harmony with clause 31. the words in the clause. words may be interpreted as having the meaning of clause 31. irrelevant words, provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in the High Court and in such other courts as are invested with Federal jurisdiction. Section 75 of the Constitution provides that in certain matters the High Court shall have original jurisdiction, while section 76 says that Parliament may make laws conferring original jurisdiction on the High Court. It is even possible to interpret clause 39 as a declaration that Parliament 4D is conferring original jurisdiction which must be exercised by some body, namely, the Federal Court, created in pursuance of the Constitution. I do not say that we, who know what is intended, would interpret the clause in that way, but there is no knowing how it may be interpreted by those whom the Attorney-General knows from frequent experience take no notice of what is said in debates when they are construing an Act. A t tlie best, the clause is a purely declaratory statement which has no validity, and at the worse, it is' an enacting clause which may produce results we little anticipate at the present moment. As prudent men, it is not desirable for us to leave dubious words in the Bill under such circumstances agree with the arguments advanced by the honourable and learned member for Corinella. Section 71 of the Constitution is the powers therein contemplated, we should use the words of the section. But there is no necessity to do so, because the provision observed. There is no doubt that this clause might raise very serious debate as to whether the powers conferred on the courts in sections 75 and 76, not only as to original jurisdiction, but as to additional original jurisdiction, would not be vested in the CourtI f the clause is merely, in conformity with section 71 .of the Constitution, there is no necessity for it ; on the other hand, it may open up a wide door of doubt-so wide that, considering we have already secured the exclusion of clause 31, it should not be allowed to remain. If the clause be removed, no dispute can arise, and if it includes what is contemplated in sections 75 and 76 of the Constitution, or there is any likelihood of its doing so, it ought not to remain. I do not think we ought to strike out the clause until the Attorney-General has had time to consider it with reference to the striking, out of clause 31. It may be that there are reasons which we do not know at present for the retention of this clause. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Werriwa that the clause .is either unnecessary or dangerous, but at the same time.

Technically, I think there is no objection to there being, as to the matters referred to in section 75 of the Constitution, concurrent jurisdiction in the States Supreme Courts and the High Court; It is a mere question of expediency. I intend my amendment to have the effect of allowing litigants to have access by way of original jurisdiction to the court that is nearest to them in point of place or in point of time -whicheve r they think will give them the speediest redress. four, or five years ago as chairman of a Royal Commission for the reform of legal procedure. reformed. If I did not succeed in other matters, I succeeded in learning a l o t ; and one thing I learned was that there is nothing more important than to secure, to people who are aggrieved quick remedies near at hand. It is with that view that I suggest that original jurisdiction should be given to the States Supreme Courts, even though ultfc mately perhaps the case would have to come before the High Court in one form or another if there be an appeal. Suppose, for instance, a case arising under the bankruptcy laws which we are to make, or a commercial case concerning an ordinary bill of exchange, or a case as to the custody of an infant where there is nothing more than family relations involved. Courts jurisdiction'( should go as far as t h a t; but I want if I can to prevent mixing up two issues at the same time. The present B ill reserves to the High Court jurisdiction in matters affected by section 75 of the Constitution. The High Court will consist of five Judges at most. The States Supreme Courts have 27 Judges. The States Judges, being more numerous, will be more accessible to people than the High Court will be for original purposes. There will be more of them to do the work ; they are confined to a limited area; and therefore they wrll be able to deal more readily with applications that are made. It is in that view that I ask the Attorney General to consider whether it is not well to confer as wide jurisdiction as possible upon the Supreme Courts of the States. able and learned member mentions-bank ruptcy cases, and so on-ther e is nothing to prevent those being considered by the States Courts. provides in clause 41, with great limitations, power for the States Courts to consider those matters which I have mentioned -suc h matters as bankruptcy cases and bills of exchange cases. Buti n order to make the scheme dovetail, I have to refer to the whole subject covered by the amendment. I I had some experience shall, of course, afterwards ask the AttorneyGenerai to consider matters under clause 41. I think he might simplify clauses 40 and 41, which are hard to follow, by giving the Which has not been States Supreme Courts original jurisdiction in the matters which now appear in clause It has in some respects. 31, and also in those matters which are referred to as exclusive in clause 40. see any objection.

Looking at the present condition' of things throughout Australia, the courts being fairly well administered, I cannot see any harm in allowing the Supreme Courts of the States to entertain a suit against the Commonwealth or by the Commonwealth. mits itself to be sued except in its own I rather think that I courts, and the Commonwealth is asked to submit to courts which are not its own. tion rather technical ?

If the Attorney-General is so wedded to a theory that he is to close his eyes to the existence of the States, and the State Attorney-General is to close his eyes to the existence of the Federation, I have nothing to say. I am quite sure that he simply desires to get a practical Billa Bill which will meet the needs of the people as nearly as he can, which will involve no extra expense, and which will leave to the High Court the original jurisdiction which has been given by the Constitution. The Committee has deprived the High Court of original jurisdiction as to the most numerous class of matters which may arise under Federal laws. But as it has not been given to the High Courti t must be given to the Supreme Courts of the States. I consider that clause 41 is too restricted. I think that, having regard to what has been done to-night in regard to clause 31 we must extend clause 41. I would suggest that in place of clauses 40 and 41, we should have one clause. W it h that object in view, I move That all the words down to paragraph (a) be omitted, with a view to insert in lieu thei'eof the following words :"" The Supreme Court, in each of the States, shall have original jurisdiction in the following matters :"" That is to say, in the matters which are mentioned in paragraphs (a) to ( f ) of clause 40.

I do see a doubt. doubt. But I would treat the State as any We are speaking defendant is treated. You would have to find out where he is, and sue him primdfacie where he is. The ordinary rule as between jurisdictions is that you follow your defendant. . We might fairly say that if a State Court is to entertain a suit against a State Government it must be in the Statei n which that State Government has jurisdiction. That is the only matter as to which I feel any doubt. A t the end of the clause I propose to add the following words :""(g) arising under the Constitution, or involving its interpretation ; (h) arising under any laws made by Parliament ; ( i ) of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction ; ( j ) relating to the same subject-matter claimed under the laws of different States."" There will be no objection to striking out admiralty and maritime jurisdiction if it is thought that it is already conferred, but I included the paragraph in order, to exhaust the matter. It will be seen that I am not proposing to deprive the High Court of any jurisdictibn which it has; to shear it of its dignity, importance, or value, such as it has. I should like to see the courts accessible to the people. I should like to see that a man injured in Adelaide is able to bring his action in Adelaide right off, without having to wait until the High Court shall come there, or without having to go to Bombala. The expense of dragging lawyers and witnesses about is a tremendous one. In our Commission report we went so far, even within the narrow limits of Victoria, as to recommend the diminution of the number of assize towns in order to avoid the expense of dragging witnesses and Judges about here and there. I think it is a good principle to follow. If you have a court, with sufficient weight, by all If my honourable and means utilize it for the purpose of all the jurisdiction for which it can possibly be utilized.

If that were done, people the atmosphere of courts, which I suppose in poor circumstances who desired to obtain agrees as slightly with other honourable members as with me.

And, speaking frankly, much as I appreciate the great talents and high character of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, I cannot wholly appreciate his attitude towards this measure. He belongs to a party, if I may be permitted to say so without offence, that desires to exclude every English commodity from * this country ; but apparently there is one thing that he is unwilling to exclude from it . We are to have everything Australian, with the solitary exception of Australian law. We are to have a branch stream of the great river of British justice coursing through the plains of Australia. That was the honourable and learned member's contention. In some respects the honourable and learned member recalls a famous countryman of his who advised his fellows to burn everything that came from England except its coals. He seems to me a trifle less consistent than Dean Swift, because, although he rejects everything else, he is still willing that Australia should go to Britain for finality in law.

GROOM -Would the honourable and learned member allow treaty matters to be dealt with as proposed? Sir JOHN QUICK We are not under any obligation to provide that they shall be dealt with exclusively by the High Court. They do not arise under the Federal laws or under the Constitution. Hitherto, if any cases of the kind have occurred, they have been dealt with by the Supreme Courts of the States. They would not arise perhaps once in 100 years. have been any, but if a case of the kind arose it would affect Federal interests and obligations. Mr L. E.

I think the amendment should be carried ; but we should not strike out paragrapli (e) of clause 40, as suggested by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. the honourable and learned member for Bendigo is that we should retain some exclusive jurisdiction. The question raised by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is whether there shall be any exclusive jurisdiction in the High Court. learned member's contention is practically that there should be no exclusive jurisdiction in the High Court. Where we have power to give original jurisdiction, we are, in effect, vesting it in the Supreme Courts of the States and are making the High Court practically only an Appeal Court. member is going beyond that. that, having struck out clause 31, we must give this jurisdiction to the Supreme Courts. Otherwise it will not be vested in any court, because we have decided that it shall not be vested in the High Court. I submit that, as the Government agreed to the omission of clause 31, they should withdraw the measure, and have it re-drafted in accordance with the opinion of the Committee. This is a very big matter, and I think that before going further we should determine how many Judges are to form the High Court. Why did we decide to refuse to give this original jurisdiction if we did not intend to vest it in the Supreme Courts? It must be vested either in the Federal Court or in the States Courts. We determined that it should not be given to the High Court, because it would create more work than a court of five Judges c'ould perform. But I am willing to go even further than the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and to confer a certain amount of Federal jurisdiction upon the inferior courts. present jurisdiction. The honourable and be done with clause 40. I agree very learned member would not allow a justice of largely with what has been said by the the peace to decide a suit between States? similar to those which confine their present jurisdiction. I think that suits between States might be left wholly to the High Court, but if Federal (jurisdiction . is not given in some degree to the inferior courts, injustice will be done to a good many people. A t the present time, the Postmaster-General can be sued for negligence only under the Claims against the Commonwealth Act, which ceases to have effect directly this B i ll becomes law. But supposing the Bill was law, and a man wished to bring an action against the Postmaster General. Take the case of a line repairer, who thought that he had been unjustly deprived of a couple of weeks' earnings-a n amount representing £ 4 or £ 5 . W hy should such a suitor be compelled to bring his case before a Supreme Court, where the writ would cost almost as much ? It would be absurd to ask him to do so. I trust, therefore, that provision will be made under which the inferior States Courts can entertain such cases. honourable and learned member for Werriwa has slightly confused two different matters. The amendment has no relation to clause 31, which contained the proposal of the Government to confer additional original jurisdiction upon the High Court. Clause 40 does not relate to additional jurisdiction at all. It deals only with the compulsory jurisdiction provided for by the Constitution, and only with a portion of that jurisdiction. Therefore, there is nothing in common between the clauses, and the amendment has nothing to do with clause 31. What the Committee refused to do, in striking out clause 31, was to give the High Court more than the compulsory original jurisdiction of the Constitution. Clause 40 provides that part of that compulsory jurisdiction shall be confined to the High Court. omit clause 31 we practically dealt also with clause 3, and were limiting the work . to be done by the High Court with the intention of limiting the number of the Judges to be appointed to that court. honourable and learned member.

I think there is great reason for each of these, and I should feel disposed to support that proposal. It would be anomalous, I think, to allow a State Court to summon to its bar another State. I think it would interfere with what we may fairly call the relative independence of the States. Then, in suits of the Commonwealth against the States the same principle applies. M.r. McCAY -Surely, as regards paragraph (d), the Commonwealth has its choice as plaintiff, and it cannot hurt the Commonwealth to give jurisdiction to a State Court? wrong to make a distinction in that case, and allow the Commonwealth to summon before the bar of any one State any other State, because the honourable and learned member will see that there is no distinction here. Why should the Commonwealth sue tlie State of South Australia before a Victorian State Court? and learned member there. I was thinking of matters brought before the courts of the State concerned. jurisdiction to some extent. I do not think it is easy to clearly draw the line of distinction. Besides, I do not think there would be much use in giving the optional power, because the Commonwealth would always go to its own court. partial ? would be perfectly independent and impartial, but I see nothing to be gained by drawing the distinction even if we could overcome the difficulty. W it h regard to paragraph ( f ) , dealing with mandatory orders to officers of the Commonwealth to do something in the execution of their duty, it seems to me more appropriate that the Commonwealth Court should be the t r i bunal to command the execution of a duty by a Commonwealth officer under a Commonwealth law. I can see, of course; that there could be an order by a State Court, but I think there is a very great deal to be The proposal said for reserving matters dealt with in that paragraph to the Commonwealth Court.

I admitted that was the only case. I agree with the honourable MrM c CAY I think that as regards paragraph (c) those matters ought to be reserved for the Commonwealth Courts. There would be endless difficulties arising if two States had a suit, and it could be heard in a State Court of either. It would be still more extraordinary if it could be heard in the court of a third State. As regards paragraph (d), I really see no reason for giving exclusive jurisdiction to the High Court. In the cases dealt with in that paragraph, the Commonwealth is plaintiff, and the Commonwealth may be just as I think not ; I think it anxious to get a speedy decision as a State would be in the converse case, and it may be just as unable to proceed in the High Court, under the limitations of time and space, as it would be in the alternative proceedings.

There is a case sab judice across the Murray at the present time, in which the one ground of complaint has been that of excessive delay, and similar delays might arise if the High Court alone had jurisdiction under this paragraph.

GBOOM (Darling Downs) I suggest to the Attorney-General that he should abandon paragraphs (e) and ( / ) also. In view of the apparent intention to cut down the number of Judges, it will be necessary for us to afford some opportunities to private individuals for bringing such suits before the States Supreme Courts. W it h regard to paragraph (e), a good many of the suits will relate to matters of negligence, and will be brought by private individuals against the Commonwealth. In cases of And under paragraph very great importance the Commonwealth might be able to insist upon their removal to the High Court under clause 45. I should like to see the jurisdiction of the States Courts extended to the matters referred to in paragragh ( / ) , because by striking out clause 31 we have prevented actions arising under the laws made by the Commonwealth from being brought in the High Court as a court of first instance.

328,Mr Deakin,"It is not a question of the Bill stands, officers acting under the statutes we pass regulating trade or commerce may do, or refuse to do, certain acts, and thus give rise to actions for damages, which must be brought in the States Courts. If , however, it is desired to compel :an officer to do an act which he has .abstained from doing, it will be necessary to bring the matter before the High Courti f paragraph ( / ) stands. The peculiar position is this-that if a suitor wanted to secure damages he would have to go before the State Court, whereas if a mandamus were required, an application would have to be made to the High Court. It would be absolutely impossible for a suitor to bring alternative claims for damages, or a mandamus in a State Supreme Court. I can only conceive of matters arising under treaties in connection with extradition cases, which are regulated by the various State and Imperial Acts. If we wish to regulate extradition matters, we shall have to pass a Federal Act, and as we have declined to give the High Court original jurisdiction in matters arising under laws made by this Parliament, we shall have to rely upon the States Courts. However, these matters are not likely to prove of any great importance. I always recognise that there is force in the view that the High Court alone should deal with matters arising between State and State. Speaking for myself, I should be quite prepared to trust the States Supreme Courts in such cases. For instance, I should be content to leave the' Supreme Court of New South Wales-to decide a matter in which Victoria and New South Wales were in conflict, because I do not think there -would be any practical danger. But if we have a High Courti t will be as well to restrict these matordinate courts may be considered. ters, if anything, to its jurisdiction. I should not, therefore, object to alter my amendment by retaining the words at the opening of clause 40 and paragraph (c). I do not think that anything would be gained by allowing the rest of the clause to stand. Paragraph (d) relates to suits by the Commonwealth against a State, or any person being sued on behalf of tlie State, and as the Commonwealth has its own choice it can' bring the matter before the High Court if it deems it expedient. There are cases, however, in which it might be convenient for the Commonwealth to have the matter determined by the Supreme Court of a State, and I do not think we should be injured by the excision of the provision. If the words which I suggest are retained in the clause, I propose to add later on the words indicated in the amendment, of which I have given notice. In the meantime, I desire leave to withdraw my amendment. Amendment,by leave, withdrawn. suggest to the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that it would be better to test the whole question of vesting the States Courts with jurisdiction under clause 41, because this clause really deals only with exclusive jurisdiction. If the honourable and learned member, will consent to do that, perhaps the Attorney-General will consider another point. It seems to be assumed that clause 41 itself confers original jurisdiction, but I do not think it does. It only follows clause 39, which provides that the judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be exercised by Federal Courts or by the courts of the States, which are By the law of the Commonwealth invested with Federal jurisdiction. That is to say, by laws which are to be subsequently passed. Clause 41 then provides that the investment of jurisdiction is to be subject to certain limits as to locality, subject-matter, or otherwise ; therefore it appears to me that clause 41 confers no jurisdiction. I think that under this clause we should prescribe the limits of exclusive jurisdiction, and then, by an addition to clause 41, invest with general jurisdiction the several courts of the States. It is almost impossible to define the courts that are not Supreme Courts, and I suggest that between this and the next discussion of the Bill, the matter of defining the subthat some remarks which I previously made have been taken by the honourable and learned member for Corinella as casting some reflection on him. I had no intention of doing anything of the kind, and I desire to withdraw any remarks to which ' the honourable and learned member may take exception. considering the suggestions made by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, as to the possibility of distinguishing between the various courts of the States.

It would be a proper thing if suits by the Commonwealth against the State also were tried in the High Court, and thus comprise a class of cases for which that court is peculiarly suitable. I shall also have one or two considerations to offer-althoug h the cases are much less numerous and important-as to the wisdom of retaining sub-clauses (a) and (6). The latter relates only to consuls in their representative capacity, and the former, if necessary, could be so amended as to clearly relate to cases under treaty, and not arising from m y Acts passed in consequence of a treaty. treaties ? by the mother country is binding on this Federation, either by adoption, as is the case occasionally with commercial treaties, or by the simple will of the Imperial Government, and if, under the circumstanced, a rase should arise directly under a treaty, surely as the Federal Government is the only Government responsible and answerable to the mother country, and through the mother country to any foreign power, such a case would bo a proper one for the High Court. ciary must be absolutely independent of the Federal Government. importance which court decides the case. might apply to the Federal Parliament or to its Executive, when contrasted with those of the States; and yet, as a matter of fact, special duties in regard to external affairs are cost on this Parliament, and through Parliament on the Executive.
