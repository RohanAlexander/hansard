To a large degree, garages in Victoria have been utilized for the manufacture of parts of Bren gun carriers. The Victorian Automobile Chamber of Commerce is the eo-ordinating agency. [ believe that in New South Wales, as the result of the survey, some sfarnges in larger towns have been similarly employed.

When the principal fall due for repayment, the Sinking Fund will be used.

AIR-RAID PRECAUTIONS.

We proved conclusively at Lae that the best and safest trench is one 6 feet long, 4 f t . C in. to 5 feet deep, and not more than 2 feet wide. ThoseI have seen around Sydney are much too wide, and will prove a death trap if the Japanese come down here.

A leopard cannot change has not changed his. I say that to his credit. He has stood by his principleslie is consistent and persistent. He is the one man who has stood loyally by the platform of the Labour party ever since he has been associated with it . He stands now, as from the beginning, for the nationalization of the means of production, distribution and exchange. He is bold enough to say f r a n k ly what he means, and t ry to give effect to the policy in which he believes. Therefore, unless and u n t i l the Prime Minister is prepared to disown the statements of the Ministerf o r Labour and National Service. what that gentleman has said represents the accepted policy of the Government. The responsibility rests upon the Prime Minister to say that his Government does not stand for that policy. On the ISth February, .1931, the honourable member for East Sydney, speaking in the Paddington TownH a l l .at the opening of the East Sydney campaign, .said that he still -rood behind the proposals of Mr Lang. Mis remarks were reported as follows:The stand taken by Mr Lang at the recent Premiers Conference was the most courageous tiling ever done in the political history of the Commonwealth. Only those speakers who are prepared to stand behind the financial proposals of Jack Lang are going to take the platform' during the present campaign. On declaredI. am on the side of Jack Lang, and within six mouths there will be thousands more on his side than there are to-day. When the Financial Emergency State Legislation B ill was under discussion in this Housei n May, 1932, the member for Mast Sydney declared that the then Commonwealth Ministry might continue its vindictive and panicky attack upon the Labour Government in New South Wales, but its every move would be foredialled by Mr Lang. Coming to November. 1938, we find Mr Ward discussing the subject of monetary control. He said it should be remembered that the Commonwealth Parliament would not exercise supreme power unless it were given authority to determine monetary policy. The LabouT party, he said, was in favour of granting such powers to the national Parliament, but the anti-Labour Government was not. During the debate on my budget in 'October of last year, the honourable member declared that he was of opinion that the best plan that could be followed by the Opposition when it became the Government, would be to put the private banks completely out of operation, and to allow the Commonwealth Bank to f u l f i l the function for which it was originally established. -GOVERNMENT MEMBERS -Hoar, hear ! supporters of the Government amounts to a declaration in support of the policy outlined by the Ministerf o r Labour we must believe that and National Service. The intention of the Government to take over the private banks has become apparent during the last few days. We have been told that the number of branches belonging to the trading banks must be reduced; that branches w ill be closed wherever possible, and the business diverted to the Commonwealth Bank. That is in accordance with the policy for the nationalization of banking. Honourable members opposite say "" Hear, hear "". Therefore, we must believe that the whole financial structure of the country is in jeopardy if the M in ister for Labour and National Service and those who follow h i m are to be allowed to have their way. I do not think that the Treasurer, who has a f u l l realization of his responsibility, associates himthe following day, Mr Ward self with the sentiments expressed by his colleague when addressing a Sydney congress of national unity for an allied victory last week-end. This is what the Ministerf o r Labour and National Service is reported to have saidWe should nut tie linked to pay for the war iii'terwHids hy iiayiiijr interest on any loans that are raised now. That, in itself, is serious enough, coming as it did from a member of the present Ministry at a time when the Government is conducting an all-important war-loan campaign. I can sympathize with the Treasurer and the more responsible members of the Government. They want the loan to be a success, yet a leading member of the Cabinet, a man with ability and a considerable following, has stated that, in his opinion, no interest should be paid on war loans raised now. It would be a sorry day for Australia if the policy enunciated by the Minister for Labour and National Service were to be applied",20,Second Reading
88,Mr Fadden,"T h a t applause f r o mby the Government. The Prime Minister will, I am confident, give an assurance that the Government will honour its contractual obligations to pay interest, and that there will be no repudiation. The suspicion already aroused must be allayed, and that can only be done by the Prime Minister, as head of the Government, making a public declaration in this House that interest will be paid in terms of the contract on all money invested in the £35,000,000 war loan. If that be done, there will be no uncertainty in the minds of the people, and the loan will, in consespending power that lies in the hands of quence, be a success. I remind the House and the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley) that, up to the end of January, the 'Government has been obliged to lean on the system of shortloan credits through the central bank to the amount of more than £70,000,000. I have been very interested Treasurer's statements and his declarations regarding the trend of expenditure. It is quite evident that Australia is approaching a point where the annual war expenditure will be not less than £300,000,000. The amount by which it is found impossible this year to bridge the in the application of its financial policy. gap by revenue and loan is the amount by which the country will be compelled to depend upon its inner financial resources, and we are only at the beginning of that problem now. The Treasurer is quite well aware of the difficulties with which he will be confronted during the year 1942-43. I urge the Government to take steps now-no t at some time in the future -to ensure that there shall be no inflation in Australia. Unless the Government is prepared courageously to tackle the rationing of supplies, inflation must follow. There are many difficulties in the way, and some of them are political. It is hard to devise machinery for putting the system into effect, but unless action be taken the financial difficulties of the Government will increase progressively. Government will embark upon a scheme for rationing it will receive much support from this side of the House. I shall give all the assistance I can, and so will many other honourable members on this side. Unless something be done to ensure that a greater proportion of the money now passing through the industrial structure shall be diverted into government channels, the Treasurer's financial difiiculties next year will be very much, greater than they are at present. money in taxation? member is suggesting something that is not acceptable to the Government. 1 have in mind particularly the huge people with incomes below £400 a year. If the Government, in its wisdom, decides that, for the present, it cannot go further than it has gone in the direction of taxing the lower incomes, it should take what steps are necessary to limit the expenditure of those moneys which ii leaves in the hands of private persons. That can be done only by introducing a in the system of rationing, if necessary by the use of coupons, in respect of consumer commodities. If the Government doe not do this now. it will be forced to do so later. I urge the Government to be consistent It is not consistent for one department to endeavour to get as much money a? possible from the people by way of taxation, and for another department to try to force profits back into the hands of the public for further expenditure, which is the policy of the department administered by the Commissioner for Prices. sack the economists. an economist's dream, but very much of what is being done by the economists is contradictory. Through one department the Government is properly trying to get as much of the spending power of the community as possible into its own hands, while, through another department, it is trying to keep that spending If the power in the hands of the public. It is evident that a demand for consumer goods of a non-war character is being set up in competition with war needs.

93,Mr Spooner,"Australi a to-day isGovernment will receive substantial support from members of the Opposition if it courageously tackles these two matters, namely, the rationing of consumer goods and the necessity for obtaining consistency between the Treasury and the department profits. The platform of the Labour party sets -nt very clearly that money for war expenditure must be raised by taxation, and --very member of the Labour party elected io this Parliament is pledged to support it. opposes not only the raising of money by loans for the conduct of the war, hut also the payment of interest on such money. I am opposed to this bill because it proposes to continue the very bad, dangerous and disastrous practice that, was pursued during the last war of placing upon posterity a burden so onerous that it, cannot be borne. The Labour party did not decide without good mason to oppose the expenditure of loan money for war purposes. In reaching its decision, it was guided by the experience -if years. It had approved of the expenditure of loan money only on reproductive works, helping to create and maintain a national asset, and on promoting the general welfare of the nation in a material way. The bill which lightly and airily authorizes the raising of £75,000,000 was introduced in a very few words and with very little explanation hy the Treasurer ( Mr Chifley). To my mind this measure cuts directly across the platform and traditional policy of the Labour party. BecauseI had no opportunity in caucus to ""xplain my views on this subject, I do not pronose to vote for the bill now. An --leinentary knowledge of arithmetic --hows just how impossible it w ill be for the country to pay interest at the rate >f 3 per cent, upon war loans. The increased loan indebtedness of Australia as the result of the war is no less than H234,000,000. If the average rate of interest paid upon the loan be 3 per cent, per annum, we shall at the end of the next financial year be liable for the payment of £7,000,000. In addition, we JIIall be obliged to continue to pay that amount of interest for every year that the indebtedness remains. money paid? to this discussion. As we asked the solresponsible for limiting diers to fight for 6s. a day, we have no right to pay interest to people who lend money for the purpose of conducting the war. factories are paid more than 6s. a day. do not wish to be led into a digression by The policy of the Labour party even such a distinguished legal luminary as the right honourable gentleman. The fact remains that we are liable for a payment in interest of £7,000,000 a year. We still owe large sums of money in respect of the last war. Consider the position 1 Twenty years after the conclusion of the last war, the Commonwealth was paying interest on war loans at the rate of £10,000,000 per annum. Many of those who are now fighting for Australia were not born when the debt was incurred. We still pay £7,^)0,000 a year in respect of our liabilities incurred in 1914-18. Tlie result is that at the end of the next financial year we .shall pay £14,000,000 in interest on loans raised in respect of two wars. As the population of Australia is approximately 7,000,000, a per capita payment of £2 per annum in interest must be made to persons who lent the money for the proper conduct of those wars. That means that every man, woman and child, down to the latest born baby, is liable for £2 a year as an interest payment to those who invested in war loans. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Eadden) declared that that policy is a good one; he did not disagree with it . But when he was Treasurer last year, he proposed to pay the workers only 2 per cent, on compulsory loans which he proposed to raise. .1 object to the payment of any interest on war loans.

120,Mr Langtey (Riverina) {4.36],"but, in my opinion, tbe war should be financed by neither loan money nor taxation but by credit created through the Commonwealth Bank. As was said by the honourable member for Melbourne, we are still paying interest on money raised to fight, not only the last war, but also the battle of Waterloo. We are paying interest on something which does not exist, to the degree that many people believe, because credit is represented by book entries, in other words figures in a book. Money is the only thing in this world which is created out of nothing. It is shameful that to-day, while our own flesh and blood are being bombed, we should be arguing about interest. Money should be the last thing spoken about in connection with the war. The Government has the full control of the natural resources of this country, and ii is only common sense that it. should employ those resources and, in doing so. eliminate debt. Debt should not be incurred in the production of commodities. I put it another way: -what has happened to all the production of Australia in the last 150 years-our wool, wheat, meat, butter and eggs, every mortal thing, even our beer, whisky and the "" wine that maketh glad the heart of man""? is it all? It has gone like the snows of yesteryear. Labour is the only wealth that this country has. If our fighting men laid munitions workers their tools what would happen? We should be ""gone a million"". it: Labour, not money, is the real wealth. This Parliament and every other Australian be laden with gold, silver, copper and notes, but that would not win the war. It is labour that will win it. While we argue over a few million pound? and as to whether we should pay interest or not the war is proceeding. I do not profess to be a financial expert, but I have sufficient common sense to know that the money necessary to conduct the war should be created through the agency of our national Commonwealth Bank. That should be Australia's policy. Call it nationalization of banking or credit expansion, I do not care what name it is called, but the fact remains that, Mr Langtry. if the present policy be persevered with, when we have achieved victory, which we certainly will have, we shall be saddled with a debt amounting to millions of pounds. War debts have never been paid in the past. Ail that ha happened has been an accumulation more debt. In peace-time there was not sufficient money to keep our people in employment, but if this war goes on for another ten or fifteen years we shall havrthe money with which to fight it. Yet. if it finished tomorrow, our returned soldier would be thrown on the scrap heap. It would be the same old tale that there wano money. I refuse to believe that thr national credit cannot be used in orde: to provide, free of interest and debt, ever\ pennv required for the war. 1 have always been a little curious as in what goes on behind the locked doors of the caucus room. I never realized thai we should see the day when there would be a caucus meeting open to the public. What we have heard to-day brings befonthe House and the country a very seriouposition regarding the way iu which thtGovernment is to proceed financially. Thi exhibition to-day shows quite clearly that Where the rank and file of the Labour pa.ru and some of the Ministers are in direct All that remains is debt. variance with other Ministers as to how war finance should be raised. This is most serious, because, at the moment, tindown their arms and the Government is appealing to the people i "" subscribe to a £35,000,000 Liberty Loan, and is using on posters the caption, "" Yon There is no doubt about dare not fail "". If the present method of raising money is to continue it most certainly must be based on a founparliament could dation of confidence. The statements recently heard from some Labour Ministers and supporters, indicating the division which exists in the ranks of the Government, augur very little good for the success of government loans. The interesting suggestion has been made that we should not borrow or pay interest. I have not heard it suggested that the money should be raised entirely by the expansion of central bank credit expansion. It has been said quite definitely that the money needed should be raised by taxes'.' Is thai not a little different from what we have heard on other occasions? When the",26,Second Reading
121,Mr Htjtchinsoln..(Deakin) [4.43],"Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) has directed attention to the fact that a large proportion of the people of Australia escape with very little taxation honourable gentlemen opposite have taken a definite stand against the taxing of that action of the people. But, if the money needed for war purposes is to be raised by taxation, the Government w ill have to dig deep into the pockets of the small wage-earners. We are spending 22 per uent. or 23 per cent, of the national income on the war. It has been estimated that when our anticipated programme is in f u l l swing we shall be spending 35 per cent, of the national income on the war. GreatB r it a in is spending between -to and 50 per cent, of its national income for war purposes. Before this war ends, or even before we are on the path to victory, Australia w ill also have io spend considerably more than 35 per cent, of its national income on the war. These figures have been placed before the House on many occasions. national income has been calculated by the Commonwealth Statistician at about £870,000,000 a year, of which only £95,000,000 goes to people with incomes ranging upwards from £1,000. It has been estimated that of that £95,000,000 Federal, State and Municipal taxation absorbs between 60 per cent, and 75 per cent. I remind honourable members of the figures already given in respect of the group earning from £400 to £1,000 a year. Their aggregate income is £145,000,000. money is in the possession of the people earning less than £400 a year. earnings amount to £560,000,000. Oh the argument put forward by the honourable member for Melbourne ( Mr Calwell) and certain other honourable members opposite, it is palpable that the money needed cannot be raised even if we take the whole of the incomes of those who earn more than £400 a year. It is obvious, therefore, that, if taxation is to he employed in order to raise all the money needed, we must heavily tax those in receipt of less than £400 a year. And that has been opposed vociferously in the past by honourable gentlemen opposite. Time and time again it has been said that those people must be left untouched. Yet some Government members have entirely reversed their attitude and are plainly saying to the wage-earner, "" We -have to tax you heavily in order to find the money with which to fight the war "". I expected that the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) would be in his place to-day to answer the queries and statements of honourable members. He should be here, and after the exhibition in this House to-day some statement must be made to us as to whether the Labour party is to follow the dictates of men outside Parliament. I wonder if the secretary of the Iron-workers Union, who wished that "" the crowd at Downingstreet would be scrapped along with tinTest "", plays a part in the framing of the Government's policy. I wonder if Morrison, of the Liquor and Allied Trades Union, who would rather his nine children in the grave than in khaki, helps to frame the Government's policy. It i.« high time the Prime Minister came into this chamber and listened to his own colOur leagues on this matter and to the complete overthrow of previous arguments. Himust make a clear and unequivocal siatiment to this country as to the direction in which the Government is to travel. If the Government intends to depend upon voluntary loans to raise money for war purposes-and it has chosen to adopt that course-it must appeal to the people of Australia who, in the past, have been t h r if t y enough to save money and so have become "" little capitalists"", for taxation is taking the The big reservoir of great bulk of the incomes of persons in receipt of more than £1,000 a year.

It must maintain the confidence of the people. We require in this House to-day a definite and clear statement of the Government's policy in this regard. Recent outbursts by the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) have been mentioned in this debate. I agree with the honourable member for Barker( Mr Archie Cameron) that if that Minister holds the views that have been attributed to him. the only honourable course open to him is to resign from the Government. If he cannot support the Government on a vital matter of policy like that, he should resign. That is the only honourable thing for him to do.

That statement also applies to the present Liberty Loan.

To ensure this country's defence and its triumph over the powers that threaten it, the munitions workers, the miners and the people engaged in all our war industries give their services. The soldier, the sailor and the airman each offers his life. Is it too much to expect the moneyed man to give his money without expecting interest returns? Such action by those in a position to lend their money in the defence of their country and of themselves would definitely not damage the credit of this nation, but would be to it? everlasting credit. I say to certain honourable members who have accepted the reports of some daily newspapers as their authorities, that there have been occasions in the past when they have not been so ready to do so.

He said that at least I had been consistent in my advocacy of financial policy. He also added that the leopard cannot change its spots.

The honourable gentleman --earebed back to 19>31 in dealing with my political attitude. In replying to the honourable gentleman, I shall not go baok *o far.. He was elected to this Parliament somewhat later than I was ini 1931.. In a speech that he delivered when he was cocking election to this Parliament he referred, to the majority party supporting the government of the day-that is, the United Australia party-in the following terms:'the United Australia party gaveIts allegiance to the big financial and manufacturing interests of the cities and to the middlemen and monopolists because it received its. support and power, from those people.. How then could the United Australia party serve the countryside as welT as those in the city who slicked the lifehlood from the 1 1 countryside? Yet the honourable gentleman is to-day not only sitting side by side with these bloodsuckers, but has actually become their leader! consistency! Let us now look for a moment or two at his statements this afternoon. He said that the Government was relying entirely upon vcluntary loans and he asked how the Government could expect to get loan money when it limited profits? Taking the honourable gentleman's statement to its logical conclusion, he asked, in effect, "" How can you expect to raise loans unless you allow the profiteer in this country to go ahead?"" That is the policy of the United Australia party. loans! man would have us. believe that the Government should not restrict profits but the idea of afterwards borrowing it from him at what it regarded, .as a. suitable rate of interest. The honourable gentleman's government propounded a policy of compulsory loans. Doubts were created in the minds of the workers in regard to such a policy because they knew very well, of the number of promises made during the last war which were repudiated by anti-Labour governments. They were afraid that the same kind of thing would happen in respect of the proposed compulsory loan policy. They held the opinion that the compulsory loans would never be repaid. I did not introduce personalities into this-debate. I listened quietly while other honourable gentlemen were speaking and particularly while they were saying that certain things should, be cleared up. 1 also desive certain things to be cleared up in this Parliament.

The honourable gentleman who made those statements now sits on the backmost bench of the Opposition in this Parliament. I have never said on any occasion that tbe Government should not pay interest on the loans which have been raised, or that it should not pay interest on the loan which is now being floated. WhatI have said, and what I say now, is that it is entirely wrong to apply a policy which will inevitably bring ruin, misery and degradation upon large numbers of people. which may be covered by this bill? a leading article in the Sydney Daily Tulegrapli, of the 12th December, 1941, a journal which has been most hostile to me and which has repeatedly distorted my statements. It is one of the newspapers which supports the Leader of the Opposition. The leading article related lo an appeal for funds to replace HMAS. Sydney-a n appeal which was quite popular about that time. The article reads as follows:The Lord Mayor of Sydney Crick) HMAS. Sydney. He wants it-now . He wants it from you. He must get it.

The Minister for Labour and National Service, as he was entitled to do, explained the statement he had made. I can see no reason, whatever for the subsequent stream of abuse from hdm, directed at various members of thichamber. All that I want to say aboin the original statement, as it wasreported in the newspapers, is this: Wh:t ! the Minister was reported to have said had the widest possible circulation in Australia. It had that circulation at a time when a war loan of first importan -c was heing floated. Until this afternoon, it had not been the subject of any correction whatever hy the Minister.

I should be the last to suggest that on every occasion on which a. Minister, or any body else, liad been misreported, he should correct the mis1 report. Far be it from me to suggest time to do little else. But this was a case of a special kind. This was a matter of major importance, and this last moment explanation by the Minister will, I am afraid, go only a small distance towards repairing the damage that has been done.

The second point is that we heard a Minister, speaking as a Minister from the table, deliver what can only be described as a new communist manifesto, namely, that in order to get an all-in war effort every body in this country called upon to do work of any kind shall receive exactly the same remuneration, aud shall receive it, not in. cash, but in coupons. the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr to himself, ""That is what I am to do: Spooner). whether my taciturn friend, the honourable member for Reid agrees with it. the originator of that idea. that the honourable member for Ballarat( Mr Pollard) supports that policy, but what I want to know is, does the Prime Minister believe in it? Does the Treasurer believe in it? Does it represent the policy of the Government?! This is a new political tactic-to put up a Minister notoriously devoted to extravagant speech, and get him to "" try it on the dog "", so to speak. He gets up and jeers at the Opposition, and says, "" Ah, you would not have this, and you would not havt that!""-whil e behind him, hoping fo: the best, but fearing the worse, sit other Ministers quite silently, still, so far a I know, drawing their salaries. I dinot know whether the Minister for Labour and National. Service hat begun to practice this new doctrine in his own case, but I would very much like to know whether what has been advocated by the Minister for Labour and National Service is, in fact, the policy of the Government.

Some of the appeals which have been made to people to contribute to the war loan wea'e exactly the same as those which were resorted to during the last war. The practice is to tell people: "" It is not necessary for you to have any money in order to support the war loan. You can borrow it from a bank "".

190,Mr Anthony (Richmond) [5.44],"theories of the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward). I do u-o-fr know what he actually said. Perhaps, he was misreported. If that were -sO,' he should have, issued a correction at rounded himself with staff. Does he still the earliest possible moment before the damage was' done. However, he allowed the public to believe that he had used those words. I am not one who regards the raising of money by loans as the best method of financing the war;. Upon this subject, I have very much in common with the Minister, for Labour and National Service, and other members of the Government. In my opinion, a large percentage of war finance-I doubt whether the whole could be found by this method-shoul d come from current savings' from current production. The best methodby which to obtain thatisby taxation. However,, that is not the policy o# the Government. When the Govern1 ment of which I was a member attempted to put that policy into practice, the Labour party criticized it, and succeeded in defeating it. If the Minister for Labour and National Service challenges our sincerity, we are at perfect liberty to challenge his sincerity. The only it --way to make that, possible is by reducing to which an individual' can put profits' is to purchase' privileges with them. Money is of no use to an individual unless he can buy something with it, either in the form of goods or privileges. I should lik» to knowwhether the Minister for Labour and National Service' has, to date, set an example to the country by surrendering some of his ministerial privileges. A l though the Government is appealing to people to make greater sacrifices than 1 ever before, Ministers take to themselves greater and greater privileges. The Minister for Labour and National Service is probably the greatest exponent of that policy. He has a bigger staff of supernumeraries and of assistants than any other Minister. What is the value of their services? What remuneration do his colleagues, pals and friends get? Are they receiving £2 2s. or £2 10s. a day, taxthat would not make available one extra free, or are they giving their service. 5 voluntarily, being satisfied with their parliamentary allowance of £1,000 per annum ? remuneration. the honourable member's disclaimer. I i appears to. me that the Minister for Labour and National Service has surreserve for himself a compartment when the demands on railway rolling-stock aiv so great? when every body is called upon to make sacrifices the example should come from the top, andwhen Ministers examine the question of man-power they should examine their own personal staffs, especially when they ask othersto do the same-. I have seen around the House in the entourage of Ministers men, who-, from appearances at any rate, might well be doing some more active job than penpushing or paper-carrying, jobs, which could be done by girls or people not of military capacity. I have a lot in common with honourable gentlemen opposite who. have expressed views about the raising, of money. 1 agree that money could be raised by a stroke of the pen at the bank.. The best ordinary civil consumption. The things that would, normally be bought, would not, be bought, and the money that would normally be expended on their purchase would be available in the form of savings for diversion to the war effort. We could, as the honourable member for Maranoa (ME. Baker) has so often proclaimed, finance the war through the Commonwealth bank, but that would do nothing to reduce civil consumption or divert money to the production of war needs. War production can be increased by no other means than community saving enforced by the, restriction of production and sale of civil goods. That is the reason for the loan programme and heavy taxation as against the creation of credit. It would be easy to finance the war through the Commonwealth Bank, but bullet or blanket or whatever be needed for war purposes. I regret that the debate has taken its present course.

Of what use would it be to make profits and accumulate money if this country were to be taken by the enemy, who is almost on our shores? If that policy of pooling our resources were applied, our effort would be "" all-in "" and we could apply ourselves to the prosecution of the war to a successful end. We have not only the enemy outside to consider; we have the enemy withinmoney power. That is the real enemy confronting us. That is as true to-day as it was when Lincoln saidThere are two enemies I have to fight-the one in front of me-the Confederate Army, which I can seek out and deal with effectively, ter for Labour and National Serand tlie one behind-the unseen money power -whic h is more subtle in its methods and is the more insidious of the two. We have that enemy within to-day; it is as insidious as it was in Lincoln's day, and it has to be dealt with as effectively as the enemy without. The outof-date money system is clogging the war effort. The influences behind that system are responsible for the attack upon the Minister for Labour and National Service. Those same influences are at the back of an effort to institute an even more orthodox method of finance than that which operates to-day. I cpjote this passage from the Sydney pressLondon. Saturday. A common currency for all tlie nations <ii the anti-Axis front is envisaged as a developmade known to the people outside they ment of the near future. Based on a gold standard, tlie common currency would do tniu-li Government as probably the most dangerto facilitate the How of goods from one antiAxis country to another. The plan would create :i pool of allied gold holdings and abolish trade barriers, while pegging Latin American currencies to a new unit. Those are the influences at work within the democracies to-day. If honourable members opposite continue on behalf of the moneyed interests propaganda of the type indulged in to-day the challenge will be accepted in this House or on the hustings at any time they like. I had no intention of speaking but for the remarks of the honourable member for Bourke( Mr Blackburn). His specious plea on behalf of the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward) gave to this House some indication of how far party loyalty will go. We know that the honourable member for Bourke has been disciplined by the Labour party because of his "" L e f t is t"" leanings. At times he has been excluded from party conferences because of his communistic tendencies. The right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) drew attention to the fact that one section of the policy propounded by the Minister for Labour and National Service was definitely communistic. ing with coupons. The honourable member for Bourke said that there was a concerted attack on the .Minisvice, designed to drive him out of the Cabinet. That is not so. The honourable member for Bourke said that the masse bad no greater champion than the Minister for Labour and National Service. If the masses had to look to him for the lead which they need in this war they would be disappointed. They would fail to get inspiration, leadership or direction and, indeed, would be a leaderless mob. There is no need for honourable members on thi side to seek for the honourable member to be driven from the Cabinet. A ll that, necessary is that the people shall read extracts from Hansard reports of speeches made by the Minister when he was in opposition. When what he said then i will demand his withdrawal from tht ous member any Australian government has ever had in war-time. On the 5th November, 1936. speaking on the Estimates in this chamber the honourable member said1 should not be prepared to take up arm? against the workers of any country, whether they be German or of any other nationality As a matter of fact, because I am not prepared to do that, I am not prepared to tell other* to do so. 1 believe, and judging by statements mad* by honourable members on both sides of thp committee it seems to be generally agreed, that Australia would find it very difficult, if not impossible, to defend itself against an aggressor.

This is the man who as a private member said that ne would not take up arms to defend this country. He is a man of fixed opinions; as the deader of the Opposition has said, this man is at least -consistent and whether in office or out -of office attacks tbose of opposite politics to his own. There was no need for the specious pleading of tie honourable member for Bourke when le. was directing attention to what he considered to be a direct and organized attack on the Minister for Labour and National -Service from this side of the House. The people generally need only to have statements of the kind attributed to the Minister published in order to withdraw their support from public loans. The Minister is definitely the weak link in the Cabinet and he should be removed. I believe that he would be the first person to advise the workers of this country not to take up arms against their fellow workers, even though they might be Germans or Japanese. He would say in effect: "" Whatever they are, they are fellow workers "". remarks of the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) have nothing whatever to do with the bill. stand the attitude of the Treasurer.

He knows full well that he will be required to answer to the House for the statements made by the Minister for Labour and National Service. .He, and some other honourable gentlemen in the Government who do not favour the policy advocated by the Minister for Labour and National Service, do not desire to have either their characters or their credentials towards the general economic position of assailed. The fact is that the outlook of the Minister for Labour and National Service on financial issues has not changed. Erom time to time he ha made statements to the effect that he would not contribute a penny towards the defence of his country. Such statements must inevitably affect contributions to public loans. 'The honourable -gentleman has made no secret of bis belief that interest should not be paid on money lent to defend the country. He has said that people should not receive any interest on money lent for war purposes. He stated in the House to-day that he was referring to past obligations, but when he was asked by responsible members of the Opposition whether 'his remarks had application to this bill ne was silent. His ministerial colleagues also were silent. I suggest that the honourable gentleman's attitude is designed to bring about a profound change in tihe financial policy of Australia. It will be remembered -that quite recently certain regulations dealing with tike economic organization in this country were tabled. The Government ha? appointed a special committee to report upon them. That would not have been done had the Minister for Labour and Na'tional Service had his way. I am sure that we should get no modification of the regulations if the decision depended .upon the Minister. When a question was asked of the Prime Minister recently concerning these regulations, the honourable gentleman interjected that the regulations were not severe enough. hear the honourable -member for Dalley express that view.

If we are to make an effective war effort, we must be a united people, and have complete confidence in our Government. I regret that, so far, we have not bad an unambiguous pronouncement on financial policy from a responsible member of the Ministry. Until that has been made, the views of honourable members on this biflt must, remain seriously unsettled. It would appear that soma honourable membersopposite place tlie-. financial 1 viewsof the Minister for Labour and National Service in the forefront of their political policy.

Honourable o'.enibers who sit on this side of the House are not slaves hound to the party wheel, as are honourable members who sit opposite. ""We are entitled at all times to express our views in regard to party policy and the manner in which it is applied. Any honourable member, whether he be a Minister or a rank-andfile member, has the right to express his '->pinion if he believes that there has been departure from the party platform by the Ministry. Furthermore, in view of rhe changed conditions brought about by the war, he is entitled to place on the platform of tbe party whatever interpretation he considers the Labour movement intended should be placed on it in a given set of circumstances. It is as well to consider what the platform of the Labour party is in regard to defence, and the measures that should be adopted in order to finance it. The defence policy sets out that it shall be financed by the operation of Labour's financial policy; and that policy very definitely states that naval and military expenditure shall be allocated from direct taxation. raxation for the purpose of naval or military expenditure is departed from any member of the party is entitled to check up in order to determine whether or not, the Ministry is departing from the-platform of the party. Furthermore, Labour's financial policy lays down that there shall be restriction of public borrowing. 1 a.m beginning to wonder whether this bill, and every other loan measure that the Labour Government has asked this House to pass, are in conformity with the platform of the party in relation to public Imrrowing. It might be said in justification of the adoption of this practice, that taxation has reached the limit. Honourable members opposite say that it, has not; they would like the Government to invade the lower ranges of income in order to collect a greater amount of revenue. Possibly the Treasurer believes that the limit of taxation has been reached, and that the leeway must be made up by means of public borrowing. If this bill is not the result of consultation with the rank and file members of the party, any one of Mr Rosevear. them is perfectly justified in criticizing it. to the degree that it departs from the policy of the party. It has been said that the Minister for Labour and National Service should resign because, apparently, he disagrees with this procedure. Whether he resigns or not, is to be taken as evidence of whether or not he possesses personal courage. I put it to honourable members that if a man ran away from, his convictions that would not be a display of courage, but that, on the contrary, he would display courage if he were prepared to stand his ground in the Cabinet as well as in this House, in defence of views which he conceived to be in line with the policy of the party. The Minister has suggested that interest should not be offered in connection with the raising of future loans. That is regarded as a revolutionary proposal. I agree that it is. He has not advocated that contracts already made with the public shall be repudiated. I put it to the House that the Labour parn has already made a revolutionary change in its defence policy. It was committed to voluntaryism in defence, but has accepted the principle of conscription for military service. There have been no When the policy of direct howls from the Opposition on that account. When the Government departs from voluntaryism and tends towards the reactionary policy that our opponents espouse, they welcome the change of front; but when we suggest that interest shall not be payable in connection with future loans, they repudiate the idea. In recent regulations, the Government, has gone dangerously close to industrial conscription, which to the Labour movement is anathema to a. greater degree than is military conscription. Honourable members opposite have not eluded us on that account. They have attempted to prove thai the suggestion of the Minister for Labour and National Service, if adopted, would damage public morale. Public morale can be damaged in a number of ways. I. suggest that infinitely more damage could be done by the suggestion, of honourable members opposite that the restriction of profits will lead to the restriction of investment in loans. Nothing could be more dama.ging to the morale of the great bulk of the people than the belief that there is in this House a substantial party, wbicb has been the Government and may again be the Government before the termination of the war, and which holds the view that a certain section is so paltry as to show patriotism only in the measure of the profits it can extract from the nation. people can be damaged also by the bombardment of our cities by enemy ships and bombers. I remind honourable members opposite that quite recently Australia was bombed by Japanese raiders. A story told by an evacuee from New Guinea is to the effect that a piece of scrap iron from a bomb dropped on that territory was marked, "" Thank you, Mr Menzies"". Such an incident is most damaging to public morale. Which is likely to be the most damaging-the policy suggested b? the Minister for Labour and National Service, the current policy of the members of the Opposition, or the policy of those gentlemen less than two years ago? first, tie damage to the prospects of the loan which might be caused if interest were not payable. When will this interest be paid? Payment will be made in postwar years, when the mass of the people of Australia will be paying for this war iu starvation and tears; when broken soldiers, who have fought to protect this countiy in the interests of those who have money to invest, will be walking about like mendicants looking for a dole from rhe Repatriation Department; when people are reconstructing their broken homes, which have taken them a lifetime of energetic endeavour to procure. At that stage, these patriots who lend rbeir money to the Government will be collecting interest on it with monotonous regularity. When the war is over, and work in munitions factories ceases, the unemployed will number perhaps 500,000. Those men will almost certainly have to search for work, and live on dole tickets, whilst these patriots, whom honourable members opposite are so feverishly endeavouring to protect, will be collecting their interest regularly. Present that picture to the people of Australia-the post-war picture, when levy is being paid to the interest-mongers-and then see whether honourable members opposite would be game enough, with all their humbug, to fight an election on it. That is the first test-damag e to the loan prospects because there is to be no interest. Let us examine the second proposition of honourable members opposite, namely, that if you restrict profits, you will discourage investment in war loans. The morale of the What sort of policy is that to put before the people? How are you to improve the morale of the public if you must tell them that, unless you allow a certain class ruthlessly to exploit them, the members of that class will not invest their money in war loans? There is only one logical conclusion to be drawn from that: the greater the profit you allow some people to extort from the public, the greater will be the success of the war loan. deliberate distortion. evitable conclusion to which the arguments of honourable members opposite Let us examine, lead. I was interested to hear the honourable member for Kooyong( MT . Menzies), who usually acts as backstop for the Opposition when things are going badly for them, put forward a specious case on what turned out to be an incorrect newspaper report. After all,, of what use is it to be a lawyer if yon cannot put up some sort of an argument even on a bad case? He asked what would people of Australia think of the Minister for Labour and National Service who dared to say that future war loans should be interest free. A few weeks ago, the honourable member for Kooyong told the House that for two years, while he was Prime Minister, he knew that we would have to fight Japan; yet, during those two years, he forced the waterside workers with threats of gaol and deregistration to load pig iron for Japan. Now he tells us what the people would do to the Minister for Labour and National Servicei f they had the chance. I would rather hear the people say, ""Hang the Minister for Labour and National Service"", than hear the Japanese say, "" Thank you, Mr Menzies "", as they have done for his part in providing them with supplies of scrap iron.

210,Mr Rosevear,"That is the inSydney( Mr Ward) in 1936 that he did not want to fight the workers of any country, and, incidentally, that he did not want to fight the German workers. Did any one know with any degree of certainty who would be fighting whom in this war until the nations had actually taken sides? In flaaisard I could turn up columns of rubbish talked hy some honourable members about countries which are now in the enemy's camp. The statement of the Minister for Labour and National Service, referred to by the honourable member for Wentworth, was made in 1936, and the people of his electorate have returned him twice since then, and his party has by plebiscite elected him a member of the Government. The same honourable members opposite, who were responsible for selling scrap iron to Japan, were, if I remember rightly, responsible for the attempt to lease the Yampi iron ore deposits to Japan. About the time the honourable member for East Sydney was saying that he did not want to fight the German workers, those other honourable members wanted to provide the Japanese with unlimited supplies of iron ore. government in Western Australia that proposed to lease the deposits. State government which wanted to lease the deposits, the Government supported by the honourable member did nothing to prevent it order. Is the honourable member in order in making misstatements regarding the actions of a previous government? I take the point that the previous Commonwealth government did prohibit the --sport of iron ore from Yampi Sound. -That is only a. contradiction; it is not. has failed to make greater inroads into a point of order.. bers opposite, most of whom were born with silver' spoons in their mouths, are shocked, at the suggestion of the honourable member for East Sydney that if every one were to make an equal contribution to the war effort we might pay for all services by the issue of coupons Government policy? from a very good Labour man. Honourable members opposite are scandalized at the suggestion that they, and other members of their class, should accept food coupons, but I never heard any of them condemn the issuing of dole coupons to the unemployed. Eor ten years they thought it good enough to issue food coupons to the men who are the present heroes of the workshops making munitions with which to fight the enemy. That is their contribution, whilst the contribution of honourable members opposite is a continuous heckling of the trade unions. Those honourable gentlemen have expressed great enthusiasm for the £75,000,000 loan for the purpose of destruction. The same honourable members, during the depression years, held up their hands in holy horror when it was suggested that a few million pounds might be raised to give work to the unemployed. They are always enthusiastic about war loans, but they have no enthusiasm for work loans for the purpose of making life bearable for those was the State suffering the worse effects of depression. There is an obvious difference between the financial outlook of the Government and that of the Opposition. We support a policy of taxation for defence purposes, together with a restricted loan policy. 1 hope that the Government will not tempt the loyalty of the party too far by going in too much for loans. The defence policy which I have just enunciated is the one to which we have always subscribed., the one upon which we won our seats in this Pai'liament, and.it is up to us to ensure that that policy shall not be departed from too widely. Honourable members opposite are still harping on the fact that the Government small incomes. They are perturbed at the fact that an amount of £500,000,000 is received each year by the lower-paid workers,, but none of them told the House just how many people share that money, and how much is left to each of them after he pays his taxes.

I refer to the popular story about the scrap iron which the Menzies' Government allowed io be exported to Japan. The time has i-ome when the f u l l facts regarding this return to the subject before the House: It -natter should be made public, and they are very different from the story told by members of the present Government for political purposes. This problem cropped up again last year while I was Minister for Labour. We received a report that rhere was likely to be industrial trouble -m the waterfront because the workers were being asked to load zinc concentrates aud lead for shipment to Japan. I asked the Minister for Trade and Customs for a full statement on the position, because it seemed at first sight strange that Ave should be supplying these materials to a potential enemy. When the matter was investigated it was found that Japan could secure supplies of zinc concentrates and lead from a number of other countries besides Australia. -irder. What is the connection between pig iron and the Loan Rill now before 1 he House? unfortunately, become altogether too wide, but since various matters have been raised on the one side, the other side must be permitted to answer them. able that what has for so long proved to be a popular story should be relinquished with reluctance by members of the present Government. As I have said, we learned that zinc concentrates could be obtained by Japan from several other countries, Burma being one of them. On the other hand, we found that we were getting from Japan articles which we could not get from any other country, articles which were essential for our defence preparations. These included machine tools, silk for parachutes, canvas tents, and khaki webbing for uniforms; there was also an offer of aeroplanes. 1 summoned representatives of the appropriate trade union and told them the story, and I am happy to say that the nnionists showed a good deal more sense in regard to the matter than have some That was the last we heard of it. There was a strike on the waterfront for three months on this issue. episode which took place last year. To is quite clear that the Government found itself, after the extraordinary performance of one of its Ministers this afternoon, in a very unpleasant predicament. Although the Government is seeking authority under this bill to raise £75,,000,000, very grave doubts existed in all parts of the House after the Minister for Labour and National Service had spoken as to whether the Government was in favour of the bill. Accordingly, it arranged for its most astute debater to present, with such sophistry aB he could muster, a case which would attempt to resolve the dilemma in which the Government found itself. He declared that no positive declaration had been made on this side of the House in support of the bill. That is completely false. The Leader of the Opposition made it perfectly clear, in the opening sentences of his speech, that we were entirely in favour of the Loan Bill to raise £75,000,000. We recognized that it was for the purpose of conducting the war. Having made that declaration, the Leader of the Opposition proceeded to direct attention to what he regarded as some of the basic weaknesses in the financial policy of the Government. Not one member on this side of the chamber expressed any opposition to the bill; but. on the other hand, a responsible Minister endeavoured to explain to us a misrepresentation of certain remarks which he had made publicly, and he offered thecorrect version in its stead.

223,Mr Holt,"I am referring to theexplanation which, was given by the Ministerf or Labour and National Service, I consider that it is appropriate to point out to the House that this alleged misrepresentation was not limited to the one newspaper from which he quoted. Such a respectable journal as the Brisbane Courier-Mail reported the Minister thusWc should not be asked to pay for the war afterwards by paying interest on any loans that are raised now. The Newcastle Morning Herald, which pays particular attention to industrial matters, reported on Monday, the 2nd March, that the Minister had saidIndustry was being concentrated and organized which meant that it got more and more into monopolistic hands. That was why he suggested that the Government take over basic war industries and organize them in the interests of the nation. Unfortunately, iu Cabinet he was in tlie minority. The next best course in seeing that workers were being protected against exploitation was to give the workers themselves some say in the management of industry and some say in the production process. In view of the fact that the LoanB ill has some bearing on the stability of our financial institutions, it is appropriate for me to quote from the Adelaide Advertiser a statement by the Minister upon the subject of the banksMr Ward said he had long held the opinion that we had too many banks and that the Commonwealth Bank was quite able to do the banking business. He had declared the Com moil wealth Bank a protected industry. Private banks were on the same footing as Hiiy other undertaking. -So that if the Minister was misreported -and .1 remind the House that this is not the first time that embarrassing ments by the Minister have had to be announced to this House as misrepresentations of what he had actually apparently a number of newspapers fell into the same error after taking notes of the same speech. But we are prepared to meet him on entirely different ground and take the explanation which he offered to the House as being what he actually said. That explanation, in effect, is this: Minister does not resist the proposition that we should pay interest on previous loans, or upon the £35,000,000 Loan, which is now being floated; but he is opposed to the payment of interest on any loans which may be raised in future. ilr. Holt. There can be no misunderstanding on that point, because the honourable member for Dalley went to considerable pains to explain that this is a basic feature of the platform of the Labour party. The honourable member for Riverina( Mr Langtry) will recall that a meeting in his electorate, the proceedings of which were reported in the press this morning, resolved that he should be asked to place before the Government, in an effective and determined manner, the opinion of that branch that interest should not be paid in future on moneys raised for war purposes. So there can be no doubt as to where the Minister stands, or where many members of the Government stand on this important proposal. I a,sked earlier whether the Government was in favour of this bill which the Treasurer presented to the House, and I say that there is some point in my question, because the Minister for Labour and National Service said, "" I am in favour of . paying interest on the £35,000,000 Liberty Loan, but on no future loans "". Yet the Government is now seeking authority to raise loans totalling £75,000,000. Can we assume that even if the Minister's colleagues are in favour of raising an additional £40,000,000 and paying interest on that sum, he is not in favour of it , and that once again he finds himself in fhe minority, as he was when he referred to the nationalization of industry. In an attempt to j u s t if y the Minister's position, the honourable member for Dalley propounded what was for all of us a most original conception of minisstateterial responsibility. Apparently, the traditional theory of ministerial responsibility, which has been observed for saidmany centuries, has been swept aside by this new doctrine that has been specially created to overcome the predicament of the Ministerf o r Labour and National Service. The new theory is that if a Minister finds himself committed to a decision of Cabinet and he disapproves The of that decision because it is not in conformity w i th the platform of the Labour party as laid down regularly at its conLiberty ferences, it is his bounden duty to denounce that decision publicly and to advocate adherence to the platform. That was seriously put forward to the House as a justification of the attitude of the Minister. If that he so, it will make a cabinet government a very difficult proposition in this country for a long time. It will make effective government in wiar-time by Cabinet an outright impossibility. That is the really serious feature of the situation revealed by this performance to-day. We are fighting for our very existence. enemy is attacking our shores. But we are not able to look with confidence to the contributions to future loans? They are Government for guidance. It is not able to reach agreement on basic matters of policy; and on that rests the whole future security of this Commonwealth. Honourable members opposite have a novel and revolutionary conception of the financing of the war. Even in Russia, to which so many honourable gentlemen opposite pledge their sentimental and personal attachment, a very handsome rate of interest is permitted on loans raised for the conduct of war. But in Australia we must be more extreme. The statement which was made this afternoon will have damaging repercussions, for both in its implications and its consequences it is tragic for the security of this country. This Government has denounced the proposal for finiincing the war by compulsory loans, taking from each individual according to his capacity to contribute to the war effort. It put the irresponsible manner at the present time. previous Government out of office because it adopted that policy, and so it has decided that the system of voluntary loans is the one to which it will adhere. Whence will the contributions from this loan come? It has been suggested that they will come partly from the big companies, despite the heavy inroad's of taxation upon their earnings. It will not be seriously suggested that they will come from what we in normal times describe as the moderately wellto-do and wealthy classes, because those sections are passing through a most painful period of adjustment. The fact that those people still have what on paper appears to be a very healthy income does not render the adjustment any the less painful for them, because over a period of years they have been accustomed to a certain living standard and are now compelled to adjust themselves discord in the community, namely, the in a matter of weeks to a drastically proposal of the Minister for Labour and [6] reduced living standard. While the voluntary principle remains, it will be extremely difficult to raise from this class substantial contributions for loans. Therefore, we must look to those elements in the community who to-day probably have more money, as the savings bank figures and the statistics relating to the purchase of conThe sumer goods show, than they ever had before. On what basis will they make asked to do it voluntarily. It is perhaps the first time in their lives that they have had a little nest egg to which they look for their future economic security, and naturally they want to do the patriotic thing on behalf of the country. Accordingly, they decide to put their money into the loan. The interest might be only 3 per cent., but to them that is neither here nor there. It is a small return on their capital. But when these people are told that the Government is opposed to the payment of interest on loans, they fear that the next step will be the confiscation of their money, and that the repayment of the principal will be repudiated. That will immediately destroy confidence and adversely affect the Government's prospects of securing substantial additional loan moneys. That is the accusation which we level against those members of the Government who talk in this loose and We say undeniably that they are destroying the confidence of the people in our financial institutions. All this talk about the private banks, interest from loans, confiscation of capital, and capital levies is having a most damaging and disastrous effect upon confidence. I ask the Treasurer to inform me whether it is a fact that there has been a significant "" run "" on some banks recently. People are showing a disposition to hoard their cash because of this fear of repudiation. The Minister for Labour and National Service and those who support him have done a great disservice to the country in raising this controversial issue at this juncture. I pass from that subject to what I believe is a more serious attempt to sow National Service that every member of the community should be reduced to what might be termed the ""lowest common denominator standard "". Very good arguments, based on principles of social .justice, might be adduced as to why every person should participate equally in the goods and services available in the community. academic proposal which one could usefully discuss in time of peace for hours. But when a responsible Minister, at a time when the country is battling for its existence, puts that forward seriously as a practical proposal to be put into operation, the result will be to create disunity, class hatred and class distrust. In the -present crisis, the country should be pulling together in perfect unity. Does the honourable gentleman put forward that proposal seriously, believing it to be a practicable proposition or does he propound it because he knows that it will have a very popular appeal among some of the less informed sections of the community? I shall tackle bim on both propositions. If he made the suggestion, not believing that it is practicable, he is deliberately provoking uncertainty, disunity and discord at a time when such developments should be avoided. But if he seriously believes that the proposal will be given practical effect, does he speak as a member of the Government and enunciate government policy, or is he once again expressing a minority opinion from which his colleagues will openly dissociate themselves? In any event, he creates uncertainty and dissension, and so does a disservice to the community in this crisis. Whichever way one looks at it this Minister is able to do what he likes. He can publicly and privately disagree with the majority of his colleagues in a way which will appeal to certain elements of the community. I do not regard him as irresponsible or ignorant. I think he is playing a clever, shrewd game, from his own point of view, because he is obviously playing for the support of the militant industrial unions. We have got out of the habit of speaking of "" Com"" unions; the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) and the Minister for Supply and Development ( Mr Beasley) at one stage organized to destroy those elements, but to-day we all are Mr Bolt. brothers and cannot use the expression "" Com"" since it may suggest disrespect for our ally overseas. The Minister for Labour and National Service is anxious to secure the support of the trade unions, and, to that end, is ready to go to the lengths of raising most conThat is a delightful troversial issues. The people of this country and the Opposition have given to the Government, from the time it took office almost up to the present moment, the most generous measure of support.

231,Mr Holt,"We are trying to debate. debate these proposals calmly and logically and free of personalities. The Opposition now feels that it must challenge these proposals because it sees, as the country sees, that whilst in time of war this Government has the authority to take the measures necessary for the protection of the Commonwealth, it has neither mandate nor authority to use as a cloak the circumstances of war in order to implement radical proposals which have been traditional planks of the Lahour platform. ""We challenge the Government on that. Some members of the Government, a minority, are using the opportunity, which feeling in the community and the circumstances of war give to them, to introduce a socialistic programme, even when some of the features of that programme disadvantage the war effort. We ask the Government to consider this matter seriously. Can Ministers from their experience of the funclioning of democracy since the outbreak of war believe that it can function effectively in war-time unless there is hasic unity on major proposals? They must consider that this is no time to make mistakes on matters of fundamental policy. There are in this chamber 60 or more members who have the same basic ideas as to how the war should be conducted, but the tragedy is that those members are not able, by some means or other, to pool their goodwill and unity of interests and policy in order to ensure this country against aggression and invasion. .1. -ay with all sincerity that until we pool the best administrative brains of this Parliament in order to establish the most effective government possible, we shall not be doing our duty to the public who sent us here and to the men who are risking their lives for us. Por that reason I ask the Government to ponder its responsibilities, not only to this generation, but also to the generations to come , otherwise the charge levelled against it will be that at the time when the country demanded our best the Government was not prepared to give that best, but preferred to play politics up to the hilt so as to preserve its own political advantages. Honourable members opposite have struck a new "" high "" in lowness. On the pretext of speaking on a loan bill, they have made an attack on the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr Ward). If this bill had not come before the House, the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) intended to move the adjournment to discuss whether or not that Minister should continue in the Cabinet. By their conduct in this debate, Opposition members have proved not that the Minister should resign, but rather, their own unfitness to represent the people in the Parliament at this grave time. I think it was the honourable member for Fawkner( Mr Holt) who said that there was no substance in the criticism of the shipment of pig iron to Japan. I shall not discuss that matter, but I shall direct attention to something else. While the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison) was reciting to the House what was said by the Minister for Labour and National Service -AS member for East Sydney in 1936, namely, that he would not fight against German workers in a war, I had lively recollections that in the same year the right honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies), when he returned from Germany, greatly praised Hitler's administration and said that what Australia needed was a leader, which is the English translation of "" Fuhrer "". -Order! The question before the House is whether this bill should be read a second time. I shall disallow any further references to persons. said that it would be a bad thing if the Commonwealth Bank was to be the only bank to survive this war.

I believe that the division would be in the ratio of 97 per cent, for and 3 per cent, against. Included in that 3 per cent, would be the members of the Opposition and their friends. Some suggestion has heen made in this debate that private members who have been appointed to assist certain Ministers in their administrative work are receiving large amounts in remuneration for such service. That suggestion was made by the honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) among others. The fact is that they are not receiving any remuneration. I have a most lively recollection that the committee system under which certain honourable gentlemen are receiving fees was introduced and sponsored by the present Opposition when in office. I am happy to say that I am not, and have not been, a member of any committee. member is now introducing party politics. bers of all parties in the Parliament are benefiting by the payment of fees to committee members. Two ideas have been specially emphasized by honourable gentlemen opposite in connection with this bill. The first is that terest to the honourable gentleman's the Government's financial policy tends to inflation; and the second is that the principles enunciated by the Minister for Labour and National Service are communistic. The honourable member for Kooyong( Mr Menzies) described the Minister's speech as "" a new communist manifesto "". In doing so the honourable gentleman was playing the game of party politics at its hardest. As to the suggestion of inflation, I remind the House that this Government is being advised by the identical financial floated, namely, 2-J per cent, for the short advisers who advised the previous Government. Honourable gentlemen opposite have done a great deal, by their utterances to-day, to disturb the financial stability of the country. As to the suggestion that the speech of the Minister for Labour and National Service was, in effect, a new communist manifesto I say frankly to honourable gentlemen opposite that I do not know, nor do I care, whether the communist system is good or bad; but I am convinced that the Communists of Soviet Russia, in being prepared to die for their system of government, have rendered a great service to Australia. We ought to be most thankful for what they have done. patriots in Russia, but traitors in Australia. honourable member for Swan recognized the Soviet Communists as patriots? are greatly indebted to the people of Soviet Russia for the splendid way in which they have maintained their resistance to aggression. It is probably true, as has been stated by Sir Stafford Cripps, the new Leader of the Government in the British House of Commons, that the war will be won primarily because of the magnificent stand of Russia against the German forces. ing myself to this bill, I begin by assuring the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) that I intend to support the measure. I listened with inspeech, but, at its conclusion, I was unable to tell whether he favoured the bill or not. Parliament, of course, has already approved of the raising of this loan, for it was envisaged in the budget proposals agreed to last year. I believe that the people of Australia will wholeheartedly support the loan, for they are anxious that a maximum war effort shall be made, and are fully prepared to foot the bill. I assume that the interest rates on this loan will not be higher than those applicable to the Liberty Loan now being period and 3^ per cent, for the long period. We all would be interested to know the proportions of applications for the long and short periods respectively in the Liberty Loan. It is gratifying to know that interest rates to-day are just about half what they were on loans raised during the last war. No other costs in connection with",51,Wanted £2 000 00 0 Ina Week

251,Mr Jolly (Lilley) [9.7],"In addressthe war have shown such a large percentage reduction. In this respect, Australia is in step with Great Britain. We are apt to overlook the fact that persons who invest their money in war loans are accepting a greater reduction of income than persons who are assisting in any other war activity. member believe that interest rates should be even lower than they are? able. I am intrigued by the proposal of certain honourable gentlemen opposite that money should be provided for future war loans interestfree. Why should a person who invests £1,000 in a war loan be called upon to make his money available without interest, whilst other persons who invest similar amounts in property or in business undertakings may still receive fairly substantial returns in rents or dividends? I am aware, of course, that the security in respect of war loans is better than in respect of either property or business, but that, surely, is no reason why persons should be denied any interest on money invested in war loans. It would be absurd, in present circumstances, to ask people to provide money for war loans interest-free. The time has passed in this country for talking; it is high time that we were acting to the very utmost of OUT energy. I am not so much concerned, at the moment, as to how the money is to be raised as I am as to how it is to be expended. Our difficulty is not in raising money, but in spending it speedily and wisely to provide the needs of war. In making that statement, I do not criticize members of the present Government. I appreciate the difficulties that have to be faced. I do not think that any one in Australia to-day is satisfied with the nature and extent of our war effort. Much has been done, but a great deal more will have to be done in the future. I am afraid, however, that there is a tendency in some directions for us to spread ourselves too much. At this serious stage of the war, it is futile for us to be devoting our energies to activities which cannot be completed for twelve to eighteen months. We must put first things first. This is no time, for example, to be spending money on permanent buildings. We must be satisfied with temporary accommodation. We are too apt to spend our money lavishly in constructing permanent buildings. A single bomb may blow some of these buildings out of existence in a few moments. It would be far better for us to concentrate our spending on items of our war programme that are urgently needed at the moment. As a father who has sons in the services, I know that what our men at the front require are more planes, more guns and more ammunition. I agree with the view that our fighting services, and particularly the men in the front line, should receive greater consideration than they have received hitherto. I believe that the people of Australia would stand behind anything the Government did in this connection. It is urgent that planes, arms and equipment shall be provided with the least possible delay. Any person who impedes or obstructs the war effort should be regarded as a traitor and dealt with accordingly whether he be employer or employee. There has been too much interference with our war effort, and the Government should deal severely with those who adopt obstructive tactics. I urge the importance of giving our men who enlist in the forces a far more intensive training than they have received in the past. I know from personal experience that many of these young men have been discouraged and disheartened because they have not had practical training. In the present grave hour I hope that the military authorities will see that improvement is effected in that direction. The Government should be prepared to take action in order to curtail unnecessary expenditure. There cannot be any support for the degree to which pleasure and enjoyment are being sought and obtained in Australia to-day. It is the duty of every Australian to concentrate on the war effort. The Government should follow the lead set by the Premier of South Australia, and prohibit horse racing in the Commonwealth. The only task that confronts Australia to-day is the winning of the war. I am satisfied",52,Wanted £2 000 00 0 Ina Week

A good deal has been said to-day as to the manner in which revenue should be obtained. It would appear that only two methods are considered suitable-taxa tion and borrowing. Surely there are other means! We must discard the orthodox, because the conditions are not normal. national life. I remind the House that last, year the present Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden), who was then Treasurer, told us that the primary and secondary industries of this country had produced goods to a value of £925,000,000 in the previous twelve-months period and that, for the financial year ending the 30th June, 1942, the value of the production would be £1,000,000,000. That represents the national income of Australia ; and every £1 can be multiplied by ten in order to measure the national credit. Surely, then, we can expand the issue of credit through the Commonwealth Bank in order to win the war! I shall read to the House a short extract from the report of the royal commission that was appointed to inquire into the monetary and banking systems of Australia:The Commonwealth Bank. . . can lend to the governments or to others in a variety of ways, and it can even make money available to governments or to others free of any charge. When Mr Justice Napier, the chairman of the commission, was asked to explain that statement, he said that it meant what it said, namely, that the Commonwealth Bank could lend money for the construction of public buildings, &c, and that there would be no need to charge interest or even to repay the principal amount! A few days ago, in this House, as a It abolished protest against the parrot cry ""equality of sacrifice"", I suggested that every member should be placed on a soldier's pay of 6s. a day, in addition to keep and clothing. I have since received many complimentary letters, as well as a good deal of criticism. How can there be equality of sacrifice if we occupy easy seats while the soldier boys are enduring dispense with hypocrisy. I now make the further suggestion that all the necessaries of life be rationed and issued on the coupon system. If those who are privileged to sit in this national Parliament were to set an example to the men who are giving their lives, there would be no doubt as to the issue. Instead of that, what do we find? In the newspapers, there are protests against the economy plan put forward by the Government, and in this House there We are in a struggle for our are protests against the reduction of the rate of interest to 4 per cent. Why should any interest at all be paid at a time like this? Mr J. A. L. Gunn, chartered accountant, giving evidence before the Parliamentary Committee on Profits, said, "" I am afraid of a curtailment of essential production. Some companies prefer to spend money rather than let the Government get it "" . Yet this is war-time! Before the war started, we were told that our Allies, China and Russia, and our antagonists Germany and Japan, were bankrupt. They have expanded the national credit, and look at what they have -achieved! We have to learn to do likewise.

But I hope that this will be the last occasion on which we shall vote to borrow money during the progress of this war, and even after its termination. We have complete power over men, money and material, and with them we must win the war. Only a small percentage of our ablest-bodied men can be placed in the firing line. Behind them are the skilled technicians in the shops and factories, who manufacture the lethal weapons of war; and behind those again there is another section of the population producing food. Napoleon said that an army marches on its stomach. Every army fights on its stomach.

Equip and. train your men, and they will do what you want them to do in order to defend this country."" Has any one ever thought of what would be likely to happen if we were under the domination of the Japanese? I spent half a dozen years in the country around Thursday Island, Normanton, Croydon and Burke town and I can visualize what would happen. The sampans would creep round the coast, the Japanese would land and send out their scouts; there would be a raid on the blacks' camp, following which every female from twelve years upwards would be put on board the lugger.

I lost my wife and two daughters some little time ago, and I say that I would rather them dead than that I should see them fall into the hands of such an enemy. Eor men the triumph of the Japanese would mean opium and dope, mutilation, captivity and murder. For the women it would mean violation, defilement, and captivity, from which there could be only one escape. I want the Australian men and women assembled here to-day to face this reality, and not bother whether the rate of interest should be 4J per cent, or 4 i per cent.

It does not specify how the money is to be raised. It might be as a part of an ordinary loan flotation on the market, or it might be by short-term loan from the Commonwealth Bank. Some of the speeches made to-day were no more than political posturing and, indeed, some of them contained a large measure of piffle. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Fadden) has been very generous and decent in his treatment of the subjects brought before the House, and some constructive criticism was offered by the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr Spooner) and the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly); but several of the speeches this afternoon were apparently delivered only for the purpose of gaining publicity or some political advantage. The Leader of the Opposiof expressing, on behalf of some disgruntled members of his own party, sentiments which he does not entirely endorse. Whatever the reason, we have been treated to an exchange of 'recriminations. It is all very well to say that the attack upon the Minister for Labour and We regard the prosNational Service was not premeditated. Before the House met, the corridors were buzzing with talk of what was going to be said about the Minister. What is the position in regard to his statement? Honourable members opposite accept newspaper statements only when they suit them. In this instance, a newspaper reported the honourable gentleman as having made a certain statement, and he was attacked this afternoon before he was given .an opportunity to make an explanation in this House, which is the proper place in which to do so. Even after he had denied the statements attributed to him, honourable members opposite went on saying exactly the same things as they had said before he made thedenial. At a time when the country is in a critical position, an afternoon has been devoted to an exchange of recriminations. If members of the Opposition had not begun this tirade of abuse, we should not have been treated to this exhibition, but they could not resist seeking a political advantage on the strength of some remarks reported in the press, whether accurately or not. Having embarked upon the attack, they found thai the Minister for Labour and National Service was able to play the game better than they could. They found that he is quite as good at personal recrimination as they are. The whole incident rather reflects upon the political judgment of the Opposition.

Well, the Prime Minister has made a statement, and if he had not. done so, I should have felt quite confident to do it on his behalf. The Government is an honourable one, composed of honest men, and when it says that interest will be paid on money borrowed, it will keep its promise, just as honest men do. Although there is difference of opinion on the subject of the payment of interest, there is not one man on this side of the House who would say that this Government should be a party bo the repudiation of one pennyworth of interest or principal in respect of commitments entered into by this or any previous Government. If honourable members opposite wanted to damage the prospects of the loan, they could not have gone a better way about it than by voicing these inferences and innuendoes. The best answer I can give to the suggestion that anything which has been done by a member of the Government has damaged the prospects of the loan, is that there were 8,500 applications in respect of the loan to-day, and three out of every four were from people who were investing less than £200. Just before dinner the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr Harrison), when most of the members of his own party had left the chamber, delivered a violent speech calling upon the Prime Minister to answer this charge and that. He spoke as if the Prime Minister, whose job at this time is in his office, should be present to answer every challenge which he and other honourable members opposite choose to throw out in order to obtain a little personal publicity. The Leader of the Opposition, in discussing the financial administration of the Government, referred to the short-term indebtedness. When right honourable member for Kooyong was Prime Minister, and the present Leader of the Opposition was Treasurer, there were times when loans were not fully subscribed, but they did not shout from the housetops that bank credit was being used to make up the difference. I have heard from this side of the House talk of the Government Mr Chifley. begging the private banks to subscribe to the loan. People who speak in that fashion do not know what they are talking about. This Government has not gone begging to the private banks. 3 can assure honourable members that the private banks have been very small contributors to the previous cash loan, or to this one. That is no reflection on their patriotism, or on their desire to help. It is due to the fact that the regulations under which they operate do not leave them any surplus which they can invest in loans, and require tliem to obtain the permission of the Commonwealth Bank before subscribing. putting in money at a nominal rate of interest. Mr .CHIFLEY -The surplus assets which come into their hands as a result of the expansion of credit are being put into a. special deposit account, which carries a rate of interest that only just covers administrative expenses. We have been warned of the dangers of inflation. Is there any man in this House foolish enough to think that our present rate of expenditure, which could not be anticipated six months ago, when different circumstances obtained, can be met out of taxation? Certainly it cannot, no matter what rate of taxation be imposed. When it is said that the deficit should be met from loans, I reply that the Prime Minister and I consulted with those persons who are supposed to know what the public can lend, and the loans that are now being put on the market, and those that will be floated in the future, are based upon their reports. Regarding the financing of the war, the Government in a period of three months imposed additional taxes estimated to the yield £50,000,000 per annum. Does any honourable member venture to assert that that is not a genuine attempt to -make the nation pay as far as possible for the war? Eveni f the previous Government had remained in office, it could not have carried on without the assistance of bank loans. It would be nonsense to say otherwise. WhilstI agree with the statements of the Leader of the",56,Wanted £2 000 00 0 Ina Week
265,Mr Anthony,"They are actuallyOpposition. regarding the dangers of inflation, I remind him that the Government has taken almost every step, with the exception of that mentioned by the honourable member for Robertson ( Mr provide that measure of control, and I Spooner), in order to safeguard against it. The honourable member advocated the introduction of individual rationing in the community. When a government is utilizing bank credit up to the point where all of the national resources are involved and all man-power is engaged, it can no longer, with safety, expand credit. It has virtually reached the end of its tether in that respect. But these times are not normal; they are extraordinary. When a government has utilized bank credit beyond that point, it must impose stiff control so that the inflation which we fear will not occur. I challenge any one r.o 9ay that the Government has not introduced safe measures of control. Differences of opinion may exist about the incidence of taxation, but people often talk very loosely about financing the war from taxation. When I introduced the budget last year, I spent a busy time replying to requests by honourable members on both sides of the chamber for the exemption of certain articles from the sales tax, or for a reduction of the wartime (company) tax, because it would destroy the incentive of many businesses to contribute to a maximum war effort. Incidentally, these references to "" incentive "" are a reflection on a number of people engaged in industry. Some honourable members opposite have declared that unless companies can make ample profits, they have no incentive to expand production for the purpose of assisting in the conduct of the war. That is a reflection upon the patriotism of a number of people who accord their political support to the United Australia party and the United Country party. The constant references to inflation during this debate were made purely for political purposes. If Australia's war effort continues to expand, the expenditure which to-day is regarded by some as evidence of inflation will doubtless seem comparatively small. We must keep our feet on the ground, and realize that, because, the situation is abnormal, we must dn unusual things. Those unusual things may have bad consequences if we fail to exercise proper economic control. The Government is endeavouring, to the best of its ability, to think that its efforts have met with reasonable success. In making that statement. I do not overlook or discredit the measures that were taken by previous governments in this connection. When the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr Spender) was Treasurer, he introduced a number of measures which were very creditable to him, in order to effect control in certain directions. I do not for one moment claim that this Government alone possesses a broad national outlook. I realize that we all are engaged in this fight and I hope that we all have the same objective. But our democracy does not receive a very good advertisement when the representatives of the people in Parliament engage in violent recriminations, and give emphasis to material that might, create a false impression. For some hours, this House has listened to unfortunate personal inveotive. In attempts to bolster up a case against a Minister, extracts have heen quoted from speeches that were delivered fifteen years ago. My only pleasure this afternoon arose from the fact that some one did not quote from past speeches by the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), because there would have been such a mass of contradiction that every one would have been bewildered. I am in no dilemma regarding the position of the Government. An honest man has only to say, as the representative of an honest government, that we shall see that the prospectus which we issue is kept as regards the payment of interest and the repayment of principal. If later we are again in opposition, we shall try to see that, the promise is kept. No supporter of the Government would say that he does not agree fully with that undertaking. Some difference of opinion might exist about the rate of interest that is payable on these loans. Some honourable members on this side of the chamber might consider that the rate should be i per cent.; others might favour 1 per cent, or l i per cent. Still others may believe that no interest at all should be paid. Before to-day, people have considered that interest was an undesirable feature in the life of a community. Every one is entitled to his opinion, even if that opinion be that interest should be nominal, and should cover only the cost of administration. Buti f the Government and the majority of the members of the Labour party decide that, as a matter of policy, the Government should offer interest at 3 per cent., every member of the party will abide loyally by that decision. Eveni f one does not personally agree with it, that does not mean that he favours repudiation and confiscation. All such talk is a mere invention of the Opposition, despite this critical period in our history. Honourable members opposite expressed their horror that the confidence of investors should be destroyed, but many of the speeches that they delivered this afternoon were calculated to arouse serious misgivings among the public. Personally, I do not think that the people believe them; otherwise, there would not have been 8,500 applicants for the loan to-day. I have participated in this debate only for the purpose of replying to loose talk about inflation and the necessity for adequate control. I deprecate many of the utterances that have been made to-day, I was delighted to hear two constructive suggestions by the honourable member for Robertson and the honourable member for Lilley( Mr Jolly). member for Robertson advocated the introduction of rationing, the necessity for which I do not dispute. I realize the possibilities, and the action that might have to be taken to deal with the position. The honourable member for Lilley replied most effectively to the contention that interest should not be paid on loans. As an illustration, he said that one man might save £1,000, which he would invest in the purchase of a house or business that would return to him 3 per cent., 4 per cent, or 5 per cent, per annum. Another man, by working extremely hard, might save £1,000, which he proceeds to lend to his country for the purpose of conducting the war. Some persons contend that he should not be paid any interest upon his investment, but the honourable member for Lilley showed that that man is just as entitled to some Mr Chifley. reward for his thrift and for his patriotism in lending his savings to the Government for the purpose of defending the country as is the other man who invested his money in property. That is getting down to cold hard facts. All the other talk in the debate was loose, largely because it did not deal with realities. Unfortunately, there was a premeditated decision to launch an attack upon the Minister for Labour and National Service. was asked as to whether the published statement by the Minister was accurate. Even after the honourable gentleman had denied the accuracy of the published statement, the debate continued. That convinced me that some honourable members opposite were determined to attack the Minister. His denial mattered nothing to them. WhilstI realize that we are engaged in politics, I warn honourable members opposite that we can overdo politics at the present time. The, responsibility for the recriminations that have taken place to-day rests with the Opposition, because it launched this attack. Honourable members opposite could have asked the Minister at question-time whether he had made that statement, and the Minister could have given his explanation. If the Opposition did not The honourable believe him, it would have regarded him as a liar. If it did believe him, there would be nothing more to be said on the subject. Certainly there was no necessity for introducing side issues and implying that some Ministers were not in favour of meeting, not the Government's obligations, but the nation's obligations. Those statements brought no credit to this Parliament. Perhaps we all are at fault; but honourable members should not forget that in the life of a democracy it is important that the public should have respect, not necessarily for a party, but for the Parliament. Everything that we do to destroy that respect deals a deathblow at democracy itself. Question resolved in the affirmative.

Excise Tariff Items2 ( N ) and 11 (c). These amendments do not involve anv increase of rates of duty, but are merely alterations of the wording of the items to assist in their administration. In respect of Excise Item2 ( N ) and its counterpart Customs Tariff Item3 ( F ) , which relate to methylated spirits, the by-Jaw proviso in each case previously read "" for power purposes as prescribed by Departmental By-laws "". On this wording relief from duty could only be given in instances of methylated spirits being used for power purposes, but it ha? been demonstrated that certain other users of methylated spirits can present reasonable claims for by-law concession. For instance, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research has introduced a new method of shrinking wool, involving the use of methylated spirits. Accordingly, the restrictive incidence of both the Customs and Excise By-law Items has been removed. With regard to Excise Tariff Item 11 ( c ) as it is at present worded, some doubt' exists amongst technical people as to whether certain types of petrol substitutes are dutiable under the item, as was originally intended. Item 11 ( c ) has been so amended as to leave no doubt that such petrol substitutes are classifiable thereunder. The Metropolitan Gas Company of Melbourne has introduced a form of coal-gas as a distillate. It is felt that it should be included in the dutiable range. There are no other alterations. The Government regrets that the opportunity ro discuss these tariff proposals has not presented itself. importance of a f u l l discussion, but I hope that the Opposition w ill bear with the Government and validate these items in order that another opportunity may IKS given to the Housef o r discussion.

I would add that the investigations hy the Minister assisting the Treasurer and inquiries instituted by myself have revealed that there were in fact a certain number of munitions contractors who were obtaining undue profits. Very largely this arose through opportunities for charging man-hour rates calculated on a skilled labour basis, whereas in some cases wages paid were for semi-skilled or process workers operating the machines. The investigations are proceeding and, whilst the transactions of a number of firms have been examined, there are others requiring further investigation. Until the investigations have been completed, it will not be possible to answer questions as to the undue profits which may have been made and the amounts of refund which should be demanded. The machine hour rates have now been fixed, as from the 1st January, as follows: (1) There will be an allowance of 5s. for each hour worked to be divided into two parts, 3s. repreand I know that censorship instructions senting wages, and 2s. overhead charges. If the wages actually paid be more or less than 33. an hour, the rate will be adjusted up or down accordingly. (2) The amount to be allowed to the contractor for depreciation of the machine tools will be limited to the rental actually paid by him. It will therefore be impossible for him to make any profit out of the rental. (3) These modifications in the allowance and rental apply to all deliveries of machine and tool equipment made on and after the 1st January, 1942, irrespective of the date on which the order was placed. This will not penalize employers who have not abused the rate by the employment of unskilled or junior labour, but will enable the department to deal with contractors who have done so. I think honourable members will agree that the sole purpose of censorship is to preserve the security of the country, and, unless censorship can be justified on the grounds of internal security, it has no place in a democratic system. Indeed, I remember bhat when the present Opposition was in office, certain members of the present Government very rightly indicated in general terms that censorship should be used only for that purpose. I asked the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) last week whether he would lay upon the table of the House all written instructions to newspapers or broadcasting companies, censoring or giving instructions for censorship of any particular matter, so that private members of this House, as custodians of, the rights of the people, might know that these instructions were solely directed to security and to no other purpose. I further suggested to the Prime Minister that, if he was not prepared to do that, he should suggest means by which private members could have some say as to what should or should not be censored, so that they would be watchdogs of democracy to see that censorship was used for its proper purpose. I have had some experience in respect of security cannot be made public, because to make them so would be to defeat one of the purposes for which censorship is instituted. But it seems to me that members of this House are entitled to know those instructions, and the mere tabling of them should not mean that they would be available for publication in the newspapers. In fact the press has them now, a and private members have no access to them at all. I see no reason why they should not have the right of access to all instructions which go to newspapers and broadcasting companies indicating what should or should not be reported or spoken about. has discovered this right since ceasing to be a Minister. Prime Minister to permit me to develop my argument. I do not wish to be controversial. I am concerned solely with the fundamental rights of democracy.

277,Mr Spender,"No. I ask theto go to the Chief Publicity Censor and have the various instructions made available to him. SoI am not quarrelling with the access given to representatives of the Opposition on the council, but I am directing my attention to this matter, because I have reason to believe that censorship instructions are not always concerned with national security. The first matter I desire to mention is the resignation of Mr Rorke, the Deputy Censor in New South Wales. Lie was a censor of some ability and had experience in the last war. I think £ am correct in saying he was a censor in New South Wales up to two or three weeks ago, when he resigned. What is behind the resignation I cannot speak about, but I do desire to have an answer lo this question: Is it a fact that Mr secondly, that there should be no referRorke submitted to the newspapers an explanation of his side of the question and chat its publication was prohibited by the Censor? If so, on what grounds ? This is a was to be nothing broadcast to detract vital matter. It seems extraordinary that a man who was a censor in this country during the last war, and has been a censor for two years during this war, should have been precluded-if I am correctly informed-fro m expressing his view as to the grounds for the resignation which was finally forced upon him. ship; it is suppression. a matter which should concern private members on both sides of the House. If it bo, as suggested to me, that Mr Rorke took exception two months ago to censorship instructions given to him on the ground that they had nothing to do with security matters, but were designed to prevent political criticism, and if , from mission should conduct its commentaries that time onwards, his position became untenable to him, so that, finally, he had no alternative but to resign, the House should demand an inquiry. I am not dealing at the moment with the merits of the case. I desire to know specifically whether a censorship instruction was Rorke subject to censorship, and if, in fact, all of his statement but two or three lines was suppressed. The question is whether a democratic government, in a time of war, is taking steps to prevent [7] complete freedom of criticism of what is being done. I ask the Prime Minister to give me an answer to my questions either this evening or as early as possible. Another matter touching the censorship in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Commission has caused me concern. In the Senate the Minister for Information (Senator Ashley) was asked whether instructions had been given to the commission which in effect directed the commission how it should express itself. I now ask the Prime Minister, specifically, whether it is a fact that instructions were given, either directly or indirectly, by Ministers, to t h e Australian Broadcasting Commission, first, that there should be uo reference to Mr Churchill in the overseas broadcasts; ence to the totality of the war, that is, that the Pacific war was part and parcel of a total war; and, thirdly, that there from the proposition that the main and vital centre of the war at present was the Pacific? honourable member ask his questions during question time? habit of asking many questions, and this is the first time that I have spoken on the motion for the adjournment of the House; but these are vital matters. I do not make any challenge in respect of the merits of the third question. I am asking these specific questions because a general question was asked of the Minister for Information who, in his reply, stated in a general way that no instruction had been given at any time as to how the Australian Broadcasting Comor its announcements. There was a further statement that an instruction had been given by the previous Government to prevent political criticism.

The article was signed by the secretary of the Northern Collieries Limited, Mr a small remuneration that it is impossible Gregory Forster. I should like to know what possible objection could have been taken to the publication of that article? Yet it was rejected by the State censorship authorities. If we are reduced to this kind of thing, I say to the Prime Minister, with great respect, that there is more than a little ground for the suspicion that the censorship is being used in this country for other than legitimate censorship purposes. I do not desire to make a provocative speech, but if the facts are as I have said, I ask that the whole question be remitted to a committee representative of private members on both sides of the House. Speaking as a member of the Advisory War Council, I , of course, have had an opportunity to see the instructions that have been issued, but in a democracy it is not too much to ask that, as the newspaper authorities are allowed to see copies of instructions, it should be permissible for private members of the Parliament also to see them. In this way they can determine whether our democracy is being preserved, or whether criticism is being stifled for ulterior purposes. too wish to make a reference to the preservers of democracy. I bring to the notice of the Prime Minister certain difficulties concerning the call-up of men for the Militia, and the volunteering of men for the Australian Imperial Force. Some time ago it was proposed that a rent allowance should be granted to soldiers in the forces, but the matter seems to have dropped out of sight. Many married men are now being called up for definite service, but no provision has been made for a rent allowance for them. Some of the men have been in receipt of high salaries or wages, but have had to enter camp under financial conditions which, unless remedied, will destroy their home life and make it impossible for them to provide educational facilities for their children. Men who have been paying fairly high rents to landlords, or are meeting substantial instalments on the purchase of their own regard to hire-purchase agreements, are receiving, as members of the forces, such for them to meet their various obligations. Family life is the rock on which this nation stands, and if it should be submerged, our democracy will not be preserved. The Government, in my view, is not meeting its responsibilities to the men who are being called up, and I ask the Prime Minister to give' this matter his immediate attention with the object of providing the proposed rent allowance. I direct the attention of the Prime Minister( Mr Curtin) and the appropriate Minister to the lack of preparation to meet air raids in the Australian Capital Territory. Since Darwin was bombed and the first impact of war on Australia was felt a fortnight ago, on« would expect that a Government with its head-quarters in the capital city of Australia would have taken the necessary precautions in order to ensure that, in the event of an air raid, the administrative facilities would not be impaired to any appreciable extent. So far as I have been able to learn, however, the Government has continued to operate as though Japan had not struck, and on the assumption that this city is inviolate, instead of being, as it is, only 80 or 90 miles from the sea-coast, off which bombers could be launched from an aircraft carrier and be engaged in a raid here within about 50 minutes. Important though the provision of shelters may be, it is, perhaps, of minor importance compared with the security of the documents of the Commonwealth. So far as I have been able to ascertain, not one thing has so far been done in order to preserve the very important documents in the various administrative quarters. Photostats have not been taken, a3 they have been by banking institutions and business firms, and sent for security inland, far from the coast-line. The Government is in a state of hopeful bliss, evidently believing that we may escape the impact of attack by the enemy. It has the duty and the responsibility of attempting to safeguard",81,Engineering Works Munitions Production Shop Committees Citymutuallife Assurance Society Limited Policy Of W R Archibald

Such a contingency is not at all unlikely. I suggest that the Government take time by the forelock, and act immediately in order to see that at least the important documents, without which it would be extremely difficult to carry on tbe Government, shall be placed in such a position that there will be no possibility of their destruction by aircraft, or that duplicates of them shall be made. Throughout Parliament House to-day, the doors were plastered with notices stating that, in the event of an air raid, very quickly by whoever is responsible, those who are in the building shall leave Parliament House and "" take to the bush "". What a nice picture would be presented by the Prime Minister and the whole of the Cabinet seeking shelter under rose bushes in the parliamentary gardens! That is the only place in which they could shelter. In this matter, I am not looking for any publicity. The whole of my remarks can be censored, if that be thought necessary. It is a fact that no provision has been made for the safety of the Administration, the staff, or any member of Parliament. So far as I have been able to see, no provision has been made for the safety of any of the residents of Canberra. I have not seen a single trench. If it exists, it must be in a back garden. Who is responsible for that? To-day, I asked the Minister for Home Security( Mr Lazzarini) a question on the subject. I assumed that he was charged with responsibility for home security, but he very politely replied that could have placed all of the details before such responsibility is vested in the Department of the Interior. Probably the Minister for the Interior Collings), if he were asked to comment, would tell us something else. The fact is that the enemy bombed Darwin a fortnight ago. Goodness knows when a bombing attack may he made, not only in this Territory, but also on points on the eastern sea-board. We have to remember that we are only 90 miles from where an aircraft carrier may be waiting to launch an attack upon us. I submit to the Prime Minister, the Minister for Home Security, and other Mr Anthony. Ministers, that the matter is one which affects not only the persona i safety of members of this Parliament, but also the positions that they hold in the parliamentary machinery for the government of Australia in its hour of crisis. The Government has the responsibility of seeing that adequate measures are taken., not only for the preservation of records, but also for the safety of the members of"" this Parliament and the residents of Canberra. If a similar state of affairs existed in Sydney or Melbourne, I could direct my criticism at the State authorities. In this Capital Territory, no one is responsible except the federal authorities. The position needs to be remedied because the enemy does not give more than a few minutes' notice of his intention to attack. The longest notice that could be given of a bombing attack on this city would probably be 50 minutes, if the enemy were lying off the coast. I therefore urge the Prime Minister to take whatever steps are necessary to meet the position. appreciate the statement that has been made in regard to machine tools by the Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin), but am disappointed with the meagre details that it contains. This matter was first raised by me and by other honourable members particularly the honourable member for Dalley( Mr Rosevear) over three months ago. Inquiry into it has been made by three departments. Cost investigators of the Munitions Department have investigated it fully, and the Minister. The Department of Home Security also has been conducting an (Senator inquiry since December last, when a special investigation was instituted; and on behalf of the Parliamentary Committee on War Expenditure, experts have been engaged on it for some considerable time. That committee has presented reports dealing with specific details, and showing that in certain instances the profits have been higher than 60 per cent. The comment of the experts is that some of the profits have been fantastic. These details are available, and should be placed before the House at the earliest possible",82,Engineering Works Munitions Production Shop Committees Citymutuallife Assurance Society Limited Policy Of W R Archibald
290,Mr Morgan (Reid) [10.37],"Imoment, particularly as the gentleman who instituted the system is still in charge of machine tool production. While inquiries are being conducted he is, in effect, under a cloud. There is considerable disquiet in the whole of the munitions industry in regard to the supply of machine tools, and particularly the activities of the director and his associates in connection with machine tool production. This is one of the greatest bottlenecks in our war effort. It is holding up production, and causing a complete sense of frustration among, not only the workers, but also many of the manufacturers. I hope that the Minister will see that no facts are suppressed, and will issue definite instructions for a full disclosure to be made to him in order that he may make a report to the House as .'-arly as possible and thus enable the posistate over the air that ultimately the tion to be cleaned up. I am perfectly satisfied that when the facts become known this House wall consent to the setting up of a select committee, or even a royal commission, to investigate the control of machine tools and the activities of those who are concerned in their production. Several weeks ago, a dispute occurred at the Aircraft Factory, Lidcombe, as the result of which certain men were dismissed. They were members of a product-ion committee which had been set up in the industry in order to deal with inefficiency and production lag in that particular aircraft undertaking. When suggestions were proffered to the management with the object of rectifying certain matters that had come under their notice, the leaders were dismissed and other members of the committee were disrated. Many men on wages amounting to £10, £1.2 and £14 a week were being kept in a uate of idleness, contrary to their own wishes. They thought that it was high time for the matter to be dealt with properly, consequently they set up a production committee and placed their views before the management. A meeting to discuss the position following upon the dismissals was held during one lunch hour when the greater part of the works was idle. The meeting lasted a. little longer than was expected, and when the men endeavoured to return to work over 100 of them were locked out, and remained so for some days. The employers contended that they were on strike. Eight of the men received a telegram notifying them that they had been dismissed from their employment. Meetings were held at the Trades iHall As the local member, I appealed to the men to return to work. I had received a notification from the Minister for Aircraft Production stating that the whole of the allegations made in the dispute would be inquired into, and that the mens charges would be fully sifted. On that specific undertaking, the men returned to their employment. The Minister has made statements which fully vindicate the attitude adopted .by the men, whose names have been besmirched and who have been under a cloud.. On a Saturday night only a few weeks ago> I heard the Minister action of the men would be found to be fully jtistified. Ho went on to say that the greed and selfishness of certain interests with an un-Australian outlook had been holding up aircraft production in Australia. He followed that with a statement which was published in the press only a few days ago, in which he saidDelays in production had occurred. These delays had been caused by(1) Government variation of production schedule; (2) Domination of the industry by private interests. In Sydney, there had been delays because key men were removed from high posts when their opinion did not correspond with the opinion of others. That our aircraft production industry could not afford to lose even one capable man meant nothing, apparently. Lower down the ladder, workers were charged with being f if t h columnists because they got restless and expressed their displeasure as trade unionists. I had to intervene. That was a public vindication of the men. The Prime Minister has called for a special report from the Leader of the Opposition, who is acquainted with the facts, having inquired as to the reason why a high American expert had left his employment and returned to America. These facts being in the possession of the Government, and the specific promise having been made that there would be an inquiry into the allegations of the men, the charges should be fully investigated, and the men should be given an opportunity to vindicate their attitude. The Clyde Engineering Company Limited at Granville employs 1,700 men. mittee has inquired into the position at the works. It has obtained first-hand information, and has brought in reports which clearly show that the industry is not being used to its full productive capacity, as it cannot obtain the requisite war orders from the Munitions Department in Melbourne. Although it is an industry that the Board of Area Management in Sydney, under the chairmanship of Sir Phillip Goldfinch, stated should be used to full capacity, it is not getting the orders to which it is entitled. It was producing trench mortars at the rate of 70 each week, and the number could have been increased to 100. Suddenly the orders were stopped because the Army authorities stated that they had enough mortars. Surely, however, this cannot be true, now that so many troops are coming to this country. It would be better to have the work done here than to have the mortars made in Uie United States of America and shipped here, with all the risks attendant upon the voyage. These works have produced the largest locomotives made in Australia, and also the greatest crane, which was to the order of BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited for installation at Whyalla. The men say that they could produce tanks, if need be. I know that the Prime Minister( Mr committees are operating. As a result of idea? Curtin) has intervened in the matter, but so far no satisfaction has been obtained. To-day, I raised with the Minister for Labour and National Service( Mr in Australia, and in some instances are Ward) the subject of production committees in a number of industries. I desire to bring under the notice of honourable members the following report, published in the Sydney Morning Herald, dealing with what has been done in this way in the United States of AmericaRE ORGANIZING UNITED STATES ARMY -ROOSEVELT' S ORDER-PRODUCTIO N Mr Donald Nelson, United States War Production Chief, has issued a call for the greatest production job in history. He demands from his "" soldiers of production ""-to use his own term-in ten months: Mr 31orgov. in general output; (2) work in machine tool factories 24 hours a day-seve n days a week; and (3) the establishment of joint manageThe War Expenditure Comment aud labour committees to ensure that output is pushed up beyond President Roosevelt's previously announced goal for this year, namely, 00,000 planes, 45,000 tanks, 20,000 anti-aircnuft guns, and 3,000,000 tons of merchant shipping. Mr Nelson promises special awards for workers whose plants turn out a surplus. This policy has also been adopted in Great Britain, as the following report shows:London, 26th January (A.A.P.). Speaking at the trade union conference, the leader of the Russian delegation, M. Shvernik, declared that Britain was going well, but production was not ideal. There were unused reserves which, if mobilized, would considerably increase the output of tanks, aircraft, and munitions. These reserves should be mobilized, and the sooner the better. "" We saw production at its highest where shop stewards were giving the closest attention to it "", he added. SHOP COMMITTEES. Mr Conley, who visited Moscow last autumn, described this as the first big move in working out the establishment of an Anglo-Soviet Union Committee. He said it was applicable to the whole trades union movement and that the views had been represented to Cabinet. He declared: "" There is abundant evidence that production is held up owing to the stiffnecked, idiotic attitude of managerial control. On the other hand, there are enlightened managements in many -workshops where shop tried out. production has increased.** That is an example of tbe practical application of the scheme. Such committees are already existent in several industries working iu complete harmony with tire management, thus making for increased production. In certain other industries, chiefly those of a monopolistic kind, their presence is regarded with some hostility, perhaps out of a fear that the workers may assume too great an interest in industry and eventually demand a share of the profits. Within the last few days, members of a shop committee from the Howard Auto Cultivators Limited, which employs 750 men, visited Canberra to interview Ministers because they considered that the industry was not working to full the next capacity. Before that, they had been to (1) an increase of 25 per cent. Melbourne to interview departmental 0 aicers. Such men deserve to receive official recognition. We have been told that the men in the fighting services have been let down because of lack of equipment. The encouragement of these committees would he one way to ensure the production of increased quantities of equipment. From time to time since I have been a member of this Parliament, I have drawn attention to the fact that the activities of which sets it out that the premium was, lite assurance companies have been passed over by successive governments without proper regulation. Whereas the present Government has gazetted regulations controlling banking, nothing has been done to regulate these other financial institutions which play an important part in the life of the community, and which make large contributions to government loans. 1 propose to cite a case so shameful that it merits the serious consideration of the Government. It may be considered advisable to bring in legislation to control life assurance companies and their activities, with particular reference to the relationship of master and servant, so that persons who peddle life assurance for the companies may he assured of the benefits of workers' compensation. This is the case of a gentleman named Walter Rothwell Archibald, who shared in the Archibald estate. He contracted with the City Mutual Life Assurance Society of Sydney to borrow money on his interest under a will. Altogether, a sum exceeding £3,000 was lent up to the time when Archibald found it necessary to assign absolutely to the assurance company his interest under the will. The assurance company's solicitors were not satisfied that his interest was a vested interest at the time the assignment was made. Therefore, in order to make sure that his interest was not contingent upon his aged mother predeceasing him, it was suggested by the company, and agreed to by Archibald, that he enter into a contract with the company in the amount of .£5,000 against the contingency of his dying before his mother. assurance of £5,000, which was a nonprofit assurance, be was to pay to the company £385 as a single premium. The unexpected happened, and Archibald did not survive his mother. When the estate came to be distributed, Archibald having assigned his interest under the will, an amount of £13,000 was paid to the life assurance company. I have here a photostat copy of the policy for £5,000 which matured on Archibald's death. The company objected to paying the £5,000 on the ground that the premium had not been paid, but here is a deed issued by the responsible directors of the company in fact, paid. This matter would have gone to law except that Archibald's widow, who has . two small children, was left without means, and the executoi himself, in the event of the action, yoing against her, would have had to pay the costs. member asked the City Mutual Life Assurance Society for its side of the case? that this is a one-sided statement. company has stated that its reason for not paying the £5,000 was because the premium had not been paid. member gone to the company about the matter? not want it said that I was using a bludgeon to force the company to pay before I had made the facts public.

The censorship stands on precisely the same footing as it has stood on since the commencement of the war. It is true that nothing is better calgave that answer before, and I shall not culated to assist the enemy than the creation of a feeling of distrust and alarm among the public. It is clear that countries have the censorship in order to promote security, and attacks upon the bona fides of the censorship, if widely circulated, would have the effect of undermining respect for the censorship and, indeed, arouse suspicion about the purposes for which it was being used. In that way, the security of the country would be affected. As the result, the Press Censorship Order, made under National Security Regulations before I became the Minister in charge of the department, prohibits any published reference to any specific act of censorship. That is the characteristic of censorships all over the world, including censorship in democracies. at all. member does not dispute it. Therefore, point. he says that when the censor issues an order to a newspaper, a copy of it should He resigned because he refused to carry be placed upon the table of the House. out the instruction of the Chief Publicity I remind him that documents which are Censor, to attend his office early in the tabled here are available, not only to day, soon after 9 a.m. That instruction honourable members, but also to the press. was given because of the deterioration of realized that fact, and I said that there closer to Australia, its factual treatment would be no objection to a censorship required greater care on the part of the regulation that would debar the press or the public from having access to the information. to the instruction, -because the press receives it ; but the press is not entitled to make any reference to the instruction. of State may see these orders. Ministers of the Advisory War Council were not given them until recently, and I direct attention to the fact that members of the Advisory War Council and members of the Executive take a distinct oath of office, which involves secrecy. Members of Parliament do not take sucb an oath. My answer to the honourable gentleman is that I shall not lay on the table of this House the instructions which the censorship gives to newspapers. 1 change it. I shall now deal with the facts about Mr Rorke. Does the honourable gentleman wish me to go into details? specific question. I asked whether it was a fact that Mr Rorke gave an explanation to a newspaper in respect of the reason why he resigned, and that thai explanation was censored. If so, what were the grounds for such censorship? Rorke's communication which was censored was as follows: "" Mr Rorke said there had been a trend in censorship which he did not like "". upon the bona fides of the censorship. Mr Rorke was a censor, but he was not ship work.",86,Britain S War Output Russia N Criticism

340,Mr Curtin,"I thank the honorablething. which the censorship operates are the National Security Regulations which are laid upon the table of the House. Regarding broadcasting, I am not the Minister for Information and I am not very well acquainted with the functioning of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, but I point out that the present personnel of the commission was inherited by the present Government. In addition, the Australian Broadcasting Commission operates not under National Security Regulations, but under its own statute. Its powers are definitely defined in the act and it has complete control over programmes. direction by the Minister. when certain persons on different occasions request the Australian Broadcasting Commission to permit them to deliver broadcast talks perusal correspondence from the Australian Broadcasting Commission, saying that it is not the master of what is said, but is subject to ministerial direction. That reply was given in reply to complaints about broadcasts of a political nature. is true. When I obtained a return showing the number of talks that had been broadcast by members of the previous Government, compared with those which had been given by members of the then Opposition, I at once realized that some ministerial direction must have been given to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, because the proportion in favour of government speakers was so overwhelming. Minister that there was not, and I also point out that whatever we did, we never sank to the depths of the "" Canberra Calling"" session. the honourable gentleman need be so positive about that. With the consent of tlie House, I shall incorporate in Hansard the following analysis of ministerial broadcasts over the past three years on national stations compared with the number given by Opposition speakers. teresting if the Prime Minister read it. it incorporated in Hansard so that honourable members may study it at their leisure. It carries its own messageUnited Australia Party-United Labour. Country Party. 1939 . . 40 3 1940 .. 63 4 1941 . . 55 21 AH these figures exclude election broadcasts on an equally shared basis. I agree that broadcasting has become one of the great activities of this country, and indeed of every other country. About a year ago, the previous Government agreed, at my suggestion, to appoint a parliamentary committee so that in formulating legislation to deal with broadcasting, we should have a detached can produce for series of constructive recommendations as to how this extraordinary service to the community could be placed upon a fair and proper basis. The committee was set up. I have asked that the committee expedite its report, and I await, as I am sure the House as a whole awaits, the conclusions of the committee, because we need guidance in respect of the way in which Parliament shall legislate for the control of broadcasting activities. commercial broadcasting station is compelled to broadcast the session "" Canberra Calling"". has been quite usual in the past for thf commercial stations to join the national stations in what is called an all-Australia hook-up. compelled. pelled on previous occasions. of national importance. judge of national importance.

356,Mr Curtin,"Some one must be theits statute and will continue to operate under it, but I do hope that Parliament will have the opportunity to deal with the report of the committee, and I am confident, having regard to the personnel of the committee, that the report will be of use to Parliament. For my part I shall be prepared to give effect to all its ever that chamber may have thought substantive recommendations, because I am sick and tired of the wrangling between political parties about the way broadcasting shall be organized. The honourable member for Richmond( Mr Anthony) directed attention to the state of affairs in Canberra in regard to air raid precautions. AllI can say to him is that the matter is under proper examination. Advice has been tendered to the Government in respect of not only Canberra, but also a great number of other places in Australia. There is an order of priority in this matter, having regard to the capacity of the country to make provision, and I consider that members of Parliament are quite capable of j ha ring the risks of the community. With regard td 'the preservation of documents, v [ assure the honourable member that steps have already been taken. The honourable member for Reid( MrG i ft Duty Assessment Act-Regulations^ Morgan) referred to munitions and I am sure that the Minister for Munitions ( Mr Makin), who heard him, will take that matter up. I tell the honourable member for Cook( Mr Sheehan) that I shall indeed look into the disabilities which are suffered equally by those who have volunteered for, and those who have been called into, the Military Forces as the result of their having to give up incomes much higher than can be got in the Defence Forces. Their obligations in regard to rent and hire purchase and the like are embarrassing. We shall do our best about that matter. "" With respect to the matter raised by the honourable member for Watson( Mr Use of land (14). Falstein), I have only to say that it looks to me as though it were a money lending transaction by the life assurance society, and. on the submission made by tbe honourable gentleman, it would appear that the society has acred harshly. That would be my judgment if what he has said represents the whole story, but, before I arrived at a decision, I should have to ask that the company itself should present its case. At any rate, it is a matter of great regret that this Parliament was not able to deal witb life assurance in time of peace. A measure was introduced in the Senate and whatabout the bill, it was a workable plan, and, I think, could have been passed. Question resolved in the affirmative.
