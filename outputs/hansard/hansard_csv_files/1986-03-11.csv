So there is some come back into the labour market when jobs are increase in that two-year period, but not an available and so are recorded as unemployed if enormous increase. they have not got a job--so making it more I want to make the point that this is not a difficult to get the recorded unemployment rates good measure of the severity of unemployment, down. although it is important to the people whom it That performance by the Labor Government is affecting. What happens when there is a strong in the last two and three-quarter years does not improvement in the labour market is that the justify the kind of criticism which has come from people who tend to get the jobs are those who honourable members on the other side of the have not been unemployed for very long.

The CEP is the As has been said in this debate we are looking, best way that we have to do it along with other in the course of three years, at about $1 billionprograms, such as job start, which is a revamped a thousand million dollars-being spent on this wage subsidy program focused on long term unproblem through the community employment employed people. If we did not have programs program. That is money which we believe is well such as this we would have a much bigger probspent in the sense that it is being directed at a lem in the community in terms of the long term group which is in tremendous need and which unemployed and a much higher average duration will not benefit just from the strong growth of of unemployment. That is an important point. the economy because employers will say 'If you have been out of work for a long time you I think it is important to make the point that cannot be all that terrific', and they will tend to the Opposition's line that the increase in the take someone who has been out of work for average duration of unemployment represents much less time. The confidence of those persons some gross failure by the Government on the who have been out of work for a long time is employment front is a nonsense. It stems from destroyed.

So the CEP is very are inappropriate and that they are a waste of important for that purpose. If we did not have money. Some Opposition members said that it it there is no doubt that the average duration of was better to cut taxes than to spend money in unemployment figures would be much higher. this way. Let me say a few things about that. My Department estimates that in the year 1984First, this apparently was not the view of the 85 about a quarter of the long term unemployed Fraser Government because it introduced the who actually got jobs got them through the wage pause program. That was a hastily conCEP, so it was of very substantial assistance to ceived job creation program with poor administhem. But still we have a large cohort, a group trative guidelines and procedures compared with of people, who have been out of work for a long those that operate under the CEP, nevertheless, time. Over 90,000 people have been out of work it was a job creation program of the same kind for two years or more and those people, of as CEP. The Fraser Government embraced that, course, are pushing up the average duration of faced as it was with skyrocketing unemployment. unemployment figures very considerably. If Opposition members now say that such job creation schemes are inappropriate, presumably I do not want to get too technical but I think they are saying that what the previous GovernI should perhaps mention one thing. When we ment did was wrong. say average we normally talk about the mean. If we look at the median, which is the mid-point AlsoI note that the Thatcher Government in rather than the arithmetical average duration of the United Kingdom has strongly embraced job unemployment, we see that that has changed creation programs of this kind. The United very considerably. The average-when we talk Kingdom has a community program, which is about the average we talk about the mean-has being considerably expanded by the Thatcher gone from 38.2 per cent to 41.3 per cent in Government. Indeed, in 1986-87 it is looking at January 1984. But the median, the mid-point, of 230,000 places. In the whole period of CEP up duration of unemployment for all unemployed to this time in Australia we have not got up to went from 18.1 per cent down to 12.0 per cent. 100,000-we have got almost to 100,000 but not So we can see that it is the very long term quite in the course of three years.

The fetish I refer to on this occasion is Act. I spoke in the debate on that occasion, and the regular practice of having elections through drew attention first of all to the fact that it was a whole series of levels, if I may so call them, being debated with unseemly haste, which was to produce employee representatives for various very unwise. Secondly, I drew attention to the councils concerned with the Trade Union Trainfact that the omnibus Bill was being used not ing Authority. We take the view that if the just for mere technical alterations, but for very Government wishes to pursue this matter it is substantive changes to the law. I made the point entitled to do so, but it must be said that this then, as I think other members have made from Bill is entirely unnecessary. If the Government time to time, that an omnibus Bill should not be had had its wits about it in May last year, it concerned with substantive changes to the law would not be necessary for the time of the but only with comparatively small changes and Parliament to be taken up in 1986. We are in technical amendments. effect doing tonight what the Government should have done properly last year. It is interesting and ironic, I suppose, to look back on my speech. I am sure, Mr Deputy What happened, to explain the matter a little Speaker, that you will either recall the speech I further, is that in May last year we debated the made or would have read it since. On that Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill occasion I drew attention particularly to that (No. I )-an omnibus Bill, in other words, which part of the omnibus Bill which dealt with the sought in one king hit to make amendments to Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975.
