LACK OF CARGO. June, the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Fenton) asked a question in regard to vessels of the Commonwealth Government Line, said to be held up owing to lack of cargo. I have had inquiries made in connection with the matter, and find that the Eurelia is not laid up for lack of cargo, but for the purpose of undergoing reconstruction of her store freezing chamber. vessels of the Line are, however, held up through inability to obtain payable cargo. While there is a general shortage of cargo, business is offering in various directions; but freights have fallen so. low as to make this business, which consists mainly of bulk cargoes from Australia to places from the majority of which there is no back loading, quite unattractive on the present running costs.

What is the nature of the agreement between the Repatriation Commission and the State Government or tbe Inspector-General of the Insane in regard to the removal and future maintenance of those soldiers, and at what cost? 3. What certificates under the Lunacy Act have been given in regard to the mental condition of those soldiers? given, and when were those certificates signed? answers to the honourable member's questions are as follow:, 1. The extent of the Commonwealth's constitutional power to deal with mental cases is doubtful, and it -was, therefore, in 1915, deemed advisable to utilize the machinery of the power Lunacy Departments of the several States, dismachines, tinguishing, civil from military cases. With a view to saving the ex-soldier from certain disabilities which were regarded as resulting from the application of the civil law, certain States passed special legislation. In those States which have passed this special legislation, certification under the Lunacy Act is not required, but should an ex-soldier be transferred to a State mental institution, certification is necessary. In that case, the patient passes under the jurisdiction of the State Lunacy Departments, of which the Inspector-General of the Insane is the chief executive officer. [365] 2. The honourable member has already been informed by answers to his question of the 7th instant of the circumstances under which, as a temporary arrangement, it was proposed to transfer twenty patients from No. 16 A.G.H. to Sunbury and Kew Asylums. The relatives of the patients were communicated with to this effect. The per diem cost was to be 25s. 3. The certificates as required by the State Lunacy Act were signed by Drs. H. M. James and P. J.

I shall endeavour to prove that the natural protection accorded, in connection with the importation of these lines of machinery, should be more than ample to give a fair measure of protection to Australian manufacturers. cannot afford to give you another taste of what you really want. able member, but it is clear that his sympathies are not with the people in the back country. I cannot understand that he should fail to foresee the trouble which is brewing for city workers with the discouragement, if not the destruction, of primary industries. It has been suggested during the deliberations of the Committee that I am delaying progress and generally incurring unnecessary expense to the country. But I am.here to put the case for those engaged in primary production; and, although there may be very little result from my efforts in this Chamber, I trust and expect that it will be perceived elsewhere, and in the country. The people to-day are realizing that every action or decision of this Government tends, as a whole, to increase concentration in the great cities. Already the evil resulting from concentration is apparent in the large numbers of unemployed to be found to-day in several of the State capitals. In the course of discussing the rates of duties as set out in the schedule, and as proposed to be amended by the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene), no effort has been made to prove.that the various increases have become necessary for the welfare of Australian industries. There has been much talk about a proposed Board of Trade; but nothing has been said of the fact that a Board of Trade was appointed by the Government nearly two years ago. Has that Board tendered any report concerning any of the grave matters which have come before the Committee during the Tariff discussion? Has the Board offered any opinions or recommendations? So far as honourable members have been advised, it has neither prepared nor presented any report concerning the huge increases of It would be the best Customs duties. Another significant fact is that, in all that has been said during the deliberations of this Committee, honourable members have not been informed that either the primary producer or the importer or the consumer has been consulted. It appears that only one section of the community has been approached, and that is the section represented by the Chamber of Manufactures. There have been speeches by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), the Acting Prime Minister( Sir Joseph Cook), the Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Greene), and other members of the Government, one after another. All are in accord in realizing the effects of the war. They have impressed upon the public two great essentials for the well-being of Australia-the one being increased population, and the other enhanced production. I agree that without the latter, certainly, we shall never be able to pay off Australia's tremendous war debt. ""Without a big increase of population, the burden of taxation per head must become unbearable. Considerable expenditure is now being devoted to immigration. Are the newcomers being conveyed here for the purpose of entering our factories; or are we going to ask them, and our own young Australians as they grow up, to go out on the land and take up the heavy responsibilities involved in primary production to-day, while at the same time adding the further handicap of huge imposts by way of Customs duties? If industries are to be built up here, why should not the whole community share fairly in carrying the burden? It is grossly un. fair that one section should be loaded with the whole. I can only express the hope that punishment will fall upon this Government similar to that which was meted out' to the Government who stood behind the McKinley Tariff, in the",22,Division Vi Metal S And Machinery

45,Mr Gregory,"I respect the honorUnited States of America; that is to say, that they will be promptly kicked out. Cani t be shown by the Minister, or by any one else, that Australian manufactures are languishing? Can it be demonstrated that imports are alarmingly increasing, and that business is being taken away from our own manufacturers? can show by statistics that such is not the case. It cannot be seriously suggested that our manufacturers are becoming impoverished. In all that has been said for the latter, no word has been heard about the grave injury which is threatening the Australian consumer. As for the Australian worker, I yield to none in my admiration for him.' During the great struggle no man of any of the nations showed finer initiative, sounder judgment, or greater courage. Surely, then, those same characteristics should make the Australian worker, as a factory employee, second to none. ""What with the natural protection afforded to our manufacturers, together with the consideration which has been given them by the framers of past Tariffs, they should be able to stand "" on their own"" to-day. I shall show that the agricultural machinery industry has prospered in Australia under the moderate duties that have been imposed in the past. One of the reasons given in support of high protective duties is the alleged low rate of wages paid by manufacturers outside of Australia, and I intend to expose that fallacy. I can show from Canadian and Australian statistics that the employees in this industry in Canada to-day are paid at a far higher rate than are those in Australia. I can show also that when, in 1914, the Inter-State Commission was giving special consideration to the question of increased duties, there was no request made for increased duties by the big manufacturers of agricultural implements in Australia. I intend to show further that, relatively to production and population, New Zealand manufactures more agricultural machinery than does Australia, and that machinery is sold more cheaply in New Zealand than it is here. quoted by the Minister. member vouch for the accuracy of his able members to pay particular attention figures ? [365]2 some time in the consideration of this question, and, amongst other things, I intend to let honourable members know that the farmer in Canada can purchase agricultural machinery for about half the price that has to be paid for it in AusI tralia. The natural protection from Canada averages nearly 50 per cent., including freight, insurance, and exchange. With a duty of 45 per cent., and taking present exchange values with an allowance for freight and insurance as well, the Tariff protection from Canada works out at 62.59 per cent., or nearly 63 per cent. I have mentioned some of the questions I intend to raise on this item, and they should be fully answered before these onerous duties are placed on this class of machinery. In connection with this industry, I wish to make some comparisons between Australia, Canada, and New Zealand. Honourable members will understand that I quote from reports andfrom statistics taken from the latest Tear-Books available. I have said that this industry has made progress in Australia under the low Tariff we had in existence up to 1911. In 1908, the number of persons employed in the industry here was 3,134, and the annual production amounted in value to Â£879,000. In 1911, the number employed in the industry had increased to 5,156, and the value of the annual production to Â£1,656,000, or an increase of nearly 100 per cent., in three years. Another satisfactory feature was that the value of production per employee increased in the same period from Â£281 in 1908 to Â£322 in 1911. Whilst the value of local production was nearly doubled in the period, importations did not increase in the same way. The percentage of imports to local production in this industry in 1908 was 30 per cent.; in 1909, 24 per cent.; in 1910, 27 per cent.; and in 1911, 27 per cent.; an average during those years of, roughly, 25 per cent. In the years following, there was a decline in local productioi. due to many causes, and amongst them the drought and the war. The average percentage of imports to local production in 1913 was 25 per cent.; in 1914, 26 per per cent.; in 1917, 25 per cent.; and in",23,Division Vi Metal S And Machinery

47,Mr Mathews,"Can the honourable 1918, 32 per cent. I should like honor",24,Division Vi Metal S And Machinery
48,Mr Gregory,"I intend to take up to these figures, because they show that, roughly, 25 per cent, of the agricultural machinery used in Australia has been imported, and 75 per cent, of it has been locally manufactured. The reason why I wish to make this quite clear is that every Â£ 1 imposed by way of duty means actually, Â£ 4 added to the price of the article to the consumer. Despite what the Minister has said, there cannot be the slightest doubt that the local manufacturer has kept his prices well up to what similar agricultural machinery can be sold for by the importer. holds that the total charge on the industry is four times 'the amount of duty coland local agricultural machinery were lected at the Customs? fourths of the agricultural machinery used in Australia is made here, and as the local manufacturer keeps his prices as close as he can to the price of the imthe Stock-owners Association of New ported machinery, every increase of Â£ 1 in the Tariff duty means an actual increase in the cost of Â£4 to the consumer. able member's argument is right, which I do not admit, then the total charge on the industry represents four times the amount of duty collected? nearly that. ber can make figures do anything. have to pay for this machinery to take deals with this phase of the question. a greater interest in the Tariff. I have He saysstated that in 1911 the local production of this machinery amounted in value to simply The Commonwealth Year-Book, which is Â£1,656,000. There was a fall in pro1914, page 482, says:-""The following table duction, and in 1918 it amounted in shows the progress of this industry to have value to only Â£1,415,000. creased prices. and the drought have to be consideredin the price of steel and general material Booh for 1917, page 494, says:used in the industry, and the honourable member's figures of Â£1,415,000 would rethis industry in the five years, 1910-15, to have present proportionately that much less. been very satisfactory. A general decline has If the increase in the price had been 30 taken place during the latter part of the period, per cent., therewould be a reduction of attributable one-third in the value of agricultural macountries being the principal contributing facchinery turned out. that the reduction amounted to about Â£240,000 in value. In my view, the chief reason for that was the war, and, secondly, reduced consumption. No one knows better than does the Minister that the .area put under cultivation was considerably reduced before 1918. be fluctuations due to big harvests and small harvests. small harvests prior to 1918, and no one knows better than does the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Poster) that the prices of both imported soaring up, and that machinery that had been Qirown on the scrap heap was recovered, repaired, and put into use again. I received a most important letter about four months ago from the president of South Wales, in which he told me that people were attending sales, and paying fabulous prices for old machinery, which was subsequently repaired and made effective, because of the heavy cost of new machinery. It is clear, therefore, that, owing to the war and increased prices, a falling off in production was natural in the period to which I have referred. ports of agricultural machinery from Australia.

I invite my Labour friends opposite, who so strenuously support the imposition of I have here figures high duties, to carefully examine figures which I am about to submit in this connection. The contention that the wages paid in Canada are much lower than those paid in Australia, and that, therefore, the imported article can be prothe duced much cheaper there than it can be manufactured locally, is absolutely false, and false to the knowledge of those who make it . The fact is indisputable that the wages paid in Australia are very much lower than are the wages paid in Canada. The particulars which I am about to quote are taken from the Commonwealth Year-Boole No. XII . for the year 1918, and the Census of Manufacturers for the Dominion of Canada for the same year. In Australia the salaried employees numbered 346, and the average salary paid to them was Â£170 2s. In Canada there were 1,129 salaried employees whose average salary was Â£292 10s. In Australia, for 2,.846 operatives, their wages averaged Â£129 18s. In Canada, the factory operatives numbered 8,966, and their average wage was Â£192 12s. It cannot, therefore, be argued that the imposition of higher duties is necessary because the wages paid in Australia are higher than those which are paid in Canada.

72,Mr Gregory,"Speaking from15 per cent. The cost of living in Australia has been high, and wages here ought not to be below those ruling in Canada. I should like to see our workmen getting wages equal to, or even higher than, those paid in any other country. But when we come to look at the added value of this class of machinery, we see at once that there must be something wrong with our manufacturers or our workmen, since we ought to he able to do at least as well as Canada in manufacturing agricultural implements and machinery. The added value of Australian agricultural implements works out at Â£652,406, or equal to Â£196 per person employed, while in Canada the added value works out at Â£3,506,76(5, or Â£347 10s. per person employed. The value of plant and machinery, is scheduled at Â£355,830 in Australia, which is equal to Â£107 per employee, while in Canada, at the time covered by these statistics, it was Â£1,194,506, or Â£118 per employee. If we divide the gross value of production by the total number of persons employed, we shall arrive,, at the average value of the work done by each employee, and we shall find that in the case of Australia at this time it amounted to Â£424 6s. per head, while in Canadai t was Â£690 10s. per head. These facts demand careful consideration.. If our manufacturers are not following up-to-date methods, if they are not making the best use of the protection which has been afforded them by putting down complete plants, so as to be able to turn out their manufactures at the lowest rates, is it fair that other sections of the community should be called upon to carry these imposts in order that they may be protected? I think I have shown clearly that Australian workmen in this industry do not receive anything like the pay received by Canadian workmen, and that the value of the output per employee in Canada is considerably more than it is in Australia. by the honourable member relate to the year 1918. Since then there has been an increase in wages here, and a reduction in wages in Canada. latest statistics available. The honourable gentleman knows that our statistics are nearly always two years old. member will find that wages rates in Australia to-day are higher than they are in Canada, because since the year mentioned by him wages here have increased, while in Canada they have been reduced.. tleman knows that wages continued to increase in Canada, the TJnited States of America, and the Old Country for some considerable time after the war. All over the world to-day there is a demand for a' reduction of wages. Wages here did not go up to anything like the level reached in America during the war. Eveni n Great Britain the wages paid in the steel industry were considerably higher than in Australia. orable member's figures are three years old. from the Commonwealth Year-Book for 1918, and they are the latest available. I stated at the 'outset of my remarks that the Australian manufacturers of agricultural machinery made no request to the Inter-State Commission when ib was inquiring into the Tariff for increased duties. ,1 have here a report by* Mr Walmsley, in which it is stated thatIn March-October, 1914, the Inter-State Commission held an inquiry to hear requests regarding the 1908-11 Tariff on agricultural implements, but according to the report, which ia dated August, 1916-nearl y two years laterno information of any practical use was obtained, inasmuch as no manufacturer of consequence in Australia submitted any requests or furnished evidence in Australia. A blacksmith, who was about to put on the market a potato digger, and a maker of pegtooth harrows in Tasmania, who submitted that his trade was on the increase, and was profitably carried on, wanted a higher duty in order to expand his business more rapidly. The Commission's inquiries covered the period from March to October, 1914. A t that time we had manufacturers carrying on here under low Tariff duties. They were doing well, but the Inter-State Commission was requested to collect evidence from all parts of Australia in regard tc* the Tariff, and to make recommendations to this Parliament. They set apart the period from March to October, 1914, toan inquiry into the position of manufacturers of agricultural machinery, and we have it stated that no manufacturer of consequence submitted a request or furnished any evidence in support of higher duties.",26,Division Vi Metal S And Machinery

Sworn evidence, taken before a Committee, and showing why these increased duties are necessary, should have been submitted to us; but we have had no such evidence. It is a shame that such duties should be proposed. The Inter-State Commission reported thatThe most noticeable feature in connection with this industry is the fact that, except in regard to three comparatively unimportant branches, manufacturers have refrained from approaching the Commission, either in regard to unsatisfactory conditions which may exist in the manufacture of machines and implements in which they are at present engaged, or in respect to an extension of their operations to machines and implements which hitherto have not been commercially made here.

I think your information is astray. member of the Tariff Commission of 1906, and I take his statements as being absolutely correct, as I think they will be found to be. When the Minister( Mr Greene) was speaking on the Tariff he saidThere are some subsidized freights in existence at the present moment. I can quote one instance which has come under my notice. I cannot give the particulars, because I have them in confidence, but I can give the figures. The ordinary freight at the present time is Â£10 per ton on a certain article; yet one firm is able to bring it to Australia at the rate of Â£1 per ton. I am assuming that the Minister was referring then to agricultural machinery from Canada and the TJnited States of America, and, if that be so, the honourable gentleman's reference was incorrect. The following is information supplied by importers of that machinery:-The steamer freight rate on agricultural machinery from the east cost of America-Mon treal, and St. Johns, Canada, and New York, TJnited States of America-for the year 1911-12 was 20s. per ton; for the year 1912-13 it was 22s. 6d. per ton; for the year 1913-14 it was 27s. 6d. per ton. In the early part of 1914 an effort was being made to establish a new shipping line in the American-Australian trade. Agents for some of the old lines offered the agricultural implement concerns and some other large shippers afive-yearscontract at an average rate for the whole period to the five principal Australian ports of 22s. 6d. per ton. The contract was accepted by both the International Harvester Company and Massey-Harris Company. That contract was effective from 1st June, 1914, to 31st May, 1919, and to the credit of the shipping companies, it can be said that they honoured their contract through that troublesome period, and gave the shippers their fair share of space in every ship they loaded",27,Division Vi Metal S And Machinery

88,Mr Gregory,"I am quoting afor Australia, altliough many of their charters cost them from Â£8 to Â£10 and more per ton. Had they wished to do so, the machinery companies could have made enormous profits for themselves out of the contract by charging their Australian customers the prevailing rates; but they did not do so. Their retail prices throughout the whole period were based on the average rate of 22s. 6d. per ton, and the farmers qf Australia, instead of the importing implement companies, got the f u l l benefit of this exceptionally favorable contract, which accounted for the moderate prices of imported machinery in Australia during the war period. At 1st June, 1919, the rate on agricultural machinery from America to Australia was increased to 67s. 6d. per ton, three times the average rate that prevailed during the war period, which has been, next to the increased Customs duties, a most important factor in fixing the present high prices for farm machinery. The Minister laid great stress on the small quantities of machinery being manufactured inPree Trade New Zealand, and I said that I would show that, so far as population and production are concerned, they produce more than is produced in Australia. are not a farming people. latively they produce more, and this makes the Minister's argument of less porters' are exploiting them. .value.

The Minister has been getting information from the Argentine, and has been, asked how and from whom he obtained it, but he has not told us. It would be just as well if he did tell us how he obtains his information about prices in that country. A considerable time ago there was a good deal of comment on the difference in the prices of agricultural machinery in the Argentine and here; but I wish to deal more exhaustively to-day with the question qf the prices in Canada, New Zealand, and Australia.

The Minister compared the prices of different machines in New Zealand and Australia, notably disc ploughs, spring tine harrows, grain drills, and fertilizer drills. ""Why those machines, which have scarcely any sale in New Zealand, were selected it is difficult to understand. I have the following information:In pre-war times prices in New Zealand were, on tlie average, lower 'than in Australia, although the cost of delivering them, as well as distributing expenses, was much higher. Freight rates from the east coast of America to New Zealand were then from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, higher than to Australia. On account of the broken nature of the country it has been found necessary to have distributing warehouses in the four leading cities, while only one for a much larger business is required in each of the Australian States. Distributing expenses in New Zealand average from 15 per cent, to 20 per cent, higher than in Australia. In Australia farm machinery is sold on the basis of delivery on rails at the stawith the duty added. It has been kept tion nearest the manufacturer's or distributor's place of business; the farmer pays the outward railage. In New Zealand the practice is to prepay carriage to the farmer's nearest railway station or wharf, and the cost of it, estimated at 3 i per cent., is added to the retail price. Then the equipment of some machines in New Zealand is materially different from the same machine in Australia. For instance, in Australia, drills are fitted with steel road wheels, while in New Zealand wooden road wheels, which cost more, are used. fications for any implement with wooden tell us how the price of the stripper-harwheels in Australia, it is always charged vester has jumped up? as an extra. Australian manufacturers charge Â£3 extra for wooden wheels where supplied. Zealand a canvas cover to protect it from the this quite well. weather is supplied with eacli drill at a cost of about Â£2. No such covers are used in Australia. Owing to the difference in seasons New manufacturer did not have such large Zealand price lists are usually issued about six stocks in hand. He was manufacturing months later than in Australia, and some interested parties, when it suited their purpose, all the time. The honourable member's have been known to compare current Australian statements are pretty hot. prices with the preceding season's prices in New Zealand. By reason of its more regular seasons, New Zealand has closely sold out its are I have at times questioned some.of supplies yearly at prices based on the landed the Minister's statements. He draws hiscost of the importations during the year, while information wholly from one sourceI quite the reverse has been the case in Australia, where it frequently happened that the might almost say a tainted source, because machines sold were imported two or three years it comes from those manufacturers whopreviously at lower invoice prices and with expect to benefit by the increased duties. lower freights, and as prices there were also made on the basis of landed cost, they were, for the time being, more favorable to Australian than to New Zealand purchasers. is now giving us the excuses of the International Harvester Company for selling: their machines dearer in New Zealand than here. here is from the Massey-Harris people. It gives the reason why at times there were increased prices in New Zealand as compared with here. Nobody knows better than the Minister that the prices of these goods have been jumping up considerably month after month. Manufacturing costs have been going up month after month, and year after year, until they have reached an enormous figure. Nobody knows that better than the Minister does. He knows also that machinery canbe imported for one season's product, and:' I suppose nobody knows better than he does why the reaper and binder is being sold at its present price to-day instead of very secret up to the present, but althoughthe Minister knew it the House was not told anything of it. thing is that, notwithstanding these reasons in regard to New Zealand, the Australian manufacturers, who were subjected to all these extra costs, did not charge as much. creased here so much.

Even with the addition of the3C items the New Zealand farmer gets a producer.

My figures are that in Australia, with a 40 per cent, duty, it is sold at Â£44, and in New Zealand, duty free, at Â£52 10s. used I collected for myself, except those which I quoted from Mr Walmsley, but these figures in regard to prices are supplied by Massey-Harris, and I believe them to be true. If I doubted their accuracy, I should not put them before the Committee. I have the assurance of Massey-Harris and Company that these are their prices, and, moreover, I have checked some of them with the printed price lists issued in Canada by Deering and McCormick. I have taken all possible care to verify my information, and I would not read to the Committee any document if I thought it contained any misrepresentation. The Minister( Mr that machinery arrived a month later, Greene) said during this debateAgricultural machinery tbere (New Zealand), which is supplied almost entirely by overseas manufacturers-becaus e there is .practically no agricultural implement making in the Dominion-is without exception dearer than it is in Australia. . . . There are eighty-five items in this list, &c. I propose to read a list of the retail prices for 1921 in Canada, New Zealand, Â» and Australia pf Massey-Harris farm machines of the same kind. you get that information? and Company. manufacturers are because of the low wages they pay, Massey-Harris and Company are worse, because they sweat their employees under contract. quoted statistics showing that the average wage per employee in this industry is considerably greater in Canada than in Australia, whilst tbe output also is larger. If a machine manufactured in Canada can be sold for Â£60 while the one manufactured here is sold for Â£100, there must be something wrong with the local manufacture. crowd here sweat their employees. wages per head is wholly in favour ot Canada. orable member worked out the percentage difference between Canadian and Australian wages? about 25 per cent, higher two years ago. related to 1918. quoting those? of salaried employees in this industry in Australia is Â£170 2s., and in Canada Â£292 10s., whilst the average wage of the operatives in Australia is Â£129 18s., and in Canada Â£192 12s. I shall quote the prices paid for different articles of machinery, by thei farmers in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The Australian prices of binders are quoted ou the basis of a 10 per cent, duty, because Massey-Harris& Company had a large number of machines on hand just before -the new duty became operative. Had."" and borne the 45 per cent, duty, the increase would have had to be paid by the consumer. ber say why the Massey-Harris people knocked off Â£24 off their catalogue price for the reaper and binder? speaking on the first item, the honourable member for Wakefield ( Mr Richard Poster) interjected:-""The price quoted 7 quoted Â£100 for his machine, the price of the imported article dropped."" The explanation is this: The Australian retail price for a Massey-Harris 6-feet reaper and binder for the 1920 harvest was Â£102"" payable after harvest. As forward orders for harvesting machines are booked all* through the year, it became necessary to fix a price for binders for the 1921 harvest soon after the new Tariff was brought' down, and a price list was issued on 19th.' July, 1920, in whicb the price ""for the 6-feet reaper and binder was fixed at Â£130, which included the duty of 45 per oent. under the new Tariff.

It is those reapers and binders, carried over from 1920, that are now listed at Â£105 for the 1921 harvest.

Tho present Tariff will injure the producer, and I do not think it will benefit the workers, although it plays into the hands of Trusts and monopolies, and tends to increase their number.. Honourable members know how the promises that were made when machinery duties were increased in 1908 have been broken. The farmer does not know from day to day what return his industry, will yield him. He has to compete without protection in the markets of the world, and he deserves special consideration. Land has been falling out of cultivation, and though the area that is being cultivated has increased this year, that is due chiefly to the efforts of repatriated men to make homes for themselves. goes out into the bush to win a livelihood by tilling land that has hitherto produced nothing, and cuts himself off from the advantages of civilization, often being unable to get schooling for his children or a proper mail service, is surely worthy of consideration. Yet, these duties fall wholly upon such men and other tillers of the soil. [5.4] I recognise that the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), although ill-advised, has made out a good case from his own stand-point. We who support the duties have been told that we are trying to ruin the agriculturist. ing to do so, but that that will be the effect of the duties. their effect, and were it likely to be so not one honourable member on this side would support them; because if the man on the land cannot make a living, the rest of the community suffers We quite understand that; but we believe that the farmers' representatives in this Chamber are over-estimating the effect of the increased duty. We are charged with looking solely after the interests of the manufacturerj but we would rather do that than protect the importer. The honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) has referred to the Massey-Harris Company. I have a particular objection to that firm, because I believe it is worse than the In pier ( Mr Gregory) quoted the ruling ternational Harvester Company. In connection with the assembling of these implements, the workmen are in a somewhat unfortunate position, as there is not a Pederal award covering this particular trade. Victoria and South Australia are the principal manufacturing States, and operations are governed by the decisions of a Victorian Wages Board. Unfortunately, a mistake was made in preparing the Victorian rates and conditions, and the Massey-Harris Company and the International Harvester. Company are taking full advantage of the position. The representatives of the men had it arranged that these firms could not under-pay men, but under certain contract arrangements men are engaged in assembling the parts of agricultural implements at rates which do not allow them to earn a living wage. These firms, however, are controlled, to The man who a certain extent, and we can demand from them wages and conditions which we cannot exact from importers. that men can be secured to work for less than a living wage? the firms find great difliculty in obtaining their services. A t present there is a good deal of unemployment, and these firms are taking full advantage of the situation by employing men to work at wages.below those usually paid. Agricultural implements can be assembled by men who do not possess engineering skill, although a certain amount of mechanical knowledge is necessary. In many counr tries where there is over-production, the manufacturer is compelled to export his surplus to other countries, where, it is sold at a lower price than it is disposed of to the consumers in the country where it is manufactured. It is only six weeks ago that the South African farmers objected to Victorian wheat being dumped in that country, because it was detrimental to the interests of the South African producers. Australian wheat has been sold in South Africa at a lower rate than it was disposed of in the Commonwealth. The American manufacturers are not the only transgressors in this direction, because all manufacturers dispose of their over-production in a way that is detrimental to the interests of those in the countries from which they export.

The difference in the Canadian price of Â£61 and the New Zealand price of Â£97 is accounted for by extra profit, because in New Zealand"" there is no competition with the local manufacturer. If the New Zealandprice is Â£97 the difference of Â£5 does not mean ruination to the Australian farmer. Surely the average agriculturist would be prepared to pay that amount if it would mean placing the industry on a sound basis and making the farmer independent of foreign manufacturers. I doubt very much whether, individually or collectively, the Australian wheat-growers would enter any protest if they realized that the imposition of the proposed duty would eventually be the means of placing them in a better position. I quite understand that the farmers' representatives are advocating reductions because they fear that some injury will be in flicted, and if they do not protest they may have to explain. I believe that some farmers' representatives are asked to make statements with which they do not agree. How much would it mean per bushel of wheat, oats, or barley if the extra price was paid ? member encourage primary production by giving a price above the world's parity? nasty, but 10s. 3d. per bushel for fowls' food is ridiculous.

The experience which we had in Australia with the stripper-harvester very nearly killed Australia's Protectionist policy. I do not want to open old sores, but if our manufacturers had kept their promises, the Protective policy would have been much more easy of adoption than it has proved. much more easily operated than at present. of faith which occurred in 1908, the duty on every machine would have amounted to Â£16.' was imposed, did not Australian manufacturers do remarkably well? their own? They were not paying the wages that they should have paid in a country like Australia, and we desired increased duty to enable them to do so. If such increase had been injurious to the farmer, we would not have sought to impose it. But we knew, and we still know, that it was not injurious. We know, further, that without the imposition of additional duties the prices of imported machinery have gone up and up. The establishment of local factories tends, without doubt, to check importers. That has been proved in New Zealand. The figures which the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) quoted in this respect were not accurate. I say that the machines are -cheaper in Victoria, at any rate, than in New Zealand. But even the statistics that the importer is an exploiter. Unfortunately, he is often an individual whom we cannot get at, since the profits go elsewhere. I wish to quote some interesting figures for the particular benefit of country members. In the financial year 1905-6, the 5-ft. stripper-harvester cost the farmer Â£81. In 1909-10, the price was Â£70. The 6-ft. stripper-harvester in the earlier year was Â£94, and in the later period Â£78.

233,Mr Mathews,"There was in thosegrain produced in the Commonwealth. Such an imposition could not possibly ruin anybody. The amount of duty collected on agricultural implements of all sorts last year was about Â£450,000. The farmer says that that is a direct charge upon one class, namely, the primary producer. It is not so, for the reason that the primary producer passes it on. Honourable members will be interested, I think, in the following extract from the Farm Implement News, published in Chicago:During the month of February, agricultural implements to the value of $7,082,800 were exported, according to figures made public by the Department of Commerce last week. This is a large increase over February, 1920, when the value of implement $2,869,647: For the first eight months of the current fiscal year, implement exports were $37,272,683, compared with $19,552,593 during the corresponding period of. the previous fiscal year. The annual report of the International Harvester Company, made public 14th April, shows that, while the company's volume of business in 1920 was the largest in its history, a representative of the worker more tbe net profit was smaller than in 1919. The report states that the machine selling prices in 1920 showed an average increase of' GO per cent, over pre-war prices, and that tlie increase in repair prices was 40 per cent. The peculiar and significant fact is that while their exports were enormously greater than during the earlier period, their profits were considerably less. It is obvious that American manufacturers were accepting lower prices for their machinery. Australia. member for Dampier that, with the up-todate furnishings of our factories, and with the intelligence and individuality of the Australian workman, we ought to be able to compete and hold our own with any one in the world. So long as the conditions are fair and normal, we should fear nothing and nobody. But we have to look out for the profit-cutting foreign manufacturer. TJnited States of America manufacturers have had to sell their products for less than formerly, and they will be compelled to continue to do so. They must find and keep and endeavour to expand oversea trade, andi they can only do so by selling for less profits than they were formerly making. Acute though the general position may be in Australia and Great Britain to-day, there are also great troubles and disabilities in the TJnited States of America. In their search for, and exploitation of, further markets, the American makers will resort to methods which, if they are not counteracted here, will prove considerably detrimental to Australian industry. It is "" up to us,"" and particularly to the representatives of the farmers, to see that Australia's industrial interests are conserved and protected. Does not the farmer perceive that an industrial smash would injure'him as much as any other individual in the community? smashes in this country. honourable member to assist in preventing exports was calamity. There need be only the small beginnings of a slide to precipitate an awful avalanche. While we are all desirous of reducing the prices of commodities generally, if reductions are to be brought about by the enforcement of lower wages, there is bound to be disaster. That consideration appeals to me as than it does to honourable members opposite. In 1893, there was a smash in Victoria, and, in common with many thousands of other persons, I had to leave this State and go elsewhere to make a living.

265,Mr Mathews,"The honorableThe statement regarding this matter which has heen supplied to me reads:In New Zealand, oil engines are subject to a revenue duty of 10 per cent., but all other lines are 'admitted free. In Australia, there were duties of 30 per cent, on grain drills and oil engines, and 25 per cent, upon all other lines mentioned above. Notwithstanding this, it will be seen that prices in Australia were considerably lower than prices in New Zealand. That was in 1918-19. In 1920, the difference was even greater. Writing to the Argus of 18th April last, the Minister for Trade and Customs quoted the International Harvester Company's then current prices in the two countries, as under :Australia. New Zealand. Net Cash. Â£ Duty 25 % 4-Furrow DlscJPlough, 24-in. discs fi.. 41 12 6 Spring line Harrow, 23-teeth Duty 30% Eleven Disc Drill Thirteen Disc Drill These figures show that Protection on farm machinery does not raise prices, and that the New Zealand farmer derives no advantage from the free importation of his implements. Whilst the removal of duties is no advantage to New Zealand, it has serious disadvantages. The Dominion loses considerable revenue, which has to* be made good by some other form of taxation, and the farmer is charged more for his implements. May I add that the Minister is not encouraging the production in his own country of a commodity which ought to he encouraged ? That, to my mind, is the greatest crime of the lot. In New Zealand the duty was remitted, with the object of making these machines cheaper to the farmer, hut the result was that they were made dearer. I know that all business men will cut lines at times, just to show how much cheaper they can sell than can the fellow next door. the honourable member complains if I go back to 1918. figures for 1919-20. has not quoted the present prices of these machines. the question of wages. members are aware, that is the question which most appeals to me. During, the war, the manufacturers of Canada, by reason of their proximity to the markets talk about dumping. of Europe, were able to.obtain contracts to the value of hundreds of millions sterling, whilst we' in Australia were unable to secure any such contracts. ply of agricultural implements ? they were for war commodities. As the honourable member knows, all the industrial establishments in Canada were converted into war-material establishments. Now that the war is over, these have reverted to ordinary manufacturing purposes. The wages paid during the war Net Cash. in Canada, because of the inordinate prices which manufacturers were able to # s. a. Â£ s. d. obtain for their commodities, were higher Duty Free. than those paid in Australia. But since the armistice the manufacturers there 52 10 0 17 10 0 19 10 0 have discovered a most effective method 51 10 0 62 0 0 of lowering wages. I hope not merely to 55 5 0 66 15 0 maintain the wages which are being paid to the agricultural employees in Australia, but to secure an increase of those wages. At the same time, I say that the employer in Canada is not paying his employees the wages that he should. Figures prove nothing unless they are up to date. thing, according to the statements of some honourable members this afternoon. which I have quoted can be disproved only by comparison with the selling prices extant. We, have .been told that the manufacturers of Canada are paying considerably higher wages to their employees than are the manufacturers of Australia. I hope that they are. But if they are doing so, the fact only makes me anxious to see our own employees receiving a considerably higher wage. Should there be over-production, either in Canada or tlie TJnited States of America, the manufacturing firms there will not exhibit any mercy or any consideration to the manufacturers of Australia.

I should not have made this quotation but for certain figuresquoted by the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory), which, I think, it entirely refutes. 75 per cent, of the agricultural machinery used here was made in Australia, every Â£1 increase in the duty meant a 75 per cent, increase. member tried to prove that an increase of Â£1 amounted really to a Â£4 increase. I have heard that contention before, but it would be difficult to convince me that, if I received Â£1 for something, I had in reality received Â£4 for it. The honourable member, as reported in Hansard, pages 7815-6, said a good deal in regard to the supposed natural protection enjoyed, by Australian manufacturers. I have here a statement in which it is pointed out thatIf his figures are no more reliable than those Telating to binders, mowers, and hay-rakes, they can be disregarded altogether. He said the natural protection on binders, mowers, and hay-rakes, in 1913 and 1921, was as under:1913. Binders Mowers Hay-rakes He did not show how these figures were Arrived at, but there is no doubt they are incorrect. sidered to be freight, insurance, and all other charges except duty.

Binders Mowers Hay-rakes Naturally it was higher during the war period, hut the above percentages state the situation to-day. These figures include freight, insurance, bank exchange, wharfage, stacking, cartage, entries, and all other expenses except duty.

Apart from that item, I quoted the actual figures in regard to importations. member will recognise that in quoting these figures in refutation of statements made by him I have no desire to be personally offensive.

The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews), in a telling' speech, has already replied to some of them, and I desire, also, to put before the Committee other aspects of the question.

I go further, and say 'that if his statements were based on fact-if it .were true that the imposition of duties on agricultural implements and machinery or anything else used by the primary producer, had the effect of increasing prioesI would mot vote.for,such duties. will have that effect. the contrary view.

319,Mr Parker Moloney,"Exactly;importing companies bow much this ""natural protection"" really amounts to, instead of endeavouring to create the impression that the freights paid hy them are enormous. I have here a photograph of a bill of lading from Melbourne to Buenos Aires by the Japanese steamer Luzon Maru, and it is a very interesting document to consider side by side with the statements of the .honourable member for Dampier. This bill of lading shows that 101 packages, representing 49 tons 5 cwts., were carried at a freight of no less than Â£20 per ton. The date is January, 1918, during the period that the CanadianAmerican manufacturers were landing goods in Australia at 20s. per ton, as compared with an outward freight of Â£20. It may be said that this is ancient history, but I have an instance, within a month or two, of a consignment of 10 tons of one-way disc cultivators, an Australian invention well known to our farmers, being despatched from Melbourne to Buenos Aires in the Citta di Qenova at a freight of Â£10 per ton. This competes with a freight from New York to Buenos Aires of less than Â£3 per ton; and it is manifest that if we value our export trade we must do as other countries do, and assist our manufacturers to -hold their own. Sitting suspended from 6.80 to 8 p.m. orable member for Dampier was good enough to admit that he did not take into account the question of the assembling of the machines, and that there was notvery much in the contention which he raised. orable member was not present when I showed from a bill of lading that it cost only about 20s. per ton to oversea manufacturers to land their goods here. oversea manufacturers can land their goods at Â£ 1 a ton now ? was during the war. ticulars. showed how a consignment of about 10"" tons, consisting of one-way disc cultivators, an implement of Australian invention, was despatched from Melbourne to Buenos Ayres in the Argentine on the Citta de Genova at a freight of Â£10 per ton, while from New York to Buenos Ayres the freight at the same time was only Â£ 3 per ton. In that case there was a natural protection to the foreigner of Â£7 per ton. was a contract entered into just prior to the war. Canadian Government by means of a subsidy enabled their manufacturers to have their manufactures brought here at Â£ 1 per ton. that? I make it as a definite statement. Does the honourable member think it is unnatural for a Government to stand by their own manufacturers ? It is the duty of a Government, in the interests of the primary and secondary producers, to stand by the manufacturers of their own country if they can, in order to allow them to build up the local industry. going to stand by their manufacturers with cheap outward freights to the markets of the world, it would not be a bad thing to apply the same principle to the primary producers also. orable member will find no more ardent backer than myself in anything he wishes to have done in the interests of the primary producer, but it is also in the interests of the primary producer to so build up our manufactures here as to enable him to have a good local market, which is the best market of all. I hope we shall see the honourable member fori Grampians ( Mr Jowett) voting with us when the division is taken on this item, although we have not seen much of him during the debates on the Tariff. I canthat the not do better than repeat the words he uttered when he was a candidate for Maribyrnong some years ago. I quoted them when I spoke in the general debate on the Tariff.

When I spoke on the general question, I referred at some length to agricultural implements,, and do not propose to go over the same ground again. I wish to give some figures, however, in answer to the honourable member for Dampier. refer to him specifically, because he is the only honourable member who has yet spoken on this item. He has, of course, a right to his own opinions, and I am sure he is perfectly honest in his convictions; but I cannot'see how he can represent the interests, or voice the true opinions, of the man on the land, when he says'that the interests of the primary producers are best served by doing something that will, kill the local market. the honourable member proposes would have the effect of leaving the primary producers at the mercy of a foreign monopoly. do so. effect of what the honourable member advocates would, be to leave the primary producers of Australia at the mercy of the worse Combine of all, the one we cannot touch or deal with, and that is the overseas Combine. showed that the agricultural implement manufacturers here have flourished under a low Tariff. figures I have here prove anything, they will prove the very opposite. The contention of honourable members in the. Comer is that the duty on agricultural implements is passed on to the farmer. The whole history of fiscalism in this and every other country goes to demonstrate the very opposite. quote interested bodies. I have doue the honest thing by taking the price-lists. On 1st September, 1920, the Massey-Harris Company, an importing firm, quoted in their own price book the 6-ft. reaper and binder for delivery in 1921 at Â£125 the price was increased to Â£98. McKay Harvester Company announced that is so. The pre-war price for the Tariff. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Tariff. that they were making reapers and binders locally, and quoted the 6-ft. machine at Â£95 cash. On 21st February, 1921, the Massey-Harris Company issued a new price-list, in which they quoted the 6-ft. reaper and binder at Â£101 cash. There is a difference of Â£24. The only reason why they did that was because the implement was produced locally, and the I local competition forced them to reduce their price to the primary producer by that amount. Nothing could persuade me that, but for the local competition in this article, the Australian farmer would not be still paying that extra Â£24. I cannot see how the production of the article locally can be to the detriment of the man on the land. If it were, I would not be advocating it, but the whole history of Protection goes to demonstrate that it is to his benefit, and not to his detriment. The instance I have given is a complete answer to the argument that the duty is passed on to a farmer. moved the duty on agricultural implements in the TJnited States of America? dealing with Australia. Here is a set of facts about what has happened at our own doors. Instead of honourable members in the Corner being able to explain it away they call attention to other countries, and ask if that is why something else was done elsewhere. Why not get right down to tin-tacks, and deal with the question at issue here? We are concerned with I Australia. I will give another interesting statement from a price-list. It is not a statement from an interested firm like the Massey-Harris Company. When the honourable member . for Dampier was speaking, he told me that he was quoting from a document supplied to him from that company. We ought to have something more than that. It should be backed up by the price-list, at all events, but this was not done. I have here another printed price-list which was given I am not going to to me. It shows that the pre-war price (1st June, 1913) for the 6-feet reaper and binder was Â£39, and the post-war price (1st February, 1920) Â£77 10s., an increase of 98J per cent.",48,Chairman To Suggest That The Honourable Member Is

We might very well ask ourselves why in the one case was there an increase of approximately 100 per cent, and in the other an increase of only 50 per cent., because during that period the duty was not altered. There was a revenue duty of only 5 per cent, on reapers and binders, and a protective duty on reaper threshers and drills. reapers and binders increased because there was no competition, and every farmer requires them. orable member for Wakefield has supplied the answer. The importers of reapers and binders were able to put up the price nearly 100 per cent, for the simple reason that there was no competition in Australia. Therefore, there is nothing in the contention of the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Gregory) that the duty caused the increase in price, because Teaper threshers and drills, which are on the protected list, advanced only 51 per cent. on the free list they will go up 100 per cent., too. There is no necessity at all to enter into a labyrinth of figures to elaborate this argument; The comparisons I have been able to make furnish an unanswerable argument, showing that as soon as the -local industry is destroyed the primary producers of this country will be at the mercy of an overseas Combine for Dampier was not arguing that we -should leave the farmers at the mercy of a Combine. that would be the effect of the policy advo4-Fuxrow-Diso Plough cated by the members of the Corner party. I propose now to deal with the comparison of New Zealand and Australian prices made by the honourable member for Dampier, and ih this connection I intend again to quote, not as the honourable member for Dampier did, fromfiguressupplied by the interested manufacturers, but from the price lists. I may add that this is not the kind of TariffI want. I want the New Protection, under which we could control local prices, but, like other members of my party, I have to choose between this Tariff, which represents the Old Protection, and a Free Trade policy. The onlyfiguresthat are of any value at all in connection with this matter are to be found in the price lists, upon which the farmer would buy, and if the figures which I have are right, then those supplied by the honourable member for Dampier must be wrong.

If there was anything at all in the Free Trade doctrine, such an advance would have been impossible. If we were not able to contrast those figures with the Australian position under Protection, it might be contended that the increase was due to enhanced cost of production, higher wages, and dearer materials; but I have been able to make a comparison between New Zealand aind Australian prices for the same class of implement.

The trouble, in the past, has been that the secondary industries have been confined to the cities; they should be spread throughout the Commonwealth. Apart from that, the best market the man on the land can have is the home market.

There are no better citizens in Australia than those men and women, and what is their reward for going into the back country, and opening up new land? under the worse conditions with the worse railway services, the worse postal and medical facilities, and the worse means of educating their children. They are asked to work the longest hours for the least return of any section of the community. Why should the best citizens of the country suffer the worse conditions? It is up to this Parliament to ascertain the reason for this. If any proposal is on foot to cut down hours, and increase wages, let a start be made in the country districts. At least, let these improved conditions apply all round. where a start should be made. The duties proposed in this schedule are not in the interest of the primary producers.

401,Mr Greene,"The reaper andwhich Australians have every reason to pride themselves. overstating the case. the history of the development of these machines, and I shall quote some of it to let honourable members know what they, owe to the agricultural implement makers of this country and to the Australian workmen associated with them. The first successful stripper-harvester was invented in 1884, and patented in 18S5, by Australians. There had previously been attempts to devise a machine that would perform in one operation the whole work of taking off the grain and making it ready for market, but it was not t ill 1885 that a machine was produced in any country to fill these conditions. As the Australian stripper-harvester worked satisfactorily, it sold well when the growers realized its efficiency, and appreciated the immense reduction its use meant in the expense of harvesting. During the first fifteen years, comparatively slow progress was made, but the prejudices disappeared during that time. In 1900, the combined harvester, as it was then styled, was generally, if not universally, recognised to be the most efficient and economical machine for taking off the crop. Then the Americans took a hand. and 1901 sample combined harvesters were purchased in Australia by the Massey-Harris Company and the International Harvester Company, both North American Combines. were used as models for imitation, and both companies embarked in the manufacture of them on a large scale. They shipped considerable numbers of these imitations to Australia for sale. It was the only country using such machines. There was no demand for them in America at that time. Meanwhile, several Australian firms had gone into the manufacture of harvesters, but the wealth and weight of organization on the part of the American companies made the competition too. severe for them. Wellknown makers, such as James Martin and Company, Gawier, South Australia; Nicholson and Morrow, Melbourne; and Henderson Brothers, of Corowa, and other makers,, were forced out of the harvester business. In the Australian com[366]2 bined harvester there were embraced some features that were in the original stripper invented by Ridley, of South Australia, about seventy years ago. The .principal of these was the combination of a stripping comb and revolving beater, by which the ripe heads of grain were taken off the standing crop and threshed. During the past twenty years many experiments were made in various parts of the Commonwealth, with the object of developing machines which would do the same work in different ways. Among many abortive attempts, one change emerged, which met with a measure of acceptance. This was the adaptation of the binder knife and reel with the stripping comb to take off the heads, instead of doing the work with the comb and beaters. The list in the Commonwealth Patent Ofiice shows that patent rights were taken out by the Australians referred to as follows:-No. 2202/04, J. L . Smith, North Melbourne, 24th December, 1904; No. 4394/05, Matthew Wm. Charlton, of Newport, Victoria; and Douglas East Chapman,, of Ascot Vale, Victoria, 19th October, 1905. Honourable members will notice that in this instance the Australian inventors were responsible for a further improvement in this particular type of machine. The patent rights which embodied the inventions of Charlton and During 1900 Chapman were bought up by the MasseyHarris Company, who employed the inventors to construct a trial machine in Melbourne, which was duly tested and then taken to the works in Canada. Its These machines manufacture was entered upon and under the name of the "" Reaper Thresher"" was offered for sale in Australia in 1911-12. The Australian manufacturers were actively working also, but not having the vast selling organizations of the American firms, they at first made small headway with this type of machine. But a novel and important improvement in the method of taking off the heads was invented and patented by Hedley Shepherd Taylor, of Henty, New South Wales (under patents dated 22nd October, 1913, and numbered 10989). While retaining the comb of the harvester and the knife of the binder, he dispensed with the binder reel. This reel, which swept back the ears of grain from the comb, was replaced by a double disc spiral, which forced the heads from the knife to the",55,Boycott Butter

424,,"' Mr GREENE!I tried to-obtain, for9036 difference. I imagine that the sources which the honourable member for Dampier acknowledged were the same as those from which the Argus got information some time ago, to which I replied in the columns of that newspaper. To my communication the Argus had no other reply than to simply say that I was a ""bumptious individual."" There has never been any answer to the reply which I sent to the Argus on that occasion. Why? They could not answer it, because the information given to the Argus from that particular source, directly or indirectly, was false information. It was information which it was perfectly easy for me, with the resources at my disposal, to show was false. I do not know whether the prices, as stated by the honourable member for Dampier, are accurate or not, but there is certainly no question at all as to the prices in Australia and in New Zealand at the time the Tariff was tabled. We had the prices then in our hands, and could compare them. There was no question then as to the position. As I have already stated, I have here a list of eighty different items, and in every case at that time the New Zealand price was higher than the Australian price. In some cases it was very much higher; in some cases it was only a few shillings higher; but in no case was it lower than the Australian price. In connection with every one of these items, there was no duty on the article in New Zealand. duty imposed on every one of them in Australia. It varied. In some cases it was 5 per cent. I speak of reapers, binders, and mowers. Oh hay rakes it was 10 per cent., on grain fertilizer drills it was 30 per cent., on spring tooth cultivators it was 25 per cent., on maize cultivators 25 per cent., on maize drills 30 per cent., on disc harrows, diamond harrows, spring tooth harrows, and on various kinds of ploughs, including gang ploughs, four-furrow ploughs, disc ploughs, and so on, there was a duty in Australia of 25 per cent. I do not propose to read the whole of this list of items to the Committee, as it is a very long one, but I shall quote a few of them to show that there is no question as to what the prices were at the time this Tariff was tabled. are different from others that have been quoted this afternoon. Mr Greene. Tariff. [REPRESENTATIVES.] Tariff. that is so or not. At the time the Tariff was tabled, I got out this list of items, and in the case of every one of them the price in New Zealand was higher than the price in Australia notwithstanding the fact that there was a duty on the article here. Eor reapers and binders, 5 feet, the cash price in New Zealand was Â£76, and the price in Australia was Â£75 10s., with a duty of 5 per cent, on the article.

I have not made these comparisons since that time.

Sewing machines are now being made in this country, and I should like to know whether the Minister( Mr Greene) is in earnest in submitting the proposed duties. for Trade and Customs) [10.9] -As I explained before, this is one of the deferred duties, depending on whether the industry is established. However, I have no objection, if the honourable mem1 ber for Dampier( Mr Gregory) would prefer to alter the date from 1922 to 1923, though this duty will not be imposed unless the industry is definitely established to such an extent as to reasonably be able to supply Australian requirements. moving an amendment. it quite clear that this is a deferred duty, placed in the Tariff as the definite promise of Parliament to anybody who establishes the industry; it means nothing more. am pleased to be able to point out that the big newspaper will be able to get its monoline or linotype in free of duty, while the poor widow will have to pay a duty of Â£3 on her sewing machine. [10.11] I intended to rise before the honourable member for Dampier( Mr Item 169 (Machinery, viz:, linotype, Gregory) spoke, and it was that ""poor widow woman"" that I wished to speak of. There have been no profiteers like the exploiters of sewing machines in Australia in the last few years. The metalwork in the very best sewing machine, with all the inflated prices due to the war, is worth about Â£5, but with a little cabmetmaking thrown in they charge from Â£17 to Â£20 for it. If , thirty-five years ago, a duty had been placed on sewing machines in Victoria to encourage their local manufacture, as was then proposed, we should have been getting them for Â£10 or Â£12 each. As it is, they have, this market on their own, and have exploited the people of Australia. We have had the values of these machines explained to us time after time by those associated with their manufacture, and we know that what I am saying is a fact. In those days it was not the "" poor widow woman,"" but the poor seamstress that waspleaded for. The Free Traders pictured in harrowing terms the position of the poor seamstress in Australia, who had io work from the first thing in the morning till the last thing at night by candlelight, and the injustice of taxing the sewing machine by which she earned her living. taxing her candle, too. see this duty included in the schedule, but Â£2 10s. is not enough, though it is a start. I am sure that the manufacture of sewing machines would be undertaken properly in Australia if a decent opportunity were offered. As in the case of the wheelbarrow, there is nothing much ingenious> about the machine. The metalwork is all cast, and there are no great engineering difficulties associated with it. There ia nothing in it but what can be made in Australia. If we cannot get new patents we should compel Singers and Wertheims to come here and manufacture their machines locally, instead of bringing them out in pieces and assembling: them here. I believe that hundreds of thousands of pounds might have been saved to Australia long ago and another industry established, by means of a duty on this item.

The articles enumerated in . this item affect mining, which is one of those industries that have done a great deal towards the development of every other occupation in Australia. Every duty put on the machinery used in that industry means practically an impost on the industry itself. During the past five years it has had many imposts put upon it. Not only will it have to stand any increases in the Tariff, hut it has had to bear, in almost every instance, the extra cost imposed upon it by the conditions existing now as compared <with the pre-war period. There is not an article used in mining which has not shown a rise in price to the extent of at least 25 per cent, since 1914, whilst in some cases the price has increased ten or twelvefold. Mining, at present, needs the greatest protection that Australia can give it. that the duties decrease the price? covered by sub-items A to p have increased in price. The duties on them have been raised, and that increase must be passed on, first of all, to the mineowner, then through the mine-owner to the workman in the mine, and then through him to the industry. I shall not say, as the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) does, that I do not care a jot for the manufacturer or the mine-owner. I do care for the mine-owner, and I care also for the men working in the mines and for the mining industry itself. If there were no men to put capital into mines, we should have no mining industry, and there would be no scope for miners to work. No man in that industry, whether employer or employee, begrudges any one doing well, beday might be a mine-owner to-morrow. I represent one portion of the mining industry, where the best possible conditions have been created by co-operation between employer and employed.

No doubt the honourable member thinks that, because he was over there during an election campaign, he knows all about Kalgoorlie, though I suppose he did not go outside the main street. I speak from a life-long connection with the mining industry in Kalgoorlie. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) has expressed his indifference as to its future, but I can assure him that if this impost is placed upon the industry, it cannot be carried on much longer.
