Asking The Prime Minister A Question With Reference To A Matter Which Is Agitating The Minds Of The People Of This Country I N An Almost Unprecedented Degree. I Wish To Know I F He Has Received Any Information From The Home Government Or The South African Authorities With Regard To The Execution Of Two Australian Officers, Lieu","tenant Morant and Lieutenant Hancock, and the imprisonment of a third, Lieutenant Witton. I think it needs no words of mine to assure the right honourable and learned gentleman that a complete elucidation of this matter is awaited with very intense interest in Australia. obtain information. I need not say that it would be most unwise for any of us to come to a conclusion or form any judgment on the subject in view of the conflicting accounts that have appeared. Much of the information I have received has been derived entirely from private conversations, and under circumstances which forbid the repeti tion of the conversations to the House. Such information as I have been able to afford has been stated by me as it has been presented in the press. It appears that on the wounding of CaptainH u n t and the retirement of the Carbineers, who were outnumbered on that occasion, they were reinforced and came back to the scene. They there found Captain Hunt who had been shot, I believe, through the lungs-dead , and seriously battered about, with his neck broken-whethe r before or after death I cannot say-and with his eyes protruding. On the capture of a Boer laager there was found a Boer who, unlike his comrades, was not able to escape, being wounded in the foot. He was in khaki and had some article of the clothing of Captain Hunt in hispossession. Hewas tried hydrumhead court-martial by the three lieutenants, and on his being convicted he was shot. Further information, so far as I am able to disclose it , goes to this effect:-That the same party of the corps captured two parties of Boers, one numbering eight and another Wednesday, Z April, 1902. I rise for the purpose of I am endeavouring to",14,Setup

3,Mr Barton,"numbering three. On their capture of these two parties no court-martial apparently -was held. There does not seem to be any clear evidence that the Boers were caught wearing the uniform of the British army, so that that point is still in doubt. These men were shot, and I am not in any way credibly informed that they were submitted to court-martial. It remains to be seen whether they were identifiable with those who had maltreated CaptainH u n t before or after death. There is no satisfactory information on that point. If they could not be identified, of course honourable members will form their conclusions as to whether they should have been shot. The other officer who has been mentioned, Major Lenehan, was at a distance of 70 miles from these occurrences. On their return to or towards Pietersburg the three lieutenants were placed under arrest, and they were tried some four months afterwards. Lieutenant Morant, who had gone out from Australia in one of the contingents, and was the son of an English admiral; Lieutenant Hancock, who came from Australia, and was an Australian ; and Lieutenant Witton, were all convicted of ordering, or being accomplices in I do not know exactly how it standsthe murder of these Boers. The two first mentioned were shot; the sentence of the third was commuted, I believe, by the Commander-in-Chief in South Africa, to -imprisonment for life. Major Lenehan, against whom several charges were brought, was eventually convicted on only one-that of having failed to send in any report. His defence was that he had been exempted from sending in a report. Whether that is correct or not, evidently the court-martial overruled it. He was convicted, and received the sentence of a slight reprimand, and was afterwards escorted to Capetown, where he re-embarked for Australia. ment. direct facts '1 have, and as to some of them the information does not leave my mind in any state of certainty. ter say whether this is official information 1 able to disclose of the facts as they have come to my ears, and I am not now making any breach of confidence. I am discharging my duty to the House as far as I can. official ? information in this matter so far as I can see, and for this reason*-: All these men were serving in an Imperial corps under the regulations of the British army, and as soldiers of that army. They were not in any sense employed by Australia, nor were they in a corps that was raised in Australia, or was distinctly Australian. They were liable to be treated according to the King's regulations and the legislation governing these matters ; and it is clear, whatever opinion anybody may hold as to the justice of the case, that they were duly tried in the manner in which any other alleged offenders are tried. There is one remaining fact to mention. Between their arrest and the passing of sentence the men were called on to serve, and did serve, in the defence of Pietersburg against Commandant Meyer. Those comprise all the facts which I can state with any pretence to authenticity, and of course I do not vouch for some of them, because they are still left in doubt. I am endeavouring to obtain information, but it rests entirely with the military authorities in South Africa as to the extent of the information which they will give, that being a matter for them exclusively to determine, having regard to the maintenance of discipline in the Army.

No advantage to the revenue is derived from insisting upon tbe payment of the full duty on under-proof spirits, because it leads to the spirit being imported at proof and ""broken down"" after its arrival in the Commonwealth. Therefore the revenue does not profit from the exclusion of good brands of under-proof spirits. The statistical returns show that in 20,444 gallons of brandy in case as against 9,800 gallons in bulk, and 12S,963 gallons of whisky in case as compared with 37,000 gallons in bulk. Thus nearly three-fourths of the whisky imported was bottled at the distilleries under the guarantee of people whose very living depends upon the maintenance of the standard of the spirit they are purveying. In the same year Victoria imported 39,551 gallons of case brandy,und 65,000 gallons of bulk brandy, and the importations of case whisky amounted to 179,750 gallons against 393,592 gallons of whisky in bulk. In Victoria and New South Wales the great proportion of the spirits was introduced in bulk, and was "" broken down "" within the States by being mixed with water or something else. If only water were used, it would be comparatively harmless. duced here in .bottle is ""broken down"" with water also. MrV . L .

MrV . L. SOLOMON -If the honorable member thinks that, he cannot know very much about the spirit trade and the quality of the spirits imported here. It is welli known that the moment that one of the-leading brands of whisky goes off in quality 1900 South Australia imported its trade is lost, so that a certain amount. of protection is afforded to consumers by the importation, of whisky in the bottle under the labels of known reputable firms. To argue to the contrary is absurd, and it . is equally nonsensical to say that in the bulk of the hotels in Melbourne consumers can obtain as good whisky -is is provided for them in the great. majority of the Adelaide hotels. I put it to the right honourable gentlemen,, who have had the benefit of the advice of their oflicers, whether there will be one penny piece of advantage to the revenue by adhering to the bad example set by the old Victorian Tariff, of having a straight-out duty of so much, whether the spirits be 16 per cent, under proof or whether they be absolutely proof spirits? Thefigures show distinctly and clearly that, there can be no possible advantage in it . . On the other hand, from the point of view of the. interest of the consumers, it is best that the rule which has been in vogue in two States, of making an allowance for under-proof spirit, should beadopted throughout the Commonwealth. If that rule is not adopted, there will be a bad look out indeed for the consumers. In nine cases out of ten the stuff that is purveyed as whisky in thehotels of Melbourne and Sydney is not as. good whisky as is sold under the labels of reputable firms.

L . Solomon, by 34 votes to 16. I have heard no reason given why the committee should reverse its previous decision. There was practically a consensus of opinion that we should be doing all that was necessary if in this connection we adopted the practice of four of the States rather than that of two, even though one of the two should be my own State. Provision has, however, been made for an allowance to be made on under-proof spirits which had been shipped prior to the introduction of the Tariff, or which were in bond. A very important reason that was given against the honourable member's proposal was that, it was a desirable thing that we should have the important industry of bottling spirits conducted within the Commonwealth. .1 am credibly informed, on the best authority, that the two great firms of Burke and Walker are at the present moment making arrangements for the bottling of their spirits in Australia. Why should they not do so ? Let us have the benefit of this trade. Our contention in favour of retaining the provision of the Tariff as it stands is supported by what has happened since, and I do not think the committee is in the humour to effect the change I say without the slightest hesitaproposed. there may be a reason in favour of the amendment which has escaped the notice of The imported whisky the Minister for Trade and Customs. If honourable members will turn to section 40 of the Distillation Act they will find that it provides as follows :No entry authorizing the removal of spirits shall be passed in respect of spirits of a lower strength than 25 per centum under proof, nor in respect of a smaller quantity than 10 gallons."" For these reasons I On turning to the .part of the Tariff dealing with excise, it will be found that from barley malt, molasses, or maize is 12s. 6d. Supposing that the spirit out-as it generally is-a t about 16'5 under prool, this means that we are giving the local distillers a protection of 4s. 8d. per dozen. This is rather an important point, as it gives an undue preference to the local distillers which I do not think it was intended to give. We have already given We have discussed this matter -a preference of Is. 6d. per gallon of proof spirit, and in cases where the spirit is made from wine the preference to the local distiller is 3s. per gallon. Buti t was certainly never intended, so far .as I am aware, from reading and hearing the discussion, that on every dozen bottles of spirit sent out we should give an additional advantage to the local distiller of 4s. Sd. per dozen, or 2s. 4d. a gallon. Is the Minister aware of that ? If not, it is a very good reason for making an alteration. It is evident that a large amount' of revenue may be sacrificed in this ""way, and in view of the fact that the Treasurer has complained of the way the committee has cut down his revenue, I urge that, as we allow",17,Tariff

33,Mr Conroy (Werriwa),"Possiblyspirit 25 per cent, under proof to go out of the local distilleries, there is no good reason why we should not make the same allowance in regard to imported spirit. ment of the honourable member for South Australia, Mr V. L . Solomon, would have the effect of slightly diminishing the revenue. There are a certain number of brands of spirits that would be imported in bottle in any case, and would pay the higher duty. I happen to know that that is so from friends of my own in the wine and spirit trade. I also know that in Sydney two firms bave been taking premises with a view of bottling reputable and well known brands locally. That is in course of arrangement, and I think that the revenue aspect will not be materially altered one way or the other: although the revenue will be slightly greater under the proposal in the Tariff. The honourable member for South Australia, Mr at a strength much below that of brandy Solomon, has made one of those extravagant statements which simply defeat their object. He spoke about the inferior class of spirit which he alleges comes into New South Wales and other Statesi n bulk. It must, however, be apparent to the meanest -comprehension that where there are publicans of reputable character it pays them, as an absolute matter of business, to buy bulk whisky of greater maturity than that to which ordinary bottled whisky can pretend, and to give it to the customers at the same price as the latter. By taking bulk whisky, which is bought on bond certificates, the publicans save the cost of capsules, labels, corks, bottles, straws, and cases, the last of which can only realize a small amount as second-hand goods in the city, and, possibly nothing at all in the country districts. All this money is saved in addition to the cost of advertising, which is so largely resorted to in the case of bottled whisky, For that reason a very large portion, if not the greatest portion of tbe bulk whisky sold in New South Wales, at any rate for years past, has been equal to, if not superior, to thecase whisky. I am excluding a very superior case whisky which is guaranteed to be ten or twelve years old. spirit sold in a vast majority of hotels, and even in the best of hotels, it is not so . good as the bulk whisky, as may be gathered from the fact that when a publican wants to treat his friends he always 32 E 2 advises the latter. I do not think tlie committee have been given any reason for reversing their previous decision. The honourable and learned member for Werriwa slightly misconstrued the position so far as concerns the comparison between the 25 per cent, under proof allowed in respect of spirits going out of any Commonwealth distillery, and tlie charge which is made on imported proof spirit. There is no protection at all so far as that aspect is concerned. Spirit winch is brought in in bulk can be broken down to any degree. MrV . L .

It was pointed out, in regard to port and sherry, that unless we were careful we should be practically providing a prohibitory rate on these particular wines. ThatI do not think we intend to do. We have found from our inquiries that 35 per cent, is rather low as compared with the law which had obtained hitherto in the States, where the rate has approximated to 40 per cent., where it has not actually reached that degree. Under the circumstances we took some trouble, particularly in regard to port and sherrywhich are particularly affected by these duties as being of a higher strength, when they reached the Commonwealth at any rate-to obtain statistics from Melbourne, which we have no reason to believe is different in this respect from other places, as toâwhat was the strength of the wines admitted. We found that out of 53 samples of port wine which were tested, 49 were over 35 per cent, of proof spirit, whilst only four were under that percentage. of the 49 samples ? here.

47,Mr Watson,"The provision referred to that can be done. I think we may as well make a provision of the character that we now suggest, and when we have obtained a little further knowledge on tbe subject we may if necessary permit Australian wines to be further fortified. That is a task which does not commend itself very much to me. I should be sorry to find it necessary, for the chief charm of our wines is often held to be their purity and their freedom from fortification. Of course it would be possible to provide that this provision shall come into force when our Distillation Act has been so relaxed. That, however, would be a cumbrous procedure. Whatever is for the real good of the wine industry is bound to be placed on the statute book before long ; and although I hope we shall be very careful in regard to relaxing the provisions of the Distillation Act in reference to the fortifying of Australian wines, we shall have power to do so if necessary. I propose that we may, on payment of the extra duty, relax, as regards the strong wines, the practical prohibition which was previously imposed, keeping in our own hands, power to alter, as we may think fit, our legislation with reference to distillation. The Government proposal does not seem to meet the requirements of the case. The Minister states that of the samples of imported wines which were examined by his direction none contained 40 degrees of proof spirit. I have it on the authority of those who ought to be aware of the facts that these wines generally have a strength of 40 per cent, of alcohol, and run up to 42 per -cent. that character before me, and that was why I checked it . these figures relate to one class of port wine, but it would be curious if they disagreed with those of others. In common justice to the consumers we ought to see that they are not penalized by being made liable to pay the duty which is imposed on spirits. If Ministers would agreethat the still wines in bulk should be liable to the duty as proposed with an increase of 3d., instead of 6d. per gallon for every degree above the limit of 35 per cent., and up to 40 or 42 per cent., the exigencies of the case would be met. have commenced at 40 or 42 per cent., but the Government have started with 35 per cent, in the Tariff. I think they have commenced here in the wrong place, as possibly they have done in other cases. If the Minister adopts my suggestion, there will be no great divergence from his own intended line of action, while I think the result will be more satisfactory to himself, and, I am sure, to the.great bulk of the consumers. the best of intentions the Government have proposed something which, if adopted, would be very unsatisfactory. The question that I put to the right honourable member for Tasmania, Sir Edward Braddon"" Why commence at 35 degrees ?"" is answered by the fact that 35 per cent, of proof spirit is the limit to which colonial wines may be fortified under the Distillation Act. Section 59 of that Act absolutely prohibits Australian wine being fortified under any circumstances so as to contain more than 35 per cent, of proof spirit. When the Tariff was introduced this very item recognised that fact, and whilst it placed a duty of 6s. per gallon on imported wines in bulk, it provided that if they contained more than 35 degrees of proof spirit they should pay a duty of 14s. per gallon. That was proposed with the object of placing imported wines on the same footing as Australian wines so far as ( the mercantile world was concerned. are not fortified to that extent. an interjection by me, said that the wines to which he referred were fortified. I m ported fortified wines, therefore, are to be allowed to come in at an advance of 6d. per gallon duty per degree when containing over 35 degrees of proof spirit. It is not a question of free-trade or protection so much as it is a question of placing this prohibition on Australian wines, and giving the advantage to the imported wine. That is not fair. It seems to me that so long as the Distillation Act remains in its present form, we cannot consistently adopt this provision.

Any Australian vigneron who dares to contravene this provision exposes himself to a penalty of Â£ 2 0 . It is not for us to say that an A ct of this Parliament is invalid. that the Act was invalid. has no right to say that. We passed the Act as a valid Act. While the provision stands, we ought not to do something which is distinctly differentiating in favour of the imported wine. We ought to be consistent, and if we are inconsistent at all it ought not to be on the side that injures our own people. may be remembered thatlraisedthisquestion at an earlier stage, and that for the reasons given by the last speaker the Government saw fit to stand by their proposals in the Tariff. I am glad that the Government have seen some reason to recede from the position which they then assumed. Some Australian wine-makers have already asked that they shall have permission to exceed tlie limits in the Distillation Act, because it is thorities say that really good wines require absolutely essential that a larger quantity of spirits should be used to preserve certain wines in crossing the tropics. As regards imported wines, it is said that there are brands of well-known repute that will not carry across the tropics except with a higher margin even than the 38 per cent, allowed. It is said that really good port wines require to contain up to 42 per cent, spirit to carry across the tropics to Australia. If that is so, it does seem rather Sydney's interpretation of the provision in hard to destroy a legitimate trade without any sufficient reason. As regards the Distillation Act prohibiting the use of more than 35 per cent, proof spirit in Australian wine, I would point out to the honourable and learned member for In d i that the section which deals with the matter says "" fortified under this Act."" What do these words refer to 1 I hold that there is a concession of duty given on spirits used for the fortifito contain 40 per cent, of proof spirit. The cation of Australian wine, that it has to be given under the supervision of an officer, and that it will only be given up to proof spirit of 35 per cent. The wines pass, after that concession, from the supervision of federal officers into the free stores of the owner, and they can be If the Act is fortified if it is desired up to 80 per cent., with this proviso : that no concession will be given on the spirit used for the fortification. That is the position of the Australian wines, and unless the State authorities choose to follow up the action of tbe Commonwealth the degree of fortificaJ tion cannot be interfered with. We have representations from winegrowers who export certain varieties of port wines that a higher percentage of spirit is actually necessary for the preservation of wines in crossing the tropics, and we have the importers saying the same thing. The only question now is what percentage of spiritshould be allowed over 35 per cent. ? I aminformed by several good authorities that it should be allowed up to 42 per cent. Sixpence on one per cent, increase is considerably higher than the duty on proof spirit. Therefore these wines, while they are allowed, in, have to pay a certain penalty. The wines are penalized sixpence for every per cent, above 35 per cent., therefore I think that 42 per cent, might be placed as the limit. It may be that there is only a small proportion over 38 per cent.; but these maybe the very wines that require the additional percentage of spirit. Competent auan additional percentage of spirit. It will not interfere with Australian wines, because they can have 80 per cent, of spirit in them and not come under federal control. I suggest to the Minister for Trade and Customs that he will be perfectly safe in making 42 per cent, the limit, and that thenhe will be penalizing some of the wines. agree with the honourable member for Norththe Distillation Act. The question is whether wines containing over 35 per cent, of proof spirit shall be imported. We are charging 2s. per gallon more on 35 per cent, port wines than on champagnes, consequently the revenue may be seriously interfered with.

I am inclined to think that the contention of the honourable member for North Sydney is correct, and it may be, as stated by the honourable and learned member for South Australia, Mr Glynn, that the provisions of the Distillation Act relathas once been passed we should never cast ing to the limit of strength are ultra vires. On the other hand, neither of these contentions may be correct, and our local producers may be placed at a disadvantage of 3 per cent, as compared with the importers of wines. If the Distillation Act is valid, as we have to assume for the time being, we shall, by imposing a lower import duty, encourage tbe introduction of wines containing more than 35 per cent, of proof spirit. When the Distillation Act was under discussion, I was under the impression that a strength of 35 per cent, of alcohol was provided for, instead of 35 per cent, of proof spirit, which would be roughly about half the strength of absolute alcohol. A vast area of country is now devoted to the production of dry wines whioh could be more suitably used for the production of sweet wines. The incomes of wine-growers would be doubled if they were able to produce sweet wines, but unless they are permitted to fortify their wines up to at least 38 per cent, of proof spirit they cannot with safety send them away to the markets of the world. In isolated cases they may be able to do so, but not generally. Having been convinced of the necessity of raising the limit in the interests of those who export wine to the Commonwealth, I hope Ministers will be prepared to amend the Distillation Act and place our local producers upon the same flevel as wine-growers abroad. If this is not done I think it would be improper to make any alteration. members have referred to some expression of opinion on my part as to the constitutionTreasurer consider that the duties that have ality of section 59 of the Distillation Act. My recollection is that when I moved the amendment which now finds a place in the section, prohibiting the fortification of AusTreasurer and other honourable members retralian wines with any other than wine spirit up to a strength of 35 per cent, of proof spirit, I proposed it as an addendum to the section, because if any question were raised as to the constitutionality of my amendment the same objection would arise as to the validity of the section to which I proposed to add it . I did not express an opinion as to the constitutionality of the section. I do not think that at this stage we should raise any doubt as to the validity of the provision. It is one thing to raise a question of that sort when a matter is being discussed, but when an A ct any doubt upon the efficacy of our own enactment. The suggestion that the Minister for Trade and Customs should give a distinct assurance that steps will be taken to increase the limit of fortification, under the Distillation Act, from 35 per cent, to 38 per cent, is, of course, a matter for the Minister to consider. I am not prepared, however, to support this proposal, even though such an assurance is given, because we do not know whether it will be carried out. The proper course would be to defer the present suggestion until both matters can be dealt with at the same time. We ought not to place this burden upon tbe Australian producer, on the off chance of our being able to bring him up to the same level hereafter. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia).

Yet New South Wales, with a limit of 40 per cent, in strength, had a revenue of Â£15,900 from imported wines; whilst South Australia, with a limit of 35 per cent., which was virtually prohibitive, had a revenue of only Â£1,501. So that, although having a third of the population of New South Wales, South Australia only derived about one-tenth of the revenue from this source. .the value of South Australian wines. MrV . L .

In four States of the group they had a limit of 40 pei' cent., in another 43 per cent. In the four States there has never been any complaint on the part of the wine-growers as to that limit of strength. Buti n framing this new Tariff we have it constantly impressed upon us that it is necessary to lower the strength at which we will permit the importation of port wine and sherry to be introduced to 35 per cent. prohibited our own vignerons from going higher. MrV . L . SOLOMON -Becaus e we made a blunder-that was pointed out at the time by experts in the wine trade-w e -are, ergo, to repeat it by making another ! Australia is now producing very good port wine, and the local wiue is fairly well protected. The strength that has obtained in the past in tlie various States, and -about which there has been no complaint whatever, is a fair standard upon which to act now. If it is necessary to alter the Distillation A ct in this respect it will be easy enough to do so. The Government, with an absolute majority behind ""them, could pass a Bill through all its stages within a very short time for that purpose. But because an error of judgment has been made in that respect we should not attempt to rectify it by putting an embargo upon the import trade. The importers claim that the better classes of sherry and port cannot be imported under the strength of from 37 to 39 per cent. Those are figures given by the leading experts in Victoria and South Australia. Mr .KINGSTON -Then 38 is the medium? MrV . L . SOLOMON -But the Government seek to make it 35. in up to 38, but impose a little extra d u t y; and that is what is being fought against. MrV . L .

Why not provide as a compromise that 3S should be the percentage, that being the medium between 37 and 39, at which most of these superior wines are imported 1 That would be an easy way out of the difficulty, and the Government could then allow the other wines to go up to 40 or 42 per cent, by payment of something additional.

111,Mr Thomson (North Sydney),"Preper cent, what is the best way to accomplish a distinction ? I would suggest that instead of going up 6d. every point, the Minister should make wine up to 38 per cent, subject to an extra Is. duty, and wine from 38 per cent, up to 40 per cent, subject to another Is. There would be only two points in dispute there, that is as to 38 per cent. and. 40 per cent. wine. But as it is there are five points of dispute with the importer, and very fine points too --as to whether the 1 per cent, has been reached or not. Every degree is a point of dispute. Limit that either by making the five degrees subject to one rate, or by making two rates for the five degrees. If that course is adopted, there will be only one or two points of dispute between the importers and the department. The officers will be saved a great deal of trouble, and greater satisfaction will be given in the administration of the Act. ber for North Sydney is suggesting that for 36 per cent., 37 per cent., and 3S per cent, wine, we should charge an extra Is., and for 39 per cent, and 40 per cent., an extra 2s. -second stage. to be said in favour of that. There might be something to be said in favour of making a medium rate for the whole lot. There is not very much difficulty in determining the strength of the wine. I have various instances worked out in decimals. AlthoughI acknowledge that there is something to be said in favour of the honourable member's suggestion on the score of convenience of administration at tlie same time. I prefer to have the amendment as it stands. Amendment agreed to. MrV . L . SOLOMON (South Australia). I move That the amendment be amended by the omission of the figure "" 6 "" with a view to insert in lieu thereof thefigure""3."" Threepence would be double the proportionate rate upon spirits. According to the duty on spirits it would be about l^d. for each point above 35 to 40 per cent. A t 6d. per gallon it is three or four times the proportionate rate of duty. Even at 3d. per gallon ordinary imported port wines and sherries which come in at from 39 to 40 per cent, would pay at the rate of 7s. 6d. per gallon. ThatI think is a very fair duty, and undoubtedly a very fair protection to Australian vignerons. Question-That the figure "" 6 "" proposed to be omitted stand part of the proposed amendment-put .

Gd."" be added. This will have the effect of increasing the present fixed duty from 6s. 3dto 6s. 6d., and of abolishing the ad valorem duty of 15 per cent. Taking the average of the cigars imported into Victoriai n 1S97-98 aud 1899 tlie price was 7s. 7d. per lb. A ID per cent, ad valorem duty upon this would represent Is. 3d. per lb., and a fixed duty of 6s. 3d. added would bring the total duty to 7s. 6d. per lb. The excise duty is Is. (id. per lb., and the duty upon imported leaf is Is. 6d. per lb., or a total of 3s. Therecigars, which are usually sold in bond, as fore, the protection under a duty of 7s. 6d. per lb. amounts to 4s. 6d. per lb., which, I need scarcely say, is a very high figure. The weight of ordinary cigars is about 12 lbs. per 1000, whilst heavy-weights run to 15 lbs. per 1000. A protection of 4s'. 6d. per lb. averages on ordinary cigars Â£ 2 14s. per 1000, and on heavy-weights Â£ 3 7s. 6d. per 1000. As the Treasurer has already conceded a reduction of this duty, I think he might go to the further reasonable length now suggested. information contained in the report of the chief inspector of factories in Victoria for 1900 as to wages in the cigar trade, the protection now afforded amounts to 143 per cent, on the wages paid. the committee will not make any alteration i u the duty. We fought this matter out very fully when it was first before us. It was then proposed that a duty of Ss. 6d. should be imposed upon Havanna cigars, and -6s. 6d. upon other cigars, it being admitted that the better class of goods should contribute more to the revenue. Now we are asked to consent to a duty of 6s. 6d. per lb. all round, but as the committee, by 35 to 22 votes, refused to adopt the other proposal, I feel certain that they will not agree to make the duty uniform at tis. Gd. per lb. As this matter has been very fully debated we might come to a division at once. would remind the Treasurer that the circumstances are entirely different from those . . . . Cigars, obtaining when we were dealing with this matter before. We then had a whole series of composite duties still to deal with, but these have since one by one disappeared. The Treasurer has time and again recognised that the feeling of the committee was against these composite duties, and has abandoned them. members favour a composite duty as applied to cigars, but would not adopt the same principle in regard to other articles. good reason for the adoption of composite duties in regard to other items as in tlie case of cigars. As a matter of fact, the composite duty is more objectionable as applied to cigars than to any other line in the Tariff. No drawback is allowed upon importers ""will not hold large, duty-paid stocks if they cannot get drawback upon re-export. When a man buys in bond, hemust, under the composite duty, obtain from the vendor before he purchases particulars as to the duty that will have to be paid. He cannot know the cost of what he is buying unless he ascertains this from the vendor before purchasing Consequently, the cost of the cigars has to be disclosed. It is not right to expect traders in cigars to According to the declare the cost before a sale is made. Business would be impossible under these conditions. The Minister gave as a reason for composite duties that, whilst protecting the local maker of low-grade articles, they would make the users of the higher-grade goods pay something more to the revenue. I trust that If the ad valorem principle is a good one to apply in order to make the consumer pay something more to the revenue, that something should be entirely in proportion to the value, but under the system of composite duties only a portion of the duty is being collected on the tic? valorem principle. Cigars which cost Is. pay only 15 per cent, upon that shilling. Surelyi f there were ever a reason for applying this principle it was to be found in the case of boots, and yet in that instance Ministers abandoned the composite duties. If the Treasurer desires to make a distinction between the .high-grade and the low-grade goods, he can do so by imposing a higher rate of duty upon the better class of cigars. The protection now -afforded to the.local manufacturer is 4s. 6d. per lb., as against 2s. 6d. per lb. previously",29,Pairs

The proposal of the honourable and learned member for South Australia gets over any difficulty with regard to labour, because it is shown that the duty represents nearly double the whole cost of the labour involved in the manufacture of Australian-made cigars. ' What is now proposed as import duty is more than the duty charged in any State previously, except Tasmania, where the duty was 6d. ' more. I quite anticipated that the Treasurer or the Minister for Trade and Customs would accept the previous decision of the committee in connection with composite duties. I urge them to do so. This is the last duty of that sort, and it is the most deleterious in its effects. If they abandon it they complete the symmetry of the Tariff, inasmuch as all of these duties which they looked upon with favour-and for which I am willing to admit there was on the surface something to be saidhave been abandoned with this exception. As to tbe 6s. 6d. duty proposed by the honorablo member for South Australia, it is the same duty as has been put on cigarettes. A lesser margin has been allowed on cigarettes, but this is the same import duty, so that we unify the Tariffi n this respect by adopting the amendment. further proposition can be made, which personally I should agree to, that an extra 2s. be put upon Havanna cigars, which are of a higher grade.

123,"Paterson, A. Mr Thomson (North Sydney)","IFrom actual cleaning operations of different shipments we learn that from a given quantity of coffee in cherry the yield of cleaned raw coffee is 50 per cent, to 65 per cent.; that is to say thai; nearlyone-half of the material on which duty is demanded is not coffee at all. From coffee in parchment, 74 to 82 per cent, of cleaned raw coffee is obtained. The present administration of the Tariff in regard to this item has a far wider effect than would at first sight be supposed. Most of the coffee in theseforms comes from the South Sea Islands, and some of it from the New Hebrides. Owing to the small quantity grown in the scattered positions on the islands, it does not pay to erect machinery for the purpose of cleaning the' coffee ; and hitherto coffee in parchment and in cherry has been imported and cleaned under Customs supervision, duty being charged on the result only. The effect of the present administration is to drive most of the trade, in connection with the New Hebrides and adjacent islands into the hands of the French. Surely that is absurd, seeing that the duty charged on the husks affords no protection. land. industry is protected by the duty on the coffee. Coffee can be brought from Ceylon, Java, and elsewhere already cleaned. from the islands in that form. cleaned on the islands for the reasons I have already given. There is cleaning machinery on one or two of the islands, where a considerable quantity is grown, but most of the coffee is. produced in small patches in many different islands which may be separated not by 10 or 20 miles, but by 100 or 1,000 miles. from the South Sea Islands1 ing quantity, and surely the trade is of advantage to Australia. The question is whether we shall deliberately cast aside trade which is not from Central America or Java, but from islands inhabited by our own people. Ought we not to encourage the connection which we desire to maintain under the British flag ? The steamers which run to these islands have the greatest difficulty in conducting their trade in competition with the German and French subsidized shipping companies, and to continue the present administration of the Tariff in this connection will deprive the vessels of valuable freight and necessitate the payment of larger postal subsidies by the Federal Government. It is absurd to deliberately reject trade when the difficulty at the Customs can be surmounted in the way in which it has hitherto been surmounted; namely, by having the coffee cleaned in the presence of a Customs officer. This is done in the case of rice and other commodities, but in regard to coffee importers are made to pay on the husk. whatever in this matter, except that I desire to see our connection with the South Sea Islands kept up and British influence maintained. I cannot conceive a single genuine reason against the practice which has hitherto' prevailed. The importer pays for the services of the Customs-house officer, and cleaning under customs supervision to a certain extent gives labour within the Commonwealth. on tea imported in packets. has to be cut into two parts, efforts have been made, to have that cutting done within the Commonwealth, but there seems an objection to that principle being applied in the present case. If the Minister for Trade and Customs says that he has no power to carry out my suggestion without having express words in the Tariff-althoug h that is a power which has been exercised by other Ministers of Customs from time immemorial-the n I must move tbe insertion of such words. Minister for Trade and Customs will not much coffee comes allow himself to be influenced by the arguments of the honourable member for North Sydney.

Husking the coffee is easily done; it merely means conveying the coffee from the different small plantations to one centre.

I am told that a little worm immediately attacks cleaned coffee and seriously damages it during transport. expert, but I am told that there is the same risk in regard to coffee beans as to grain, cigars, and other goods if they come in an uncovered state. I hope the Minister will not be influenced by the pleading of the honourable member for North Sydney. the Minister for Trade and Customs will adopt the suggestion thrown out by the honourable member for North Sydney. The practice of cleaning under supervision in the Customs has been in existence for the last 25 years; in fact, ever since coffee was produced in the islands. If better authority he required for the statement. I have made honourable members may refer to the I m perial Tariff, 1902, paragraph 167 of which providesCoffee in the husk, which has been delivered out of warehouse under bond for the removal of the husks, will be charged with duty ou all loss exceeding that due to the removal of the husks only. The estimate for the proportion of the husks is to be made on the results of actual experiments by the officers, or samples taken by thein tor the purpose. Sir include the parchment. kinds of husks. The coffee berry is like a cherry, and that is why it is called "" cherry."" There is an outer skin which contains two berries, which are encased in the silver skin. The one is the cherry, and the other is the parchment, but both are husks or refuse, which are equally valueless. They have to be removed before the article becomes the coffee of commerce. If duty is charged on the husks, then it will be levied on something which is not coffee. If the Minister refers to page 401 of the Imperial call the attention of the Minister for Trade 32 P Tariff, 1902, he will see that paragraph 475 statesI t makes a great deal Coffee imported in the husk may be delivered from the warehouse for the purpose of having the husk removed, upon bond being entered into, in the penalty of double the duty pajable on the goods, for the return of the coffee to the warehouse after the operation has been completed. That is when it is done out of bond. Security is given that the coffee will be returned in due course. The paragraph continuesPrior to the removal of the goods such samples are to be taken as may euable the officers in the warehouse to estimate the proportion of husks, and on the return of the goods duty is to be paid on any loss in excess of such proportion. I do not pose as an That fairly lays down the practice in Great Britain, and the honourable member for Herbert has been misled if he has been told that the coffee is sent in the form referred to by him in order to prevent it from becoming wormy. I understand that most of the coffee goes from the Islands to Sydney, and it will be seen at once that, if the husk is taken off at the Islands, the coffee comes in at 3d. per lb. Therefore it is evidently a mistake to charge anything on the husks, which are not coffee in any shape or form. hope that the Minister will agree-to the suggestion made by the honourable member for North Sydney. Most of the coffee grown in the Islands is imported into New South Wales; very little comes into Victoria. In this State they have always paid the duty on coffee itself, and not on coffee in the husks. If the coffee had been brought into Victoria in the same condition as that in which it is introduced in New South Wales, I am sure that those concerned in the industry would have brought the matter under the notice of the Government. no case has the duty been levied in the way now adopted by the Commonwealth Government. ascertain what it costs to clean a pound of coffee.

I do not believe it does, because I do not think for a moment that Queensland is a greedy State. Here is an honourable member who has a protection of 3d. per lb -5 0 per cent urging the Ministry to secure some better results by round-about methods of administration. Surelyi t is a round-about method to apply the words "" kiln dried"" to coffee. Coffee is not kiln dried-excep t in some case where the sun may not be sufficiently strong and artificial heat may be applied simply for drying it to the ordinary condition at which it is dutiable at 3d. per lb., and is called raw coffee. I am very glad that the Minister is going to make the regulation he has promised. He said that it was giving an' assistance to that black labour which we did not desire to encourage. It is doing nothing of the sort, because the cleaned coffee grown by black labor in Java and other places is allowed to come in at a duty of 3d. per lb. comes in under the same condition. Minister tries to charge duty on.the husks. Â£2 F 2 He states that the Government should not be asked to make an exception, but this system has been carried on for years, and should not be departed from unless good reason can be shown. No good reason has yet been shown for this departure. The Minister pleaded that Queensland might need more than the protection she will get. That State cannot get one penny more protection if husks are charged duty. She gets a protection on the raw coffee, and if this coffee in the husk is shut out, it does not prohibit competition with Central American and Javan coffee, which pays duty on the clean weight.

Wheni t first came under the notice of the committee the honourable member for Wentworth raised some slight objection to a duty upon oysters, and the Prime Minister who happened to be in a particularly generous frame of mind withdrew the proposal, which was dropped without further discussion. For some years past oyster beds have been cultivated in Queensland, and considerable expense has been incurred in carrying on the industry. This has been essential to the maintenance of an abundant supply of oysters, because the natural beds are being rapidly depleted. The report of the inspector of fisheries inQueensland to the 30th June, 1901, shows that during the twelve months then ending the exports of oysters from Queensland amounted to 11,747 bags valued at Â£15,2S8.

But one of the first principles of federation was that there should he Inter-State free-trade with protection against the world. Tens of thousands of people voted for federation on that account. New Zealand is not part of Australia. Only the other day a gentleman who is a native of New South Wales told me that there are thousands of acres of oyster beds in that State which only require a little cultivation to enable them to feed the whole Commonwealth, with oysters. I find that oysters are now four times the price that they were some years ago, and that monopolies have entered into the trade because of the absence of facilities for the encouragement of oyster culture. The protection asked for is not for Queensland alone. On the broad principle of enabling oyster culture to be encouraged and to be successful in all parts of our coast we should have a moderate duty. The oyster has been such a trivial article in the eyes of State Treasurers that they have never thought of a duty upon it , but so many duties have been knocked off in the Commonwealth that we have to be careful. If it is necessary to impose a tax upon New Zealand timber, we should also tax New Zealand oysters. In that country they have a better climate for oyster production. The New Zealand oyster is larger than the Australian, but not more wholesome. It is a very coarse article of diet. The Prime Minister agreed to strike oysters off the Tariff without consulting other honourable members or the Minister in charge, and it was understood that the question would be revived at a later stage. I am sorry that it should be discussed at all. I do not think it is worth discussing. should commend itself to every honourable member, and I trust it will be agreed to by a good majority. that honourable members opposite do not claim that a duty on oysters is important for the sake of encouraging the manufacture of wire netting because wire netting if of sufficiently small mesh would keep off the fish that prey upon the oysters' spawn ! It is ludicrous that we should be asked to retrace our steps on a matter of this sort. the business in this fashion, I may as well inform them that I am going to remain here for the rest of the year. I am inclined to think that the Opposition have been too peaceful altogether. When I look back upon our lost opportunities, I realize that it is simply and solely because we had not wearied out the Government supporters that they are behaving as they are now doing. When we were discussing coffee berries we learned from the honourable member for Mernda that the duty was levied on the berry with the skin on, and he pointed out 'how absurd it was to do that, because people do not consume the skins. But we are now asked to levy a duty of 2s. per cwt. on oysters in the shell. I do not know precisely what is the weight of the oyster apart from the shell. Probably there would be about 10 lbs. of oysters to every 100 lbs. of shell. The tax on the oysters, apart from the shells, would be something like 20s. on every cwt. of oysters eaten. Do the Government intend to allow a drawback on the shells 1 Probablyi f honourable members opposite advertised the fact that there is to be a duty of 2s. per cwt. on oysters, the New Zealand oysters will learn to grow with less shell; though from the oyster's point of view they should grow more shell, so as to have a better chance of not being exported aud devoured. I have no doubt that at Stewart Island, whence the bulk of the oysters come, the decision of the Federal Parliament will be largely advertised, and that we shall have an oyster parliament passing a vote of thanks to this Chamber. The local oysters would of course view the matter differently, and point out how the duty will increase their chance of dying. I cannot but be surprised at the action of two or three representatives of Queensland in this matter. Sometimes honourable members think it proThe proposition per to represent the views of their constituencies without pledging themselves to those views; but if they do so, they should not call on honourable members on this side of the House to vote with them. There must have been a solemn Cabinet meeting since the item was struck out at the instance of the Prime Minister himself some months ago, and I should very much like to know the name of the wise Minister who suggested that this item should be reinstated with a view of preventing the eating of New Zealand oysters. Consider, If Ministers intend to conduct too, what earnest debates must have taken place in order to overrule the original decision of the Prime Minister. How did the Cabinet divide?

I suppose it will be admitted that the trade of the islands of the Pacific is of some considerable importance to the Commonwealth of Australia. Those of us who look forward to the time when these islands will be part of the territory of the Commonwealth and under Australian control and domination, will certainly do all they can in the interim stage to protect that trade and reserve it for Australia. We have this evening done one thing in favour of the trade with the islands; we have drawn the proper distinction between raw coffee unhusked and cleaned, and coffee in the husk. ... ... 25 There are two other articles of commerce ... ... 24 between the islands and Australia which are of very considerable importance.

It is very important that we should stimulate and encourage trade between the Commonwealth and the islands, of which at present the French are very desirous of obtaining possession. In addition to that, there is the proposal whioh has emanated from New Zealand for a federation which would include F i j i and various other islands in the southern Pacific. I sincerely trust that the committee will not regard this question from the free-trade versus protectionist aspect alone, but will consider the interests of the Commonwealth generally, and see that it is desirable to encourage the trade and the friendly relationship which should exist between the Commonwealth and these islands of the Pacific. useless to re-discuss matters that we have already debated very fully. There was a long and acrimonious debate on this item. If I recollect rightly, I offered to reduce the duty from 2s. to Is. per central in order to settle the matter. That offer was not accepted, and we went to a division on an amendment by the honourable member for AVentworth that bananas should he free. The whole question of the island trade was then discussed, but the committee negatived that proposal by 23 votes to 14. That was a fairly substantial majority, having regard to divisions on some other items which have been passed, and for that reason I propose simply to take the vote of the committee without occupying any time in discussing this 'matter. There are other parts of the Commonwealth which must be considered, although I think that the questi Â»n of encouraging trade with the islands will have to be dealt with generally when we come to take their colonization into consideration. It may be proposed that the Commonwealth shall take over the islands, or assume some protection over them, and wfe could then settle terms under which we would deal fairly with them and with the Commonwealth as a whole. Meantime, I think that the duty imposed on bananas is a very legitimate one. statement made by the Treasurer is unsatisfactory. The original proposal of the Government was that a duty of 2s. per central should be imposed on bananas. It was pointed out at the time that such a duty would injure the trade between Sydney and the islands, and it has been found by those who have large dealings in bananas that the present duty of Is. per central has brought about that result. Trade with the islands has been injured very considerably in consequence of there being no back freight to Australia for vessels trading to the islands. The result of 'the duty has been a loss of trade, not only in bananas, but in other produce. The trade has been diverted chiefly to New Caledonia and New Zealand, while so far as some of the islands are concerned, their trade will go to Honolulu and find an outlet thence in the direction of San Francisco. This duty is felt more by tlie merchants of Sydney than it is by those of Melbourne.. When we. find representatives of Victoria urging the claims of this State-from time to time, I think it is rather ungracious for the Government to I think it is insist on this duty, witli its consequent loss of trade to Sydney merchants. The item was discussed when there was not a f u l l committee and in the absence of people from New South Wales, who had been waiting for days for the purpose of laying information before the committee so that the matter might be fairly and properly dealt with. I hope that the Government will not insist upon the duty. matter is far more serious than the Government appear to consider. While on the one hand the Cabinet are expressing their -desire to attract the islands to the Commonwealth"", they are on the other hand doing everything to alienate the islands from it. The encouragement of trade with these islands-and especially when they can do so without injury to the Commonwealthis an important part of the Government policy. What is the position t Under the Victorian State Tariff there was no dut}' on bananas, and the whole of the trade of this State in that article was done with Queensland. That condition of affairs would continue without aiiy duty. The reason is obvious. The island steamers can bring bananas to Sydney without transhipment, but that process would be necessary if they desired to send them on to another State; whilst steamers from Queensland can bring bananas from that State direct. The absence of the necessity for transhipment is a great advantage. In New South Wales before the imposition of the Federal Tariff half of the. trade in bananas was done with Queensland, while the other half went to the islands of the Pacific. The object of this duty is to secure the whole of",38,Pairs
181,Sir George Turner,,39,Pairs
182,Mr Henrywillis (Robertson),The,39,Pairs
183,Mr Thomson (North Sydney),"Thisthe trade to Queensland. When that is accomplished the back freight of the island steamers, in the shape of the carriage of bananas to New South Wales, which constitutes a very large item in their earnings, is destroyed. These steamers are experiencing the greatest difficulty in competing with foreign vessels in the island trade. They cannot compete iu the trade itself without a loss. I am not speaking without authority on this subject, because I ""had a great deal to do with tlie matter as a director of the Australian New Hebrides Company while it existed. That company endeavoured to compete with the French companies. In the first instance, it received a mail subsidy of Â£1,200 a year from New South Wales, and Â£1,200-whic h was reduced subsequently to Â£800a year from Victoria. All credit to Victoria for giving that subsidy when she was not so directly interested in the matter as was New South Wales. It was given in order to maintain communication between Australia and the islands, for it was felt that those islands would the effect"" of imposing a duty would be to be lost to us unless that communication was retained. When the Government remove the natural freight back from the islands, they at once tend to destroy the natural stream of trade. Surely, when Queensland gets half the New South Wales trade, and all the Victorian trade, it is not worthwhile to impose the duty. The very effect which was anticipated is occurring. * The Government have deplored any discussion on the recommitted items. In dealing with the Tariff we discussed many items, and if the same course is to be pursued as was pursued a few moments ago, it will become necessary to rediscuss them. We have no desire to unnecessarily discuss any items, but we are in this position, that if we allow a silent vote to be taken, the Government will muster all their forces and' try to undo that which was deliberately done with the concurrence of the Prime Minister. W it h the view of settling the question, as we thought for all time to come, the Government deliberately agreed to the proposal made by the honourable member for Wentworth .to admit oysters have gone back on that agreement. I wish to prevent the possibility of anything of that kind occurring again. It is only with a view to facilitate the transaction of business that I utter this note of warning. If we are treated in a similar way in regard to other items, I fear it will be some time before the consideration of the Tariff is completed. one argument in support of a duty on bananas which has not been advanced by the other side. In order to carry out the idea in its entirety we ought to allow the raw material to come in duty free. By that means a large employment might be given to children in skinning bananas, and we should have it put forth that under the benign regis of protection a new industry had sprung up. I throw out the suggestion for what it is worth. I feel quite sure that honourable members on the other side, after their brilliant remarks in favour of taxing oysters, will readily consent to allow the raw banana to come in free so that it may be peeled here. There is an argument which should appeal to honourable members on this side, and to sensible men, no matter where they are. When the duty was last considered it was pointed out that lessen a trade which was being'carried on at a considerable disadvantage. I refer to the trade of New South Wales with the islands. Sufficient time has elapsed since the introduction of the Tariff to show that that will actually happen. That fact should weigh with the committee. I remember a speech in which the honourable and learnetl member for Corio pointed out that Australia ought to take possession of all these islands, l t is perfectly clear that if we do take possession of them the trade of the islands will be carried on with Australia. It has been shown that, slight as this duty is, it does affect to a certain extent the island trade which is already on the balance. It is not argued that any man in Queensland or elsewhere derives any considerable benefit from the imposition of the duty. I did not anticipate that it would endanger the trade with the islands, but I am assured by commercial men and others who deal with the islands that it is diminishing the trade, and may help to do away with the line of communication which the individual States did so much to build up. duty free, but they Under these circumstances I trust that the committee will accept the amendment. In my former speech I suggested, but only very delicately, what strikes me as being the position to which we should give our thoughts. In the islands of the",39,Pairs

The Votes and Proceedings are our only journal. Hansard contains no reference to the specific items. The Hansard report does not pretend to cover the question of resolutions of a forma] character, or anything of that kind, but to give a report of the proceedings so far as debate is concerned. But the Votes and Proceedings of last Wednesday, the 26th of March, contain the following as item 6Ways and Means -The House, according to order, resolved itself into Committee of Ways and Means. Theni t goes on to state what occurred prior to the proposal to recommit, and saysSir George Turner moved that the resolutions be now recommibted to the Committee of Ways and Means for the reconsideration of certain srxscified items. There is no record even of the items that were to be recommitted. Thati n itself is a serious omission, as it seems to me. But allow me to point out the significance of the phraseology used-""for the reconsideration of certain items."" ""Certain items,"" not the matter of some specific amendments, but the items of the Tariff themselves. seems to me to point, so far as the records of the House go-and those are the only records to which I have access-to the conclusion that the items to be referred back to the committee were referred in such a way that the committee were assumed to have a free hand to go to any extent it thought fit. Now, sir, to come to my own memory of what occurred, it was that the right honourable the Treasurer read over a number of items which it was desired to have the sense of the committee upon, those items having been suggested by himself and various private members; and that the Speaker put the question in the form that certain items or hues of items he recommitted. I say that that information should appear upon the journals of the House. But there is no information to guide honourable members, and so far as the information that is contained in the journals goes, it is solely in the direction of a larger view than is being permitted to us to-night. I would also point out that it is admitted by our action a few hours ago that we have the right to amend a specific motion that is contained in the printed set of amendments for recommittal. We have already done that. make a new motion. is the consequence of any such ruling. In the first place we could not move for a duty of 6d. on bananas until the committee had been tested with regard to making the item free of duty, for the reason that the committee would be stultifying themselves by voting for 6d. in the meantime. Therefore, we must first decide-as we have all through this Tariff discussion decidedwhether we will have the extreme proposal before we can come to the more moderate one. That, I say, has been the position right through, and I do not see any escape from it on the present occasion. Now, sir, to come to the document upon which you yourself have relied. There is nothing in it to intimate that it is an official document emanating from the hands of the Speaker. It is a document absolutely similar to papers that have been issued from time to time during the Tariff discussions, merely showing the amendments to which various honourable members desired to give publicity before moving them in the committee. items they desire to recommit. That for the information of honourable members. But there is no signature attached to it . document. document, but is merely issued for the convenience of honourable members. It is a document to give publicity to certain proposals which are coming forward. We have had such documents circulated ever since the introduction of tlie Tariff, and no one has contended that we were bound to the very wording of the amendments put before us upon these papers. In this instance, there is nothing to distinguish the document in' question from the documents circulated earlier in the Tariff debate. There is no record whatever of the actual question put from the chair in regard to instructions to the committee; and it does seem to me that where there is no such record, and no official document to guide us, our course should be to keep the proceedings of the committee reasonably free, so as to allow of a compromise, and of that f u l l discussion",42,Pairs

Therefore I am not worried about that. But there are a number of items coming on which the ruling of the Chairman will affect, and that is not a good thing. I point out, to make the matter clear, that in the first place there is no record for the guidance of the committee upon our Votes and Proceedings, nor is there any such record in Hansard, so far as I have been able to -find out, and that the document which the Chairman relies upon-n o doubt with a ful l desire to do the right thing-is not an official document, and bears no signature of any responsible authority, but is merely a circular to give publicity to the intentions of certain honourable members.

If it were not done in tain specified items were recommitted. If that way there is no document which shows we do not come to the latter conclusion, what the desire of the House was. Therethere is nothing to guide us. If the Chairfore the contention of tlie honourable member man's decision were to be dissented from, it cannot be good unless he contends that would mean that it would open up the every item of the Tariff was recommitted. whole discussion that has been going on for To show how baseless that contention isif I may say so in all courtesy-the record says that the motion passed wasThat the resolutions be now recommitted to the Committee of Ways and Means for the reconsideration of certain specified items. That destroys the contention that the whole Tariff was recommitted. Tariff was not recommitted, then it is true that "" certain specified items"" were recommitted ; and it is only a question of evidence what those items were. The only evidence is a document which has passed under the revision of Mr Speaker, ' and which is upon the table. That document has been laid upon the tal .le. The committee declares itself to be a perfectly rudderless ship, and to have no guidance whatever, unless it accepts this document. I have in my hand the' Treasurer's notes which he took down at the time, and which include the item in question. His note is not in exactly the same words, but it contains the information that the proposal carried was for the recommittal of the matter in order to declare bananas to be free of duty. The Treasurer's note says "" bananas to be free."" The document upon the table only puts that proposal in more formal words: "" That bananas be exempted from duty.""

219,Mr Barton,"The Treasurer took a notethat consideration is not limited to the items upon the paper, we admit the whole question. As to the point of the honourable member for Bland, that there is no official guide to the committee, my answer is that if this paper is not an official guide, certainly there is no official guide ; and if that is right, there being no official guide, the whole Tariff will be open to revision, whereas the resolution of the House itself says that the Tariff was recommitted "" for the reconsideration of certain specified items."" To hold that the whole Tariff is open to reconsideration would be a reversal of the resolution of the House itself as contained in the Votes and Proceedings. That seems to me, fairly speaking, to dispose of that point. The remaining point is as to whether the Chairman was right in deciding as he did that, the motion "" that bananas be exempted from duty"" being disposed of, the consideration of the question ended there and then. As to that I will admit this : That if you, sir, could have decided that the whole item was open so that the committee, at this stage, could take any action it chose in any direction I should have been much the better pleased. But J. have got to take things as I find them. It is our duty to take things just as we find them. The motion was that the Tariff he recommitted for a certain purpose. We have to read into that motion a recommittal with regard to the things mentioned in this paper. was recommitted for the purpose of moving, amongst other things, ""that bananas be exempted from duty."" How can it be contended after the decision on that amendment that another proposal can be made ? I would even go so far as to say this : That if upon the motion that bananas be exempt from duty some honourable member had moved a relevant amendment, the Chairman would have been bound to rule against that amendment. saying ""exempted from duty,"" the motion had been that the duty be so and so, it would have been open for the committee to consider such an amendment. But the opportunity for that has gone by. The whole motion for the recommittal in this respect was that bananas be free of duty, and once that was decided the matter was over. I am not now speaking from a Government point of view. I am speaking from a considerable experience in parliamentary affairs, more especially from the experience gained during my occupancy of the chair in another State. I am bound to say, although I would rather it were the other way, that I cannot see how we can question your ruling, that there can be no further motion on the matter. On the question as to what was recommitted, we cannot have any other guide than the printed document we see before you. one or two of the standing orders in support of what I take to be the practice in connection with recommittals. I think the true practice in respect to resolutions is that we can, as with a Bill, recommit the whole of a particular resolution arrived at by the committee. When a Bill is being reported we can ask for a recommittal of the whole of the Bill or a particular clause, but not a portion of a clause. There is no necessity for prescribing by the motion that the clause shall be recommitted for the particular purpose which the honourable member may have in view. As a matter of fact we only mention the purpose in an endeavour to get the support of honourable members, or to disarm opposition-it is purely a matter of courtesy. The true position is that any honourable member can ask for the recommittal of a clause without stating a single reason, and the position of a resolution of a committee is exactly that of a clause of a Bill. Each particular item is like a The Tariff clause, and we simply ask that it shall be recommitted, and after it gets back into the hands of the committee the members of the committee ""can do as they please. As regards the question of instructions these only apply where a particular clause, had it been as it originally was before the committee, could not have dealt -with it in a certain way. In the case of a Bill leave to recommit does not authorize an addition to a particular clause, and, thereI f , instead of fore, we have to ask for the instructions of the House to do something which in an ordinary way we could not do in committee ; and it is the same way with resolutions. If we ask that instructions be given to the committee we simply ask for power to do something we could not have done when the resolution was first considered ; and that view is laid down clearly by May. An instruction can be given in relation to a resolution, not to enable the committee to do something which it could have done previously when the resolution",44,Pairs
220,Mr Glynn,"I shall have to refer towas before tlie committee for the first time, but to enable it to do something further-to make a particular addition to the resolution, which addition in an ordinary way could not have been made. ""When asking for a recommittal honourable members give information to enable the Government to decide, whether they will support the motion or not, but the standing orders require no particulars. Standing Order 181 saysOn the motion for the adoption of the report the BiU may, on motion, be recommitted, either in whole or in part; in whicli case, if amendments are made and the Bill be reported, a subsequent day shall be fixed for taking the report into, consideration. There is not a word there about stating reasons for asking for a recomniital, or about instructions being given to the committee to do certain things. Order 246 providesResolutions of the Committees of Supply and Ways and Means reported to the House are read a first and second time, and agreed to; or may be amended, postponed, recommitted, or disagreed to. AVe are now dealing with Ways and Means, and there is not a word in that standing order setting forth that we must explain why a recommittal is asked for, or that we are to be pinned down by our expressions as to the object we have in. view. On the question of instructions, Standing Order 24S says. An instruction empowers a committee to consider matters not otherwise referred to it. That is the point. committee to consider matters not referred to it.. be put in an. informal, way-in a clumsy manner such as that adopted by some honourable members and especially by the Government-still , under the standing orders, the whole of the resolutions or one can be recommitted. learned member say that the House cannot instruct the committee in regard to the resolutions so as to restrict the power of the committee? purpose to say that, but I do not think the House can. I think the House cannotrestrict the power of the committee over the resolutions submitted to it , but the House can increase that power by allowing an amendment which, under the standing orders, would not otherwise have been possible. Standing Order 249 providesNo instruction can be given to a committee to do that which it is already empowered, to do, or to deal with a question beyond the scope of a Bill as read the second time. Such a power is not inherent in the committee j it is not given by the standing orders, or sanctioned by the practice of Parliament. When the question, is first conr sidered by the committee, and there is not power to do a particular thing, we may on the report ask that when the clause or resolution is recommitted an instruction shall be given to amplify the power and to do something which there would otherwise, not be power to do. If there is no necessity for instructions there is a bald recommittal, and on that recommittal the committee can do Standing just as it pleases-that is within tbe power it . had when the resolution was first com sidered. I feel, therefore, that if the question goes to a division. I shall be bound to disagree with your ruling. appeal's that not. only this item, but others that will follow, will be .affected, along, with the practice of the Housei n framing resolutions. So far as I have learnt of the practice of the House of Commons, it is a common thing to order the recommittal of a clause or item for a certain purpose, and then, of .course, the debate in committee is limited to that purpose. But supposing that in a. resolution oftheHouse for recommittal -there is no limitation, then the committee is at large. The formal resolution of the Treasurer was that the resolutions be now recommitted to the Committee of Ways and Means for tbe reconsideration of certain specified items. The only limitation, there is as to the items; there is an absolute powerof reconsideration. AlthoughI see, Mr Chanter, that, as it appears to me, you have correctly interpreted what was tbe actual will of the Government and of the House when therecommittal was ordered, still I say that the form of' the resolution, which, is the only tiling that binds the committee, is in favour of the contention of the honor-, It is not necessary for my able member for Bland. The. . unfortunate thing, is that in the haste of the House a resolution m a y be drawn up;in. an unlimited form when it is meant to be' limited. .

If there be any need to refer to the practice of the House of Commons, I should point to pages i68-9 of May, 10th edition, where are shown the different ways in which a Bil l may be recommitted. A Bill may be recommitted without limitation, or it may be recommitted with regard to a particular clause or amendments, or it may be as to certain clauses or schedules. None of these things have been done here. AVe readA Bill may he recommitted and an instruction given to the committee that they have power to make some particular or additional provision. In that case I say, with respect, that the resolution ought to have been to the effect that the resolutions be now recommitted to the Committee of Ways and Means for the reconsideration of certain specified items, and as to items for the purpose of exempting them from duty. AlthoughI recognise that you, sir, have seen and expressed the wish of the House so far as I recollect it, and that the Government would not be very likely to consent to. a recommittal without limitation, the form of tlie resolution is binding on us, and unwillingly I have to say that I agree with, the honourable member for Bland. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, but I see a further' difficulty the committee have, to face in the fact that if we are to go solely by the resolution of the House as reported in the journals, we have absolutely no evidence before us to show which items of the Tariff ha-y^! been recommitted, and, consequently, we cannot consider anything. document or nothing. for instance, that the item of bananas was recommitted \ The only available evidence in writing is the Treasurer's note, on which theprinted document was founded. The honourable member for Wentworth is not here to verify or question the accuracy of the Treasurer's note, but we all recollect that the Treasurer read these items out after he had taken them down, as they were suggested by honourable members. I do not recollect whether or not any corrections were made. accuracy of the note. solutely with what the honourable 'and learned member for Northern Melbourne has said, I wish to take the matter a step further, and point out, that unless we accept, this document, we have absolutely no evidence of what items have been recom-mitted. we are taking the facts as they are. learned member were told he had no title deeds to a piece of land would he accept that opinion ? evidence procurable. the horns of a dilemma. Either we have nothing to guide us beyond the individual memories of honourable members-which , with all respect, would not be satisfactory -o r we have tlie printed, list. Earlieri n the evening I drew attention to the same difficulty in connection with another it e m; but on that occasion the Chairman's ruling, from which I entirely dissented, was given against the position I adopted. The position now is that if we do not take the list we have nothing to guide us, and we are not entitled to consider any item. We as he has gone have no reasonably satisfactory evidence as to what items are to be reconsidered, unless progress is reported and the Speaker is asked, to name them. I am. certainly clear, as far as my memory goes, that the Treasurer took down exactly what the honourable member for AVentworth asked for, and that was that bananas should be free. As the honourable member for Northern Melbourne has read from May, a B ill can be recommitted to reconsider certain specified amendments. The analogous position in this-case would be a recommittal to consider a certain specified alteration of duty. I i a. duty be recommitted for that purpose, the particular amendment proposed, or matters relevant to it , only can be considered. I do not think that an alteration in the rate of. duty is in any way relevant to the specific proposal that bananas should be free. I should be glad if we could have a definite ruling, and no doubt time would be saved if it were given in the widest possible way.

A t first I thought your ruling was right, Mr Chairman; subsequently I thought it was wrong, but I have come to the conclusion, finally, although not without some hesitation, that it is right, solely oh the ground that unless we take this list we have no right to consider anything. If the list itself is not eviitems. dence, then the memories of honourable members cannot be evidence. The only possible alternative would be to ask Mr Speaker to say, if he can, what the duties are that have been recommitted. tion which the committee has is the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives, which are signed by the Clerk. In those Votes and Proceedings it is stated that the motion wasThat the resolutions be now recommitted to the Committee of Ways and Means for the reconsideration of certain specified items. When we come to look at the notice-paper we find under orders of the day] . Ways and Means -Furthe r consideration in committee (The Turin?-Recommitte d Items). On the list furnished to us in every case, the Chairman would put down the items. I hold that the moment we are entitled to consider an item that moment we are entitled to go into it fully. The Treasurer so clearly foresaw this, that I think he asked something in the nature of a promise from honourable members that they would practically confine themselves to the particular part of the item which would be under discussion. to limit their notices as much as possible. tion of the Treasurer to what happened in my own case. My direct motion was that item 57 be recommitted, although I indicated that I desired that it should be recommitted only in order that towels and linen handkerchiefs should be on the free list, and should rank at least with cotton piece goods. learned member did not expect me to agree to recommit the whole item ? JIS far as possible, to confine my attention almost entirely to that, but I did not intend to restrict debate. I do not think the committee can be bound by anything which has been reprinted subsequently by order of the Treasurer. It may be unfortunate if we have to go into tbe whole of an item, but the moment it is recommitted we have to consider it as a whole. learned member regard the printed list as being an indication ? learned member goes only half-way. learned member knows that if the latter part of a section in an Act were held to be idtra vires, the court would still act on the first part. If the latter part of the Treasurer's statement had been merely a misprint, surely the committee would have said that lie had power to alter it? and learned member pardon me ? It appears to me that we are becoming involved in a discussion that is likely to occupy some considerable time. We are all agreed that we cannot afford to spend our time in this way if we can possibly meet the difficulty by adopting any other course. Personally, I feel that the Chairman could not have ruled in any other way than he has done on the wording as we have it here, if we are to have regard to this document. done to-night is wrong ? We are all anxious that these particular items should be discussed, and that every honourable member should have rfin opportunity of dealing fully with any matter I requested them which he desires to have reconsidered by tKe committee. I requested honourable members to give me the items which they desire to have recommitted, and I wrote down those items. WhereI had any doubt on the matter, I asked honourable members what they proposed, and when I could not find any honourable member in order to ascertain exactly ""what he proposed, I set it down in the widest possible way that the duty be reviewed.

We have been told that if there be any evidence that any items are before the committee by way of recommittal, that evidence is to be found in the printed paper before us. Unfortunately, however, we have before us two papers which disagree very materially. Sir forth the notices of motions ^intended to be moved for the recommittal of items, but some of which were not moved; bhe other Jist comprises those that were moved. Motion, by leave, withdrawn. committee imposed a duty of 2d. per lb. on currants and a duty of 3d. per lb. on other dried fruits including raisins. which had been duty free in New South Wales, are therefore subject to a duty of 3d. per lb. The date is a valuable fruit. The stones constitute a large proportion of the weight, consequently on the quantity of f r u it a much larger duty is paid than is paid in the case of other fruits. The value of dates is very much lower than that of currants or raisins. Dates are worth from 10s. to 12s. 6d., sometimes 15s. per cwt. One penny farthing per lb. may be considered as the general value. In the streets of Sydney dates used sometimes to be sold at l | d . per lb. They are largely used by the 32 G poorer classes when other fruits are not on the market. The duty of 3d. per lb. practically means the exclusion of dates from the Commonwealth. A duty of I d . per lb. is equal to from 75 to 80 or 90 per cent, according to the price of dates. The duty on currants is fixed at nearly 100 per cent., and in the case of raisins the duty on the cheaper sorts is fixed at nearly 100 per cent., and on the dearer sorts at from 25 to 40 per cent. If we impose a duty of I d . per lb. on dates it will interfere with no production of the ComThat, I think, monwealth that I know of.

Groats are consumed very largely by the poorer classes and by invalids. is free. are used for that purpose, and although the Minister is very far removed from that stage of life when gruel was his proper food, I hope that he will have some sort of feeling for the children of Australia. A duty ol Â£d. per lb. is imposed on oatmeal, rolled oats, wheatmeal, pearl barley, Scotch barley, maizena, and cornflour, and I see no reason why a difference should be made in the case of groats, which are used for making children's food. I trust that the Minister will not make the Tariff more inconsistent than it is in many cases. It will save time if he will agree to' tlie amendment. committee dealt with the item of grain and pulse it was felt that some of the articles under that head, not being very valuable, would be fairly treated if subjected to a duty of ^d. per lb.; but groats were looked upon as a much more valuable article than the others. I think the price averages 5d. per lb.; sometimes it runs up to 8d. per lb. The committee decided to leave the duty at I d. per lb. The honourable member for West Sydney proposed that it should be Under reduced to Â£d. per lb., but he did not proceed with his proposal. My honourable colleague has since looked into the matter and has come to the conclusion that, having regard to their value, groats may very fairly bear the impost of I d . per lb. If the article were used exclusively for the purpose of making infants' and invalids' food it would be duty free, but as I understand that it is not used for that purpose only, we must object to a reduction of the duty to ^d. per lb. I venture to say that the great bulk of groats consumed throughout the Commonwealth will be consumed as invalids' and which is best for them, and this is an article which happens to be best for them. There* * * is scarcely any gruel used anywhere which is not made out of groats. So far as I know that is its particular purpose. One does not feed horses or animals on imported groats, but on crushed oats. I . hope that the.Minister will be humane and accept a duty of ^-d per lb., which, after all, is a very sufficient ad valorem duty.

Item 35 -rMeats,fish,poultry and game, viz.:sausage casings, per lb. 2d. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) -On behalf of the honourable member for Melbourne, who has left for China and Japan, I move That the words ""and on and after 3rd April, .1902, free"" be added. I cannot profess to have a very special knowledge of this subject, but the case in favour of placing sausage casings on the free list has been very strongly set forth in a circular issued by the Master Butchers and Live Stock Buyers' Association of ""Victoria. The matter has also been brought under my attention by the Butchers' Association in my own district. It may surprise honourable members to know that thousands of pounds worth of these casings are impjorted year by year from the United States.' These are not what are known as sheep sausage casings, but pork sausage casings, and I am informed that 95 per cent, of the pork sausage casings used in Australia have been imported. They have been admitted free of duty into Victoria and New South Wales, and I have never heard of any demand for a duty. Large quantities of sheep sausage casings are produced locally, but to America and Germany, where no duties are imposed. The butchering trade generally is interested in the free importation of pork sausage casings, because there is no large local production of the article. Pigs are grown and handled upon such a large scale in America that the sausage casings can be produced there and exported tp all parts of the world at a very low price. important item, and the circumstances connected with the discussion are especially 32 o 2 noteworthy, inasmuch as, among other Against. tilings, they mark thefalling from fiscal grace Lyne, Sir W.

H . able and learned member for Bendigo McEacharn, ' Sir M. have now departed from the protectionist Salmon, C. C. principles to which they have so closely adhered during the last six or seven months, McColl, J-. H. and I am glad to find that, even at this late Manifold. J. C. stage, they have seen the error of their Bamford, F. W. ways and have decided to support the free admission of sausage casings. The public of the Commonwealth will no doubt be extremely grateful to them ; although they may be far more concerned with the contents of the casings than with the casings themselves In the interests of not only those who make the sausages, but also of those who consume them, I trust the Treasurer will agree to the amendment. MrA . M c LEAN (Gippsland) I think the Government might accept this amendment. We produce a large number of"" sausage casings here, but they are mutton sausage skins. There is a considerable recriprocal trade with the United States.. They take our mutton sausage skins, and we take their pork sausage casings. We only produce about 5 per cent, of the pork sausage casings used here so that there is no question of protection at stake. ment proposed the duty in question we have obtained a little further information on the subject. We find that there are two sorts of sausage casings, one of which we export and the other which we import. The United States are able to dispose of their hog casings at a price which suits us, and we import them, whilst we export our mutton sausage casings. The result is that from the United States, Victoria alone during the year 1900 imported 233,795lbs. weight the bulk of these are exported of sausage-casings, valued at Â£11,104. On the other hand; still taking Victoria as a type of the other States, she exported a total of 89,496 lbs. weight, of the value of Â£3,970. The imports are hog casings and the exports are sheep casings, which are sent to America and Germany, where they are admitted duty free. Asi t seems that we are not producing the more valuable of these casings in sufficient quantities for ourselves, and as we know that they enter into our local manufactures, we might fairly let this duty go, and we propose to do so.

264,Mr Kingston,"Sinc e the GovernThat tlie words "" Preserved fish in tins or other was 25 per cent., 50 per cent., 75 per cent., air-tight vessels, including the weight of liquids, on and after 3rd April, 1902, per lb. Id., "" be inserted. The duty on preserved fish in tins under the Tariff as it stands would be -2d. per lb. Honourable members will recollect that there was a considerable discussion with regard to ""the item, and I then said that the Government would endeavour to meet the wish of the committee by reducing the amount of the duty. Since that time the Tariff has. been reduced in other directions where I hoped it would not have been. Preserved fish seems to be used to a great extent in the far-off parts of the various States. It is a revenue rather than a protective duty, and though the amount in questionÂ£30,000-is considerable, the reasons for reducing the tax are very strong. I am glad that the Treasurer has made this proposal, because it will confer a' considerable amount of relief to those who specially deserve it . People living in the far back parts of the Commonwealth necessarily use preserved fish as an article of diet to a considerable extent, if they are to be relieved from the obligation of living almost entirely on bacon. I thank the Treasurer for his liberality in making the proposal. Amendment agreed to. Item, as amended, agreed to. Item 40 -Oilmen' s stores, n.e.i., including culinary essences non-spirituous, soap dyes, condition foods, and other preparations used in the household, whether otherwise exempted or not ad valorem 20 per cent. That the word ""uon-spirituoiis"" be omitted. There are two proposed amendments upon this item. One is a merely technical one, but the other is of some importance. When we were dealing with the item spirits many weeks ago it was pointed out that our proposals would impose the f u l l 14s. per gallon duty on spirits or compounds containing spirits, although there might 'be only a small proportion of spirits in a particular article. It was pointed out that in New South Wales they had a sliding scale. It seemed to ns at the 'time that it was rather unfair where'there was only 25 ' per cent, of spirits in an article to charge the f u l l rate, and we adopted the sliding scale of 3s. 6d., 7s., 10s., and 14s., according to I m o v e whether the amount of spirits contained or proof. A t that time, it escaped the notice of the committee that we are in a position very different to that of New South Wales. New South Wales, while she had these revenue du ties, had noprotective duties. What we now propose is, to take out the word "" non-spirituous."" That means that oilmen's stores, whether they contain the spirit, or whether they are nonspirituous, will he liable to 20 per cent, duty, unless they contain such a large proportion of spirits as would make them dutiable at the higher rate under the heading of spirits. Wo have done, something similar to that in regard to medicines and opium. So far as we can see, if we omit the words ""non-spirituous,"" we shall make these various articles dutiable at 20 per cent., but if they contain 25 per cent., or more, of spirit they will be liable to pay a higher rate. a,m afraid there will be great difficulty about this matter. I was told by a person in the trade in Sydney the other day that the amount of labour involved in connection with returns to the Custom-house to determine under which class duty should be paid on goods was such that it was almost impossible to carry on business. I believe there will be found in the Treasury a communication .from a Sydney firm in connection with the difficulty. It should convince the Government of the large amount that has to .be paid by merchants to make up the returns required by the.'Customs authorities. The gentleman of whom I spoke told me that the matter in question only involved I m o v e about 8s. 6d. upon the whole consignment, but that it took several clerks a considerable time to make out the calculations required by the Customs authorities. I want to have this matter fairly treated, and do not want to see the law taken advantage of, but at the same time it would be better if the Government had some fairer way of computing the duty instead of compelUng merchants to make out returns which are very expensive. The Treasurer will recollect that I brought this subject under his notice, and I think he promised to make inquiries, but owing to tlie regrettable absence of the Minister for Trade and Customs, the matter was held in abeyance.
