We support Minister will tell us before this whole area those amendments that are being made sinks into a complete fog of confusion. by this Bill. The Minister's staff member was kind enough to tell the world the other day These amendments are interesting to that the Minister was confused, and it was the close observer for another reasonvery apparent that he was. We believe it the Minister's recent curious qualification is time that this confusion was cleared up to his announcement that there would be because investment decisions will have to a 20 per cent limit on foreign investment be made, and presumably before the legin television licences. The qualification, islation is introduced and passed in the which I have described as curious, was Budget session. So let us bring an end to that loans would apparently not count to this confusion. I think more light is thrown wards the 20 per cent. Such a qualificaon it by looking at the small print of the tion would seem, on the surface at least, Bill that is before us tonight, but it simply to negate the limit on foreign investment, highlights the need-if there were any for a company with perhaps 90 per cent more need for it-for clarification of of its funds in the form of foreign loans where there is presently, judging from the would not necessarily have more than 20 Minister's statements, regrettably, confuper cent of its shares owned by foreigners sion. and it would not exceed the limit. There are other provisions in the Bill One has often pondered the reason for which are worthy of comment without that qualification and it would appear detailed discussion. One of them flows from this Bill that the reason is now clear, from a Federal Court decision in the News or at least there is a clue to the reason.

The Bill seeks to give est in a television licensee is held if the a more workmanlike definition to control, person holds more than 5 per cent of the and there would seem to be some sense shares of the licensee, but it also provides behind that. Given that we have a Broadcasting Tribunal and a regulatory frameby the regional television stations, but also work, it is desirable that the Tribunal by other observers of this field. have some clearer guidelines, and the Bill To put it in a very generalised way, if is a step in this direction. So we support one looks at the proposed new sections, that amendment to the Act also. one sees that what they do is to take out In the area pf licence renewals, in subof the operation of the ownership and stance, without going into it in too much control provisions control of an otherwise detail, we are faced with a situation where independent licensee that might come the Tribunal apparently is bogged down from networking agreements, which, of in its licence renewal hearings, and it has course, are Pl;lft of the mechanisms that deferred for up to two years 40 per cent operate in the television industry between of licences that are due for renewal in networks and regional stations today.

I will refer to and 89EA and the definition of 'networkthem in general and then in the commiting agreement' in clause 4. There really is tee stage I may have to say some more on our understanding of this-and I hope about them. we will get a more detailed explanation Generally, we start off with the position from the Minister than the one in the I have described in the second reading second reading speech-no justification speech. As I have said, we are told in the for these new provisions at all, and that second reading speech that there is legal comes from concern expressed not only advice that arrangements between licensees who are affiliated to networks for the that and thereby laying the foundations distribution of programming could breach for the regional television stations to be the 60 per cent population reach for telecome slaves to the networks. It is contrary vision. Therefore, it is said that this has to advice that was given to the Ministerto be changed.

I might refer to point of the 60 per cent audience reach it precisely at this stage because it is no rule if it is simply going to be reversed. great secret that some advice was given On the surface it would seem that such to the Minister which was obtained under arrangements would breach the 60 per the Freedom of Information Act.

So the view of the Department was, apparently, that The Government is simply going one must continue to have regard to this through this amendment to perpetuate a danger of networks exploiting regional fiction because it is going to say , 'Yes, the stations.
