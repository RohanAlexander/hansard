I shall communicate w i th the State Government on the subject. Minister say how f a r the Government have been instrumental in having arrangements made for the manufacture of wire netting and fencing wire in Australia) newly-created Board of Trade have been more or less responsible for what has been done. A t the steel works of the BrokenH ill Company, at Newcastle, they have apparently for some time been considering the development of subordinate industries arising from their manufacture of steel and iron. The Government are anxious, while we suffer great disadvantages during war time, that that manufacture may lead to the establishment of new industries. That is why the attention of the Board of Trade has been so keenly directed to this matter, and it has no doubt been largely instrumental in bringing the proposal to its present stage of f r u it i o n. in going further? We are manufacturing wire netting Johnson) -Order! tion of the House to the fact that a number of questions have been asked upon this subject arising out of a reply given by the Acting Prime Minister to the first one, and quite a debate of an irregular character is developing. I ask honourable members not to proceed beyond the legitimate privilege of asking questions by attempting to debate the replies thereto. kay) asked me the following questions: 1. Whether he will inquire into the statement that a deputation of fruit-growers recently waited on the Minister for Health in New South Wales for the purpose of drawing ister for Defence, upon noticeattention to the risk of infection of the banana plantations by the importation of diseased bananas from F i j i . 2. Will he inform the House what precautions are being taken to prevent infected fruit from coming into the Commonwealth. If there is not sufficient An interim reply was furnished, and I now give the following additional information : It has now been ascertained, as the result of inquiries, -that the secretary of the Tweed River Fruit Growers Association recently interviewed the Hon. J. D. Fitzgerald, who is* Minister for Local Government in New South Wales, and asked that F i j i bananas might be kept out of the Tweed River district. The question of importation in New South Wales is not raised. The matter, therefore, at the present moment is one of State jurisdiction entirely. Inquiries made have established the fact that the precautions mentioned in the reply to question 2 are being observed. AIR SERVICE POLICY. Minister say whether it was the decision of the Government, or of the Ministeri n charge of the Department, that the question of formulating the policy for Australia of an aerial defence should be left to an officer brought into the country from England as an expert advisor ? orable friend, the member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs), Was the only member of the House who was in the habit of submitting conundrums to the members of the Government. I know that that honourable member has spent a I s there any utility great deal of time in doing so. But the honourable member for Wentwoyth ( Mr. K e l l y) has now asked me one, for answer to which I must depend entirely upon my I direct the attenmemory. So far as I can recollect, the Minister for the Navy( Mr Joseph Cook), who is now absent from Australia, secured the consent of the Government to the importation of an expert naval aerial advisor in order that he might consult with the Government as to the formation of its policy. Beyond that, I know nothing of the matter.

11,Mr Bayley Asked The Assistant M I N,"(6) By whom the decision, as to whether a man should be returned or not, is made? orable member's question is as follows:(a) The information required is not readily low:ascertainable, and would necessitate a review of the thousands of files in the records at Central Administration, Victoria Barracks. Approximately, 8,500 applications for the return of soldiers have been received and dealt with by the Department, and up to 30th September, 1917, 258 soldiers were cabled for"" to return owing to extremely distressful family circumstances. (l>) All applications made are submitted to the Adjutant-General's Branch for investigation nnd action. Jn every case, a special inquiry officer, or a member of the civil police, is detailed to test the accuracy of the application, and furnish other particulars required by the Department. A recommendation on the matter is made by the Commandant concerned. The files are then reviewed by the Adjutant-General's Branch, and recommendations given. Before a cable is despatched for the return of a soldier, the file is submitted with the recommendation of the AdjutantGeneral's Branch for Ministerial approval. The policy of the Department is not to allow a soldier to return unless tlie family circumstances are of a particularly distressful native, and this policy is rigidly adhered to. Prime Minister, upon notice1. Isi t a fact that, notwithstanding the statement made in the Melbourne Age on the 21st ultimo that applications from both inside and outside the Public Service would be invited for the position of assistant secretary of the newly appointed Board of Trade, an acting assistant secretary has been appointed? 2. Isi t still intended that applications for the position shall be invited? 3. Or is the "" acting "" assistant secretary's appointment to become a permanent one? honourable member's questions are as foldental low:1. Yes. 2. Yes. 3. No. AREA OFFICERS. Minister, upon notice1. Isi t a fact that a number of Area Officers, who, it is stated, receive £250 per annum for tliat particular work, are also employed in the Pensions Department an""d receive further payment for such, work? 2. If so, is this considered fair to the large number of returned soldiers who, it is alleged, are unable to even obtain one position? honourable member's questions are as fol1. There are three returned soldiers employed as temporary ofhsers in the Melbourne Pensions Office, and one in the Sydney Pensions Office, who at present hold positions as Area Oflicers. The rate of pay for an Area Officer is £150 per annum, and their work is performed outside their civil ofiice hours. 2. It is the practice of the Defence Department to appoint to the position of Area Officer persons who are in other employment, and the practice is considered fair, in view of the fact that the work is sufficient to occupy the oflicers for only a smajl portion of the day. MR. BARNETT'S INQUIRY. Minister for Defence, upon notice1. Whether the investigation now proceeding by Mr Barnett, Special Magistrate, into the nationality of employees in the Defence Department refers only to mon occupying thelower salaried positions, to judge by press reports? 2. Is the inquiry limited to certain grades and positions only? 3. Do the progress reports of the magistrate include only the result of inquiries into the lower grades'and positions? 4. Will the final report include the results of an inquiry covering every grade and position in the Department? honourable member's questions are as follow:1. No. 2. No. 3. No progress reports have yet been received. 4. Mr Barnett was appointed to be a Commissioner to inquire into the origin of birth and parentage of all persons now in the Com: monwealth Public Service or employ who are or may be reported or believed to be of enemy thereto; and to make recommendations as to their continuance or otherwise in the Commenwealth Government Service or employ.

19,Mr Brennan Asked Th« Acting,"2. If so, does he consider that the spirit of the award governing the employment of clerical workers in the Prime Minister's Department is being observed? 3. Does the practice of the Department not amount to requiring officers of the Department to work the equivalent of one day per week without payment? 4. If not, how otherwise does the Acting Prime Minister explain the position? 5. Has the Prime Minister been informed that his officers are smarting under what they conceive to be an injustice in the matter? 0. Why was the Acting General Secretary of the above-mentioned registered organization not favoured with the courtesy of a communication expressing the departmental view of the matter ? 7. Seeing that there are a number of oflicers in the Prime Minister's Department, including returned soldiers, who are attending night classes with a view to improving their positions in the Service, will the Acting Prime Minister at least agree that the officers be permitted to cease duty at 4.30 p.m. on two days per week? honourable member's questions is as follows :Nos. 1 to 7. Yes; I have read the correspondence referred to. The Secretary of the Department has informed me generally as follows :-The officers of the Prime Minister's Department have, as a result of the war, been called upon to discharge largely-increased duties. A good deal of the work is of a secret and confidential nature, and this must, obviously, be dealt with by specially selected officers. Apart from that, much of it is of an urgent nature, which necessitates prompt action. Telegrams and cablegrams are received and require to be despatched daily after the usual ofiice hours. Many officers voluntarily and cheerfully work prolonged hours; but, in order to distribute the burden equally, instructions were issued some little time ago that all officers should remain on duty until 5.30 p.m. when occasion required. Even under these conditions, great difficulty is experienced in carrying on satisfactorily. Pending the rearrangement of' some of the administrative functions of the Department whicli were in contemplation for sonic time, it was not considered advisable to appoint additional officers, but this has now been found imperative, in order to give some relief, and action is now being taken to secure more assistance. It may be added, however, that, in the existing circumstances, due to the war, it is thought all officers should be prepared to make sonic sacrifices. Tlie majority of the oflicers have cheerfully and voluntarily made sacrifices in the matter of extra service, and, so far as I am aware, none of them is smarting under what is conceived to be an injustice. I should mention that payment ofovertime is made in all cases, as prescribed in the Public Service Regulations and in awards of-the Arbitration Court. PLYI NG CORPS. Minister for Defence, upon notice1. Whether a mechanic in the Australian Imperial Force may transfer to the Flying Corps? 2. If so transferred, is he entitled to a mechanic's pay of 8s. per day? 3. If he is paid as a mechanic, is his separation allowance reduced so that his total pay will not exceed 10s. per day? 4. If there is a reduction, docs it not put a single man on a better footing than one who has a wife and family? orable member's questions are as follow:1. Yes; providing there.are vacancies. 2. Yes. 3. Yes; provided that if pay and separation allowance, on basis of a private, would amount to more than 10s., the higher rate is paid. 4. No. Payments to married men and families are never less than those to single men, and, in many cases, are greater on account of separation allowance.

33,Mr Watt,It weakens solidarity a,28,Budget 1917 18
34,Mr Tudor,"Of course it does. Ionly the other day I read in the newspapers a statement that the Government have just provided a new Cabinet table, made of Australian timber, and* covered with cowhide. It is very appropriate that the table should be covered witlrcowhide, in view of the toughness of the hides of some Ministers who will sit around it . This table has been constructed for the purpose of accommodating the numerous Ministers who compose the present Government. I can quite understand that if the numbers of that Ministry continue to increase as they have been increasing it will soon be necessary to knock out the walls of the building, regarding the constriction of which the present Postmaster General was resiponsible for an inquiry. I have no doubt that he will then be able to inform us how a wall or two can best be taken out of that structure with a view to improving it and to accommo*lating the additional Ministers. couraging to the rank and file. that there are fifty-five members of the National party in this Chamber and twenty-four in another place, I can scarcely believe that the Government intend to create a Cabinet of seventy-nine Ministers. It is true-as the honourable member for Henty pointed out-that today there are a great number of paid positions which are practically within the gift of the Ministry. why an addition had been made to the number of Ministers. if Ministers are permitted to make statements in the press to the effect that they intend to run their Departments as they choose, and that they propose to do away with Public Service examinations, there must necessarily be a weakening of Ministerial solidarity. There are one or two matters to which I wish particularly to refer, and I desire to direct the attention of the Acting Prime Minister to one of them. It relates to a class of Public Service employees, namely, the women ofiice cleaners. from the provisions of the Public Service Act. They are under every Minister, but it would be fairer if they were to one of the Ministers direct. It is not placed under the direct authority of one Ministeri f that were possible. wish the Acting Prime Minister would either deal with their position himself or allocate the task to one specific Minister. The hours and pay of these women have been discussed by various Cabinets from time to time. In 1910 or 1911, the Ministry of which I was then a member increased their wages from £1 to 25s. a week. In the Victorian State Service they had been getting 25s. for a number of years, until the Patterson Government came into office. Thereafter the rate of pay was reduced, until these women were getting only £1. Nowi t is indisputable that if 25s. was a fair rate in 1911, 25s. is not a fair wage to-day. The women have to put up with unusual hours of employment. Their duties do not cover a straight-out period, as is the case with ordinary workers. In the case of the majority of them, the earliest trains into Melbourne must be caught, and they arrive at their duties at about 6 a.m. They work for about an hour and a half to two hours, and then return home. Then they are in attendance at the Government offices again at the close of the day's work, and they again have to work for about two hours or two hours and a half. If the women cleaners are living near a railway station, they naturally avail themselves of the benefit of monthly tickets. Most of them, however, live as close as possible to the scene of their work, and that means that they come in on the trams. The majority are widows with children, since it has been a rule with the authorities either to give such work exclusively to widows, or, in extreme cases, to the eldest daughters of widows who have become too old or unfit to carry on. The Victorian ""Wages Board, recognising the need for granting higher rates of pay when the Federal Government gave 25s. a week in or about 1911, fixed the rate at 22s. 6d. for this work. Since then the Board has granted 27s. 6d. for a thirtyhour week. The reason why the Federal Government office cleaners did not reThey are exempt ceive as much as that was that their hours were shorter.

Any Customs Minister who has been compelled to reMay, 1918, and during that time has permain in his office after ordinary hours formed his work in a satisfactory manner. will have noticed, no doubt, that the cleaners are always waiting to attend to most willing worker, and his services would their work; and I am sure that in every possibly instance this waiting has been underto give preference to returned soldiers. taken uncomplainingly. into. which I desire to draw attention is the twenty years' experience as a typist and action taken by various Federal Departstenographer.

42,Mr Tudor,"I say that every rean excuse to get r i d of them. I am absolutely opposed to that policy, and I shall do my best in a l l cases to see that the men are given a fair deal. Recently there was brought under my notice the case of a man who was offered a position in the Defence Department as an examiner. He told me he did not like to take it because he knew that if he did so know what doctor passed my son. The a married man with five children dependent upon him would have to be dismissed; but he also knew that if he did not take the position some one else would. The responsibility is on the Government to treat every case on its merits, and while married men with heavy obligations upon them should be considered, the Government should see that perfectly fair treatment in the matter of employment is meted out to returned soldiers. I desire now to refer to another matter which has been mentioned in this House from time to time, namely, the inquiries being made by Mr Barnett into the question of enemy origin of employees in the Public Service, I have here what is alleged to be, and what I believe is, an accurate statement of questions submitted to a particular member of the Public Service. I shall not give his name, but I might state it is not of foreign origin, and when I mentioned the matter to the honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr. Fenton) the other night he told me that he had known the boy's parents for a long time-lon g before they were married. They had lived in the Avoca district, he said, for a number of years, and were of I r is h descent. The young man to whom I refer was instructed to call on Mr Barnett at his office. He had no idea at that time what he was wanted for or why the following questions were, put to him:Your name? Age? Position? Where employed, and for how long? He answered these questions, and was are not likely to get much satisfaction out then required to supply answers to the of it . Apparently, the Commissioner has following::Married or single?-Married. How many children?-One. Age of the eldest boy?-There is not one. because he could not tell where his grandAge of daughter?-Tw o years. Any brothers?-One. Has he tried to enlist?-Yes; he was rejected. What doctor rejected him?-I do not know. agitating the minds of the people Mr Tudor. The magistrate might just as well ask me what doctor passed my son, for I do not know, and I w ill guarantee that honourable members with brothers or sons at the Front could not tell what doctors passed them for active service. further questions wereWhere was he examined?I do not know. Where were you born?-(Ful l information given.) Birthplace of father and mother?-Victoria, but do not know exactly where. Birthplace of grandparents?I do not know. The magistrate, referring to this answer, told the young man that he had better find out where his grandparents were born. I will guarantee that not 50 per cent, of honourable members, who, I presume, regard themselves as of average intelligence, could tell where their grandparents were born. birth certificate? pay 2s. 6d. to get a copy of a b i r th certificate-and I know that it would be quite impossible for me to find out where my grandparents were born, because the whole of my father's and mother's people are dead.

Where are they?-France. How many War Bonds have you purchased? -£10 . Where are they?I sold them. Did you pay for them?-Yes. How much have you subscribed to the Bed Cross?I do not know. In regard to the last question, also, the young man was told that he would have to find out. If this is the way the inquiry is to be conducted, I am afraid we made up his mind to suspect every person who comes before him to be of enemy origin; and in the case of this young man, parents were born, he was assumed to be stubborn or insolent.

Report No. 1 deals with bread, and the above questions are not repeated in connection with any of the other reports. That reference was sent to the Inter-State Commission on the 9th August, 1917, and, probably, they received it the next day. The first report dealing. with meat was submitted by the Commission on the 3rd October, and was signed by Messrs. A . B . Piddington, George Swinburne, and N . Lockyer. It was not presented to the House and ordered to be printed u n t i l 24th A p r i l of this year. The House had met in January, and the report could have been presented then. parently, other influences were at work in the meantime, because, according to AppendixA of Report No. 7, dealing with meat, the Prime Minister, on the 23rd February, before this Parliament had an opportunity of seeing the first report, sent the following letter to the Chairman of the Intefr-State Commission, Sydney: Dear Sir,-Tw o deputations, representing the who)esale meat traders and the Producers Association of New South Wales waited upon me to-day in connection with the proposal of the Government to adopt the recommendation of the Inter-State Commission to fix the local price of meat on the basis of the Imperial Government contracts, and made statements whicli appear to call for further consideration. As you are aware, the Government have instructed Mr Whitton, Chief Prices Commissioner, to take the matter in hand with a view to giving effect to the Commission's recommendations, but after hearing the statements of the deputations I have come to the conclusion that it is> advisable to re-open the question, to give them an opportunity of placing fresh evidence before you. In the meantime, I have promised to stay proceedings. Will you be good enough to arrange for the persons interested to have an opportunity of placing their case before the Commission as early as possible? I should be glad i i Mr Whitton could attend in his official cap'acity to take such, part in the inquiry as may be necessary. That letter was sent before honourable members had an opportunity of seeing the report. The report was not ordered to be printed until 24th A p r i l , so that we would probably not get it before May. When the Commission dealt w i th the question, Messrs. Piddington and Mills, Deputy Commissioner, reported : The evidence showed that the parties who asked for a re-opening of the inquiry had not read the previous reports, and that they held mistaken opinions upon two important points, namely, the recommendation of the Commission, and its reasons. Could any denunciation bej more scathing ? The people who asked for the re-investigation had not read or even considered the report, and based their application on mistaken opinions on the only two points that mattered. not get the reports. not get them.

On that point the Commission s a y In spite of one or two imprudent individual utterances, the Commission cannot anticipate a deliberate conspiracy of sabotage against Governmental regulation on the part of a law abiding class such as the graziers and farmers of the community. If the Government do as some of the press have advised them to do, are these people going to withhold their sheep and cattle from the market? Is that to be their attitude if the Government direct that the price which they have accepted for shipment overseas shall be the price to prevail in Australia? When I had the honour and privilege of being Minister for Trade and Customs, I said that the people who were sending food stuffs out of Australia, particularly mutton, which I was dealing w i th then in New South Wales and Victoria, must make them available to the people of Australia at the same price. The Government to-day are only getting back to where we were in September, 1915. Certain Governments in the Commonwealth at that time endeavoured to get the shippers of mutton to send their mutton down to the ship's side to send away. That was done in New South Wales. They ordered large shippers to send trucks of mutton down to the sliips, and said that it should go away; but I gave instructions to the Collector in New South Wales and other States that they were not to be allowed, to send any meat away from Australia unless it was made available to the people of Australia at the same rate.

In 1915, fourteen months after the war broke out, when the Labour party was engaged in an endeavour to obtain an alteration to the Constitution, the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), who was then a member of that party, said, "" The cost of living has so increased that it is with the utmost difficulty that people can exist to-day. There, are people in this country who pose as patriots, who give £ 5 0 to a patriotic f u n d and yet fleece the public of £5,000 by means of in creased prices.""

Upon an examination of a number of pastoralists' accounts in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, it has been found that, coupled with the recent good seasons, the high prices of meat and of wool have resulted not only in the losses of the drought being overtaken, but in such profits being made that, taking the losses of the drought with the profits since, the four years 1914-1017 (both inclusive) show a better total position than the previous four years.

I am surprised that Mr Kidman has said that he is getting quite enough out of tbe meat he is selling at the I m perial contract price. Before goods are exported their value has to be declared, and this gives a basis on which to calculate prices. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) in this way calculated the export price of wool tops to Japan before the war, and compared it with the price that is being paid for them now. .cattle to which the honourable member has referred are still immature. vernment I discouraged the killing of female and immature stock, b u t of late the price of lambs and calves have been so high that very few female animals can have been killed. compelled to market female stock, just as a business man may be compelled to realize good securities; but for the most part female stock are not sent to market so long as they can be used for breeding. The Inter-State Commission, on page 12 of the report, saysThe conclusion drawn is that, in tlie six States (excluding the Northern and Federal Territories) there are now 11,000,000 cattle, and 00,000,000 sheep. In 1913, the figures were 11,Q00,000 cattle, and 85,000,000 sheep. Viewing the internal conditions of the Commonwealth as a whole, there appears, therefore, no valid reason why the supplies of beef and meat should be dearer than in 1913, except that the causes enumerated on page 10 of report No. 2 had increased the working costs of grazing properties. The present prices for meat are found to be 100 per cent, higher in the case of beef and mutton (wholesale) than in the year before the war, though the country contains as many cattle and more sheep than at that period. son of the retail prices. member's attention to Labour Bulletin 19 for the period Apri l to June, 1917.

If the retail price is not 100 per cent, dearer, the butchers must be at a disadvantage, and the growers must be receiving the f u l l increase of 100 per cent. I think that both retailers and wholesalers are doing extraordinarily well. The Imperial contract prices are set forth on page 52 of the Inter-State Commission's reports, and on page 53 are these wordsTlie Commission is satisfied that the Imperial contract prices allow for such considerations, and that, in Mr Kidman's words, pastoralists ""are getting more for their cattle and wool than they are worth."" contradicted that statement by a letter to the press. gave evidence before the Inter-State Commission, he was on oath; and I would sooner believe Kidman on oath than K i d man not on oath. that he was speaking of the position in Queensland.

That is why they did nothing with the first report, which they received from the Inter-State Commission on 3rd October. friends are the people who profess their patriotism, while at the same time robbing the public by increasing the prices of commodities. The Government receivedthe Inter-State Commission's report in regard to the meat prices in Victoria on 3rd October, 1917, and on 23rd October they received a report regarding New South Wales and Queensland No honourable member was able to see either of those reports until they were ordered to be printed on 26th April last. All we could get of the contents of the reports were the odd bits which were dropped here and there. We have not been able to get the reports regarding other matters that have been referred to suits the Government they publish it ; . if it does not suit them they refer it back for further consideration. The supporters of the Government have made a similar complaint against them. Some time ago a Board composed, not of Labourites, but of business men, was appointed to inquire into the working of the Defence Department. It presented a report, but because that report did not suit the Department it was held back, and honourable members opposite complained of the delay in publishing it. The position is much the same in this case. The Prime Minister said that the Government had decided to adopt the report of the Inter-State Commission, but since it was thought that the decision of the Commission was not based upon the best of evidence they were referring it back to them. The reply of the Commission was referred back could not have read it , or,* if they had, did not appreciate the reasons {or their recommendations. The report was returned to the Government, and they slept on it. The Honorary Minister( Mr Greene) announced last Thursday week that he had received it from the then in print the Ministry must have had it in their possession at least a fortnight before. The report having been printed, copies of it were supplied to the newspapers, but not to members of this They do not wish to run Parliament. It was only on Friday last that we were allowed to see it, or to learn anything of it except that which we could glean from the newspapers. Surely it should have been circulated amongst honourable members simultaneously with Their its distribution amongst the newspaper offices. Minister to-day referred us to the newspapers for the Government policy in regard to this matter. question he said that he could not add anything to what had already appeared in the press on the subject. The Government and their supporters may say that this question is unworthy of serious consideration. I ask them whether the people are not entitled to obtain their meat supplies at a fair rate. We are told by an honourable member opposite that the price of meat here is cheaper Commissions. When a report than in other countries. What satisfaction is to be found in such a statement? If a man has a finger crushed in a machine, it is no consolation to him to be told of another who has lost four fingers in the same way. And it is no satisfaction to the people of Australia to learn that the price of meat in other countries is higher that it is here. Are",39,Budget 1917 18

I regret that the Government have not seen fit to come forward to-day with a definite statement as to what they propose to do in regard to fixing the price of meat. The question has been carefully considered by them. If we are to believe a statement which appeared in a Government organ, their supporters knew last Thursday what their proposals were. They discussed the matter before they went into Caucus; they discussed it again in Caucus; and they discussed it a third time in Cabinet last Saturday. In these circumstances the Acting Prime Minister should have been able to say today what the Government intend to do in regard to fixing the wholesale and retail prices of meat. The people of Australia are being called upon to pay more than they should for meat, and since meat is one of the biggest factors in the cost of living, this question is of the utmost urgency, and should have been dealt with by the Government prior to any other matter'affecting the price of foodstuffs. coming from the honourable member, seeing that he held office for so long a time as Minister for Trade and Customs. action, in spiteof the Government of the day, by preventing the export of meat in certain circumstances. gladly avail myself of this opportunity to publicly protest against the policy of the Government in regard to the exploitation of the people, particularly with respect to the prices of necessary commodities. There are some honourable members on the Ministerial side from whom neither protection nor sympathy could be expected in regard to the mere matter of the people's food supply. this side. it with great confidence of the Honorary Minister( Mr Greene), who ably and conscientiously represents the producers of the particular commodity with which my honourable leader ( Mr Tudor) has dealt, but who cannot be expected to represent moratorium the great masses of the consuming public. It is a flagrant scandal, and one that cannot be lightly regarded, that we have erected tribunals to determine the prices of certain commodities, and that when those prices have been fixed, in this time of war they have been disregarded by the persons whose business it is to produce and retail those commodities. When we remember that the present Government employs a machine, sometimes vulgarly called ""the sausage machine,"" to grind out every day regulations under the War Precautions Act, and that persons, whether familiar with those regulations or not-and it may well be supposed that they cannot be familiar with a tithe of them-ar e nevertheless prosecuted for any transgression of them, it is a public scandal that these food prices are not promulgated when they have been fixed by competent authorities. They are not made known to the general public, and the persons who ought to know them, and who are under a special duty to obey them, have flagrantly disregarded them. These people have not been punished. is in error; a very large number of prosecutions have taken place. prosecutions have taken place; but not until the fact was exposed, through the Inter-State Commission and other sources, that in a number of cases the prices fixed had been disregarded. trary to the facts. said, "" The people concerned knew that this Government would not prosecute them.""

I propose to join my honourable leader ( Mr Tudor) in bringing to book the Government, and the party which supports them, with regard to this special matter of the price of meat. A representative of the Government,when questioned on the subject to-day, made the cynical reply, "" I should like the honourable member to give notice of his question in regard to what is proposed to be done with the findings of the Inter-State Commission as to the price of meat."" again, the Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) , when a similar question was put to him, said, "" I have nothing to add to what honourable members have seen in the press with regard to the price of meat.""

Then there is my genial and interrupting friend, the honourable member for Grammore for the 'pians ( Mr Jowett), who, while the Leader of the Opposition was speaking, seemed to be bursting with a desire to put the Committee righ t on the question of meat.

On tlie 23rd of February the Prime Minister requested the Commission to re-open the question, so as to provide an opportunity of placing fresh evidence before the Commissioner.

I have put him in his place already. His interjections do not assist the consideration of the matter. I am answering an honourable memberwho apparently quite honestly ^desired to make a point. My answer to him is that whatever may be the misconceptions in the mind of the Chairman of the Inter-State Commission, and whatever the imperfections of that tribunal or lack of qualifications to deal with the question, there has been no answer to the finding of the Commission. There has been no reply to the reports of the Commission from the other side or from any will have a f u l l answer directly. f u l l answer, all I can say is that once again, out of many times, the party to which I belong will have done a very usef u l service to the country. ber's supporters will derive very little comfort from the adoption of the report of the Commission. as clearly as I may, in the time at my disposal, this, which I conceive to be a damning case against the Government.

So far from the Government then rising in indignant protest against the finding of the Commission, they put themselves into communication with Mr Whitton, the Chief Prices Commissioner, and instructed him to give effect to the finding. What occurred then? A deputation representative of the interests so well represented by the honourable members for Hume, Calare, and Wannon waited upon the Prime Minister. The members of that deputation The honourable put certain facts, or alleged facts, before him. What would one have expected from such a deputation and what would one have expected the attitude of the Prime Minister to be towards a deputation of that kind?

But did the Government, who had gone to such trouble to have the views of their friends and supporters put with greater force, and, for the third time, before the Inter-State Commission, hasten to cover their face by immediately giving effect to the Commission's report? Certainly not. On the contrary, having had their third try, a representative of the Government rises in his place in this> House and tells us that they. consider it impracticable to give effect to the recommendation of the Commission. But they did not think so when that body brought in its finding in the first place. They went to Mr Whitton to give effect to that finding. They thought it was impossible to give effect to the recommendations of the Commission only when representations were made to them by the land-owners, and by the vested interests which are concerned in keeping up the price of meat. member be content if the Government gave effect absolutely to the recommendations of the Commission? orary Minister put a somewhat similar question to my honourable leader. My answer is that, had the Government given literal effect to the recommendations of the Commission, they would have saved their face as a decent Administration. That is all I am concerned about saying. I do not for a moment pretend that if they had done so, everything they had done would have been above criticism. That is not part of my case. I am not bound to say that. I do not even pretend to know whether, word for word, I would be willing to adopt the recommendations of the Commission. It is not necessary for me to say yea or nay to a proposition of that kind. I do say, however, that the Government would not then have been deserving of the censure which they have brought upon themselves, and which they unquestionably deserve by reason of their disregard of those recommendations. That is the history of the matter up to date. The Commission have anticipated and answered quite a number of objections which have been -raised to their finding. It has been said, and it is a familiar argument which I must admit has some force, that in the matter of meat supplies-as in that of other commodities^-the most important factors are those of supply and demand. But when some of the largo land-owners were threatened with prices less than 100 per cent, in advance of those that were paid in 1913, the cloven hoof was immediately disclosed, and men like Mr Austin, a rich land-owner in the Western District, and others, were heard to say "" We will not sell. We will not produce. We will place the clamp of our arbitrary power on the law of supply and demand. Wo will apply that hateful system of sabotage to the production and sale of live stock."" The Commission further sayAnother argument was that the capital value of the flocks and herds of the Commonwealth would be seriously lowered by a reduction in the price of meat. To that argument the Commission replies^The prosperity of the pastoral industry, however, depends, not on calculations of the capital value of stock, but on the actual income derivable from that stock from year to year. meat producers borrow but the capital value of their stock? Commission further saysSecondly, it is equally certain, though not so obvious, or so often voiced, that the real monetary value of Australian incomes and wages has been, and is, seriously lowered by the great increases which have taken place in the price of meat.",44,Budget 1917 18

These interjections only lead, to further exchanges.. of them. There has never been any denial of the fact that the fixation of the price of meat on the London parity, in accordance with the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission, would be remunerative to the grower. True, there have been some attempts to show that, while that remark may apply to Queensland and New South Wales, it does not necessarily apply to Victoria. But even if it does not apply completely to Victoria, or to the southern States, by reason of the cost of transportation or from some other cause, the Commission had taken these details into consideration, and had recognised that in respect of them there might need to be an adjustment. It has been said that the prices of meat in Australia, although 100 per cent, in advance of what they were immediately prior to the war, are none the less the lowest ruling in any part of the world. A comparison has been instituted between the prices of meat here -wher e prices have not been fixed-and prices in London, where they have been fixed, which shows that the London prices are greatly in advance of those ruling in Australia. But that is a comparison which needs to be submitted only to the most cursory examination to demonstrate its absurdity. We, with our large unoccupied spaces, are producing much more meat than is required for local consumption. We are not affected by difficulties of transport and a thousand other difficulties which affect the insular situation of the United Kingdom. But when we compare the prices of meat in London, where those prices are controlled, with the prices that obtain in Paris, where they are not controlled, we are able to form some estimate of how far exploitation in war time will go if it be untrammelled by regulation. Here, again, I am indebted to the Age of Saturday last, which gives the following comparative quotations:-Leg of mutton, per lb., London, Is. 7d a price which is shocking enough in itself-Paris, 3s. 4d. Rump steak, per lb., London 2s. 2d.; Paris, 4s. 2d. Fillet of steak, per lb., London, 2s. 2d.; Paris, 5s. Pork, per lb., London, Is. 7d.; Paris, 3s. 4d.

There we have an interesting comiparison between the prices ruling for meat in two countries, both of which are at war, and both of which lie alongside each other geographically. These quotations enable us to form some conception of the service which has been rendered to the people of Great Britain by reason of the Government controlling the prices of necessary commodities. member say what are the Canadian prices ? them at hand.

When that argument was advanced in 1914, the people accepted it as a satisfactory answer to the high prices which then obtained. In 1915, 1916 and 1917, they still accepted it as more or less satisfacremarked to me that, allowing for the tory; but now that we are in 191S, when oven the young stock of 1914 have got beyond the killable age killable age now does not exist. member will agree with me that if a' bullock has been depastured upon decent land, he is killable at three years old. after he was born. he lived. would have been conceded in my favour. I was speaking the other day to a grazier in reference to this matter, and although I have taken up the more speculative and often more embarrassing business of an attorney, in a city such as Melbourne, I have been closely interested in, and connected with, the cattle business. Therefore I can claim that I know something about it. Speaking with a grazier friend a day or two agoa man who is growing stock in a fairly large way in southern Victoria-h e said to me: "" You may take it from me that this claim on the part of graziers and squatters that the prices of meat may not be fixed is so much moonshine."" He added, "" There is a discrepancy between the prices in Victoria and those in Queensland."" I know that is so. One can fatten stock much more quickly and cheaply in Queensland than* in Victoria. I remember that in the Bendigo market a Queensland bullock could compete with a bullock from northern Victoria. other State could be brought all that way, and, because it was a bigger-framed animal, and more rapidly grown, in spite of the cost of its importation it could be sold upon terms equal to the Victorian stock. of putting a beast on the market at three necessarily affect the retail price. years old. surd. A bullock is almost fully grown have waited so long for words of wisdom at three years, if it has been on good pasture. weight on. purchase of a yearling beast at £5 you should allow Is. a week for the grazier on to that animal for an additional two years. You would probably then have a beast of 550 lbs., or up to 600 lbs. If you sold at the price fixed or suggested by the Inter-State Commission, namely, 4-}d., and allowed for wastage and so on-although , by the way, there is not much waste in the fat beast in these times-ther e would be realized a very fair sum to the grower. And that would be the case even though the grower had I thought that that point not raised the beast, but had purchased it as a yearling at the high figure of £5. Thus my grazier acquaintance made what he considered a sufficient answer. And he was satisfied in his own mind, as I am in mine, that beef can be properly retailed at the price indicated by the Commission. There have been numerous interjections this afternoon, such* as,"" Are you in favour of fixation only as to the wholesaler, and not as to the retailer?"" The reason for suggesting that the price should be fixed on the wholesaler only, and by reference to the value on the hoof in those places where there were no wholesale markets, was stated by the Commission to ibe the very simple and sufficient one, namely, that the fixation at those points in the transaction would inevitably control and fix the price of the retail market. Of course, I am well aware that it is the middleman who is making huge profits at present-largel y more so than even those The beast from the of the producers, and they have been large enough.

Mr Angliss represents a class Avho do particularly well in connection with meat. ber of those who grow beef, and who are both wholesalers and retailers. The Commission pointed out that Mr. Angliss, M.L-.C. (Victoria), had pointed to the recent resumption of export in Victoria as an indication of the tendency cf meat to revert to normal prices. But, unfortunately, a like prediction was made before the Commission by that same gentleman as a witness in August, 1917, the expelcted relief to the consumer being foreshadowed for September or October of that year. The report adds: Tliat prediction has not been fulfilled, partly, no doubt, because onee the community has grown used to high prices, the tendency is for them to be maintained, even when they might, and should, come down. It must be borne in mind, too, that many carcass butchers -leadin g buyers both at sales and on stations -ar e also pastoralists, and their interest in high prices as pastoralists is not modified by their interest in low prices when buying for the butcher's trade, since they can always pass on high prices to the retailer. statement as correct? correct. if not incontrovertible, then, at least, as having been uncontroverted. figures have been published by that same person in the Sydney papers, and that he says there is not enough stock to influence one day's market. we shall be hearing, during this debate, from some of the great guns among the producers, even although they did not see fit, apparently, to go before the Commission and put that body right in its investigations. I shall quote now from the Commission's report, page 43Fiom figures that will follow (vide p. 52), it will be seen that there are now as many cattle and more sheep in the Commonwealth than in 1913. The capital value of each class of stock is much higher than in 1913, and would remain much higher if pricesfell to export level. V The income from all stock has been £27,000,000 more in the two "" fat years "" than in 1913. It has cost more to earn that income, for the reasons set out on page 10 (Report No. 2). And during the drought there was what may bb cited "" salvage expenses,"" such as hand-feeding or rent of land in such spots as Gippsland to keep stock alive.

It is not sufficient to have a secret or any other kind of deputation to the Prime Minister, and to load him up with an ex parte statement, and to induce the Commission to re-open the question, and have all that additional evidence brought before it so that it might be weighed over again. That having been done, it is not sufficient to say, "" That is incorrect,"" unless you can produce some proof in the face of such a deliberate finding by so authoritative a body.

I have already pointed out the special circumstances under which we live in Australia, where meat is a stable quant it y , and should be, and could be, made available to the people at reasonable rates. The report goes onWitnesses in the re-inquiry who were asked the specific question whether the Imperial contract prices pay the grower, uniformly answered in the affirmative. Indeed, seeing that the prices in question are about 100 per cent, higher than export prices before the drought, while, compared with the same period there is a practically equal "" visible supply"" of cattle and a greater supply of sheep now in the Commonwealth, the profitableness to the industry of this scale of prices is almost selfincreased annual return per sheep of not less evident.

The following is the summary:1. The sheep in the Commonwealth are greater in numbers than in 1913, while the number of cattle is about the same as in that period. 2. Assuming normal seasonal conditions, the carrying capacity of the grazing land now occupied in the Commonwealth has been nearly reached. 3. The present prices of meat for home consumption in New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania, and South Australia are about 100 per cent, higher than the prices in 1913. 4. The Imperial contract prices, after deducting gd. per lb. for freezing, are about 65 per cent, higher than the prices ruling in 1913, when the flocks and herds of the Commonwealth were about the same in number as at present. If the meat slaughtered in that year had been sold at the prices now suggested, the increased return to the grower would have been £13,500,000. 5. In Queensland the Imperial contract prices reduced by the arrangement with the State Government referred to under heading "" Imperial Contract Prices"" are unquestionably accepted as satisfactory. In New South Wales, export under the Imperial contract prices, which has never altogether ceased in either beef or mutton, has been resumed as to mutton on a fairly large scale. In Victoria the fair inference from the evidence is that the export of mutton and Iamb will reach normal proportions in a few months' time. 6. The Imperial contract price for wool as compared with the pre-war prices gives an than 4s. per head. 7. Every pastoral witness questioned on the point during the re-investigation admitted that the Imperial contract prices would, in normal On these facts it seems to the Commission impossible to avoid the conclusion that, considering the Commonwealth as a unit, the home consumption equivalent of the Imperial eonThe honourable tract prices would be fair to producers as a basis of prices for home consumption. If that conclusion be accepted, the only question is, what adjustment, if any, should be made to meet the special circumstances of any State. As to Queensland and Western Australia, it is clear tliat no adjustment is necessary, and the home consumption equivalent of the Imperial contract prices could be fixed as the maximum wholesale prices for local supply. The Commission With regard to New South Wales, after full consideration of all the facts the Commission is of the opinion that there also the same maximum prices might reasonably be adapted. It is very curious that these gentlemen, The report has been who have made their influence so strongly felt in opposition to the fixation of prices for meat, have been silent in regard to fixation of prices for other commodities. Occasionally they may have expressed views as to the wisdom or efficacy of price-fixing generally, but their influence was by no means made evident in the same way or to the same extent as when the question came home to those who constitute such a powerful corporation in this country. What would have been the position in connection with this investigation by the Inter-State Commission if , after having heard the evidence and adopted the finding, it remained, say, for the Australian Workers Union or th© Waterside Workers Union to approach th© Prime Minister and suggest, from their point of view, reasons why th© findings",48,Chairman Hon J M 6d Paris 5s Butter Per Lb London

As to sheep, since the numbers are now approximately 20 per cent, greater than in 1913, the State.may fairly be considered to be selfwhat it was providing, with the consequence that the same 'Workers Union maximum prices for mutton might bo fixed as Act in other States. In Tasmania, the position of the State with regard to both sheep and cattle is such that this State also might be taken as I do not know self-providing, and not in need of any special consideration in the matter of prices. Certain witnesses contended that tlie fixing of uniform maximum prices in the three Eastern States would, in the case of beef, lead to a shortage of supply in Sydney and Melbourne. There is no .reason to believe that this result would occur to any material extent. In any If it were anything case, such a difficulty could be met by bringing supplies of beef from Brisbane to Sydney ana Melbourne. Evidence has been given that the Queensland Government has always been willing to assist in this direction. The Queensland Labour Government, through its State meat shops, has done a service to that State which has made, and will make, its name immortal in Australia.

In those centres an official declaration should be made of the maximum weights upon which the bidding is to be based. 3.

What the Commission reported under that head was relevant to the fourth specific question in the Prime Minister's original request, viz., whether ruling prices were due to combinations or manipulation of markets. It is not relevant to the present re-inquiry, but, in fairness to parties who either were, or deemed themselves to be, implicated in certain strictures in that report, full opportunity was given to such parties to deal with, the statements iu question.

There was an impression that the Government intended to inaugurate butchering generally as a State service. The market reports show that prices at once rose. With regard to the Pool-whic h is not to be confused with the Field Combination-it should also be mentioned that the stock owned by Mr Field actually yarded during the Pool were not important in number. This leaves untouched the general question of the advantage to Mr Field of high prices for stock, since, as a pastoralist, he owns and is interested in a large number of stations.

There is no parallel. My mature judgment, as also my advice to the Government, is that we should follow a policy of "" hands off the flocks and herds of Australia "" in any policy of price-fixing. tinkering with sewing twine and the odds and ends of the community, it is a matter of very little concern; but there is underlying the greater question of fixing the price of meat the test, to which I have already alluded, as to how far such a policy can be pursued in war time or in peace time. I -am glad that this matter has cropped up. I have not the slightest feeling of ill-will against any honourable member of the Opposition who has raised it , or against any honourable member sitting on the Ministerial side who believes in a policy of fixing the price of meat; and I do not think that I can be charged with having no concern for those who are carrying on the war in this country without seriously undermining industry. with those members of participant families who remain in Australia, and have to stand up to the present high prices of commodities, but I hope to show them that there is a better means of handling this question than .that which has been propounded. I admit that the conditions obtaining during the war are the very reverse of those which . obtain during peace; and if I thought that it would be wise to place on the people of Australia the same restrictions and bans as are i m posed in belligerent countries, which are parcelling out in the smallest quantities every atom of national resource in order to sustain their people, I would say, ' By1 all means, let it be done."" Everything else must stand aside for the 'successful prosecution of the war. No man should emerge from this struggle richer than when he entered it ; but while making that admission, I maintain that it is devilishly hard to successfully substitute any economic condition for natural blind in regard to these matters, nor do I follow any old or time-worn policy in regard to them; but having looked [209]3 around all the phases of this subject, I claim that, in the best interests of the masses of the people, it is better to encourage the natural and normal increase in the production of the country, so far as its flocks and herds are concerned,rather than to follow a policy of fixing prices. If we pass aside without any action, ; the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission, we are placing that body on When we are trial as to its efficacy. It has a constitutional position in the life of our country, and it has. been intrusted by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) w it h many investigations; but I have carefully scanned its two reports on the fixing of the price of meat, and, while I recognise that it has shown evidence of industry and fair play, as far as it can come from a body which is not a practical one on such a question, If a i l to find any evidence to show that it has succeeded in gripping the great fundamental principles upon which the flocks and herds of Australia rest. In its Report No. 2 it does not venture to advise the Government. It simply makes the following suggestion :I am in great sympathy Shouldi t be desired to fix the price of meat in Victoria, the Commission would draw attention to the fact that the wholesale price paid by the British Government is a payable one in Queensland. Tliat price is 4Jd. per lb. for hinds nnd fores. It would be necessary to consider, in conjunction with that price, the cost of transferring cattle from Queensland to Victoria, which could be ascertained by the Chief Prices Commissioner. Jt appears to the Commission that, if meat prices arc to be fixed, the simple plan is to fix the wholesale prices, rather than attempt the detailed fixation of the retail prices for different cuts. If there be any recommendation in the report it is embodied in that suggestion. Two matters will need careful attention. One is to avoid fixing prices in such a way as to encourage abnormal exporting. The other is the question raised before the Commission of commandeering cattle and sheep on the hoof to insure supplies coming forward. The Commission sees no reason to assume tliat, even if the ruling prices for wholesale meat were reduced, graziers would deliberately withhold supplies from the market. The question of compulsion, therefore, is prematurely raised. laws. I am not purThat, in substance, is the suggestion of ReportN o . 2.

The basis which the Inter-State Commission recommends the Government to adopt, namely, the price fixed for the I m perial contracts, does not to-day represent the London parity, if I so might call it , of beef, mutton, or lamb. It is the result of a price determined upon a considerable time ago, when the exporters and Government agreed that it was "" up to "" Australia to provide beef and mutton as cheaply as possible for the fighting battalions abroad, Imperial or otherwise. The price fixed is for the frozen surplus beef and mutton, as distinguished from the local or fresh meat of the country. that after the drought there was a period in which there was not sufficient fresh beef and mutton in Australia to meet the requirements of our own people, and it was then the hardest thing to induce our public to eat the frozen commodity. was living on salt meat. ber assisting a number of producers in their efforts to dispose of some 40,000 or 50,000 carcasses of lambs from an inland Freezing Works, and hawked the meat about Melbourne at 6d. per pound, it was a considerable time before we succeeded in selling it , while fresh lamb was at the time about Is. per pound.

The sion when we may thresh it out altogether point is, however, that the Inter-State Commission has not, from the inception, attempted to ascertain the true basis on whicli price fixing, if it be a sound p r in ciple, must rest, namely, the cost of production. Has this or any preceding Government ever attempted in price fixing to ascertain the cost of production ? They have not done so in the case of meat, butter, or any commodity in which we deal. If price fixing is right in principle, it must be applied to the whole of the industries of tlie country. We cannot say to one section that the product of its labour shall have the price fixed, while the product of another section shall be sold at whatever economic price it w ill fetch in the market. H a d the Inter-State Commission sought accuWe remember rate information on which to base values, it would have inquired as to the numbers of the flocks and herds in Australia, and the proportion that are f a t and immediately available for market, for it is a false economy to put calves into the pot when mature beasts are ready.

If I .could be shown that the industries on which the credit of the country rests could be maintained under a sound principle of price fixation in the middle of the war, I"" would not be averse to it . But I ask my honourable friends in' Victoria who support this proposal, where do they start? Wo have been told here and in the press, that it is the big, f a t pastoralists who are to be benefited by price-fixing. So far as Queensland is concerned, if the recommendation of the Inter-State Commission is carried out, the consumer there will pay more for his local beef than he is paying to-day. The price proposed for that State is in exicess of what is paid today. In Victoria, on the other hand, who will beh it first ? We are indebted in Victoria to the dairyman whose calves OT poddies go to our grazing and pastoral lands; and it is the dairyman who will be the first to be hit. It is not a matter of hitting the owners of the great herds of Queensland, but of writing down the value of the calves by the first levy in Victoria. ber deal with the Inter-State Commission's contention that the dairy farmer should not desire to raise the price of cattle ? Commission, and the press, point to the seeming anomaly that the dairyman * should desire to raise the price of stock against himself. I remind the honourable member, however, that half the dairyman's calves are steers, which do not go back to the dairy, and, in the natural course of events, it does not take half his heifer calves to keep up his herd. The argument, therefore, is fallacious; the dairyman knows on which side his bread is buttered, and he may be lef t to look after himself. In the made to the Acting Prime Minister( MrW a t t ) to re-open this question, the most prominent, though I did not observe tlic big squatter in the proceedings. T hope that the press of the country will not continue to circulate the fallacy that the great squatter is going to be h u rt by price-fixing. I venture to say that if the honourable member for Grampians ( Mr Jowett) considered his own in terests, instead of being, as he is, the stalwart representative of the small men in his constituency, he would not raise his voice against the Commission's proposal to give h i m more on his Queensland cattle than he could possibly get to-day. If the proposal is carried there w ill be immediate conflict between two governing activities in price fixing. The price fixed in Queensland is immeasurably lower than that which would be fixed by ' the Commonwealth. Does the honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Higgs) assent to a proposal that will increase the price of food to the poor people in that State? To a limited extent the same argument applies to the back country in' New South Wales. In Western Australia, as the result of good seasons since 1914, the flocks and herds have been built up. That State, unlike Victoria, Queensland, and New South Wales, is not highly organized so far as export is concerned. There are very few export facilities, with the result that the value of sheep and cattle there is much lower than in the eastern States. In Victoria, had we been lef t alon© u n t i l the end. of the breeding season, we should have almost overtaken our pre-drought W ill the honourable memtallies. Then would disappear one of the factors in the inflation of prices, namely, drought conditions, which force the landowner into the market to replenish his flocks 'and herds at almost any price for Inter-State breeding stock. Then there have been abnormally good seasons since the drought -probabl y three of our best years-and all these influences, in Victoria in' particular, have tended to raise the price of beef ' and .mutton. We have just about overtaken our shortage. In the coming season the graziers' competition will disappear so f a r as sheep are concerned. It is generally anticipated that in the coming lamb season the freezing exporter will re-establish himself in the Victorian market, and be the chief representations buyer. All tlie raisers of sheep and cattle are not fatteners, and they are not all breeders, both breeding and fattening dairymen in Victoria were areas being limited. When you fix the price of beef, mutton, and lamb, you write down the value of the flacks and herds of Australia. Not one proposal has been made by the members of the Opposition, by the Government, or by the InterState Commission which will deprive the so-called profiteer of any opportunity",54,Chairman Hon J M 6d Paris 5s Butter Per Lb London

I hope that it will not he said that the producers, whose business it is to breed, rear and fatten stock for sale to the highest bidder in the open ""market are profiteers. They cannot properly be called profiteers, being ready sellers to the highest, bidder. The proposals of the Government, though more reasonable than the recommendations of the Inter-State Commission, will not deprive one branch of the meat trade of the opportunity of making as much as has hitherto been made out of a beast. All the cuts from tail to tongue are scheduled and setdown. Say, for the sake of argument, that a 600-lb. beast cuts up worth, at present prices, £ 3 0 , and that under the Government list of prices those cuts will, bring only £ 2 6 . W ill the trade set to work to reduce its profits? No. It will send instructions to its buyers, telling them to purchase the 600-lb. beast for £ i less than has' hitherto been paid, and thus the process of writing down the value of the flocks and herds of Australia will commence. I ask the Government what satisfaction can it find in placing the burden of price reduction on the producer ? He has played the game.

Their domicile is the northern areas of Australia, where the cost of production is little, and flocks and herds prosper. is greater, the farmers have to look to the cow, the most ""highly-powered"" animal for the purpose, to convert the grass into cream and milk, while the calf is being artificially reared. Why should these farmers have to bear the whole burden of price fixing ? Is another nail to be driven into the coffin of the producer? Why is he to be penalized: The trade, retail and wholesale, will continue to make its present profits. The consumer may get cheaper meat, but at whose cost? In Victoriai t w ill he at the cost of the small dairymen.. The grazier, if he can buy poddy calves sufficiently cheap, w ill continue to make a good profit out of them. reared if a good price cannot be got for them. it becomes unprofitable to rear calves, the dairyman w ill go back to the rearing of pigs. Men who have been mating ewe lambs and two-toothed ewes iri the endeavour Co re-establish our flocks, will turn from this work of breeding to wool growing only. The effect of the proposals of the Government will not be to increase production. Our financial participation in the war must -depend to a great extent on the maintenance of values. Yet the Government have, set themselves to reduce the value of our flocks and herds.

On the last occasion when the Government interfered, I was in the Warrnambool and Camperdown district. owners telegraphed to auctioneers all over the country, "" We will not inspect such and such wethers, or such and such lines of steers."" Why? There was no basis of ""values on which to buy. During the interval which must take place now between the announcement that prices are to be fixed and the publication of a list of prices, there will be great loss, disappointment, heart-burning, and restriction of credit. Promissory notes have to be redeemed, contracts have to be kept, markets have to be held. But there will be chaos and confusion. If there could be a compromise between the producer, the trade, and' the consumer, under which there might be an equitable reduction of prices, I would waive my objections to an unsound economic proposal, because I recognise that the country is at war, and that, beyond and above the interest of any one section of the community, are the interests of tlie whole people.

The cost of distribution is no small portion of the enormous increase in retail prices. tical Socialism. Government at the present time arises from listening to Socialistic theories. This Socialistic doctrine that price fixment was that of what I believe to be a ing will remedy everything is beginning to be proved a fallacy. Some of the commodities which have been the subject of price fixation during the war would have been enormously cheaper if there had been no interference with the prices. Price fixation may be good in the belligerent countries where. We ought to go very much further than the mere fixation of prices. that admission from the honourable member. There are probably three schools of thought-firstly , those who believe in the natural law of supply and demand, plus good regulation; secondly, those who believe in the Socialistic nostrum of price fixation; and, thirdly, those who believe entirely in nationalization. Socialism to be well administered by Conservatives. that by the time the Government have finished with the meat question they will have discovered that price fixation is not the simple thing they think it is. There is no force in this country that can ever restore the losses that will be made by the bungling of officials until price fixation is abandoned. In the meantime enormous losses will be incurred by the writing down of values, and by persons buying store bullocks at prices which will not enable them to fatten the stock and sell at a profit. there was an immense fall in prices yesterday because of the talk of fixation ? dealt wTEh that. Does the honourable member think that dairymen should suffer a drop of £2 per head on their calves ? question. price of cattle in Victoria starts with the dairyman's poddy calves raised round the coastline upon which the stock raisers draw for the stocking up of other areas. Very few graziers in Victoria breed their own cattle for rearing on their holdings. Their runs are stocked from the dairymen's herds, and that is the point at which fixation must commence.

I desire to place on record the findings of the Inter-State Commission in its first report on meat. It set down the causes of the increase in the price of meat as f ollows:(a) The heavy losses of stock during the drought of 1914-15, and the consequent shortage of cattle and sheep. That is incontrovertible. (6) The operation of the Queensland embargo, as described in the report. AlthoughI know the embargo against the export of meat from Queensland has been withdrawn, the Government of that State were the first offenders in raising the price of meat in the southern States. Their action affected South Australia most. With very great deference to the Queensland members, T admit that on the intercession of the then Minister for Trade and Customs( Mr Tudor) we did get a ship-load of shin beef, plucks, tripe, and so forth, from Queensland, but the Victorian Government declined to accept the consignment, and it was disposed of at the Queensland Government's risk.

Australia, _ while one was employed in the chemical adviser's branch, two in the Small Arms Factory, four in the Clothing Factory, and one in the Cordite Factory, making a total of thirty. My only reason for referring to this matter is that, as far as I am able to discover, the only persons affected by this return are those receiving low salaries. For instance, of the three of enemy birth to whom I have already referred one is in receipt of a salary of £290 per annum, another receives £254 per annum, and the other, a young lady, receives £1 16s. per week. descent are as follow:-£35 4 a year, £180 per annum, 10s. 3d. per day, 12s.

The peculiar fact is that quite a number of highly-paid officers of enemy birth or descent are employed in the Defence Department, but have evidently been overlooked in this return. While the low-salaried men are singled out and their names published to the world, not a word appears in this return regarding highly-salaried officers in the Defence Department who are of direct enemy descent. honourable member name them, and we will have them dismissed. to name them. My only reason for referring to the matter is that I think that if an inquiry is to be held it ought to be an impartial one. I was informed in reply to a question that I asked to-day that the inquiry was not limited to certain grades and positions, but covered every part of the Service. I understand that Mr Barnett is now inquiring fully into this matter. Evidently the return laid on the table of the House does not cover the whole of the facts, and I am anxious that the magistrate, in his inquiry, shall have so much liberty granted him by the Government that his report will cover not only the lower paid men, but the higher salaried officers, who are equally involved. I have no complaint to make against the employment of these men in the Department. They were not employed because they were Germans; there was no discrimination because of that fact. A t the time they were engaged they were reputable citizens. They were men and women-ther e is quite a number of women involved-wh o had the qualifications for the position, and were accepted as such, and they have occupied these trusted positions without question until now. The fact that we are at war with Germany is taken as sufficient justificaThe salaries of those of enemy tion for at any rate inquiring into their position and doubting their loyalty. I am not taking up that aspect of the matter to-day. The point that I wish to make is that if there is any danger at all, those capable of doing us the most are not the men occupying the lower positions in the Service, but those in the higher ranks. It is those very men, occupying positions of high responsibility, acquainted with the most intimate secrets of our defence system, who are capable of doing us so much injury that if the complaint that these people should not be associated with the Public Service, and particularly with the Defence Department, is at all well founded, then they, first of all, should be affected by the inquiry, and should be dealt with if it is proposed to displace any of these people. From that point of view I shall await with considerable interest the result of Mr Barnett's inquiry. I understand that up to the present no reports have been received from him. until he has finished his inquiry. Mf.

327,Mr Finlayson,"The only inforput out of the Service because he is of enemy birth or descent, let ihein all go out. It should be a case of all i u or all out. One man whose name is mentioned in this return has already been discriminated against. He has a splendid record in -the Public Service, and is a man of my own acquaintance. He is of German birth. There are others of German birth whom I know to be occupying very important positions in the Defence Department and concerning whom not a word appears in this return. In fact, we hear of their promotion and continuance in responsible positions. not fair to those who have no opportunity for redress, and if the making known of the result of it is to be delayed until the whole of the Public Service has been inquired into, those under suspension will be most unfairly treated. I hope the Government will see that those whose positions are being inquired into receive some protection during the progress of the investigation. Another matter to which I wish to refer relates to the question I raised in the House some two months ago, in regard to the unfortunate and appalling state of affairs in F i j i , in connection with the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's operations there. In the last annual report of the company, the following passage occurs: Some of you may have noticed attacks on the company in various Australian newspapers about the conditions under which the Indian labour is housed and worked in Fiji. About these it is only necessary to say tliat all details of the living conditions of these people, and their relations with employers, are strictly ordered in accordance with regulations laid, down by the Indian and Colonial Governments. It is certain, moreover, that in respect to health, earnings, and prospective employment, immigrants are much better off in Fiji than in India, the one serious defect being the discrepancy of the sexesa point inseparable from emigration from every country. The attack, though apparently directed at'the company, is really on the Fiji Government, and it is, we believe, instigated and carried out by the party in India which has for its object the weakening of British rulo in that country. From the Colonial Sugar Refining Company's point of view, that statement may be quite satisfactory, point of view of the public, pecially that section of the public that has regard to the good name of Australia, and wishes to keep it free from any stain with regard to the ill-treatment of other races, it will not be at all satisfactory. Mr Finlayson. over F i j i . difficulty. The honourable member for Herbert( Mr Bamford) is aware that the Indian Government know quite well our limitations in regard to the control of affairs in F i j i , yet claim that since the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is an Australian enterprise we ought, at all events, to exercise some pressure upon it to make the condition of affairs in F i j i not such a disgrace to civilization as it is at present. The position recalls the This inquiry is worse episodes of the slave days, and was not equalled during the worse days of the Kanaka traffic in Queensland. The facts are not denied in the company's report. The only qualification is that the treatment of these people conforms to the demands of the F i j i an Government, and that the housing conditions are according to the regulations laid down by the Indian and F i j i an Governments. The peculiar thing is that the Indian Government, so far from being satisfied, has twice sent Commissioners to F i j i in connection with the matter. Professor Andrews, M . A . , who was in Australia recently, appealed to the Commonwealth Government, and also to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, for some redress for the subjects of India, and for considerable alterations in these matters. Here is an extract from a letter received quite recently from India, referring to the return of Professor Andrews to that countryMr Andrews stayed for over an hour, and we did talk, as you may imagine. He then had to hurry oil"" to the Palace, where he was to dine with his friend through twenty years', the dear old Bishop. Mr Andrews had a good time in Bombay, the folk there raising £1,100 for the nurse he is so keen on having sent to F i j i ; and then in Simla, the Viceroy, of course, brought a certain amount of knowledge previously gained in Australia to the question in hand. But, knowing us he does the high respectability of the Colonial Sugar Refinery shareholders in New South Wales, for instance, Lord Chelmsford found it hard to believe things were quite as bad as Mr Andrews declared. However,*the Fiji Government report convinced both the Viceroy and the Bishop. That is an Unequivocal statement that, but from the however exaggerated Professor Andrews' and esreport might have appeared, he submitted such facts as proved the soundness of his contentions. orable member think about sending a",60,Chairman Hon J M 6d Paris 5s Butter Per Lb London

The Imperial Conference is a very reasonable and proper place at which to discuss this matter, and perhaps to arrive at a solution of the difficulty. A t any rate, there would be no harm in the Government suggesting to Mr Hughes and Mr Cook that this matter should receive their attention while they are at the Conference. I can only promise that later on as these matters develop I shall continue to draw attention to the position in P i j i , with the hope of securing som< redress for the people there. This brings me to the consideration of another matter which I consider of very great importance at the present time. We have received fresh reports of a speech made by the Prime Minister of Australia that the kind of talk indulged in by Mr. ( Mr Hughes) in New York. I quote Lloyd George, the resolutions of the Parisf r o m the Argus of the 1st JuneHe said:-""Australi a and New Zealand look style adopted by Mr Hughes, are not to America to stand by them at the peace going to help us to secure that just and table, as well as on the battlefield.

It will increase the bitterness, of the conflict, and render a satisfactory ending of the war -much more difficult. There are already two things standing like a barrier across the way to peace. One is, of course, the Paris Economic Conference, than which there could be no more direct incentive to the enemy nations to continue the war. A t that Conference they were actually told in plain terms that even when they were defeated in battle, the war against them would be continued in the economio sphere, and they were, therefore, fighting for their actual bread-and-butter existence as well as their national existence. Then we have the famous speech of Mr. Lloyd George, known as "" t h e knock-out b l o w "" speech.

354,Mr Finlayson,"I have the wholeabout the destruction of German militarism. member will allow me to do so without interruption, I will read three short extracts from it. Referring to the speech by Dr. von Hertling in the Reichstag, President Wilson saysBut tlie German colonics, lie demands, must be returned without debate. He w ill discuss with no one but the representatives of Bussia what disposition shall be made of the people and the lands of the Baltic provinces; w it h no one but the Government of Franco the "" conditions"" under which French territory Bhfill be' evacuated; and only w it h Austria what shall bo done with Poland. In the determination of a l l questions affecting the Balkan States he defers, as I understand him. to Aust r i a and Turkey; and wit h regard to the agreeof New Guinea be consulted at the end ments to be entered into concerning the nonTurkish peoples of the present Ottoman Empire, to the Turkish authorities themselves. After a settlement a l l around, effected in this fashion, by individual barter and concession, he would have no objection, if I correctly interpret his statement, to a league of nations which would undertake to hold the new balance of power steady against external disturbance. It must be evident, to every one who understands' What this war has wrought in the opinion and temper of the world, that no general peace, no peace worth the infinite sacrifices of these years of tragical suffering, can possibly be arrived at in any such fashion. . . . The peace of the world depends upon the just settlement of each of the several problems to which I adverted in my recent address to the Congress. I , of course, do not men ii that the peace of the world depends upon the acceptance of any particular set of suggestions as to the way iu which those problems are to be dealt with. I mean only that those problems each and a l l affect the whole world; that unless they are dealt wit h in a spirit, of unselfish and unbiased justice, with a view to the wishes, the natural connexions, the racial aspirations, the security, and the pence of mind of the peoples involved, no permanent peace w ill have been attained. They cannot be discussed separately or in corners. None of them constitutes a private or separate interest, from which the opinions of the world may be shut out. Whatever affects the peace affects mankind, and nothing settled by military force, if settled wrong, is settled at all. It w ill presently have to be reopened. President Wilson there emphasizes what Mr Lloyd George has repeatedly stated, namely, that in this war the Empire is not actuated by any selfish motive-that it desires no annexations and no indemnities. Yet our own Prime Minister, speaking on behalf of the Government, has declared that Australia does not agree with that principle, and that it is in favour of annexations. nexations is not so much the individual profit of Australia as the prevention of militarism. will apply equally well to Alsace-Lorraine and Poland from the French and Russian point of view. We cannot apply it only to Europe. Honourable members will recollect that on the 22nd May last I called the attention of the Acting Prime Minister( Mr Watt), to a statement which appeared in the London Daily Mail of 11th March, 1918, to the effect that considerable uneasiness exists in Australia lest the people of the war as to whether they wish to go back under the control of Germany or not. That newspaper continuesThe ordered discipline of Australian administration is unpopular by contrast with the previous licence allowed under German rule. Germany's favourite method of colonization hereabouts is to demoralize the populace by a system of pampering preparatory to the establishment of a system of slavery. New Guinea, when it was captured, was enjoying the pampering process, hence the resentm?nt here. W h e n I d r e w the honorablo gentleman's attentio n to t h a t extract, the Act in g P r i m e M in is t e r saidI am not aware that there is any uneasiness in Australia in regard to this matter. I do not pretend to know any more than other honourable members may know about it ; but I think that if that feeling of uneasiness does exist we would have heard of it in this Chamber. The statement of the Daily Mail is without warrant as far as my judgment enables me to speak.

360,Mr Mathews,"Certainly not. Ithat I am not prepared to echo the sentiment expressed by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews). I have no objection to seeing Germany's Possessions in the Pacific taken from her for ever. I am not for one moment advocating that captured Possessions should be returned to Germany, but I am complaining that the Prime Minister, without the warrant of this Parliament, and certainly without the warrant of the people of Australia, has, before reaching London, announced to the world a policy of "" Hands off the P a c if i c "" so f a r as Germany is concerned. guarding the people of Australia. tion of what is the Prime Minister's purpose. Honourable members are endeavouring to get away from my argument entirely. My point is that the Prime Minister of Great Britain, speaking on behalf of tlie Allies, and laying down the conditions upon which they are prepared to discuss terms of peace, has declared that the future of the German colonies is to be determined at the Peace Conference. That is the place, and the only place, where Mr Hughes has any right to make the statements which he is now reported to have made in New York. He, more than any one else, was responsible for those Paris Economic Conference resolutions. We all know what an enormous amount of trouble that Caused in Great Britain. It has been a perfect bane in connection with the statements made by the Imperial Government iis to its position regarding the war. The Paris generally admitted to have been a huge mistake : it has done more than anything else to incite Germany to exercise its utmost efforts to find a successful issue to the war. long before the Paris economic resolutions were passed. the Paris economic resolutions to-day are not accepted by the Imperial Government. peatedly. Lord Lansdowne, speaking in regard to the speech made by Mr Lloyd George, from which I have already quotedI am in agreement with the Prime Minister in believing that a just and lasting peace can only be based upon the three conditions specified. The acceptance of these conditions by Germany would imply that the old spirit of military domination had been finally exorcised. And MrA r t h u r Henderson, Leader of the Labour party in the Imperial Parliament, saidWe accept the principle of self-determination of nationalities. The future of Ireland depends on the decision of a convention of Irishmen now sitting in Dublin Further, the Labour party accept the principle of self-determination for all peoples, and believe that this can bo secured for Egypt and India by a rapid extension of self-governing institutions on dosafeminion lines. We accept the principle of no annexations. We will take no territory out of the war. In the case of populations which desire to be freed It is not a quesfrom their present governors, but are not strong enough to stand alone, we regard ourselves as under a moral obligation to secure them international protection. But we do not desire to take this task on ourselves alone unless we are explicitly requested to do so by the Peace Conference or some similar international authority. As for indemnities, we want none. But, like our Russian comrades, we demand reparation according to international law for definite wrongs done to nations or individuals. I have quotations here also fro m Mr Philip Snowden, Mr Ramsay MacDonald, Mr John Hodge, and Mr. Victor Fisher, all of whom approve of the statements of Mr Lloyd George concerning territorial aggrandizement. The idea of annexations is now repudiated by all the Allied Powers. Even France does not want territorial aggrandizement, in the sense of adding new territory to her Possessions. All that France is claiming -and rightly so, too, in my view-is that her lost Provinces, so ruthlessly taken Economic Conference is now from her by the Germans, should be restored to that? unless she is made to ; but that is no justification for our declaration that we demand annexations. And what else are we doing, if not that? It was not; and agree to giving back the Pacific Islands to Germany. They have been denounced rethat. I said I was not here begging that In support of that I quote they should be given back. I said then, and repeat, that I am not advocating that",65,Chairman Hon J M 6d Paris 5s Butter Per Lb London

But I am advocating that the f u t u r e government of these German Possessions in the Pacific is not a matter for Australia to make a declaration to the world upou, but for the Peace Conference to settle. in which we should have a say. deniable, and the representations of Australia will secure very favorable and sympathetic consideration at the Peace Conference; we need have no fear on that score. I believe the Imperial Government would rejoice if the Australian Government would take over the responsibility of government in New Guinea. But the time to say that has not yet come. To say it now means to unnecessarily prolong the war, and to render an honourable peace more and more distant. honourable peace until Germany is absolutely beaten ? read Prussianism being beaten down. cognate to my argument. I am not talking upon German conditions, or upon the terms we are going to get from Germany. peace. Why don't you say so ? Chairman, would allow me to do so, I could tell the honourable member what he is; but if I did I would have to withdraw the words, so I had better not use them. I am not discussing terms of peace, or when, or how, or where we should get peace. All my argument is that to say or do anything unnecessarily placing an obstacle in the way of peace is playing' into the hands of Germany and not into the hands of the Allies. The speech of tbe Prime Minister of the Commonwealth ( Mr Hughes) is only embarrassing to the British Government, and not helpful to the Allied cause. I am not going to be dragged into a discussion on peace. I have stated in this House my views upon that subject. The mere-suggestion that I am in favour of a Germau peace does not make any difference to my opinions. Germany, prior to the war, held Possessions in the Pacific totalling about 96,000 square miles. The principal Possession was German New Guinea. Honourable members are aware that it was through the blundering of Lord Derby, then Foreign Secretary, in 1S93, that Germany got her chance of securing any part of New Guinea. Sir ThomasM c l l wraith, one of the best and most far-seeing statesmen Australia has ever had, O u r say is unsecured the whole of New Guinea iu 1893; and he was then told by the Imperial Foreign Office to mind his own business, while the flag that had been run up as a symbol of our annexation of the country had to be hauled down. Later on, Germany having taken possession of the northern part of New Guinea, aud the Dutch also putting in a claim, a partition of that territory had to be undertaken; and we secured Papua. The whole of that island would have been ours but for the British Foreign Office. It is pecuY o u do not expect an liar that the two great missionaries, who were then the most notable identities on the island-Dr. Lawes and Dr. Chalmers-bot h approved of the acextracts in connection with tion of Lord Derby. They were both very fine men, and Australia has been very largely indebted to them and their successors for the peaceful government of Papua. Not one word can be said against the character or loyalty of either. Yet Dr. Chalmers wrote that Lord Derby was right in leaving room for Germany, and If you, Mr that the Colonies were angry from ignorance. D r . Chalmers, good man though he was, was wrong in his estimate of what the futur e of New Guinea should be. many. u n t i l a few years ago. repoat that error. and, as f a r as the possession of German New Guinea is concerned, if we are to have the Monroe doctrine applied to the Pacific, it w ill be well for us to"" know just where we stand. Here is an extract from the doctrine submitted by D r . Monroe. I quote from Stead's War Facts, and I may say that I do not know of any book or magazine available in Australia that gives more useful and reliable information.

That that policy has been consistently followed was given formal expression to when the United States delegates signed The Hague Conventions, with the proviso that nothing contained therein should be so construed as "" to require the United States to depart from its traditional policy of not intruding upon, interfering with, or entangling itself in the political question or policy, or internal administration of any foreign State, nor shall anything contained in the said Conventions bo construed to imply a relinquishment by tlie United States of its traditional attitude towards purely American questions."" And there you have the Monroe doctrine in its particular application. Here is the position now: The United States, which, under that doctrine, asserted its determination not to interfere in European politics or permit European nations to interfere in American affairs, finds itself in the thick of the war. That, of course, is a most satisfactory situation from our view-point, namely, that the Monroe doctrine, as far as it affected the right of America to interfere in European politics, has been abrogated. But next we have the declaration of an Australian Monroe doctrine; and I want to know whither this policy is to lead us. I am not affected by any craven fear as to Australia ever becoming a great nation. I have a most hopeful opinion of Australia in future dominating the Pacific. much larger population before we can do that diately conicerned about 'is-Are we prepared, at the present time, to accept this tremendous responsibility t We have been charged, and, I think, truthfully, with not effectively occupying Australia.

I am not complaining that we have failed in our duty. I think very few people in the world in similar circumstances would have showu greater ability or enterprise than we have. Those men and women who have gone, those early settlers who pioneered in this country, performed a wonderful work. But we are only at the fringe. The subject is big enough, the opportunities wide enough, and the responsibilities great enough, to occupy the attention of the Commonwealth for many years to come. And now it is suggested that we should undertake much wider responsibilities,' that, although we are unfortunately weak in our occupation of this continent, we should stretch out and administer more distant Possessions. not do you justice. member should not run away with the idea that I am objecting to Australia taking up this responsibility. He and other honourable members who hold that view have allowed their minds to run along grooves of their, own, and are not following my argument. I am not arguing that we should not accept the responsibility of administering those Possessions. I am not saying that even if the Peace Conference request us to take charge we should refuse to do so. I think the handing over of Samoa to German rule was one of the most unfortunate events in our history, and now tliat New Zealand is in occupation of that territory, I hope the Dominion will be allowed to retain it. It would be a most excellent thing for Australia to hold on to as much of New Guinea as possible, because I believe there are splendid opportunities there for the production of certain raw materials that will be of immense value to Australia. I am only concerned to-night in an atx tempt to point out that in doing all these things in the Pacific, or that we should only allow these Possessions to fall into the hands of a friendly Power, we are, in effect, repudiating the statements made recently on behalf of the Allies by the Prime Minister of Great Britain( Mr Lloyd George), by President Wilson, and by President Poincare, who have declared against annexations as the result of this war. that we are not going to hand them over to an unfriendly nation. amused when I hear some honourable members talking about a friendly Power.

A t a suburban meeting, the honourable member for Yarra made a speech which was reported under the headings, ""Patriotic Pirates,"" ""Speech by Mr Tudor."" That was a most excellent phrase. I used it . Age of 8th June. I do not know whether in the present state of friendliness between that newspaper, for which I have the highest possible respect, and the Leader of the Opposition, the. reference is to Mr Tudor as one of the patriotic pirates, or whether the honourable member was referring to some one else. I presume the honourable member was alluding, among other things, to the present price of meat. Do honourable members on the other side mean to infer that the graziers of Australia have, by unfair or improper means, raised the price of meat to its present level 1 much for it. point. When my honourable friend uses such a phrase as ""Patriotic Pirates,"" which, in the minds of the people who read the headings, if they do not read the speeches, can only mean one thing, does he imply that the graziers of Australia are "" patriotic pirates "" ?

It seems to be forgotten that the Commonwealth is under responsible government. mission may recommend a certain course, but a Government which gave effect to recommendations which it considered wrong would be unworthy of the confidence of the electors.

They have occupied so much time in discussing other matters-n o doubt they think them to be of very great importance-that the Government has not, and w ill not have, an opportunity of considering any matter until Parliament goes into recess. As to how this question w ill be dealt with in detail, that is a matter for the Government to decide.

The New South Wales Government have promised to call a special session of the State Parliament to deal with the re-registration of unions, for the purpose of restoring them to their original status.

505,Mr Wallace,"I was very muchhostility displayed by the ship-owners. By Statutory Rule 87, the Commonwealth Government have assumed complete control of the shipping industry, and consequently they also control the employees in that industry. Paragraph 6 of that rule readsWith the object of utilizing to the best of advantage vessels engaged iu the coasting trade, in order to make more vessels available for the oversea shipping service, there shall be an Intcr-Stntc Central Committee (in these regulations referred to as the Committee), consisting of the Controller of Shipping, the Deputy Controller of Coastal Shipping, and six other members. This Committee has control of the whole shipping industry, and possesses wide powers. It , in turn, is responsible to the Acting Minister for the Navy; and it is within his jurisdiction to order .that employees on the vessels controlled by the Committee shall be engaged for whatever source he names. The.rule continues9. (1) The Committee shall give such directions as it thinks fit in relation to the movemated some six weeks ago that 1,500 ments and use of vessels requisitioned hy .the Controller of Shipping and in relation to the carriage ot passengers and caryo by those vessels. (2) All expenses in relation to the movements and use of the vessels and the carriage of passengers and cargo shall be paid out of the revenue of those vessels. 10. The not profits (if any) which have accrued at the expiration of the period for which the vessels arc requisitioned under these regulations shall he paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Every direction given or to be given by the Committee in relation to the movements and use of vessels and the carriage of passengers and cargo shall be deemed to be a direction lawfully given and enforceable, and compliance therewith shall excuse any person for any nonperformance of any contractual obligation which by reason of such compliance could not be performed. Employment of labour on those vessels comes completely under the jurisdiction of the Shipping Committee, aud any opposition in the Arbitration Court to the application of the employees, although ostensibly by the employers, is really by the Federal Government. The Committee is composed entirely of ship-owners, and is really the old Inter-State Shipowners' Federation, formed into a Board under Government control. That Committee is opposing the application Mr Wallace. of the Waterside Workers Union to have certain industrial conditions restored. The conditions for which these unions are asking are only fair and reasonable. The y seek no special favour. All they desire is that they shall be restored to their original status. To-day the waterside worker is treated more like a convict than a reputable citizen. When seeking employment, he has, first of all, to apply for a disc at a registry office, and in order to obtain one must produce a reference as to character. The disc having been furnished him, he has then to take his chance of securing employment. He has a number, and if he does not happen to be close to the office when his number is_ called, there is a scramble, and the man in charge tells him that he has lost his chance. Many men on the water fron t in my electorate have grown old in the calling, and cannot compete with young men in the wild scramble for work. The consequence is that many of them are practically starving. It was roughly estifamilies in the electorates of East Sydney and West Sydney were without the means of subsistence. This was due to the new method of employing labour on the wharfs and to the employment of volunteer labour. Investigation will show that the volunteers are not the men who went to the assistance of the Government at the time of the strike. The original volunteers came from various country districts, and as soon as the strike was over they returned to their former callings. Those who have succeeded them are for the most, part men who, during the strike, left otlier employments which had become disorganized. They are now receiving preference of employment on the wharfs. Most of them are young men who are better fitted to battle for work in the country than are some of the old residents of the water frontages. If the Government are really anxious to give effect to the promise of the Prime Minister, let them take this matter into consideration, and withdraw their opposition to the claims of the waterside workers in the Arbitration Court. If that opposition be withdrawn, the Court w i ll grant what they desire. They merely ask that certain pickiug-up places shall be appointed, and that every man shall be allowed to secure a disc. They urge that a man should not be debarred from employment merely because he is an ex-member of a union. Surely this is not too much to ask of the Government. The granting of this request, after all, would only be in conformity with the promise of the Government that they would restore the unions to their former status. W it h such an alteration in their conditions the waterside workers might be able to purchase meat if the ,prices were reduced. The increase in the cost of necessary commodities calls for drastic action. The honourable member for Wannon( Mr Rodgers) says that it can best be met by organization on the part of the people themselves. I agree with him. What is required is co-operation and the elimination of the operations of middlemen and speculators i i i the people's foodstuffs. There is, unfortunately, a difficulty in the way of co-operation, since co-operative stores cannot purchase except through the agency of middlemen or speculators. Pricefixing might meet the trouble to some extent, but what is necessary is direct Government intervention. Let me quote an experience of my own: We wished to purchase some chaff, and meeting a farmer who I knew was sending chaff to town, I asked him whether he could let us have some. He agreed to sell us 5 tons, and in due course we received a truck of chaff which was good and f a i r l y cheap."" It sold rapidly; but when we asked this man to supply another 5-ton lot, he replied that the Sussex-street merchants had told him that if he sold any more to us direct they would not buy from him . That is the sort of thing that the people have to combat. If the high cost of living is to be dealt with, it is up to the Government to assist the people to organize for their own protection. Just as Boards have been appointed to control the shipping and other industries, so we should have in each State Boards to control the sale of necessary commodities. should be able to eliminate the operations of the speculator and the middleman, and make an alteration in the cost of living. While we hold that price-fixing will prove satisfactory to a degree, We do not think it goes quite far enough, and unless we have a sympathetic administration, and inspectors to see that the prices fixed are observed, I am very much afraid that the poorer classes will not secure any great reduction in prices as the result of it . The price of butter, for instance, has been fixed; but those who purchase it in small quantities know that they are supplied with only third-grade butter at the maximum price fixed for butter of first quality. And so with every commodity. There is really no protection for the consumer. The consumer can be protected only by the formation of Boards such as I have just suggested, and by the appointment of inspectors to see that the prices fixed are duly observed. If a i l to understand how the fixing of prices is likely to ruin the squatter or the dairyman. They have fixed their own prices in normal times, and although we are at war, it does not necessarily follow that because the people of other countries, owing to profiteering and other reasons, are paying very high prices, the profiteers here must also be allowed to make huge fortunes. In Report JSTO. 3 issued by the InterState Commission, and dealing with f a r m products, milk, butter, & c , it is stated *at page 15 that the Commission found that there was an understanding between different companies as to the sale if condensed milk. In other words, there was a monopoly in regard to it . It is stated that the principal matters provided for in the agreement, are as follow: Clause 1. The companies, in the ajyecment, are bound to abstain from competition with one another. Clause4 eliminates the Standard Company and the Australian Milk Products Limited from competition in unsweetened condensed milk and other milk products. They are to ""concentrate"" on sweetened condensed milk. That is to say that they could only sell one particular line. Clause5 defines the proportions in which the products of the different companies shall If that were. done, we be sold. iThat was to regulate the market for themselves. Clause 11 debars the Nestle Company from making any contract for delivery of condensed milk outside the assigned proportions. Clause 13 defines the Nestle Company not to charge more for its sweetened condensed than 2s. 6d. per case above the lowest price for any brand in the agreement. Clause 14. provides that the retail prices ruling at the time of the agreement are not to be increased except aa a result of increased cost of manufacture or distribution. Clause 24 provides for the carrying on of the agreement to any purchaser of tbe busipromised to appoint commissions to ness of any of the contracting companies. There is also an interesting schedule comparing the different prices which shows that they advanced in a couple of years from 25s. to 32s. 6d. I was reading the London DailyM a i l the other day, and I found that there is also a M i l k Trusti n Great Britain. The profiteers overseas, and those in Australia, would appear to be working in conjunction. If there is an increase of prices in Great Britain, it seems to be followed by an increase here. I quote the following from the Daily Mail of the 11th March, 1918: MILK TRUST METHODS. Allegations by Dairy Farmer. A resolution, viewing with considerable alarm matter of fixing tlie price of meat. On the formation of the £4,000,000 milk combine in London, has been passed by the Eastern the same day the Prime Minister came to Counties Dairy Farmers Society.

Last July, it was referred to in this House, and the Prime"" Minister( Mr Hughes) inquire into the exploitation of foodstuffs. The wharf labourers refused to load certain consignments of onions and other .produce into boats leaving this country, because of the enormous prices that were being charged for those products here in Victoria. As a result, the Government decided that, sooner than let the wharf labourers do the price fixing, they would do it for themselves. B ut here, twelve months later, the Government have just decided upon fixing the price of meat. I spoke to the Chief Prices Commissioner at the Commonwealth Officesi n last February, and he told me that he had sent in a recommendation to the Prime Minister, and was awaiting a reply from him on the vernment fixed the price of meat at that I sympathized with them, console them very much.
