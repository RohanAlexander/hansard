Then, if I recall correctly, when John Howard have to say about this so-called he took it to the party room he said, spiralling government debt? He said: 'Sometimes it's better to ask for forgiveness And our debt to GDP ratio, the amount of money than permission.' This is one occasion when we owe to the strength of our economy, is still a he was asking for forgiveness. But I tell you: lot better than most other countries. it is not the member for Goldstein he needs I could rest my case on the words of John to forgive or needs to seek forgiveness from. Howard. I could do that, but there are a He needs to seek forgiveness not just from couple of other important points I want to the 3,000 successful Australian businesses make. One is that those opposite talk about that will be slugged with this tax but from high-taxing governments. What they do not the Australian people, who will face an acknowledge is that the tax-to-GDP ratio increase in the cost of their goods and under this government-that is, the amount services when they go to the grocery store of tax you collect as a proportion of the and in their mortgages. The banks have economy-is considerably lower today than already indicated that they would need to it was when we came into office. It was 23.7 increase mortgage rates to fund this paid per cent when they left office. Today it is parental leave tax. People will pay for it at 21.5 per cent. To put that in context, one the bowser, as the price of petrol goes up percentage point is equivalent to $15 billion when petrol companies are slugged with this a year. That means that, had we been taxing tax. And this will be a tax on miners as well, Australians at the same level as they were as much as the coalition might like to tell being taxed when we came into office, the their friends in the mining sector that they budget would be in surplus today. will be a protected species under them. A question that those opposite might want The point is that, as a government, we to answer at some point is: do they give a have delivered sensible tax reforms that have commitment to keep the tax-to-GDP ratio at delivered tax cuts to an overwhelming the level that it is at? If that is the case, then majority of Australians while, at the same they have got some work to do because of time, we have committed to shoring up the the very few policies they have been tax base.

Wednesday, 26 June 2013 Small Business constituency that once again has been neglected by this Labor Gillard government. The Federation Chamber was delayed in commencing its proceedings because in the main chamber it was the last chance for Labor to actually listen to and respond to the voice of the small business community. The coalition brought forward a motion pleading with this government not to increase the carbon tax that is already causing such harm and economic hardship for so many in the small business community, not to see a further five per cent increase in that carbon tax from 1 July and not to proceed with an increase in carbon tax costs on heavy freight transport from 1 July in 12 months time. There was an opportunity, but instead the government guillotined an important debate about an important measure to stop adding further harm to the economic hardship that the carbon tax is producing. All you need to do is look at the facts. We saw, in the small business Too Big To Ignore campaign, the election priorities that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have outlined. They are calling for the abolition of the carbon tax. They recognise that it is a cost impost on small business, for whom there is no compensation, no carve out and no direct assistance. Small businesses are being told to either pass those costs on or suck them up. Today we have got some new research. The Australian Industry Group has actually had a look at what the business response has been to the imposition of the carbon tax. The Parliamentary Secretary for Small Business yesterday put out a press release saying: 'Don't worry. Small business doesn't pay the carbon price.' What utter nonsense! What an alternate universe this Labor team lives in. This survey says that business picks up the carbon tax bill. The Australian Industry Group surveyed several hundred of its members to find out what the carbon tax has meant to them. What it has meant for more than two-thirds of them is that they have not been able to pass on the costs of the carbon tax. They have had to absorb the impact of the carbon tax. There is interesting research here about the way in which different sized businesses have responded to the imposition of the carbon tax: 68 per cent of small businesses-two-thirds-have not been in a position to reduce their carbon intensity. Instead, they are getting it in the neck with the carbon tax-a carbon tax the government promised small business would not face. If you go further into the research, you ask what is happening there? Small businesses say that it is a lack of funding. There are already viability and margin pressures on small business. This is why they have not been in a position to invest, to negate the harm caused by the impact of the carbon tax. The research goes on to say that close to 70 per cent have not been able to pass on any energy cost rises relating to the carbon tax. One in 20 have been able to pass on a small portion of the carbon tax. This is causing economic harm and injury. We must abolish this carbon tax. It is causing damage to our economy and to small business. (Time expired)",136,Delegation Reports Notices

As part of the process, in my office, she actually wrote a speech on something that she cares very much about. I thought I would. share some of her thoughts with us today. She is one of a number of women in the under-18 women's football team for the South Australian Port Noarlunga Football Club. They entered this year and were involved in a very successful season. There was a lot of team building and, as a new team, they quickly adapted to the game of footy. They did not win any games, but their efforts and sportswomenship were outstanding. They are training very hard and are ready for next season. They have been faced with some difficulties, and that does affect the team. They were unable to play any home games due to the footy club's lights not being powerful enough for the night hours. However, next season they are hoping to have lights that are powerful enough for their home games.",138,Constituency Statements
199,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (09:45,"Miyanggan dhanang? Dhanggu nyuwayi RobThere are some challenges. Sometimes they are driving two to three hours to get to the game, and members often rely on other players, coaches or trainers to give them a lift. There can be some responsibility on the drivers, and one way that Kaitlin believes that this can be overcome is through taking a minibus for players to easily make it to their games and home safely. Another challenge is that they do not have their own change rooms, which does not allow them to shower or use their own toilets after training. And, if any of the girls need strapping or to have injuries looked at, then they have to enter the male change rooms to see a trainer, due to the trainer's room being inside these change rooms. The other issue is that the girls have been training without training tops, so if anyone wants to sponsor the Port Noarlunga Football Club girls, feel free to come along. They would like to get guernseys so that they can represent their club. AFL is not traditionally seen as a women's sport. However, the girls at the Port Noarlunga Football Club have very much enjoyed their experience, and Kaitlin has indicated that they are very much looking forward to next season. I wish the women at the Port Noarlunga Football Club under-18 team the very best of luck for the upcoming season and into the future. I would like to thank Kaitlin for the time she spent in my office. She did a great job. (Time expired) Northern Australia am to speak about the Coalition's 2030 Vision for Developing Northern Australia. This is a clear sign of the coalition's determination to develop the Top End. A coalition government will put in place the policies and plans needed to develop our wonderful Top End's potential with more investment, infrastructure, jobs and services. No longer will the people of Darwin and Palmerston be seen as the last frontier. In fact, to quote the Hon. Tony Abbott, they are 'the next frontier'. This is an exciting development, it is great news for the Top End and I am so excited to be part of the coalition team who are going to make it possible for northern Australia to grow to its full potential. We Territorians know how fabulous our Top End is, but we are so far away from other major cities and business hubs that we could use some extra assistance in getting that message out there to bring business our way. Darwin and Palmerston hold such potential for northern Australia, and it is great that the coalition is prepared to put its trust in us. AndI know the people in Darwin and Palmerston often become frustrated with the lack of infrastructure and access to services because of our comparatively small population and remoteness. The coalition have listened to us and they are here to support our growing population and they are here to break the development deadlock that has held northern Australia back for so long. For far too long, many families have been reluctant to move to the Top End because of the lack of infrastructure and access to services. Governments and the private sector have often been reluctant to invest in major infrastructure because of our insufficient population. That is why I am so grateful for the coalition's support for my electorate. We have to capitalise on the Top End's existing strengths and natural advantages in agriculture, cattle, energy and tourism. We are proud to be Australia's gateway to Asia and at the forefront of Australia's defence plans and the protection of our borders. When you build a stronger economy, it means more jobs, higher incomes and better infrastructure and services for all Territorians. I am just",139,Constituency Statements

Tasmanian Forests Agreement Forestry) (09:54): I stand here today to discuss an issue that has been dividing Tasmanians for 30 years-namely forestry. On Monday, the World Heritage Committee approved the extension of World Heritage boundaries that formed a key component of the Tasmanian forests agreement that passed the Tasmanian parliament earlier in the year after three years of negotiations by industry, mainstream environmental groups and the CFMEU. This was a pretty tough exercise, punctuated by walkouts, returns to the table, constant political commentary and the old politics of the Liberal and Green parties trying to tear it down. Tasmania is finally making progress and, with this historic agreement, is looking like it can put forestry as an issue behind us. But not everyone is happy. Some people need division and conflict. The federal and Tasmanian Liberals have constantly denied that any real problem exists. The facts are that, despite the Liberal Tasmanian Community Forest Agreement in 2006 to 2009, the number of forestry jobs halved, contractors went broke, timber mills closed and the biggest player in the industry, Gunns, went into liquidation, all without a single tree being reserved. A responsible government acts when an industry faces what the Tasmanian industry has faced. People were going under and whole communities needed help. That is why the federal Labor government acted to support the forest negotiations with funding for economic diversification, compensation and contractor exit assistance. As a result we have an agreement in place. We have also protected jobs in Smithton and in the Huon by supporting Ta Ann, a vital cog in the forest industry. Ironically, on Monday we saw Greens leader Christine Milne welcome the World Heritage listing, even though she described the Tasmanian Forest Agreement as 'dead' after it passed the Tasmanian parliament. A so-called 'dead' agreement has delivered, and now it is up to the Greens and the extremies on the fringe to back it in. The people of Tasmania expect nothing else. The people of Tasmania want to see this sort of divisive politics as a historical anecdote. The people of Tasmania also do not want to see the Greens and extremies move on in an attempt to destroy a balanced mining industry in the Tarkine. Most recently, in my region, there have been a number of rallies from the community seeking a balance between responsible economic development in our region and responsible protection of those areas that appropriately deem it necessary. We can have a balance. We do not need the conflict. The Greens and the Liberals-state and federal-need to get on board and support this agreement.

And what do we have now? The Treasurer has done a media conference and said that he is going to fix the issues in regional and rural Australia when it comes to farm debt, that he is going to put in place a farm finance package. He did the media on it and set up the glossy brochures on the website saying how this problem will be fixed. These glossy brochures say that the Australian government is committing up to $30 million each year for the next two years to each state and to the Northern Territory to provide concessional loans to farmers in need-concessional loans to give farmers the breathing space to focus on growing and improving their farm businesses. The Australian government will work with state and Northern Territory governments to make these loan products available across the country via appropriate delivery agencies. There are glossy brochures up on the website, but what has been done? Nothing. We were promised that this package would be ready to be rolled out on 1 July, yet it is not ready to be rolled out. I am passionate about this because there are farmers in real need of this money. They are banking on this money. The government has led them down a path to say that this money will be available to them, and yet on 1 July they are going to see nothing, because this Treasurer is incompetent-absolutely incompetent. He has promised that he would deliver this for these farmers across this country, yet he has not sat down with the state and territory governments; he has not delivered this package. He has given false hope to these farmers and done nothing about it. Get off your backside, Treasurer, and negotiate with the states and the Northern Territory and get this Farm Finance package rolled out. Vietnam: Human Rights Minister for the Public Service and Integrity and Special Minister of State) (10:00): I rise today to raise human rights issues in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Australia has worked with Vietnam over the past 30 years to assist in the development of its economy, governance, education, trade, infrastructure and to counter transnational crime. Against this backdrop Australia has continued to hold and convey at the most senior levels its serious concern at the human rights situation in Vietnam. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has directly raised human rights issues and individual cases of concern with his counterpart. Our embassy and Consulate-General are also active on human rights issues by raising individual cases, attending trials of human rights activists and regularly meeting peaceful human rights activists and religious groups. Australia and Vietnam also hold a regular bilateral human rights dialogue with the 10th round held in Canberra only last week. TodayI would like to add my voice as a local member on behalf of my constituents to one particular case, Roman Catholic priest, Father Nguyen Van Ly. Father Nguyen Van Ly has long campaigned for the human rights of the Vietnamese people and suffered several strokes while serving an eight-year prison sentence before being granted temporary medical parole. Now he has been incarcerated again, despite his critical medical conditions. Father Ly, now aged 66 and in a very frail state of health, has spent his adult life peacefully campaigning for religious freedom, democracy and human rights.

The Australian government will continue to do what it can to pursue the case of Father Ly and others and the general severity of sentencing for the democracy activists as well as reiterate our long-held opposition to the death penalty. Australia will also continue to deliver a human rights technical cooperation program, in operation since 2006, which provides funding for practical activities to promote human rights on the ground and improve the lives of the Vietnamese people. I thank my local constituents who continue to advocate for the release of peaceful human rights and democracy campaigners in Vietnam and around the world. Bond University: Student Assistance University and the ineligibility of Bond University students to access OS-HELP. Bond University is based in my electorate of McPherson and has over 4,000 students enrolled and 35 per cent of these students are international students. The university has enrolments from students from over 70 countries and over one-third of Bond's international students are from Asia. Bond University has over 65 exchange partners in over 20 countries, and these relationships facilitate the exchange of students between the university and other universities in the US, Europe and increasingly in Asia. The university and its students recognise the importance of Australia in the Asian Century and the benefits of education driving our connection with Asia. However, despite the university's 65 exchange partners, less than five per cent of Bond's students utilise the opportunity to study abroad with insufficient financial support being cited as a reason for not embracing such an exciting opportunity. Bond University, in its submission to the House Standing Committee on Employment and Education's inquiry into the Higher Education Support Amendment (Asian Century) Bill 2013, put the issue quite succinctly. It said: As a not-for-profit, private university Bond delivers high-quality graduates into the Australian workforce who have not received any benefit from the Commonwealth Grants Scheme tuition subsidy. Under the current and proposed HESA arrangements, they will also be excluded from the same incentive and support for Asian studies that is available to their public university counterparts through the important OS-HELP scheme. I note that the House standing committee recommended as a result of its inquiry that the Commonwealth government consider extending the eligibility for OS-HELP assistance to non-CSP students. Bond University, Bond University Student Association and Bond University Exchange Club have all sought an extension of OS-HELP for some time. Bond University Exchange Club started a petition seeking an extension of OS-HELP and in a very short space of time collected over 250 signatures. That petition has been presented directly to the Standing Committee on Petitions, and I look forward to a favourable response from the minister. I seek leave to table a copy of the petition. Leave granted.",142,Constituency Statements

(Time expired) Chisholm Electorate: Representation Live Animal Exports Ms BURKE (Chisholm-Speaker) (10:06): It is a rarity for a Speaker to be on their feet, but the one thing you do not give up on becoming Speaker is being the member for your electorate. I am incredibly proud to be the federal member for Chisholm, which I have been over the last 15 years. SoI was rather surprised when a senator in the other place took a shot at the independence of the Speaker and took a shot at my ability to still continue to represent my area. I grew up in my area. I lived in my area. I went to school in my area. I went to university in my area. I live in the area with my family, as does all my extended family. You can walk from my house to my mother's, to my two sisters' and to my brother's. Actually, one of my largest voting blocs in Chisholm is the extended Burke clan! I am fairly confident that they all vote for me-at least, they all hand out for me quite vigorously. I am very intimately connected to my seat. I am incredibly proud of my seat. I do not think we sing the praises of suburbia enough. That is where the majority of people live. People in my eastern suburbs put up with congestion. They put up with traffic. They put up with noise. They put up now with the loss of open space. I have been championing these causes for them for the last 15 years. So to give any impression that I am not out there working on behalf of them because I became Speaker is an insult to my constituency. I have been to 101 events. I cannot even name them all. I have been at my mobile offices around the electorate, where people raise with me everything under the sun: Telstra bills, postal boxes, gold passes for an engineer who served his time but in two different states-he just wants his gold pass; could someone give it to him-planning issues, trees being inappropriately planted, and kerb sides at the appropriate level for scooters to go up. I have an ageing electorate; it is a very big issue for disability access and people going around on scooters. All these things are raised with me. But the No. 1 issue we have all had through our emails, phones and faxes is live animal exports. When I say that the No. 1 issue that comes from my electorate is live animal exports, it does not demean in any way, shape or form all the issues of concern to my local constituents or their individual problems. But the No. 1 issue people have raised with me over this term is live animal exports, and I support them. I support their call for banning live animal exports, for bringing in a chilled meat industry which will create more jobs. It will actually create more jobs; it would not lose more jobs. It will sustain the industry going forward, and it will support Indonesia in becoming a sustainable producer of its own food processing.",143,Constituency Statements
205,Mrs Andrews,"Thank you. In conclusion, I am encouraged that the advisory reportI do not resile from that, but I do not think that demeans me talking on behalf of my constituents. I think it recognises that I am in touch with them. I know that they are concerned about gambling. I know that they are concerned about same-sex marriage. I know that they are concerned about climate change. AndI am going to advocate for them in the upcoming election. (Time expired) Calare Electorate my involvement in politics and my hope for the future of our region. The Calare electorate has changed dramatically over the years and today covers an area of over 30,000 square kilometres from Lithgow in the east to Tullamore in the west. Calare is arguably the engine room of New South Wales, being rich in agriculture, mining and forestry. Without a doubt, it is one of the better places to live in our country. I came to this parliament in 2001 as a person without higher education or tertiary degrees, but I did bring to it experience in life and in representing country people and, perhaps more importantly, in surviving and even prospering as a small business man, a farmer. Most of my professional career and family life has been centred in the central west. Lisa and I live in Molong and I have a sister, daughters and grandchildren around Orange and the central west, so I have a vested interest in ensuring that our region of Calare gets a fair go. In my time as a federal member I have travelled pretty widely, particularly in the central west and in the nooks and crannies of Calare, listening to people from all walks of life and assisting them with federal issues. Never have I seen so much despondency with federal politics than recently. I, the National Party and the coalition plan to change all that. What we need in our rural communities more than ever is hope and optimism-optimism to go about everyday life without the constant threat that government is lurking around the corner waiting to whack you for daring to try to get ahead. It is up to the coalition-and we will start the process-to turn country Australia into the powerhouse it has been, that it must be, that it will be and that it should be. I believe the electorate of Calare offers the greatest example of what country Australia has been in the past and will be again. We have to resuscitate our country, ensuring a prosperous future for all and, therefore, a prosperous future for Australians. the time for members' constituency statements has concluded. Baird, Corporal Cameron Stewart, MG Debate resumed on the motion: That the House express its deep regret at the death on 22 June 2013, of Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird MG while on combat operations in Afghanistan and place on record its appreciation of his service to his country and tender its profound sympathy to his family and friends in their bereavement. Cameron Baird MG, who was tragically killed aged just 32 while serving with the Special Operations Task Group in Afghanistan.

208,Mr Craig Kelly (Hughes) (10:12,"I rise to honour our fallen commando: Corporaltour of Afghanistan and had previously served in Iraq and Timor-Leste. Corporal Baird becomes the 40th Australian soldier killed in war in Afghanistan. Corporal Baird was a member of the Special Operations Task Group and was from the 2nd Commando Regiment based at Holsworthy barracks in Sydney, New South Wales. Holsworthy barracks is, of course, in the electorate of Hughes, which I represent in this parliament. Our elite soldiers from Holsworthy have paid a very heavy price. With Corporal Baird becoming the 20th member of the Special Operations Task Group to fall in combat in Afghanistan, this tragedy is heart breaking for our local community. One thing that is often overlooked is that we have many people in the local community of Hughes based around Holsworthy serving in Afghanistan. We have many children of serving soldiers going to our local schools. When the news comes through that there has been a death of one of our soldiers it hurts greatly across the entire community, especially in those schools. The uncertainty for those kids is something that we wish upon no child in our schools. The loss of any one of our soldiers is always felt hard, but this tragedy also comes in the same week as his unit, the 2nd Commando Regiment, received the highest and rarest honour-receiving the first battle honour award since Vietnam. The Governor General, Her Excellency the Hon. Quentin Bryce, presented the Eastern Shah Wali Kot battle honour to the 2nd Commando Regiment at Tobruk Lines, Holsworthy on Wednesday, 19 June this year, just three days before the tragic events we are now discussing took place. The mates of Corporal Cameron Baird MG describe him as one of the most iconic figures in the regiment. General Hurley said of Corporal Baird: In combat, and as a Team Commander, he was the man to watch and never happier than when the situation demanded decisive action and courage. The ADF stated that 32-year-old Corporal Baird: … died how he lived-at the front, giving it his all, without any indecision. Corporal Baird had been awarded the following honours and awards: Medal for Gallantry; Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp East Timor, Clasp Iraq 2003, Clasp International Coalition Against Terrorism; Afghanistan Campaign Medal; Iraq Campaign Medal; Australian Service Medal with Clasp-Counter Terrorism/Special Recovery; Australian Defence Medal; United Nations Medal with Ribbon United Nations Transitional Authority in East Timor; NATO non-article 5 Medal with Clasp ISAF and Multiple Tour Indicator; Infantry Combat Badge; and Returned from Active Service Badge. We have lost one of our best, and today this parliament grieves with his family and friends. But his sacrifice was not in vain. Over the last decade our forces in Afghanistan have made many great achievements. Perhaps the greatest achievement is the education of Afghani girls. Before 2001, there were virtually no girls in Afghanistan receiving an education. Today, according to officials from the Afghan education ministry, there are almost 3,200,000 girls receiving an education. We realise that the dangers and the threats are still there-earlier this month we read how 100 girls going to school were taken to hospital when a Taliban Islamic radical attacked the school with poison gas. These are the conditions these girls face when they go to school. Winston Churchill said: We sleep safely at night because rough men stand ready to visit violence on those who would harm us. Today, 3.2 million girls in Afghanistan are receiving an education, learning to read and write and to become productive members of their society because men such as Corporal Cameron Baird stood ready. Lest we forget. Leader of the Opposition and others in expressing my condolences to the family of Corporal Cameron Steward Baird, who was killed while serving in Afghanistan as an ADF soldier. I understand that it was Corporal Baird's fifth tour of duty in Afghanistan, and, whilst I did not know Corporal Baird personally, I know many of his colleagues and I often think it could easily have been one of them who did not return from Afghanistan. For Corporal Baird's family and his partner their loss will have the most profound effect. The bond between family members and loved ones is unique. His loss will stay with each of them for the rest of their lives, and their memory of him will always be with them. Corporal Baird's comrades will equally have a heavy heart as they relive the incident in which Corporal Baird was killed, their service time together, their friendship and what the future might have been had he not been killed. Knowing that this was the life that he chose, with the full knowledge of the risks he faced, may ease the pain of those who grieve his death. But the pain will still be there. I also extend my best wishes for a full recovery of the special forces soldier and the Royal Australian Air Force airman also injured in the incident. Corporal Baird's death brings to 40 the number of Australians killed whilst on duty in Afghanistan. Hopefully it will be the last. Australia has paid a heavy toll in deaths and injuries for our involvement in Afghanistan. The burden is carried every day by the family and loved ones of those ADF personnel who have been killed or injured. Earlier this year I attended an ANZAC Day service at Golden Grove Primary School in my electorate. My electorate is home to many ADF families, with RAAF Base Edinburgh being in the region, so at the service special recognition was given to the children of serving ADF personnel, many of whom were either on duty in Afghanistan or on regular tours of duty. As those children stepped forward to be recognised, sometimes with one of their parents, my thoughts turned to how difficult it must be for those children, living with the knowledge of the dangers faced each day by one or both of their parents. Similarly, how difficult it must be for those children each time they say goodbye to their mum or dad who is leaving for service overseas. I imagine the same heart-wrenching thoughts must go through the minds of the ADF parents whenever they leave home for a tour of duty, knowing that they may never see their children and loved ones again. I can only imagine the feeling of relief for family members and loved ones each time ADF members safely return home. This SaturdayI will be attending a welcome home parade for the 7RAR Task Group, in acknowledgement of the operational service of personnel who have recently returned from operations in the Middle East. I understand that 466 personnel, including 433 members based out of Adelaide, will be welcomed home. All are associated with Operation Slipper, Australia's military contribution to the international campaign against terrorism, and maritime security in the Middle East area of operations and countering piracy in the Gulf of Aden. The personnel being welcomed home contributed to the International Security Assistance Force led multinational effort in Uruzgan, Afghanistan. The withdrawal of most ADF personnel from Afghanistan by the end of this year will be welcomed by so many people I speak with and perhaps by none more than the ADF families",145,Condolences
209,Mr Zappia (Makin) (10:17,"I join with the Prime Minister, the defence minister, thedirectly involved. Historians will be left to judge whether our involvement in Afghanistan was justified and whether our mission there was accomplished. Whilst political leaders make decisions about wars and military interventions, and historians write in judgement, our ADF personnel carry out the deeds of war. They do so without flinching, without question, but with absolute professionalism and loyalty to the uniform they wear and the country they serve. And they forever carry the scars of war with them, a burden that only those who serve could ever understand. It is because of their service that the rest of us can get on with our lives. For all they do, to those who have served and to those who continue to serve, I say thank you. To Corporal Cameron Baird and to all those who have lost their lives, I say thank you. You have given all you had for the rest of us in Australia and it is appreciated by those of us who understand. condolences, on behalf of the Ryan electorate, to the family and friends of Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird MG and to pay tribute to his exceptional and heroic life. I must confess that, on hearing the tragic news last Saturday that there had been an incident in Afghanistan that had injured and killed Australian soldiers, my first reaction was one of immense sadness combined with an almost guilty relief, knowing that my own son had returned from his deployment to Afghanistan several weeks ago. Not for a moment am I suggesting that my son's role was anything like the work being carried out by Corporal Baird and his team. However, last year when I was privileged to spend time in Afghanistan on the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program, as has my colleague the member for Longman, one thing I did find was that, if you are 'in country', incidents can occur at any time and anywhere, no matter your role. My next reaction was to think of all the families and friends of service men and women still on duty in Afghanistan and how, every time the telephone rang for the next 24 hours, they would hope it was not bad news about their loved one. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are aware, while the ADF Parliamentary Program facilitates members of parliament spending time with our service men and women in their environment, there is also the reverse program. Last week Lieutenant Colonel Todd Vail joined my Canberra office. Lieutenant Colonel Vail is himself a former commando, who has undertaken many overseas deployments including to Afghanistan. So when we heard of the death of Corporal Baird, I asked Todd for his thoughts, to try to understand, even in a small way, how it feels to lose a comrade. This is what he said: The first notification usually strikes you to the core-I was at home at the time and found out through friends who had heard it on the news-everyone who you meet or talk to will ask questions about who it was and the circumstances in which it occurred, expecting you as a member of the Defence Force to have all the answers. However, you know no details due to the blanket media ban, which is not lifted until the next-of-kin have been notified and approved the release of the name. During this time you speculate along with everyone else. Being a member of the ADF you do wonder if you knew himparticularly as the media said he was in a ""leadership"" role. The news brings a sense of reality which hits home-you realise that the profession you have chosen can be deadly-you think of his family and what they must be going through-it makes you think of your own family and you put yourself in their shoes and wonder how they would cope. You also think of the injured and hope their injuries will not leave them maimed with little quality of life.",147,Condolences

In the end you reconcile your feelings by knowing he died doing what he loved, surrounded by his mates. Today is business as usual-we have a job to do and he would expect us to get on and do it. On Friday we will pause, as a group, and remember him at a memorial service where his name will be added to a memorial wall along with 39 others who have also paid the supreme sacrifice carrying out their nation's work in trying to bring peace and stability to the people of Afghanistan. Corporal Baird's commitment to his chosen career as a soldier and to our mission in Afghanistan was unwavering, as was his loyalty to his mates and his love for his own family and the Army family. Soldiers like Corporal Baird are making a difference in Afghanistan and we must not let his sacrifice, and those of his fellow 39 soldiers, be in vain. On behalf of the Ryan electorate, I offer my sincere condolences to Corporal Baird's family, friends, colleagues and loved ones. Lest we forget. condolence motion on the death of Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird MG, a former commando and a young man who gave great service to our country. He died during special ops activities in Afghanistan. We have heard some great words from the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister for Defence and other members of parliament. I am speaking on behalf of the people of the Moreton electorate, who would all wish to pass on to Corporal Baird's family our thanks, condolences, prayers and thoughts. Obviously, the first thing that strikes me about Corporal Baird, as someone born in 1981, is how young he was. With a name like Cameron Stewart Baird, he joins that long, proud tradition of people of Scottish descent. But I also note that he came from Tasmania, a state that makes up less than one per cent of the population but that currently provides nine per cent of our defence forces-a state that has always punched above its weight. Corporal Baird was one of its finest sons. To have roll off the tongue talk about the fifth tour of duty in Afghanistan can only hint at the service that this man has given our country, the people of Afghanistan and freedom-loving people everywhere-particularly, as noted by some of the earlier speakers, women in Afghanistan, who have benefited from the establishment of a rule of law and security to combat some of the extremism visited upon the nation by the Taliban. This was his fifth tour of duty in Afghanistan, but I note that Corporal Baird had also done tours of duty in Iraq and Timor-Leste. I take some comfort from the fact that a few days before his death Corporal Baird would have shared in the pride of the award of the unit's Battle Honour, which was handed over on 19 June by the Governor General, Quentin Bryce. I am at least sure that he would have had a few days during which its members would have been proud to be the only unit since Vietnam to have received such an honour from a Governor General. I also note another soldier and an airman were injured in the exchange. I know that they would be feeling nothing but grief at the death of their comrade, Corporal Baird, and I wish them well in their recovery.",148,Condolences
211,Mr Perrett (Moreton,"Government Whip) (10:28): I also rise to speak on thisAfghanistan, like any overseas engagement, is special work serving the nation. The nation has called on our ADF personnel to do great work and they are doing it. Obviously, when Australia calls on our ADF personnel to go overseas the people who suffer are the families. I particularly acknowledge Corporal Baird's family and friends and I wish them well in the years ahead as they look back on the great sacrifice that Corporal Baird has made for, and the great service he has given to, this nation. In our jobs as parliamentarians we have the smallest of insights-up at the pointy end of the plane-into what a FIFO lifestyle does for families, but I have never understood how our ADF personnel are able to do the job they do and still maintain loving families. There is sacrifice all around for our ADF personnel. Sadly, parliament has stood 40 times to acknowledge the death of our ADF personnel in Afghanistan, 30 of those occasions being in this 43rd Parliament under Prime Minister Gillard. Here we are commencing her fourth year as Prime Minister and we have done this 30 times. I am lucky to have married a North Queenslander, and my in-laws live just down the road from Yungaburra. The Prime Minister was there on Saturday opening the Avenue of Honour, the 39 trees acknowledging the ADF personnel who have passed away in Afghanistan. Sadly, there will be another tree planted to acknowledge Corporal Cameron Stewart Baird. I look forward, in a horrible way, to making my way up to Yungaburra and seeing the trees. I will make my pilgrimage to acknowledge Corporal Baird and thank him for his service to the country. members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places.

I ask them whether they have rules at their school and tell them that this is the place-it does not matter whether you call them pieces of legislation, statutes or bills-where the rules for Australia are made.

214,Mr Ruddock (Berowra) (10:34,"Given the matters that we have just been discussing itthey had that first opportunity in 1994 I saw the queues. I visited Annangrove Public School the other day and asked the children whether their parents would stand in a queue all the way from Annangrove Road up to Old Northern Road and down to Rouse Hill. They look at me with surprise and said that they did not think their parents would wait in a queue all day. Nevertheless, it seems to me a place that is fundamental to our democracy ought to be an appropriate place. More than 25 years ago I sat in the old chamber. I think it was recorded in the debate the other day that I am one of four who remain here who were familiar with the Old Parliament House. I always like to give Malcolm Fraser a bit of a clip. Malcolm Fraser never wanted the new Parliament House. One of the most fascinating party room discussions-there may be more fascinating party room discussions in this place today!-a long time ago was when Malcolm Fraser brought the parliamentary coalition together down in Old Parliament House to tell us of his plans for developing on the Senate and House of Representatives lawns two additional sets of offices on either side to accommodate the needs of members of parliament. It was a relatively short meeting because he got short shrift from the parliamentary party, which told him, even though he showed us some rather exotic plans, that they were not suitable. I think only two people spoke, and I was one of them. He then decided he was not on the winning side. A competition was held. It was very interesting. A great deal of interest was taken in the fact that the principal architect, Giurgola, could not be here the other day. He is now an Australian citizen. At the time he belonged to an American architecture firm that tendered. I think he was Italian. They added a man by the name of the Thorp to the list of partners so that they would have an Australian connection. I do not care who came up with the design, quite frankly. I do not care whether it was an Australian or not. I think the design of this building is particularly unique. I reminded the school children when they visit that this building on Capital Hill-and there was the argument about whether it should be on Capital Hill or down on the lake-was built with the hill removed so that the lawns could be grown over the top of the building and the people would be on top of the legislators. When you look at the plans-and I am sure they are somewhere; David Elder will be able to tell me who has them-of the other participants in the competition, some of them were like the buildings in Malaysia. They envisaged multistorey towers on Capital Hill. There was only one, in my view, that reflected something of the design of the Old Parliament House with two chambers on either side and the major facilities that we will all share in the middle. Down there it was King's Hall and up here it is the Great Hall and the Members' Hall. But, if you actually look at the old design that served us from 1927, I think it was, it was suitable for the purposes and for the time. The design was appropriate and has been reflected in the design of this parliament. But, if you ask me whether I would rather sit in the old house or this house, there is no question-I would rather sit in this house. I will say a few things about the old place, because it puts things into perspective. There was a lot more camaraderie than is enjoyed here-because you were in closer proximity. There is perhaps a gender issue in this, but there was one place where people frequently saw each other-because there were no loos in the rooms-and that was the loo between the cabinet room and the back of the chamber, adjacent to the Speaker's office. People frequently saw each other at the urinal. The nature of the conversations which took place there was surprising. I do not think there would ever be a conversation like that up here. My colleague in the chamber here was just bending his elbow-I am not sure why, but perhaps what he was referring to was that the Old Parliament House had a members bar. It did. I do not often disclose the fact that I am teetotal, but I can remember when Jim Killen saw me in there on one occasion. He asked, 'What is parliament's most famous Rechabite doing in here?' The bar was a very important place. The non-members bar was equally important. Here they constructed bars, but-if you are new and you do not know-they have been boarded up. They are now the bakery and the florist's room, I think. The bars are behind the boards on either side-the Senate bar and the House of Representatives bar were closed. There was a non-members bar. What is it now? It is now the childcare centre. The way Parliament House works has changed. We have offices which are sufficiently commodious for people to work in. They are larger than members need for their staff, because they usually only have one staffer with them. Members' rooms are amazing. They have a waiting room, with a place for a staff member, and then three other desks for staff members. I think the accommodation for members is generous. In comparison to what existed in the old chamber, the accommodation is appropriate-but not necessary. In my judgement, the accommodation in this place which is woefully inadequate is the accommodation for ministers. I make that point very strongly. It is occasionally commented that members are seen to be dozing in the chambers. I think someone even took a photograph of a member who may have put his head back momentarily. In Old Parliament House, nobody had a couch in their room to which they could go and quietly rest. The parliament would often sit until the early hours of the morning. I think the parliamentary catering staff have forgotten how to put on sausages for breakfast after the House has gone through until six or seven o'clock in the morning. That would test them up here. But, in the old chamber, if people needed to take a quiet moment, the only place they could go was, I think, the Parliamentary Library. I can remember seeing Billy Wentworth in there quite frequently. I make these observations not in jest but because I believe this parliament building is appropriate for the democracy we all enjoy. I think it is important from that point of view. It enables people to do their job far more effectively than they were able to in the old chambers. There are other factors. Ministers now work from this place rather than offices elsewhere in Canberra; that has been a significant change. For my own part, I was glad to be able to sit on the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House for a time. I sat, interestingly enough, with the fathers of two present members of the House of Representatives, Harry Jenkins and Robert McClelland. Doug McClelland, who was President of the Senate, was a joint chairman, as was Dr Harry Jenkins Senior as Speaker of the House of Representatives. Tom Uren was a member. Labor may not want to remember Mal Colston and Georgie Georges, who was the only person I can remember who crossed the floor and never got held to account for it. I do not know what they do these days. There was Kathy Martin-later Kathy Sullivan-who was a senator at that time. Margaret Reid, latterly President, was a member, as was Kerry Sibraa, another President of the Senate. Other members besides me were the late Don Dobie; Ros Kelly; Bruce Lloyd, a National Party member from Victoria; Helen Mayer; and Leo McLeay, who also became Speaker. We took an interest in the future of this building. We saw it as being important and were committed to it. I can say from personal experience that it is appropriate that the parliament be accommodated in the way in which it is. I think the building is suitable for the purpose, and I think it is appropriate on its 25th anniversary that we commend those who brought it to fruition. Dr LEIGH (Fraser-Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (10:46): Burley Griffin's original plan for Capital Hill provided for a 'capitol' on the current location of Parliament House, with residences for the Governor General on one side and the Prime Minister on the other. Parliament House was to be on a lower level, at the head of the government triangle on a site known as Camp Hill, in direct line with the axis running from the capitol to the summit of Mount Ainslie. The capitol building, atop the inner city's highest hill, Kurrajong-now Capital Hill-was to have been a ceremonial building, a pantheon that would commemorate the achievements of the Australian people. Instead of what Burley Griffin called 'the inevitable dome', the building would be capped by a stepped pinnacle or ziggurat. For Walter Burley Griffin, this form expressed 'the last word of all the longest lived civilisations'. However, it was not to be. In 1954, the Senate appointed a select committee to inquire into and report on the development of Canberra. The report recommended: … the permanent Parliament House should not be constructed on Camp Hill where Griffin intended, but on Capital Hill on the site allotted to the ""Capitol"" … It noted that Griffin himself had considered such an alternative. I have to confess that I am still quite partial to Burley Griffin's original design-to the notion that the highest place, the capitol, should be taken by a building that acknowledged the greatest of Australians. Mr Perrett: With a ziggurat. Dr LEIGH: With a ziggurat. But some eggs cannot be unscrambled, and here we are today. In April 1979, the NCDC announced an architectural competition for the design of what was then known as New Parliament House. The National Capital Development Commission consulted with the Royal Australian Institute of Architects, and the Parliament House Construction Authority issued a brief and competition documents. Key aspects of the brief included that Parliament House must be more than a functional building and should be a major national symbol in the spirit of Westminster or Washington's Capitol dome. It was important that the building reflect the significance of the national parliament, the executive government and the nation's political and social context. The extent to which the building asserted that significance was to be related to questions of its scale and monumentality. The building and the site treatment were to respond to qualities of the environment that were uniquely Australian-the Australian climate, landscape, vegetation and quality of light. The philosophy and its popular success, the brief said, would depend in part on the extent to which public access and involvement was encouraged by the design. Parliament House was not to appear remote or inaccessible. Access to the site and to the building was to be facilitated, and within the building connotations of a people's parliament and open government were best to be established if people could penetrate the building and observe its operation. Parliament has succeeded to the extent that one can walk over the top of the parliamentarians-a great design feature, I believe-though its structure is somewhat different from, say, the US Capitol where voters can walk to the offices of their elected representatives, going to see them directly without the security screening we have here. On 26 June 1980, New York-based architectural company Mitchell, Giurgola& Thorp was announced as the winner of stage 2 of the Parliament House design competition. Interestingly, Romaldo Giurgola had initially been asked by Sir John Overall, the then head of the National Capital Development Commission, to be an assessor for the design competition for the new Parliament House. Giurgola wrote back stating: I am honoured by such an offer, but I would rather enter the competition. Aren't we lucky that he did? The winning architectural team, Romaldo Giurgola, Richard Thorp, Harold Guida, Rollin La France, Pamille Berg, Tim Halden-Brown, Peter Rolland, Peter Britz and Mervyn Dorrough, was responsible for the design, conception, siting and architecture as well as the interior design, furniture design, landscape and coordination of the art and craft program for Parliament House. Construction began in 1981 and the building was opened on 22 August 1988. Romaldo Giurgola moved to Canberra to implement his design and lives here to this day. He brought a team of eight people from his New York office, and three others, as well as Romaldo Giurgola, stayed in Australia after the project's completion. It is a great contrast from the way in which the Sydney Opera House construction eventuated. It does make you think, if only Jorn Utzon had had Romaldo Giurgola's patience and his negotiating skills, how much more glorious the interiors of the Sydney Opera House would be today. The assessors' report on the winning scheme noted its unpretentiousness and accessibility where, 'children will not only be able to climb on the building, but draw it easily too'. Speaking of children, I was pretty much a child when I first came here in 1988 to do work experience for the then member for Fraser, John Langmore. It was something of a coincidence to have done work experience for the member for Fraser given that at the time. I was living in the electorate of the Father of the House, the member for Berowra. My father, who was a university academic, knew John Langmore and so it was with John that I spent two weeks in this building. I have never before, or since, gotten lost so many times inside a building. The key to this building, I believe, is to like the art. I did not like art in 1988, but I do today. A think art lovers have a far easier time navigating Parliament House than those who glide by ignoring the beautiful works on the walls. To the successful architect, a matter of crucial importance was the relationship of the structure to individual Australians and whether people would feel comfortable approaching and entering the building. For the winning designers this was basic to their plan. As Romaldo Giurgola once said: We felt if Australia’s new Parliament House was to speak honestly about its purpose, it could not be built on top of the hill as this would symbolise government imposed upon the people. And: The magic relationship between geometry and land configurations of that plan, after that, often became the object that country often became the object of my architectural dreams. The brief for the design of the parliament compiled by the NCDC was possibly the best I had ever encountered in my professional career. Another great tribute to the extraordinary public servants who helped build Canberra. Giurgola spoke of how he came to understand Australia by saying: I plunged into Australian literature rather than into guides and travelogues. Patrick White, Miles Franklin, Henry Lawson and Les Murray became my real instructors, while the sonorous voice and accent of Richard Thorp, the Australian in our office, produced the right atmosphere. I think it speaks well of Australia that we are in a city designed by a Chicagoan and in a building designed by a New Yorker, because Australia at its best engages with the rest of the world, taking the best ideas not just from within our continent, but around the globe. So it is with this extraordinary building-Parliament House. I wish it a happy 25th birthday and hope it will stand for longer than the 200 years for which it was originally built. Sydney Opera House, the Sydney Harbour Bridge, the War Memorial and, of course, Gold Coast's Q1. They are just some of the iconic buildings and structures that come to mind. But perhaps the most iconic building that has come to represent our nation as a whole is the building in which we stand today, the new Parliament House. Although the Commonwealth parliament has sat since 1901, it was not until 1988 that the parliament was able to sit in this location. The opening of the first parliament in 1901 was in the Exhibition Building in Melbourne but from Federation up until 1927 the Commonwealth parliament sat in the Victorian Parliament House, while the state parliament sat in the Exhibition Building until the construction of a provisional parliament house. When that building, now known as Old Parliament House, was opened by the then Duke of York, later King George VI, no-one would have expected that it would house the parliament for 61 years. As time progressed, Old Parliament House became cramped and could not cater for the 3,000 or so people working in it rather than the 300 it was planned for. In 1975 the parliament appointed the Joint Standing Committee on the New and Permanent Parliament House to facilitate the construction of a new parliament building. The parliament approved construction on 28 August 1980 and the committee recommended that the new parliament house be opened by Australia's centenary of European settlement. So, ready on time, Her Majesty the Queen opened the new Parliament House on 9 May 1988, 61 years since her father had opened Old Parliament House, and the first sitting of the Commonwealth parliament in the new building took place on 22 August 1988. Parliament House now occupies a floor area of 250,000 square metres with 4,500 rooms, and over 5,000 people work here during a parliamentary sitting, plus all the visitors that come throughout the year. Ninety per cent of the building is made of Australian materials and each part of the building's design has a meaning behind it. For instance, as many would know, the colours of the House of Representatives and the Senate reflect the respective colours of the House of Commons and the House of Lords in the United Kingdom; however the shade of green in the House of Representatives reflects the colours of eucalyptus and acacia trees while the red hue of the Senate reminds us of the rich soils and the redgums. One of the great things about Parliament House is that much of it is open to the public, with Australians and other international visitors being able to come here and see the parliamentary system in action. I think there is many a schoolchild who remembers their trip to Parliament House and to Canberra, and I look forward to seeing many more come into this place and learn about our system of government, our democracy and what their part is in it. I, like many of my colleagues, speak to many community groups and I have spoken with quite a lot during the last couple of years. We are often asked to speak and we are usually",150,Motions
215,Mrs Andrews (Mcpherson) (10:55,"Australia has several iconic buildings. It has theasked about anything other than politics. One of the things that I take the opportunity to speak about is this magnificent building, and I speak about it because I guess, as an engineer, I look at this building through engineering and construction eyes. But for the people that I speak to, they get to hear about a building that is so iconic, that is so important to this nation, and I try and remember as many statistics and as many different things as I possibly can about this building. Often people come up to me after I have spoken about this building and congratulate me on giving such an interesting speech-and it will have been interesting because this building is interesting. It is fascinating. I talk to them about what it was like when I first walked into this building as a newly elected member of the House of Representatives-how there is so much whiteness, so much glass-and it is probably a little bit like the starship Enterprise, to be perfectly honest, where because of the nature of this parliament, when we come in we are here for the entire day and there is so much whiteness and there is so much glass here as well. I talk to them about standing on the ground floor of parliament directly under where the flag is, looking upwards and seeing the size of the flag from up so close, and how you are surrounded by so much beauty and structure in the building itself. I talk to them about a statistic that I am confident is correct, because I heard it on one of my trips around Parliament House with a guide-that is, there are about 23 kilometres of corridor in this building. I am sure that I, along with many others, have walked through many of those 23 kilometres of corridor. When I first arrived in this place and found myself having to move from one part of the building to the other, I was confronted with what many other people here are confronted with and that is that the corridors are so similar. Even now, as you are moving, perhaps from a committee hearing back to your office, you can easily look up and wonder whether you are in the inner corridor, the outer corridor or on the first floor or the second floor because the corridors, particularly in the office part of the building, are so similar. When I was finding it difficult to work out where I needed to be, as an engineer I acquainted myself with one of the many diagrams that are on the walls here so I could see a plan view of what Parliament House looked like. I have been very confident of finding my way around since looking at the plan view of it. It demonstrates the symmetry of this building. The building is exceptionally well laid out and, when you are conscious of what the layout of the building is, it is exceptionally easy to move quickly from one place to another. It is so symmetrical. It is a truly wonderful building. It is a landmark building and it is so important that we preserve it and respect it. Twenty-five years is a fantastic milestone. I am sure that there will be many more to come and I certainly join my colleagues in wishing the building a happy 25th birthday. Ms LIVERMORE (Capricornia) (11:02): I was so pleased to see this motion of the 25th anniversary of the new Parliament House on the program of business this week because it meant that in this, my final week in the parliament, I could have the opportunity to pay tribute to this magnificent building, which has been one of my workplaces for the last 15 years and to, as it were, extend my valedictory speech to thank the many people, the staff of Parliament House, who have helped me do my job in this place for the five terms that I have served. It has been fantastic to listen in to this morning's debate and to start back in the days of Old Parliament House, listening to the member for Berowra talking about serving on the committee that put some of the building blocks in place that led to the design and construction of this building. Also, to hear from the member for Fraser, who has such a strong connection as a member here in the ACT, about how this building was conceived and what it was hoped to embody and convey to the Australian people at the time of its design. I can still remember coming to this building for the first time in 1989, maybe 1990. I was a university student at the time and came down to visit a mate, who was at ADFA. My first impression has stayed with me ever since and it is something that I always share with school groups or people who ask me about this building when I am back in my electorate. To me, what is so great about it is that it is so quintessentially Australian. It is grand enough to be our Parliament House, to be the nation's capital building-the nation's parliament. But it is not ostentatious, it is not flashy and it is not in any way over-the-top. This is a very Australian characteristic. I think embodied in Australia's Parliament House is that sense of Australians wanting it to be appropriate but not in any way flashy or ostentatious. The member for Fraser talked about some of the design principles that the architects wanted to convey in the building. They have been very successful in creating a building that is impressive but not imposing. To have the building topped by that incredible Australian flag, that huge Australian flag, sends out a signal of who this building is for and what this building is for. When I see it from the air, or when parliament is sitting, I cross the lake to drive up to Parliament House on a Sunday afternoon the flagpole conveys very much the significance of this building, what this building is for and who owns it. When you get closer to the building itself, it is, as I say, impressive but not imposing. The building really invites people to gather at its front and then for them to participate within it-this is something very special. But a building is only as good as the people inside it. I am just so fortunate to have been looked after by the staff of Parliament House for these many years. I will start with the people whom you first meet as a new MP, and they are the corridor attendants and those in the Serjeant's office. They are so friendly and helpful, and this has been the case for my entire 15 years here. Nothing is too much trouble for them. I tell you what: when you pick up the phone to the Serjeant's office, it does not matter how obscure your question is, they will have an answer and the patience to find a solution or to help you in some other way with what you are asking about. I really do appreciate all that they have helped me with over the years. I am going through this list in no particular order but with who just popped into my head during this week. The starting point for me was when the attendants were looking after me in those very early days and making that sure that I felt at home in my office and that I could get to work straight away as the member for Capricornia. I also want to thank the security guards for always being so courteous, so friendly and so professional. I have been to other parliaments around the world and have gone up to the security staff with a big smile and a hello, only to be met with stony-faced silence-so different from here. We are so lucky to have the security guards around Parliament House, keeping us safe and doing their job but also making everyone feel welcome and that this is their house. I cannot remember the number of times that I have had people from my electorate come here, looking a little bit lost, and a security guard has come up to them in the entrance hall and asked: 'How can we help you? Who do you want to see? Here's a phone. Let's get you sorted out.' This has always been my experience of our security guards in Parliament House. They are a great bunch. Thank you to the clerks Bernard Wright and David Elder and to Marion Bartlett and all the other chamber staff who serve us so well. You literally make this place function and, in doing so, help us all to do our jobs and to present the best possible face of this parliament to the Australian public. I have really valued your experience and assistance over the years, especially in my time as a member of the Speaker's panel. The library staff do a terrific job as well. They are such an important but sometimes undervalued part of the democratic function of this place. Again, when you go to an overseas parliament or when overseas delegations come here they want to learn about our library-how it is structured and the role that it plays in our parliament in assisting members to be diligent in their decision-making processes in this place. I want to thank the International and Community Relations Office, who have been extremely helpful over the years in many different ways-Onu and Paul for helping out with passports and visas, and Geoff, Raymond and Colin for always being there to answer my questions and to get things sorted out for international travel or hosting delegations here. Thanks too to the Comcar drivers, as well as Greg, Roger and Carol in the Transport Office. Some mornings you might not really want to come into this place, but the Comcar driver greets you with a friendly smile outside your accommodation and then there's a big cheery 'Hello, how are you going and welcome' from Greg. It is those little things that really do help you get through your days in this place. One of the things that all of those of us who are retiring are most anxious about is how to survive in the outside world without 2020, those IT experts here in Parliament House, helping us to turn things on and off and to understand what this or that instruction means. Seriously, I do not know what I am going to do without them. They are always so patient with me-I am in my 40s and I do not know how to do all this stuff. They have been eternally patient and have never made me feel too much of an idiot when it comes to technology. The dining room staff, and especially Tim, always makes you feel like a million dollars when you go up there. I thank them for making the Members and Guests Dining Room a special place-I really like to take guests up there to experience not only the view, but also the atmosphere that has been created through the professionalism of Tim and his team. I also want to thank Hansard for always interpreting those place names in my electorate correctly and keeping me out of trouble by getting people's names right and creating that perfect record of what goes on in here. As the Deputy Speaker would know, it is a great thing to be able to mention a school or a person's achievements and present them with a perfect Hansard record of it. I appreciate Hansard's assistance over the years. I also want to thank the Auspic team who always cooperate with photos in the chamber or passport photos. It is another one of those services that is easily taken for granted, but it has been great to have them on hand to help out with such things over the years. The member for Berowra mentioned the childcare centre. My goodness, that was quite a long time coming and a big battle to get that facility, but who would question its value to the parliament these days? I am very fortunate to have my office directly above the childcare centre. What a wonderful thing it is to see those children out enjoying this beautiful building and its magnificent grounds as much as we do. It is wonderful for people working in this place to have their children close by and part of their world inside Parliament House. I have had the great privilege of serving on some terrific committees, and the best ones have been the ones in this final term, including the Standing Committee on Regional Australia, so wonderfully served by Glen Worthington, Siobhan Leyne, Casey Mazzarella and Emily Costello. We have travelled all over Australia and even around the world. It has been great to do that with the member for Riverina, who is here in the chamber, and also with our chair, Tony Windsor, the member for New England. I would like to take this opportunity to wish Tony all the best in what will not be his retirement, but for his life after this place. I have also served as the chair of the Public Works Committee and that has been a fantastic experience, with the assistance of Anthony Overs, Alison Clegg and Fiona Gardner and my deputy chair the member for Mallee, who is also leaving this place after a very distinguished career. I am going to say a quick thank you to staff at FCm Travel and their predecessors who, again, have always been very patient in helping me figure out travel, travel with children and the back and forth between here and Rockhampton. They have always been very quick to answer my inquiries and get me on my way so I thank them. I appreciate all the work of the gardening and cleaning staff. This is a magnificent building but, I tell you what, it would require a lot of upkeep. They keep it looking its best for us and for the Australians who want to come here and feel proud of this place. Finally, I am going to talk about the Parliamentary Education Office. I had the great pleasure of working with Jason and Marisa in my electorate just in the week before I came back here for this final fortnight of sitting. They came around to a whole bunch of schools in my electorate to bring lessons about the work of the parliament to students. The Parliamentary Education Office and the work they do every day ensures that this building, this parliament and the work that goes on here can be understood and that those children who come here feel a connection to what we do. We hope they aspire to be part of this-to be part of our parliament-whether it is as a politician, a researcher or a staff member, or in some other form. It is the work of the Parliamentary Education Office in introducing students to the parliament and encouraging them to take an interest that will ensure this building, and the work of this building, continues to be held in high esteem in the future. Thank you very much to all the staff of the parliament who have made this such a special place to work. I look forward to returning in other capacities in the future and wish all of my continuing colleagues all the best as well. thing that you have mentioned all of those people who make our lives easier. I call on the member for Riverina. for her fine speech and wish her well in her post-political life. As she mentioned, we have gone a long way together-around the world, indeed, to Canada and Mongolia and on our regional Australia trip. Certainly, her contribution to that fly-in fly-out inquiry was invaluable. Speaking of invaluable, such has been the work of the former Attorney General, the member for Barton, whose seat is named after Edmund Barton, the first prime minister of this great country. Certainly, there is going to be a different political landscape in the building we are acknowledging today in this motion on the 25-year anniversary of this building. It is going to look totally different in the next parliament. We have the members for Capricornia and Barton both retiring. This morning we heard that the members for New England and Lyne are joining them in retirement. But while the faces will change, the building and its service to the",155,Motions

217,Mr Mccormack (Riverina) (11:17,"Firstly, I commend the member for Capricornianation will go on. Parliament House is a symbol of Australian democracy, home to the Australian parliament and the meeting place of the nation. It was originally the ground upon which the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people used to meet as well and we should acknowledge them in this motion. On9 May 1988, the building we are currently standing in-Australia's Parliament Housewas officially opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, long may she reign, 10 years after the Fraser government decided a new building was required on Capital Hill. Old Parliament House, as it is now known, was opened in 1927 and was only ever intended to be a temporary building for the Australian parliament; however, the building was starting to become outgrown and by the 1980s there were 3,000 people working in a space originally designed for just 300. Old Parliament House served Australia well-for 61 long years. It is very much an iconic building. The Fraser government announced a two-stage competition to become the designer of the new building, and the winner was New York based architectural firm Mitchell/Giurgola, with Italian architect Romaldo Giurgola on site for the construction process. Construction of this magnificent building began in 1981 and was intended to be completed by Australia Day 1988 to coincide with the 200th anniversary of European settlement in Australia. The construction was to cost Australia $220 million. However, neither the completion date nor the budgets were met. Her Majesty opened the building just over three months after the expected datewhich is not too bad, given the size and scope of the building-and the building cost a total of A$1.1 billion, making it the most expensive building in the world at the time of its construction. But it is worth it. I think we would all agree that it has certainly been worth it. I know the member for Canberra agrees that it is worth it; it is probably in her electorate. Ms Brodtmann: It is in my electorate. construction of Parliament House, and the building is constructed almost entirely of Australian materials. The building is one of the largest in the southern hemisphere, measuring 300 metres long and 300 metres wide and covering a floor area of more than 250,000 square metres. We heard the member for McPherson say before that there are 25 kilometres of corridors, and that is an amazing statistic. The official opening date of 9 May was chosen to align with the anniversary of the opening of both the first federal parliament in Melbourne on 9 May 1901 by the Duke of Cornwall and York, later King George V, and the provisional parliament house in Canberra on 9 May in 1927 by the Duke of York, later King George VI and father to Queen Elizabeth II. The building was designed to blend in with the local environment, and one million cubic metres of earth were removed so that the centre zone of Parliament House could be built into Capital Hill. This was then replaced with two curved walls and covered with grass to recreate the shape of the hill. Aside from returning the earth back to the environment, the reconstruction of the hill was also of symbolic purpose-and this is what the Prime Minister talked about the other day in her fine speech-in that it was meant for the public to be able to walk over the building and serve as a reminder to those who serve as members of parliament and senators that they are not above the public but that indeed the public are above politicians and have the right to hold us accountable.",159,Motions
218,Mr Mccormack,"It is in her electorate. Ten thousand people took part in theAs times have changed, security measures have needed to be increased and people can no longer walk over the top of the building, but the sentiment is still there and it is something that I think every person who serves in this parliament should always remember. We should also remember that, as we look out the front doors of Parliament House, the Australian War Memorial is off in the distance. That building, which is a fine centrepiece of Australian democracy as well, serves to remind us that men and women died so that we could live in peace and have freedom, free speech and a free democracy-and that is so very important. Whilst not being able to walk over the building, the public can still gain access to the top of the building where they not only are treated to amazing views across Canberra, the member for Canberra's electorate but also get to see first hand the 81-metre flagpole from which an Australian flag measuring almost the size of half a tennis court is flown. The flag is the pinnacle of Parliament House, and the flag and the flagpole are just as iconic an image as the parliamentary complex itself. May we long retain the flag we have now, because it is a great symbol. The forecourt is the primary entrance to Parliament House and was designed to invite people into the building. The two walls which frame the entrance almost appear as two outstretched arms to welcome people in. The complex is then divided into the ministerial wing, the House of Representatives, the Senate and the entrance, which includes the magnificent Great Hall. The public can view a large area at the front of Parliament House, but for security reasons and to ensure efficient day-to-day running most of the building has restricted access. If you enter from the forecourt and walk through the Great Hall you arrive in the Members' Hall, which is located outside the House of Representatives chamber. There is a water feature placed there so that anyone on the upper level, whilst being able to look down into the hall, is unable to hear conversations which may be taking place. That is sometimes important because there are a few conversations meant for private ears in this place that should stay just thatsuch as on a day like today when we have only a couple of sitting days left in parliament. Each wing of the complex has its own distinct colouring system. The ministerial wing has blue carpet, and the House of Representatives and Senate have adopted the Westminster colouring of green and red respectively, but with a distinct Australian feel. The green of the House of Representatives is muted to align with the colourings of the eucalyptus leaves, and the red of the Senate is a softer shade to represent the red of the outback. People who have visited the Senate may have noticed that the emergency exit signs are red. In Australia, it is compulsory to have green emergency exit signs, and an act of parliament needed to be passed to allow the Senate to have red exit signs. These are the only exit signs in Australia which are not green. Isn't that interesting? Parliament House is not only a Canberra icon, but it is also an Australian icon, with many Australian tourists visiting every year in addition to the numerous international visitors who leave the tourist hot spots of the big cities to come and see Australian democracy at work. I was speaking to a lady from America yesterday at the post office here, and she admired the building. I said, 'Your President, Barack Obama, when he visited here not that long ago, was also in absolute admiration of the size, the scope and the magnificence of Australian Parliament House.' It truly is something to be proud of. Another large contingent who visit this building every year are Australian school students. I would imagine that we get more students visiting from my Riverina electorate, which is not very far west of here, than from any other electorate in Australia. We have more than 120 schools in my electorate. The kids just love it. They love the certificates they get, which I personally sign and which the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives also have signed. The kids love coming here. I remember coming to the Old Parliament House-I do go back that far-and getting off the bus and being marshalled into lines. On the steps, Malcolm Fraser-yes, it was that long ago-was being interviewed. I thought that it would be a really cool thing to be interviewed on the steps of Parliament House, but let me tell you-many, many years on and having come to this place as a parliamentarian-sometimes it is not that cool to be interviewed on the steps of Parliament House. We have all had those 'gotcha' moments, when the media have asked you a question and you have answered it and you think that it might not come out as well as was intended. But the school students love coming to this place. You can see the eagerness in their brisk walk and the enthusiasm in their eyes when they are all going into the hospitality area. To that end, I commend the hospitality people, because they do a fine job with the school students, and the school students are always very respectful. I love being able to meet with the students from my electorate and relay to them the importance and significance of this building and, indeed, of Australian democracy. I always get them to look out of the window at the War Memorial, which, as I mentioned before, is a poignant reminder to us all that we only sit here today because of the brave men and women of our country who have gone and fought. Sadly, more than 105,000 of them have died in combat. I feel honoured and humbled to serve as the 14th member for Riverina. It is a Federation seat, and may it long continue to be a seat recognised by this parliament and all that it represents. I trust that this building will continue to see many more years and many more parliaments. I believe it will continue to serve us as a symbol of Australian democracy and the meeting place for our great nation. BeforeI conclude, I would also like to pay tribute to the member for Hinkler, who I know is going to follow me in speaking, for his fine service. I know how proud he is to come to this place. There are not too many members who actually served in the Old Parliament House and are now serving in this Parliament House. I know that Philip Ruddock, the member for Berowra, is one of them, and he is contesting this election. One of them who is retiring is Senator Ron Boswell, the great Queensland Nationals senator. He is from the Liberal National Party, but he is certainly very much a National Party senatorMs O'Dwyer: Very much a National. Higgins reminds me. 'Bossie' has given this place his life, and certainly he will be greatly missed. There are some characters in this place. If you look at the prime ministers that we have had and some of the great speeches that we have heard, it is a tremendous place. The longest serving member for Riverina was Noel Hicks. He also was actually the National Party member for Riverina-Darling, because the electorate had a slight name change when they added the name Darling between 1984 and 1993. He came into this place when it",160,Motions
219,Mr Mccormack,"He is very much a National Party senator, as the member foropened in 1988. He had been serving in the old place. He said that the new Parliament House was well overdue at the time but that this place took some getting used to. He has very many fond memories of the traditions of the sitting nights in the old place. He said that the old parliament was perhaps a little bit more bipartisan. In 1988, 3,000 people were crammed into a building designed for just 300. There were shared offices, and the House of Representatives chamber was too small to fit the number of members elected to it. You could not help but get along with members on the other side, he told me. The parliamentary bar, Mr Hicks said, was where most of the governing actually happened. He said that there was a real sense of camaraderie and civility between members and senators and the parliamentary bar was where this conviviality was really on display in the old House. While the facilities that we have in this place are undoubtedly first class, it is the camaraderie Mr Hicks speaks of and which many retired members have lamented the gradual decline in that I think this place could do with perhaps a bit more of. We get to know the members well on committee work and delegations but perhaps it is a shame that we do not sometimes push the tables together more in the politicians' dining room and share a meal with our combatants on the other side. Noel Hicks, however, does speak of how better equipped this place is compared with its predecessor. We even have terrific childcare facilities, which are very important. We are incredibly lucky to have such a functional, modern and symbolic building in which to debate the nation's future. This is a place steeped in the traditions of the Westminster system which also reflects the changing nature and aspirations of the modern Australian nation. There is no better reflection of what our nation is then the wonderful synergy this place has of the old and the new. I commend the motion. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (11:31): I would like to commend the member for Riverina for his splendid speech and also for paying tribute to those who served in the Old Parliament House and also this wonderful new Parliament House. I am incredibly proud and tickled pink that this wonderful, iconic building that we are celebrating and talking about here today is in my electorate of Canberra because it truly is a most magnificent piece of modern architecture and craftsmanship. It is the centrepiece, as we heard from the Prime Minister on Tuesday, of our democracy. She quoted former Prime Minister Bob Hawke-and I think this is a beautiful quote-who said of his place that it is: … the forum for our differences and the instrument of our unity. I think that really does sum up what new Parliament House represents to us as politicians and as representatives of our communities and the Australian nation. It is a symbol of nation building and forward thinking. This building was designed and built to last for 200 years. I cannot imagine what the electorate of Canberra will be like in another 175 years time, but I cherish the thought that this wonderful Parliament House, which will be a grand old dame by then, will still be standing tall at its centre. Parliament House is the realisation of a magnificent design, a magnificent philosophy and a modern notion of democracy. It has been made possible by Canberra's, Australia's and, indeed, the world's best tradespeople, labourers, managers, administrative staff and professional consultants. Parliament House was built by a team of some 2,000 people here on site in Canberra, and as many as 8,000 around Australia were involved in the manufacturing of the materials and products. Some 24 nationalities were represented among those working on this project. Anyone who has been lucky enough to spend time in this building for an extended period will know that a full range of craft and trade skills are evident in its design and construction. It is right down to the fantastic carpentry work that is in our offices. It is in the tiny little drawers and shelves that have been developed. It is all high-quality craftsmanship made with great love and great respect for the Australian people and for the actual materials, such as the beautiful woods that have been used, and a great sense of this legacy and the fact that this beautiful craftsmanship and beautiful work is going to be here for a long time. It was built to be enduring. It was built with respect as a result of that. One particular story that I love is that the building even called for the revival of some skills which at the time were considered quite rare, such as the mixing and application of stucco lustro, a polished plaster wall finish derived from the methods first used in Roman times. I like to think the building has therefore contributed to the preservation of these skills. I know that Aldo, when he was designing it, invoked many of those classic Romanesque architectural themes here, with the pillars and columns and the grandeur. It is just wonderful that not only is the design concept based on those principles and those philosophies but also the actual building and construction of it have drawn on those skills that date right back to Roman times. I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the over 10,000 people who were involved in the construction of this project in some way or another. I hope and I know that they are proud of their contribution to this incredible, significant and historic building. I hope and I know that they take satisfaction in the fact that the results of their efforts are so spectacular, are so enduring, are so monumental and are so significant that they make us all proud as a nation. They inspire awe, as we have heard from presidents and other visitors from overseas, from right throughout the world. Most importantly, I hope and I know that they realise that the thousands of people who visit this building every day-from the politicians to the cleaners, from the schoolchildren to the lobbyists, the security guards, the police officers and the advisers-all feel a sense of pride and privilege that they are able to work in this great place. Many people who work in this building have aspired to work here since they were children-perhaps as a politician or an adviser. It is a focal point for the nation and, for many Australians and many who work here, a focal point of their aspirations. I feel that as I work here every day of the week. I would also like to pay tribute to the people who work in this building today, particularly those who take such good care of it and of us-the cleaners, the gardeners, the tour guides, the library staff, the security guards, the police officers, the journalists, the barristers, the chefs, the waiters, the attendants, the educators, the post office staff, the bank and travel agent employees and the list goes on, including the advisers, of course. Perhaps the most special thing about this building is that it is not just a building; it is a community that it is a privilege to be a part of. It is a community. We spend an awful lot of time here together and we spend an awful lot of time in the wee small hours, when we are quite often very tired and cranky. It is a community where people provide support to one another from both sides of the political divide, and we also get support from the security guards and the other staff around here. We get that sense of support and a sense that we are all working together for the common good, we are all working together to make a difference and we are playing our role in many and varied ways. Even though we have differences in our methods of getting there, we are all here to serve the Australian people. I believe that that is the belief of everyone who works in this building. We want to serve the Australian people. We want to make this nation a better place for all Australians. We want to make a difference. It is an incredible privilege to be working in a community that aspires to that. In my early years as a Canberran, I watched this building emerge out of what looked like a giant pit. It was a giant pit for what seemed a very long time, and now it has emerged into this thing of beauty. At the time, I could never have dreamed that, one day, I would not only work at New Parliament House-as we used to call it-but that I would be doing so as the person elected to represent the people of Canberra. It is fitting that by now, its 25th year, we have all but dropped the word 'New' when we refer to Parliament House, although we still abbreviate its name as NPH. I remember working on the 20th anniversary of Parliament House. I was doing some consulting-I had my own communication business before coming here. I was doing some work with the CFMEU at the time, and they were working in conjunction with a number of the architects and the engineers who worked on the construction of the building, to celebrate the workers who built this Parliament House. That was very much the focal point for the 20th anniversary program. It was just wonderful to meet, and hear all the stories of, the people who came here from all over the world to build this. There were plenty of funny stories and there were plenty of sad stories. There was a reunion lunch for all the workers. There was a reunion event here at Parliament House for all the engineers and the architects and the builders, and it was a great celebration of their efforts. To celebrate the 25th anniversary and to coincide with Canberra's centenary, we had the beautiful ballet that was performed recently by the Australian Ballet company, called 'Monument'. The building was celebrated through dance, and everyone who saw that, including me, was amazed at how the ABC managed to convert the built form into life, into dance, into movement. It was a challenging brief, but they did a fantastic job. I understand that Aldo Giurgola, the architect of Parliament House, attended that and was incredibly moved by what he saw. Aldo is a very prominent figure in this building. He comes here every week to check up on his baby. He makes sure that everything is in its place. WheneverI see him wandering the corridors-he is 90-plus now-I reflect on a story that I was told when I was in Foreign Affairs and Trade about Harry Seidler, who designed the Australian Embassy in Paris. The story shows how protective architects are of their creations. It happened at the time when Gough Whitlam was ambassador. Harry was invited around to have a drink, or dinner, with Gough and Margaret. They were in the ambassador's residence, this beautiful Harry Seidler creation, and Harry spent most of the time arranging the furniture. Like all great architects, he had designed the furniture as well, and he was most unimpressed with the way Gough and Margaret had disrespected his vision for the furniture arrangements and other general arrangements-the ambience of the Australian ambassador's residence in Paris. Harry spent most of his time wandering around rearranging the furniture, literally, and chastising Gough and Margaret for not realising the true sense of the Harry Seidler vision. I do not know whether that is myth, but it is a good story. It does underscore the fact that architects are incredibly protective and possessive of their work, and we definitely have that with Aldo. I can see Aldo being carried out from here in a pine coffin. He is so attached to the place that it will probably be here where he will move on. He is a great inspiration. Another thing I find inspiring in this wonderful building are the gardens. Even at the moment, when we are in the grip of winter, we still have beautiful azaleas and camellias. I wish my garden looked this good in winter, but unfortunately I do not have the fantastic team that they have here. In spring it comes into its own. There is a magical Japanese garden, a cherry blossom garden, which is just divine. I love wandering the gardens here every day and seeing the art and sculptures. It is not just the building that is so magnificent; it is also the gardens and the art that is in the gardens. It is wonderful seeing so many Canberrans and Australians come up during Floriade, in spring, to see the true joy of the beautiful design of these gardens. As the member for Riverina has mentioned, the children who come here also get great joy not just from seeing the House of Representatives and the Senate and working out what is red and what is green, and from the hospitality, but also from doing the role-play in the education room and screaming at each other. They also get great joy from seeing this iconic building, which they watch on television during the week from far-flung parts of Australia. They all come here to celebrate democracy and their nation. It is this purpose-built home of democracy which we are celebrating the 25th anniversary of this year. It is a symbol of freedom and hope. It is a symbol of democracy. It is a symbol of unity. It is a symbol of nationhood. It has served us well over the last 25 years and it will continue to serve us for the next 175 years. Happy birthday, Parliament House! interesting that you mention Wide Bay instead of Hinkler. I am going to draw an analogy between the two seats in my speech. the member for Wide Bay at the time, Andrew Fisher, who laid the foundation stone for the first Parliament House 100 years ago. But we are here today primarily to celebrate the 25th anniversary of this great Parliament House. But, as the member for Canberra said, it is overlaid by the second great anniversary, the 100th anniversary of the naming of Canberra and the laying of the foundation stone for the first Parliament House. As I have said, it was Andrew Fisher who was the member for my area and who laid that foundation stone. Interestingly, you can go to Gympie-which is not in my electorate but is in the electorate of Wide Bay, adjoining mine-where there is a historical precinct and you can actually go to Andrew Fisher's house. For those of you going up the north coast anytime in the future, it is worth stopping in Gympie to get that lovely link between Wide Bay, one of the original seats, Andrew Fisher and indeed this place. It is hard to encapsulate what this place means. Like all great public buildings, when it was being built it was roundly criticised: 'Why are they digging that big hole in the hill?' 'Couldn't they have built it on some flat land?' 'Why do they need a million dollars for a flagpole?' When you think about it, to the uninitiated, not seeing the architectural vision of Romaldo Giurgola at that time, you would have been taken aback before you saw that beautiful architectural shape of the flagpole and so the concept of someone spending a million dollars on a flagpole was probably a bit more than some people could bear.

223,Mr Neville,"There is no need to apologise, Madam Deputy Speaker. It was actuallybuildings have been challenges, not least of which is the Opera House. There were people who thought the Opera House was a dreadful building but, of course, time has proven them quite wrong-as indeed it has with this building. I like the line in Tony Abbott's address when they had the function, morning tea, in the Great Hall to celebrate this 25th anniversary. He offered an interesting line. He said it is a bit like a young person's first suit because you might look a bit awkward and gorky in it at first but eventually you grow into it. Indeed, we have grown into this and, as you have heard other speakers say today, Old Parliament House in many respects had become a bit of a shambles with people living on top of each other, cramped officesAn honourable member interjectingIndeed, all Australians would still take great pride in it as being our first Parliament House in Canberra. The other thing that Tony Abbott said-which others have said in other ways-was that a 'nation’s pride in itself should indeed be reflected in its public buildings'. Those of us who have had the good fortune to go to Rome, Paris or London and see the rich history that has built up there, or to stand on the Eiffel Tower and see the symmetry of Paris and Napoleon's vision for that, know it is inspiring. So a statement about our nationhood was really called for. After all, the first Parliament House was only ever called the temporary parliament house. As others have said, it opened on 9 May 1927, after a fairly elongated period in the Victorian parliament. For this building I am in the imagery is very good. It is a bold statement in the sense of the grandeur of the place and the area it takes up, being 300 metres by 300 metres, cut into a hill, Capitol Hill. But then, at the same time, with the grass overlaying it, there is a sense that we have not got beyond ourselves-that, in the end, we serve this country from this place. So it is a mixture of a national statement on the one hand and national restraint on the other. As the member for Riverina said, the American President, Barack Obama, was full of praise for this building. I can remember that not long after I came here we had a state visit from President von Weizsacker of West Germany, as it was then. President von Weizsacker said that he believed it was the greatest parliament house in the world. That is something we can take great pride in-that we had set a standard in our public building which reflected our confidence and reflected a national sentiment. I think that this Parliament House has some quite exquisite features, one of which is the almost total use of Australian materials. To see the rich marbles, the rich timbers and the beautiful timber inlays in the Marble Foyer-you certainly come away with a sense of pride, not only in the architectural statement made by the building but in the workmanship and the arts and skills that went into creating this ambience. The two chambers are such that-the member for Lingiari probably craves the old building a little-they will serve us for 200 years even if the House of the Representatives and Senate were to increase again by, say, another 12 members. You virtually have to go up in multiples of 12-two for each state with six statesfor the Senate and then you have to double that for the House of Representatives. It is interesting to know that that next step could be taken without substantially altering this building.",166,Motions
224,Mr Neville,"I am sure you did. From a sense of sentimentality, I am sure you did.A few things troubled me this year. This is not said, by the way, with any sense of malice or as overt criticism, but I think it needs to be said. We developed, in this very chamber we are in today, something unique in the Westminster system-this idea of a second debating chamber for the lower house of the parliament. It was a very well-structured idea, which came out of the Keating government, to give us this. The thing that troubles me about it is that, after all these years, we have not developed it to the next stage. This 25-year anniversary of the new building, on the one hand, and the 100th anniversary of the naming of Canberra, on the other, is a marvellous opportunity for us to seize-to build the permanent Federation Chamber. The plans are there. Many of us in this room who are chairs of committees have sat in on consultations and have seen these plans. Having seen them, I think this would have been a great opportunity to initiate that. NowI put to you another challenge. Before this year is out, a new parliament will assemble. To close off 2013, this year of silver jubilee and centenary, why not bookend it by at least laying the foundation stone for the federation chamber? In other words, if we cannot build the thing this year, at least make the commitment this year. We started something quite unique with a second debating chamber and it is something that has been taken up by the mother of parliaments, the UK parliament, whose second chamber is in Westminster Hall, with its rich history going back a thousand years. Australians are great lovers of democracy and this is a significant year for us. When we reflect on our democracy we can go right back to the early concepts of democracy from Greece. In a more practical sense, we can go back 800 years to Magna Carta which is the lively document upon which most of the English-speaking parliaments of the world are based. We can go out into the tourist areas of this building and see one of the three original copies of Magna Carta-an 800-year-old document and the document upon which all our parliamentary business is ultimately based. The history of this parliament-a fairly short history in comparison with some of our European cousins-contains innovations like a second debating chamber, the Federation Chamber. That is an innovation that other parliaments have either adopted or are looking to adopt. I am told that even the House of Lords is looking to a second chamber. With that in mind I make this plea in my last week in this place: this year, 2013, let us make a commitment to a permanent Federation Chamber. I think that would be a great fulfilment. Quite frankly, I think the people of Canberra and the ACT Legislative Council have done a marvellous job. They have really shown a pride in their city in this centenary. But my sense is that, on the functions I have been to here, we as the federal parliament have not pulled our weight, first, in the celebration of that 100 years and, secondly, to put a tangible overlay on the celebration of the silver jubilee of the building. It has been a great privilege to serve in this building. As I said, it has been a great privilege to hear the leaders of the world laud it as one of the great gathering places of democracy. We should be proud of it. We should enhance it. We should make it the focal point of people who come to Canberra, particularly students, so that we build into them a sense of pride and national achievement. if I can put on the record, for the enormous service that you have given to this parliament. I have to say that you will be missed.",167,Motions
225,The Deputy Speaker (Ms Hall,"Thank you, Member for Hinkler. Thank you also,Ms O'DWYER (Higgins) (11:59): I concur with the Speaker's remarks. I also place on the record my appreciation for the member for Hinkler. What a wonderful speech you have just delivered. I suspect it is your final speech in this place, if you are not delivering another speech in the other chamber. What a delight it has been to know you in the short time that I have been here. Thank you for the wonderful contribution you have made representing your constituents, like so many people before you and so many who will come after you. Congratulations for that. I rise today to recognise one of the most, if not the most, recognisable landmarks in Australian politics-that is the Parliament House building itself. I am from the great state of Victoria where we may well mourn the loss of the nation's parliament from Victoria, whence it first came. But on this occasion let me say with great celebration and rejoicing that it has been 25 years since the Australian parliament relocated from Old Parliament House just down the road to what is now the not-so-new Parliament House. It was officially opened by her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on 9 May 1988. With its unique architecture, Australian art and iconic features, Capital Hill is a symbol of Australian democracy and governance. One needs to see only an outline of the famous spire and flag and the building is instantaneously recognisable. We should note that that stainless steel structure-the famous spire we see each day as we come and go from this beautiful building-is one of the largest stainless steel structures in the world, at 81 metres high. However, the story of Parliament House extends far beyond its physical presence. It has become a symbol of the political and social narrative of this nation. Some of Australia's most controversial and defining moments have taken place in this building from the great battles between Treasurer Peter Costello and former Treasurer Paul Keating, then Prime Minister, to the national apology. This building has borne witness to some of the finest political moments. It has also witnessed the uglier side-the knifing of a first-term Prime Minister and corruption scandals involving members spring to mind. One thing is for sure, though: this place is never dull, it is never boring and there is very serious business that needs to be done here. That is, indeed, why we have a second chamber; the amount of work members need to do this place does require a second chamber in order that we are best able to represent the concerns and interests, big and small, of our constituents and the national interest. I take the opportunity here today to pay tribute to all of those who were involved in the planning and design of this building. Everyone who was involved, from the original steering committee to the architect, Romaldo Giurgola, should be acknowledged and praised. It is fitting to also acknowledge that it was a very serious international competition to come up with this unique design. More than 329 entries were made before one was, fittingly, chosen, and that is what we have here today. Finally, I recognise the immense work that the clerks, the cleaners, maintenance, IT, the support staff and the gardeners all undertake to keep this building and its grounds in the immaculate condition that we appreciate each day. The walls are pristine white, the floors are always polished and the gardens immaculately manicured. All of those who embark upon this great care for this wonderful building so richly deserve their credit and our appreciation. We wish the building a very happy quarter of a century. Who knows what the future holds for this place, but I look forward to hopefully being able to be back in this place to celebrate its 50th birthday in years to come. and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (12:04): Thank you for this opportunity. I was sitting down in my office and I glanced at this chamber and saw we were pursuing and continuing the discussion around the 25th anniversary of this Parliament House. I thought I should make a contribution for a number of reasons. I was born in Canberra, as was my mother. She was born here in 1927, the year of the birth of the interim Parliament House, as it then was, which lasted of course until 1988. I grew up in Canberra knowing this dome as basically a paddock, a bit of scrub with a lot of trees on it, around which we drove to get into the city. Never would I have though that at some future date it might be the home of our new parliament. Indeed, on my election in 1987 I had an office in Old Parliament House. There are two members on this side of the chamber who have had the opportunity to serve in both places: the member for Scullin, who was here earlier, and me. I have to say there is a remarkable difference between the two places, for a range of reasons. Many people in Canberra came here to build Old Parliament House. My grandparents were here living in what was called the Causeway, which was basically a little settlement created for people working on the buildings of the new Canberra. I have a book at home which has the names and occupations of the people in every house in the Causeway during the 1920s. They were here as carpenters, bricklayers, painters-they were workers. Not far from the Causeway, in fact very close to the railway station, was built the Government Printing Office. Of course the Government Printing Office was important in those days because Hansard was done manually. The manual transcription was put down a pipe and shot off to the printing office where it was painstakingly composed, put on a printing machine and published. That process involved a whole lot of people and whole a lot of trades which largely no longer exist. My mother was a reader in the old printing office. Her attachment to the parliament, although she had never been in the place, was that at some point she was a reader, as was her sister. Other members of her family worked in the building. My brother had an apprenticeship as a machine fitter in the old printing office, which is so closely identified with Old Parliament House. When we moved up the hill of course things changed. I moved from a box of about nine square metres in Old Parliament House, where you literally could not swing a cat and where you had to walk outside up to the common-use facilities, the toilets. It has often been said that in Old Parliament House you struck up a conversation with the person next to you at the urinal. That is what used to happen. People passed each other in the corridors. It was a very intense place for personal communication. You could not avoid people; you had to interact with people. IndeedI recall my immediate neighbour when I first got into the parliament was the then newly elected John Hewson. Old Parliament House was a very dynamic building simply because it was too small. People had to spend a lot of time out of their offices. The dining room was a common meeting place. The bar was a centrepiece of activity. You would go down at five or six o'clock in the evening and see a few-politicians and media alikewho used to prop up the bar. The media cycle was very different in those days. But it was a meeting place, a meeting place that does not exist in this parliament. People interacted on a constant basis, and it was a very human thing. The dynamic was very positive. The old press gallery, poor buggers, sat in what was a rabbit warren-you had to walk over the roof at one",168,Motions
226,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari,"Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Sciencepoint! They were close to one another, sitting virtually on each other's laps to do their work, but they were constantly interacting with the members of parliament, whether they were ministers or backbenchers, because that was the nature of the physical structure of the building. Ministers were not separated as they are here. There were meeting places, but they were rather small. So it was a very different place. Then we moved up here. I have had the privilege of serving in both that parliament and this parliament and they are so drastically different. The first thing that struck me, after not too long, was the isolation of this building. I still think it is a negative attribute of the place. Because of the wonderful infrastructure that we have-and it is really world class, the office space for members of parliament and the office space for the press gallery-there is a great deal of separation. The ministers are in one wing. The senators and member are in other wings. To traverse from one point diagonally to the other takes fives minutes. If these bells rings, we are lucky to get to the chamber in four minutes. I have almost been caught out once or twice because of the distances in this building. SoI found it a quite isolating place initially, and, although the facilities are wonderful, there was not that human interaction-and, in my view, there still is not that human interactionthat was so much part of the Old Parliament House. This Parliament House was opened on 9 May. The first sitting day was 22 August, and I had the great privilege to give a speech on 23 August. I have seen this place develop. It can be a soul-destroying place if you do not get out of your office. That is clear. There are people who have really suffered as a result of isolation and loneliness in this building. That is something which, as members of parliament, we need to be very conscious of in making sure that we take care of our friends. But the facilities are absolutely magnificent. The gym here is wonderful. I am a regular attender-I have been since the day it opened-and it is well used, not only by the members of parliament but by the staff. One of the great things about this building is that, despite the fact that there are isolated hours when only members of parliament can attend the gym, there are no airs and graces here. You are who you are, and that is it. It does not matter whether you are the Prime Minister or one of the cleaners; in this building, you are all equal in the sense of use of the building. That, to me, is a really wonderful thing. The other obvious thing which is really magnificent about this building is the maintaining of the visual connection with the War Memorial down ANZAC Parade and the way this city has been designed to show us our obligation to our past. When we walk out of the front of this building onto the Michael Nelson Jagamara dot painting forecourt and bead our eyes down ANZAC Parade, we recall our obligations to those who have served. That, to me, is a wonderful thing. Another point that I think is really very important-and this again symbolises the Australian nature of 'Don't get too highfalutin'-is that, regardless of who you are, the people of the country can walk over the top of you. That, to me, is really wonderful. The symbolism of being connected to the world community through the opportunity for people to use the outside of the building as their own-to walk over it, to be part of it, to feel it and to touch it-is a wonderful thing. The other obvious thing to be said is that the craftsmanship in this building is world class. Whilst the architect has quite properly been given great recognition, the people who actually did the work on the building, the bricklayers, the plumbers, the painters, the electricians, the trades assistants-those people who have made this wonderful building what it is-deserve our highest praise. I know it was a boon to many in the building community in Canberra simply because of what it was: a huge multimillion dollar investment that provided opportunities for many both from Canberra and around Australia. I pay tribute to their work, because it will last for decades. This building really is a monument to the architect, to the people who have done the work on it and to the people who work within it. I think we have currently in a sitting week around 3,000 people working in this building. That is the size of Tennant Creek. When you explain that to the people of Tennant Creek they look at you with amazement, but it is true. This is a small town and we have almost all the facilities of a small town. When we look at this place we need to look at it in that context. It has been a great privilege-it is a great privilege-to be a member of this great parliament. To be a member of parliament in the first place is a wonderful honour and privilege; to be able to serve in this beautiful building that has been designed for us is also a great privilege. to this debate and for your insight into both Old Parliament House and this Parliament House. anniversary of new Parliament House, because I am amongst about 75 to 80 people who have been here since we shifted up the hill. Warren came up the hill with us. He went on to bigger and better things and then came back. He has been here a long time. I think for us this is really about the events of 25 years ago, when we made the move, because in a way the pioneers had to set the pace. They were two totally different working environments. We set out to try to make sure that it worked. There are things about the new Parliament House that changed the way we engage, the way in which we actually work with each other. Some of those things, I regret, are not totally positive, but this building is such a wonderful work space and has enabled the parliament to go into the 21st century. It enables parliament to have a modern outlook and to try to make sure that we can add that modernity to the base of our Westminster system so that we continue to remain relevant to those whom we represent. There have been many occasions, and this is yet another one, to pay tribute to everybodythe craftsmen, the architects who had the vision-who was involved in putting this building in place. It is quite appropriate that people talk about this being a building for eons. We talk about the fact that it was built to last 200 years, but I suspect that it will be used long after that. I remember being in Westminster Hall in the Palace of Westminster in January 1988, when we were having our bicentenary celebrations. I looked at that space and thought: 'That's what we need. We need a space like that.' This week when we were down in the Great Hall with the magnificent tapestry from the Victorian tapestry workshop, which is based on the Arthur Boyd painting, I still get the sense that that is the space that will linger. Even if it is used as a reception hall and for things like that it is still a space that is Australian. It is a space that we can be very proud of. Being able to host presidents from China and the United States or the big gatherings during the end of the bicentenary in that hall, I think, was very important. The main reason I wanted to intervene was that there are people who have been custodians of this place for the last 25 years and we should really congratulate those people. I remember",170,Motions

228,Mr Jenkins (Scullin) (12:16,"I am here as part of the museum piece of the 25ththat when we had the 20th anniversary people who had worked in building came back and were overawed at how good the building looked, and they paid great tribute to those that maintained it. Those are the people that I want to pay tribute to today, the people that ensure that this great Australian building, which is here for the Australian public in general, remains in the condition that it is. By doing that we honour the concepts that are involved in this building. All those who work in DPS in the maintenance of this building and the maintenance of the surrounds need to be congratulated. The other thing that we do not discuss enough is that in doing that they continue to make it a functioning building for the times. They have attacked energy conservation and they have attacked the challenge of water recycling and they do it really well. I think that we do not praise the people that do that. In its ecological footprint this is a building that should be an exemplar to others. Of course, it has the fortune of being of a size where we can really do that. They harvest water from the cooling towers and things like that and use it for other uses. When I went down there and inspected it I was told this was technology that they had got off dairies. It is the same simple technology that is being used. One thing that I have observed since I have got back into the nitty-gritty of committee work is the way in which this building allows us to use IT. Audioconferencing over telephone is passe. You can talk to people and have them on screen-and they are sitting in London or in their kitchen-over Skype and things like that. This is really enabling the parliament to be brought well and truly back to the community. I pay great homage today to all those that are involved in making this large space an operating and working environment. This is a terrific building. In conclusion, because we have expectant associates and observers from parliamentary committees who want to listen to the responses to their committee work, I pay great respect to all those that work in the committee system in this place, from both houses. I give a plug again for my mantra that this is one parliament, two houses-or two houses, one parliament. Let us get over the hill of our rivalries between ourselves and the Senate and see that the outcomes that we have are those of the parliament. I am in a better position to do that these days because I seem to have attracted more joint committees over the last period, and I am finding them a really refreshing outlook. I pay tribute from time to time to people that are associated with other government departments and government agencies that come across and help our committees to do their work. I hope that they leave with a great experience when they are associated with the parliament and can be ambassadors and people that can talk up our great work. I thank the Deputy Speaker for allowing me to have these short minutes to speak to this really worthwhile motion. Debate adjourned.

229,Mr Stephen Jones,"by leave-I move:Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Joint Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (12:25): On 15 June 2012 I requested that the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade inquire into and report on the care of ADF personnel wounded and injured on operations. On Monday, 24 June 2013 the committee tabled its report. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the committee for the report, which makes 25 recommendations for the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I have asked both departments, as I am sure you would understand, to examine closely the report in order for the government to provide a full and considered response. I should point out that both departments are committed to improving our understanding of the needs of veterans and their families and providing them with the highest quality service and support. I know this report will be a valuable contribution for us in continuing to develop our understanding of their experience and for both Defence and DVA in identifying any barriers to their receiving appropriate support, particularly after their military service as clients of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The recommendations for DVA broadly address issues such as veterans' mental health, transition from Defence, and accessing DVA care and support. As part of the committee's inquiry both DVA and Defence lodged submissions and presented before the committee. The submission lodged by DVA focused on five key issues: understanding the characteristics of those wounded or injured in operations; a more flexible, simple and comprehensive process for recognising service related injury; working closely with the ADF on services and the transition of personnel to civilian life; effective ongoing care and support after discharge; and readiness for the future. I should say that DVA has a strong and I believe proud history of supporting those men and women who have suffered and have offered service to our nation and the families that have made sacrifices to support them. DVA's submission to the committee provided information on a number of initiatives aimed specifically at providing care and support to those wounded or injured on operations since 1999. Over the course of the department's 94 years of operation it has developed considerable knowledge and skills in understanding the risks and effects arising from the unique and demanding nature of military service. As such, DVA is transforming its service delivery models to meet the emerging and ever-changing needs of the contemporary cohort of veterans and their families. I think it is important that we emphasise that immediate help is available for eligible veterans, including those currently serving with operational service such as in Afghanistan or Iraq, to access mental health treatment without the need to lodge a compensation claim. For eligible veterans with diagnosed post-traumatic stress disorder, other anxiety or depression,",173,Motions
230,Mr Snowdon (Lingiari,"Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence ScienceDVA will pay for immediate treatment. This access to immediate treatment for mental health concerns is separate to applying for compensation. I welcome the committee's acknowledgement that, for the most part, the care provided to Australia's wounded and injured is world-class, particularly in the immediate aftermath of a battlefield incident. The committee states: The Departments of Defence and Veterans’ Affairs have honoured their responsibilities to support the recovery and rehabilitation of these individuals and their families and, through various programs, continue to improve veteran support processes and coordination. Unfortunatelyas referred to in chapter 6 of the reportsome veterans still ‘fall through the cracks’. This has to end. I acknowledge that there is still more work for both the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs in this space to enhance the support they provide to our wounded and injured personnel. However, I think it is important to recognise that there is significant effort already underway in both departments to respond to the needs of these personnel. For instance, one recent initiative between DVA and Defence is the establishment of the ADF servicewomen's steering committee comprising current serving and former female ADF members, including reservists. DVA also appreciates there are concerns for some veterans transitioning from Defence and the nature of the claims process. Both DVA and Defence have in recent years focused on improving transition of veterans from the ADF to DVA care. I must say that this is an issue which I have been driving very hard since I was first put into the DVA portfolio. Having been the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, it occurred to me then as it does now that there is greater capacity for these two agencies to work more closely together to look after the needs of serving veterans. DVA will continue to work closely with Defence towards a seamless transition and to streamline the claims process-a process which, I know, is being taken on board by both agencies as a key component of what they are about. Most of the report was focused on research. DVA is committed to a strong research program. Much of the report also focused on research, and I have commented on that. A new strategic research program will strengthen research relationships through collaboration with other research bodies and organisations, including Defence, and ensure that research is focused on the department's priorities. This will involve, importantly, developing relationships with the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, the key scientific adviser to the Department of Defence, for which I am also responsible. Defence stands by its commitment to ensure ADF personnel always receive higher quality care, and the contact with Medibank Health Solutions underpins this commitment. Defence is holding MHS accountable for effective service delivery by closely monitoring performance against the contracted obligations and agreed performance indicators. This is a matter which is close to the front of my mind because I regularly visit the Defence facilities and have cause for discussions both with Defence health personnel and with service personnel, and we talk candidly about the access they have or do not have, depending on where they are, to appropriate health care services. DVA and Defence are cooperating extensively and DVA is working with the ADF to make the process of discharge from the military into civilian life as smooth as possible, including for those personnel who have sustained wounds or injuries from their service. Both departments have recently renewed their commitment to supporting the ADF community with a signing of a memorandum of understanding. This MOU is for the cooperative delivery of care and support to eligible persons. The Support to Wounded, Injured or Ill Program, SWIIP, was established as a joint Defence and Veterans' Affairs undertaking that aims to provide coordinated, transparent and seamless support to individuals during their service and after transition from the ADF, including by enhancing support for personnel with complex or serious medical conditions who are transitioning to civilian life; improving information sharing between DVA and Defence relating to injury or illness; and streamlining and simplifying compensation claims handling. There are other initiatives which we have in play to assist those wounded and injured in operations, the first of which is soldier recovery centres. Soldiers wounded or injured are also already seeking care and services at soldier recovery centres on bases in Townsville and Darwin, with a third on its way in Brisbane. These centres provide a dedicated health precinct to those members to rehabilitate, recover and return to their duties. A division having been called in the House of RepresentativesSitting suspended from 12:34 to 13:03 those wounded and injured on operations. I recognise the time for the debate has expired. I was going to talk about the veterans mental health budget package of $26.4 million in the 2013-14 budget and I was also going to talk to you about the mental health strategy and the review of military compensation arrangements, so this is in response to the review of military compensation arrangements. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Military Compensation Review and Other Measures) Bill 2013 was introduced into the parliament on 20 March 2013. We are hopeful it will pass through the Senate this week. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (13:04): It gives me great satisfaction to have taken part in this inquiry on the care of ADF personnel wounded and injured on operations. It is a very comprehensive report. It is the result of hours and hours of discussion and hearings with people from all over Australia-with families, with vets, with public servants and with serving soldiers. It is a very comprehensive body of work and it has been a great pleasure to take part in this very comprehensive review. It is impossible to exaggerate what we owe to our service personnel. In thanking them for their efforts and showing our gratitude for the work they do in securing our nation and preserving the democracy here, we have to ensure that we provide the highest standard of care for both those who are currently in service and veterans. The report covers a broad range of areas. As I said, it is a comprehensive body of work and it covers a broad range of areas. They range from the immediate action following an injury; aeromedical evacuation, which focuses on some of the activities that we are getting involved in in Afghanistan; rehabilitation and support following physical injury; mental health concerns; return from operations; and post-service issues, including Veterans' Affairs and veterans' support structures.",174,Committees
231,Mr Snowdon,"Before the suspension I was talking about the further initiatives to assistThe report also highlights a number of gaps. Previous speakers have mentioned those gaps, or those areas where things are falling through the cracks-as one of the chapters is calledand areas where there can be improvement, and also areas of excellence. With the areas of excellence, the report underlines the fact that we are working very well in the aeromedical evacuation space. However, there are areas of concern and they include garrison health support, female veterans' mental health, improving communications between Defence and DVA in the management of post-service transition, continuing problems-despite improvements-in the nature of services provided by DVA, and the continued need to improve cultural understanding and empathy. That is particularly important. In terms of progress in relation to areas of concern, there has been a strong recognition-as we have heard from Minister Snowdon-of the need to support those with mental health issues. Baby steps have been taken to make improvements in terms of streamlining the Veterans' Affairs-Defence processes and streamlining the information on injured soldiers. All the matters that are covered in this report are incredibly important. We have seen evidence of terrible hardship and unhappiness among our service people, as a result of their treatment. They have fallen through the gaps in this process, despite the best efforts of the ADF and DVA. I want to focus on four areas where we can improve. The first concerns female veterans. As the report notes, the committee was very concerned about the issues raised in the June 2012 report The health and well-being of female Vietnam and contemporary veterans. One of our recommendations is that the government implement, as a priority, the recommendations of that report, which was prepared by Dr Samantha Crompvoets. The recommendations in that report are to, as an overview:  Develop targeted support and resources for female veterans  Increase the visibility of experiences of and services for female veterans  Facilitate continuity of learned coping strategies post-discharge  Implement and evaluate family friendly practices  Provide training to civilian health care providers on issues for female veterans  Develop best practice guidelines for the treatment and care of female veterans  Set a strategic research agenda on female veterans' health We found these recommendations to be consistent with our recommendations, but I would like to stress that the care of female veterans does require a special effort. Hence the Crompvoets recommendation that there be targeted support, and resourcing is particularly important. The other area that the report touches on is the cultural issues in mental health. I have personally been made aware of problems faced by service personnel in coming to terms with their incapacity, particularly in cases of post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental illness. Despite efforts, this is in part caused by the continuing culture of stigmatisation and shame in the ADF. As stated in the report, we were impressed by the work that General Cantwell and organisations such as Soldier On and Young Diggers are doing in terms of changing this culture. It is an area where ADF and the department do need to continue to focus their efforts. Despite the fact that there are a number of programs in place, there is still the issue of stigmatisation and shame and, as a result of that, individuals and returning soldiers are ignoring the signs of mental health issues and other injuries. The report also focuses on the need for early recognition of mental health problems, because they do take time to be identified and diagnosed. Usually it is the families-the wives, the girlfriends, the children, the partners-who are on the frontline of those issues and who bear the brunt of them even before diagnosis. My father-in-law did two tours of Vietnam and my mother-in-law always said that the man who returned was very different to the man she married. Since Vietnam the issue of PTSD has become an increasing area of focus and attention, but now that we are aware of its symptoms and how it can emerge through alcoholism, domestic violence, depression and other mechanisms there can no longer be any excuses for us not knowing or treating it appropriately. The report also highlights the post-service life adjustment and how hard it is for a wounded or injured soldier to adjust from being a highly skilled member of a professional force-a warrior, so to speak-to a seemingly constrained civilian. The inquiry has grappled with this issue. We have highlighted the need for greater continuity in the transition from Defence to Veterans' Affairs and we have recommended expediting or streamlining information technology connectivity and a unique service veteran health ID number. That is extremely important and it is a theme that ran through a number of the presentations in the hearings. DVA still faces dissatisfaction from the veteran community, although we found the department is doing much to improve client service, particularly in having a single point of contact for case management, moving to a single electronic claim process, and free treatment for PTSD, depression and anxiety. We have recommended that the department try to be less prescriptive, as well as monitoring its performance through periodic publication of claim processing times and claim success rates. This will need constant attention, but I hope the work of the committee will help to bring about improvements and make for better lives for our service people and their families after suffering physical or mental injury. I am very proud to be associated with this report. I know everyone on the committee has had discussions with returning soldiers who have been injured or are suffering mental health issues. It is good to have all this consolidated in one report and to take a comprehensive and forensic approach to reviewing the existing treatment to highlight the gaps and then to work out how to make improvements. It is a report that brings together a very great number of issues and makes a serious attempt to find solutions. I would like to commend the Chair of the Defence Sub-Committee, Senator Mark Furner, for his great contribution, and the secretariat for their invaluable work. Debate adjourned. Sitting suspended from 13:14 to 16:00 Gambling Reform Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. Ms BRODTMANN (Canberra) (16:00): As the deputy chair of the parliamentary Joint Select Committee on Gambling Reform, it is a pleasure to speak on the tabling of the committee's sixth and final report. This report covered the remaining bills referred to the inquiry: the Poker Machine Harm Reduction ($1 Bets And Other Measures) Bill 2012, the Anti-Money Laundering Amendment (Gaming Machine Venues) Bill 2012 and the Interactive Gambling Amendment (Virtual Credits) Bill 2013. I take this opportunity to put on the record the government's work in this area during the life of the committee. The government is committed to addressing problem gambling and it has taken a number of steps to progress reform in this area. In November 2008, the government asked the Productivity Commission to inquire into problem gambling in Australia. The report was presented in February 2010. The COAG Select Council On Gambling Reform was established in 2010 to develop a national response to the findings and recommendations of the Productivity Commission report. In May 2011, the select council agreed that pre-commitment is a useful tool to help people set limits on how much they want to spend on poker machines and it was agreed to support the required infrastructure for pre-commitment technology in all jurisdictions. Building on this agreement, there was consultation with stakeholders, including consultation on an exposure draft of the national gambling reform legislation. In January 2012, the government outlined its approach to helping Australians affected by problem gambling. The National Gambling Reform Act 2012 is the first time the federal government has legislated to address problem gambling. New poker machines will be capable of precommitment technology and eventually all poker machines must be part of a state-linked precommitment system but smaller venues will have additional time for implementation. The government also announced the development of electronic warnings and cost of play displays on poker machines, a $250 a day ATM withdraw limit from ATMs in gambling venuesexcluding casinos-and additional counselling support. Self-exclusion arrangements will also be strengthened and there will be improved training for staff in venues. The government committed to and has been working on a large scale trial of mandatory pre-commitment in the ACT. Clubs ACT has decided to postpone the trial until after the federal election, but work continues on optimum trial design and trial preparation. The committee's third report covered the area of prevention and treatment of problem gambling. The committee made a number of suggestions to improve the messages in social marketing initiatives, including campaigns and education initiatives to address stigma and stereotypes. I note the government is conducting a trial project which aims to reduce the stigma of problem gambling by supporting former problem gamblers, or people affected by problem gambling, to talk about their experiences at community awareness sessions. Findings from this project will be used to further explore the consequences and causes of stigma and how this can be reduced or mitigated. In the area of online gambling, the government has undertaken a review of the Interactive Gambling Act 2001. The final report was released in March and the Minister for Broadband Communications and the Digital Economy announced that the government would work with states and territories to implement a national harm minimisation and consumer protection standard for all licensed online gambling activities. In consultation with states and territories, the government continues to further examine the recommendations of the review with respect to enforcement and deterrence, advertising, education and awareness and social media. The recently tabled report, on the promotion of sports betting, recognised the level of community concern on this issue. There is a great level of community concern on this issue. The government has listened to the concern and in May the Prime Minister announced that live odds would be banned during the broadcast of live sports matches and generic gambling advertisements would be banned during play. The government has also taken steps to safeguard the integrity of sport by establishing the National Integrity of Sport Unit to work with stakeholders to ensure a national approach to regulation and to prevent match fixing through education programs. The committee heard during its inquiries about the need for more targeted and coordinated research. The national gambling reform act 2012 established the Australian Gambling Research Centre to enhance national gambling research. I very much welcome that initiative. The centre begins in July and will be located within the Australian Institute of Family Studies. The government has indicated that areas identified by the committee as requiring further research will inform consideration of the centre's work agenda. It has been a privilege to be deputy chair of this committee and to see the tabling of its final report. I thank the member for Denison for very capably chairing the committee. I thank my fellow committee members and I would particularly like to thank the secretariat, who did excellent work and often in very short time frames. I would like to thanks and commend Lyn Beverley. I commend the report to the House. (Extension of time granted.) It was an incredibly enjoyable journey being on this committee as deputy chair. At really highlighted to me the fact that there are significant issues with problem gambling in the community. We heard throughout the course of my time on the committee about people who are suffering significant economic hardship, people whose marriages have broken down, people who had lost their homes, people who had lost custody of their children and people who were experiencing significant hardship as a result of gambling addiction. It really underscored to me the fact that there is a problem in the community and that we need to do something to address it. We as a government have engaged in a number of initiatives to address it through a number of mechanisms, most recently in the sports betting area. I know that all of us here will have received an enormous amount of emails and other feedback from the community about how people were greatly offended by the intrusion into the pleasure of sport that came with live odds betting and sports-betting advertisements. It was a tsunami in many ways. There is no way that you could miss it when you were watching sport on a Saturday afternoon. There was, rightly, an outcry amongst the community and we as a government responded to that outcry. For me, one of the most rewarding elements of being on this committee as deputy chair was the fact that we managed to take a close look at the research in the field and it highlighted a number of gaps in the gambling arena. First off, gambling is not actually recognised as an area for research under the NHMRC grants criteria, which makes it difficult for researchers who want to enhance our understanding of the issues associated with problem gambling and its impacts. It is difficult for them to gain an understanding if they cannot get grants. I really welcome the government's initiative to establish the research centre. That will ensure that we gain a greater understanding of these problems and through that gain a greater evidence base. Our response can then be based on what is actually happening in the community rather than on small pockets of research. It has been an incredibly rewarding experience and it has highlighted for me that the research is a real soft spot. I welcome the fact that we have established this centre and I look forward to hearing of the research that emanates from it in a range of areas, including the problem gambling area-the impact of sports betting advertising, of poker machines and a whole range of gambling components which impact on the community, particularly on children. One of the areas that was highlighted was the potential impact on children of sports betting advertising and gambling advertising in the community. Research was one of the areas which I was particularly pleased with, with the gaps that were highlighted. Our hearings and the inquiries highlighted these gaps, and as a result we did not have a strong evidence base on which we could develop appropriate policy reactions. I believe that the policy reactions we have developed have been appropriate, but it would be helpful to have that very strong evidence base moving forward in our response as public policymakers to this issue which is a concern to the broader community. I would particularly like to thank the committee which worked on this. It was a committee of very colourful characters with very passionate views. Senator Xenophon is well known as a very strong advocate of this issue and he has been a long-time advocate. It was a pleasure to work with him. He is so knowledgeable in this arena and so passionate about the issue, as is the member for Denison, Mr Wilkie. They are both very committed to eliminating problem gambling in the community, establishing the right policy reactions and frameworks and establishing the right research evidence base to address those issues. I would also like to thank Senator Madigan, who also added a great deal to the committee with his observations, as well as those from the other side of the chamber. Generally we had a bipartisan approach to the issues and a bipartisan concern. While we had differing reactions to the responses to those issues that were highlighted in the inquiries, I believe that we all went into the inquiries and into closer examinations with a strong will to improve the situation and to ensure that we can, as far as possible, eliminate problem gambling in the community. It is a significant problem in the community. We heard from people who have been very badly damaged physically, economically, socially and emotionally, and it is very important that as policymakers we establish as many mechanisms as possible to ensure that these people are protected in the future, as well as children. There are pockets of evidence where research is being done-and I commend those who are conducting the research-which show that children are engaging in gambling, particularly sports gambling, at a very young age. We have all heard stories from nieces and nephews or sons and daughters recounting to us the odds of a particular game that is taking place. Rather than sitting and enjoying the game, they are recounting the odds for who will win and who will not win. We cannot allow that sort of culture to grow. That is why I really welcome the initiatives that the government has introduced on the sports betting front. I commend the report to the House. I enjoyed the opportunity to be the deputy chair of this committee and I look forward to hearing the response of the community to this report, which is comprehensive. Debate adjourned. Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Joint Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. Ms VAMVAKINOU (Calwell) (16:14): It is a great pleasure to have the opportunity today to speak to the report following the recent inquiry conducted by the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, entitled Trading lives: modern day human trafficking. The inquiry gave the committee an opportunity to look at some very serious issues pertaining to the trafficking of human beings on a global level. This report comes at a time when the movement of people around the world has never been greater and the need to do more in eliminating forced labour, slavery and trafficking from global supply chains has never been more pressing. The report's findings are timely and very, very important. The report has delivered eight recommendations, and those recommendations are indeed a fair reflection of the submissions that were made to the inquiry. There were some 82 submissions made to the inquiry, and the recommendations are a genuine response to the issues raised in those 82 submissions and, of course, the subsequent 10 public hearings that were conducted. All the recommendations were supported by members of the committee. I support all the recommendations, and today I want to speak particularly to recommendation 7, under the heading 'Exploitation in the supply chain'. This recommendation recommends that the Australian government investigate antitrafficking and antislavery mechanisms appropriate for Australia, with a view to creating a greater awareness of forced labour in the global supply chains. It is the one, as I said, that I want to speak to today, because in many ways it reflects the efforts made by people in the community, including those in my own local community, and the lobbying I received from them on this issue. There are an estimated 20 million victims of forced labour globally, and the annual profit made from these victims is estimated to be some $32 million. So it is quite clear that more needs to be done in our community both at home and abroad to raise awareness of this issue, because this issue of forced labour is one that can be best and only described as a stain on humanity. It has been due to the efforts of long-serving community members in my electorate and in the broader NGO community who have lobbied government endlessly and relentlessly to ensure that a call for action on human trafficking remains at the centre of the political debate. Many of these advocates are in my home state of Victoria and I am very pleased, as I am sure they will be pleased, with the committee's overall findings and, in particular, with recommendation 7. Recommendation 7, as I said, recommends that the Australian government, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, undertake a review to establish antitrafficking and antislavery mechanisms appropriate for the Australian context. The review should be conducted with a view to introducing legislation to improve transparency in the supply chains, the development of a labelling and certification strategy for products and services that have been produced ethically, and increasing the prominence of fair trade in Australia. Recently, I met with members of 11 churches from my local community, and I want to name them because this was a very important meeting. They were members from the Broadmeadows Uniting Church, the Broadmeadows/Dallas Anglican Church, St Mary's Anglican Church in Sunbury, Hume Anglican parish, the Sunbury Baptist Church, the Salvation Army Craigieburn Corps, the Providence Road Uniting Church, the Gladstone Uniting Church, the Holy Child Catholic Church, the Sunbury Uniting Church, the Craigieburn Uniting Church. Reverend Peter Weeks and Dr Mark Zirnsak, who is the Director of the Justice and International Mission Unit Synod of Victoria and Tasmania, were present as well. The group met in my office to present me with postcards that are part of a campaign aimed at stopping the slave labour that is going on in the world at the moment. The campaign is urging action, particularly action that requires companies to ensure that goods imported into Australia are free from slavery and human trafficking. The group has been advocating government to ensure that the government commission its own research to identify goods being imported into Australia where there are significant risks of slavery, forced labour, trafficked labour or, worse of all, child labour. All of this should be identified, isolated and targeted in the global supply chain. The group's campaign calls for the establishment of a working group, with representatives from government, law enforcement, businesses, NGOs and academics, to identify measures for businesses to take to ensure that their supply chains are clean of slavery, forced labour, trafficked labour and child labour. The campaign also calls for the introduction of legislation requiring companies to report on what steps they are taking to mitigate the risks of slavery, forced labour, trafficked labour and child labour. The campaign also seeks the amendment of the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 and the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines to require suppliers to government to have to provide a written assurance that they have taken all reasonable steps to ensure their supply chain is free of slavery, forced labour, trafficked labour and child labour. My meeting with the local churches showed overwhelming support for federal government action requiring both the private and public sectors to make sure that products imported into Australia do not make profit from slavery and human trafficking. The group presented me with a postcard campaign. It is called 'Stop the Traffik: Slavery Free Guarantee'. Their aim is to get as many of these postcards as they can to us here in the parliament and the government. If sweatshops can exist in Australia, underpaying workers and keeping them in substandard conditions, it is not difficult to imagine people in the world's poorest countries being most inhumanely cheated and exploited, used as child labour and, worse of all, held in bondage. The Uniting Church's Justice and International Mission Unit director, Dr Mark Zirnsak, told us at that meeting that he had received research which was conducted by the US Department of Labor and United Nations agencies that had identified goods coming into Australia from countries where slavery and human trafficking was involved. Dr Zirnsak has indicated: What we do know is that the production of agricultural goods is where slavery is most strong. He has said: Cotton production, palm oil, also bricks and pavers, quarrying out of India, coltrane from the Congo that goes into mobile phones – all use bonded labour … Dr Zirnsak has also indicated: With Uzbekistan cotton, between one and two million people are forced into labour … That is an occurrence on a mass scale and one that we need to be very concerned about. Dr Zirnsak and the group that met with me were deeply concerned that, at this stage, no government efforts were being made to identify Australian companies importing goods or services that involve bonded labour or slavery. He also suggested that Australia was lagging behind other developed nations, most notably the United States, in applying pressure on companies to ensure that goods they import or sell are free from slavery and human trafficking. The group has called, quite strongly, for a slavery-free guarantee system that is similar to Fairtrade. This report addresses a lot of the concerns that were raised with me. I have received many of those postcards, and I will be endeavouring to present them to the Attorney-General, the Hon. Mark Dreyfus. In conclusion, there is another group that I want to pay tribute to. It is a group that I have had a long standing association with. It is ACRATH, Australian Catholic Religious Against Trafficking in Humans. This group is endorsed by Catholic Religious Australia, which is the peak body of 190 religious orders in Australia, representing 800 religious sisters, brothers and priests. For the past I do not know how many years that I have been up in this place, I haveAn honourable member: You know! Ms VAMVAKINOU: I know. I have been visited by a wonderful group of women, predominantly nuns from ACRATH. These women are absolutely, totally dedicated to advocating on behalf of those women and children, in particular, who are victims of slavery and child labour. I would like to name them individually because every year they are up here and they deserve to be commended for the efforts that they make. I would like to commend the work of Ann Tormey, Brianna Lee, Carol Hogan, Carole McDonald, Denise Mulcahy, Genny Ryan, Janine Bliss, Jennifer Bird, Diane Kennedy, Marie Marsh, Margaret Ng, Therese Power, Christine Carolan and Louise Cleary, who is the National Chair of ACRATH. I want to commend them because they come up here each year to convey their anti-human-trafficking messages to members of parliament and also to ministers and shadow ministers. The women, who are the Catholic sisters and their colleagues, are all members of this organisation and they come up here to ever-so-gently lobby for government to act in righting the terrible and inhumane wrongs committed against vulnerable people-women and children in particular. They met with ministers and policymakers and, over the years of their advocacy, they have managed to achieve many changes. It is to their credit that they have been able to make significant changes. They were involved in a public hearing in Melbourne in May this year, and it is quite apt that I quote the chair of the foreign affairs subcommittee, the Hon. Laurie Ferguson, who congratulated ACRATH on its activities, saying that he thought that ACRATH was 'the main group' of this inquiry that led the committee to holding this inquiry, based, as he said, on and your lobbying'. So the chair of the human rights subcommittee commended them and also referred to them as being the essence that inspired this inquiry. I would like to thank them and also thank members of my own community who are lobbying me, and I would also like to thank Dr Mark Zirnsak for the work that he does in making sure that we never forget that we live in a world where profits are made on the back of slavery, especially that of young children and women, and it is our responsibility as policymakers to do whatever we can, through legislation if necessary, to protect the vulnerable both here in this country and also internationally. I commend the report to the House. Debate adjourned. Health and Ageing Committee Report Debate resumed on the motion: That the House take note of the report. on the inquiry into dementia; early diagnosis and intervention, by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. It is one of the best written reports that I have read in a long time. As a committee member, I am proud to be associated with the detail of the report that very accurately reflects many of the views and perspectives and the work that is being done within Australia with respect to finding not only a cure for, or a slowing down of, dementia, but also the identification of the early diagnostic elements that will enable medical advice and support to come at a much earlier point. The other thing that was important in all of this was the passion of all of those who were involved in the delivery of services and programs on the ground and I know that my colleagues who are speaking on this standing committee report will reflect much of the detail that represents the way in which we approach the issue and the way in which the committee reported on the breadth of the problem and the focused work that is occurring. colleagues on both sides of the House for ensuring that changes were made so that people could speak on this particular report. I would also like to acknowledge: the deputy chair of the health and ageing committee who worked on this report, the member for Swan; the chair of the committee, who was here a moment ago; and the other members of the committee-the member for Hasluck and the member for Bass. They have all been members of the committee and contributed to this report. It gives me great pleasure to speak about this report on the early diagnosis of and intervention on dementia, titled Thinking ahead. This report is relevant to all of Australia but particularly in my electorate as one of the oldest in the country, with almost 20 per cent of people over the age of 65. It has one of the highest rates of people diagnosed with dementia in the country. I have heard countless tales from families and constituents of my electorate first hand about the devastation it can cause in our community. We on the inquiry when we travelled to most major cities and all around the country also heard first hand from different communities about dementia and the devastation it can cause. This inquiry and report before us make it quite clear that there needs to be greater awareness of dementia and that more action towards a dementia-friendly future needs to be taken. We know that one of the most important things that we can do to combat severe dementia is ensure that patients are diagnosed in a timely manner. With early detection the quality of life for people with dementia as well as for their family and carers is often dramatically increased. We heard this during the inquiry. People, for example, when diagnosed in a timely manner can put their affairs in place and work out the future because they still have the capacity to do so. With early detection the quality of life of people with dementia as well as their families and carers, as I said, is often dramatically increased. It gives",176,Committees

233,Mr Georganas (Hindmarsh,"Second Deputy Speaker) (16:30): I thank myfamilies that opportunity to make plans and arrangements for the future, something that we can all appreciate is incredibly difficult for all involved. As elegantly stated by the chair of the committee, the member for Shortland, a very effective way to promote early diagnosis is to promote greater awareness of dementia. This is so very true and so very important. We heard this evidence and had this advice given to us at every stage of the inquiry-that early diagnosis is so important. An effective way to promote early diagnosis is to promote greater awareness of dementia. If we do this, we can ensure that friends and relatives recognise those very early signs. This will help to promote a dementiafriendly society. We heard that when people see those early signs and talk to their GPs very often it is just brushed aside as 'getting older' and that as you get older you forget things. But these are signs and we need to ensure that GPs and other people in health services are well aware of the early signs. A dementia-friendly community involves taking an holistic approach to care, support and treatment. It is all about, as I said, educating not just GPs but the health industry, the community sector and support groups so as to enable them to better care for people with dementia and provide assistance to their carers. It is all about ensuring that the community continues to value Australians with dementia as well. One of the greatest barriers to improving outcomes for patients remains that stigma that is still attached and that many feel when discussing dementia with their families and friends. In fact, we heard evidence that even GPs associate with that stigma and will sometimes just brush symptoms aside as someone getting older or forgetful, without really looking deeper into the symptoms that patients present with. That means that many people do not seek early treatment from health professionals and end up with outcomes much worse than if they had. Another common barrier is that many people still believe that dementia is just a natural part of the ageing process. As a result, they do not discuss their dementia with their doctor, their family or their friends. Vice versa, their family and friends do not discuss it with them or with other health professionals since they do not believe anything can be done to delay the onset or to slow the progression of this disease. In its report, the committee has also called for a national awareness campaign aimed at dispelling the myths about dementia, ensuring that people recognise the symptoms of dementia and encouraging people experiencing those symptoms to seek a full assessment. There are assessments which can be done to determine whether someone is suffering from signs of early onset dementia. If we can achieve this timely diagnosis of dementia and provide people with the necessary tools, skills, treatment and support, we will go a long way towards improving the quality of life for many older Australians. During the inquiry, we travelled to different parts of the nation. At one point the committee visited a place called Norman House in my electorate of Hindmarsh. Norman House is a day care centre for people who suffer from dementia. Ms Hall: A fantastic facility! facilities I have seen. It helps people to continue within a community group while giving their families the respite they require. We saw their activities-people meeting, cooking, eating and drinking in a normal household environment.",185,Acrath S Activities And He Noted Your Appearance Before The Committee At Various Stages
234,Mr Georganas,"It is a fantastic facility. It is at the cutting edge and is one of the bestI was also lucky enough, a few months ago whilst we were still conducting the inquiry, to be invited by ECH to open Seasiders in Laidlaw Street, Henley Beach, which is also in my electorate. Seasiders is another great facility catering for people who have early onset dementia. It provides everything from physiotherapy to community activities in which families can participate. We saw many of these facilities around the country. One that comes to mind was in the member for Shortland's electorate. Ms Hall: East Lake Macquarie Dementia Service. conducted a public hearing of the inquiry at that facility as part of our visit there. The number of Australians with dementia will quadruple by 2050. That will be a large number of Australians with this disease. This inquiry has made recommendations which should be implemented by governments-both current and future governments-to ensure we have in place the facilities and services we need to deal with the growing number of people with dementia. I commend this report to the House. dementia: early diagnosis and intervention is the culmination of 15 months work by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing. We have just heard from the previous chair, the member for Hindmarsh. I thank him as well as the chair and the other committee members who worked on this report and who have helped make sure that this was a memorable report. It is a report which I think will go a long way towards assisting those who suffer the symptoms of early onset Alzheimer's. This is the ninth report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing to be tabled in this 43rd Parliament. As this will be the final opportunity to speak on matters pertaining to that committee in the 43rd Parliament, I will, before moving on to the body of the report, make a general point regarding the status of those reports. Members would be aware that one of the key roles of committees is not only to investigate and report on matters but also to put recommendations to the government of the day. It is the duty of the government of the day to provide a response to reports that contain recommendations within a six-month time frame. Of the nine inquiry reports handed down by the health and ageing committee during the 43rd Parliament, this is the seventh that requires a government response to its recommendations. However, unfortunately, to date the government has not responded to any of these reports tabled by the committee over the last three years. Three of these reports in particular are well beyond the six-month time frame, with the youth suicide report the most outstanding. That was a report that I initiated and it was tabled on 4 July 2011. Having taken a particular interest in the youth suicide report on behalf of the youth suicide charity Youth Focus, in my electorate of Swan, I am particularly keen to see these recommendations considered and responded to. A two-year delay is not good enough. I am, as I know the member for Shortland is, a supporter of the committee system operated by the parliament. Since 2010, members of the health and ageing committee have completed reports containing 107 recommendations to the government. These reports include ones on early intervention programs aimed at preventing youth suicide, registration processes and support for overseas trained doctors, a round table on polio and postpolio syndrome, adhesive",186,Acrath S Activities And He Noted Your Appearance Before The Committee At Various Stages

236,Mr Irons (Swan) (16:38,"The report Thinking ahead: report on the inquiry intoarachnoiditis, health issues across international borders, adult dental services and, today, early diagnosis and intervention in dementia. As I often mention when we table these reports, members of the public invest their time and themselves in the process and sometimes the testimonies take great personal courage. These people deserve prompt responses from the government of the day to the effort they have made to contribute to these reports. As a deputy chair I receive many emails and calls from participants, particularly in relation to the overseas trained doctors inquiry, the arachnoiditis round table report and the youth suicide report, inquiring as to when the government will respond. I am sure that the chair receives these phone calls also; during discussion with her, she has also indicated her disappointment at the lack of response by the government of the day. I am sure the chair shares my frustration. I ask that she do all she can to secure responses from the government to the outstanding inquiries and reports before this parliament ends. One of the great elements of these committees is that much of the work that is conducted is conducted in a bipartisan spirit, and I know that the member for Shortland, who is the chair, and all the members of the committee are concerned only for the work and the recommendations this committee has produced. I understand the need for the government to thoroughly consider these reports, but the government should really be doing better and I want to take this opportunity today to publicly state my concern in the House. Having done that, I now turn to the report before the House-the report on dementia. This report has 17 recommendations for consideration by the government and I can say at the outset that I was particularly pleased to focus on this area, given my interest in the aged-care system in general. It is fair to say that many of the issues around dementia do feed into the aged-care system eventually. I have significant aged-care facilities in my electorate of Swan and have held many events there over previous years around the subject of the aged-care crisis. This issue, once again, has the implications of a major problem which I do not believe has been adequately addressed by the government in the parliament. As the chair said, Australia's population is ageing, and over the next 20 years the number of people with dementia is predicted to more than double. Most members know someone who has suffered or is suffering from dementia. My mother, as we started work on this report, was placed in a dementia ward in Croydon in Victoria and is being very well looked after in that facility-but, as I said, this is an affliction or condition that many people are affected by, and many people in this place would know someone who has been affected by dementia. To give some idea of the extent of the issue, it is estimated by Deloitte Access Economics that there were 266,574 people with dementia in 2011 and, assuming no change in the medications available to treat dementia, this number is projected to increase to 553,285 people by 2030 and almost 1,000,000 by 2050. So we need to do two things: we need to invest in the medical sciences, to give the scientists the best chance of finding ways to delay the onset of this disease and, ultimately, to prevent it entirely-and in my speech yesterday I spoke about the work of Professor Martins from Edith Cowan University in Perth-and we need to plan to manage this disease into the future. That is what this inquiry was all about. The terms of reference for the inquiry asked the committee to inquire into the early diagnosis and intervention aspects of dementia, with a particular focus on how that can:  improve quality of life and assist people with dementia to remain independent for as long as possible;  increase opportunities for continued social engagement and community participation for people with dementia;  help people with dementia and their carers to plan for their futures, including organising financial and legal affairs and preparing for longer-term or more intensive care requirements; and  how best to deliver awareness and communication on dementia and dementia-related services into the community. In response, the committee has endorsed 17 recommendations, and I want to go into some more detail on the issues of awareness and postdiagnosis in particular here today. It is obviously extremely important, if we are going to secure more early diagnoses, that people are made aware of the signs at the earliest stage. It is not just the awareness of friends and family that we need to focus on. One of the biggest problems and barriers to early intervention is that patients do not want to admit that they have a problem in the first instance and they avoid seeing their GP. That is obviously an extremely difficult time for anyone with dementia, and I am sure that members will have stories of people they know who are struggling with and, in some cases, resisting the realisation that they may have some form of dementia. This is perpetuated by the misconception that there is nothing that can be done to delay the onset or to assist with the symptoms of dementia, but this is not the case. Although the report did not go deep into much of the science surrounding the benefits of early diagnosis, it was generally agreed at a broad level that early intervention had a number of clinical benefits in addition to non-clinical benefits. The Australian General Practice Network gave evidence that these benefits included the potential to:  treat the reversible causes of dementia  help slow the progression of dementia through pharmaceutical and lifestyle interventions  support symptom management through pharmaceutical and lifestyle interventions (many of which are likely to be more effective earlier in the course of disease progression) and minimise the impact of symptoms, for example through the establishment of routines that can help patients and families manage declining cognitive function. If we can get the message out that treatment and early intervention makes a big difference in terms of clinical outcomes to the quality of life, then this might make it significantly easier for patients to come forward. But we also need to factor GPs into this equation, as evidence given to the committee suggested that some GPs are unaware of some of the clinical benefits of early intervention. Mrs Fiona Young, a clinical nurse consultant in Tasmania, said in her evidence: For health professionals there needs to be awareness too. We cannot assume that because people are health professionals they have a good understanding of dementia because it is a specialised area. Mr Jack Sach of Alzheimer's Australia Victoria told the committee that dementia was often not well recognised by GPs due to a lack of training, saying: Many GPs are not well trained in the application of cognitive screens such as the mini-mental and so forth. Many GPs have difficulty just keeping pace with the latest science in this area, which is very, very rapid at the moment. Some GPs may be reluctant to refer to specialists, hence there is misdiagnosis occurring. Many GPs do not fully appreciate the services that are available and therefore do not refer on. On the question of awareness, a key part of early diagnosis, the committee focused its recommendations not only on the need for the Department of Health and Ageing to engage in a general awareness campaign but also on the need for the development of a national evidence-based dementia training program for GPs with an emphasis on early diagnosis. The second set of issues considered in this report that I wanted to make a comment on is around the question of postdiagnosis. One theme that came through strongly was that doctors tend to provide much of the information to the patients on management of dementia at the time of diagnosis. This is a difficult time for a couple of reasons, the first being that most patients are obviously fairly distressed at receiving the news and are not in the best position to be thinking abut treatment options. The second reason is explained in the CDAMS submission: with earlier diagnosis, clients and families are often not ready for or in need of services at the point of diagnosis. They tend to manage initially and, apart from some contact with their GP, are not connected to the service system. Information, provided at the time of diagnosis about available supports and contacts, can be lost at this time and they often remain outside the service system until a crisis occurs. One way of potentially addressing this issue is a series of guidelines for referral, which was the subject of recommendation 10, and there may be some role for the Department of Health and Ageing here. Recommendation 11 goes on to suggest that: The Australian Government establish clear and streamlined local referral pathways for dementia diagnosis, treatment and support, through Medicare Locals, localised primary health networks or other specialist dementia networks such as memory clinics. This was taken a step further with consideration of a potential dementia link-worker program-the idea being that a key worker assist to manage an individual patient's case and link them in with the appropriate services. This is an idea that has been seriously advocated by the Alzheimer's Association, and their CEO, Mr Glenn Ross, put this case to the committee. There was a suggestion that such a program could be linked to any federal agedcare legislation and delivered by existing aged-care provider organisations or community organisations such as Alzheimer's Australia or Medicare Locals. There is no doubt that this would be a terrific initiative; however, with projections that over half a million people will have dementia by 2030 in Australia, there will certainly be some logistical issues to consider. The committee has therefore recommended that the Department of Health and Ageing examine the case for establishing a dementia link worker program to assist in the ongoing case management of people with dementia and their carers. In conclusion, this report is one that I think the committee should be proud of and I would like to thank all my fellow committee members. One of the things that came out of the report, which I have not mentioned in my speech was stigma, which the member for Hindmarsh mentioned. A lot of people are afraid of the diagnosis because of the stigma that is perceived to be attached to having Alzheimer's or dementia. In some of the inquiry hearings we heard that some people were more afraid of being diagnosed with Alzheimer's or dementia than they were of death, which is a horrible way to look at things because we have moved on with the ability to help and treat these people and given them a better pathway and a better life after diagnosis. As well, one of the areas that I have not touched on is the problem as to financial assistance or legal obligations for people who are diagnosed, making sure that their carers and/or their families are made aware of all of the potential issues that come with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's in that some people have been the subject of what was probably some unscrupulous carers in the area. I am sure that we would like to make sure that that does not occur too often. Again, I would like to thank the committee and I look forward to the next parliament and working on the committee again with my fellow committee members. I commend the report to the House. Representatives Standing Committee on Health and Ageing on dementia. Alzheimer's Australia state there are over 320,000 Australians living with dementia and: This number is expected to increase by one third to 400,000 in less than ten years … Without a medical breakthrough, the number of people with dementia is expected to be almost 900,000 by 2050. Dementia is a leading cause of death in Australia. In 2010, the most recent year for which the data is available, it was the third most common cause of death. Dementia is not a single condition, rather it is an umbrella term that encompasses a range of conditions that affect memory, thinking, behaviour and ability to perform everyday tasks. Characteristics of dementia involve impairment of brain functions, including speech, memory, perception, personality and cognitive skills. Its onset is typically gradual and progressive-in that as the condition develops, the patient deteriorates and it is irreversible. For the majority of people with dementia, assistance will eventually be required for activities such as making decisions, managing relationships, coping with feelings or emotions, and undertaking cognitive or emotional tasks. Although dementia occurs more commonly in older people, contrary to popular belief it is not an inevitable or 'normal' part of the ageing process. Dementia has wide-ranging implications for carers, families and friends of people living with the condition. In my home state of Tasmania, the Wicking Dementia Research and Education Centre is at the forefront of research and support for individuals, their families and carers. The Wicking centre is the largest health research group in Tasmania. The success of the Wicking Dementia Research Network, funded initially in 2010 by the UTAS Community Engagement fund, has created greater connectivity between dementia service providers and researchers. I was most pleased to show the Hon. Mark Butler, the Minister for Ageing, the great work they are doing last year when he visited my electorate of Bass. It is critical that we support the development of a highly educated and skilled workforce and attractive career paths in aged care. Having a skilled workforce is particularly important as the ageing of our population is changing the face of care. Care needs are becoming more complex as people live longer and require care associated with dementia, diabetes and other chronic diseases. These mentor-based clinical placements integrate theory and practice and ensure that the future aged-care, health and medical workforce is equipped with the skills and knowledge to meet the care needs of Tasmania's growing ageing population. Masonic Peace Haven aged-care facility in my electorate of Bass has been closely involved in this program, and I believe it has been a valuable teaching tool for students. I thank the committee for the opportunity to chair our meeting in Launceston.",187,Acrath S Activities And He Noted Your Appearance Before The Committee At Various Stages
237,Mr Lyons (Bass) (16:53,"I rise to add my remarks on the report by the House ofDementia can happen to anybody, but it is more common in those over the age of 65 years. It is essential that a medical diagnosis is obtained at an early stage when symptoms first appear to ensure that a person who has a treatable condition is diagnosed and treated correctly. If the symptoms are caused by dementia, an early diagnosis will mean early access to support, information and medication and preparations for the rest of their life. At present there is no prevention or cure for most forms of dementia. However, some medications have been found to reduce some symptoms. In Launceston we received evidence that shunting-removing fluid-does assist some people. Support is vital for people with dementia and the help of families, friends and carers can make a positive difference in managing the condition. I wish to place on record my thanks to the late Hazel Hawke, who worked to raise the profile of dementia and the importance of investment in research to improve the quality of dementia care. As Ita Buttrose, President of Alzheimer's Australia, has said, her courage has left a lasting legacy. I thank the secretariat and those who took part in this inquiry, particularly those in my electorate who gave evidence when the committee went to Launceston. This committee is a true reflection of the fact that most members come to this place to do the right thing by the people of Australia. Debate adjourned.
