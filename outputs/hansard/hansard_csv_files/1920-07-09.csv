That The Government Declined To Treat The Motion Of Which The Leader Of The Opposition Gave Notice Aa One Of Censure; Yet To","day it appears first on the business paper. I ask you, Mr Speaker, what is the reason for this? first on the business-pauer in accordance with established parliamentary usage, as stated in a ruling of the late Sir Frederick Holder on a similar occasion. On the 20th October, 1908, Mr Speaker Holder said-Hansard, vol. XLVTL, page 1301The motion to which the honourable member refers has been given precedence, not at the request of the Leader of the Opposition, or of the Government, or of any honourable member, but simply in accordance with invariable parliamentary custom in Great Britain, and which has certainly been-wheneve r such occasions have arisen-the practice of this House since its first meeting. When a notice of motion of censure or of no-confidence is given by the Leader of the Opposition, or with his concurrence or sanction, it is the practice to place it first on the business-paper foT the following day, but such a motion by a private member without the sanction of the Leader of the Opposition would be treated like any other notice of motion in arranging the business-paper. What has been done on this occasion is in accordance with established custom.

[11.4] I make no apology for asking the attention of the House to a matter which is of vital importance to all the industries of the Commonwealth. It is within the knowledge of those honourable gentlemen who are now trying to prevent me from speaking that at the present moment the coal-mining industry of Australia is threatened with an upheaval which would involve the country in immense loss. Honourable members interjectingtion of the House to the concerted interruption of the speech of the honourable member for Illawarra, and I ask that it may cease. It is impossible for me to hear a word of what the honourable member is saying. Honourable members should observe the Standing Orders, and allow the speech to be heard in silence. speech party that is interrupting. in this House a practice of interjecting immediately after Mr Speaker has called the House to order. Such an interjection is not only gravely discourteous to the Chair, but is also a breach of tiie Standing Orders, and an insult to the assembly itself. I ask honourable members to discontinue the practice. Standing Orders, only a brief time is allowed me for placing this matter before the House, and I have the right to expect that the members of the Opposition, who (Formal). particularly claim to represent the working classes, will allow me to speak without interruption. It is known to them, and to all who take an interest in the industrial welfare of the country, that there is the gravest reason to apprehend industrial trouble in the near future, unless prompt steps be taken to provide means . for settling disputes without resort to strikes.

As every trade unionist knowsj the majority of industrial troubles are due to the failure of the parties to point being that the honourable member is anticipating a motion already on the business-paper, which provides for the discussion, among other things, of the Government's failure to take steps to deal with the causes of industrial unrest, of which the unrest in the coal-mining industry is part. ber is quite in order. His motion, which relates to a specific matter, viz., ""the coalwhich exception was taken. mining industry,"" and is not general in its terms, covering any other matters, does not anticipate any other of which notice has been given. somewhat difficult to place before the House in their proper sequence the facts to which I wish to draw attention, because of the attitude of some honourable members toward me. I wish to draw attention more particularly to the dangers arising in the coal-mining industry, as in others, from the congestion of the Arbitration Court. Some, at least, of the most serious disputes that have occurred in thi.° country recently have been due to the failure of the Court to settle speedily the issues between the parties. Honourable members interjectingtake extreme steps, but if these interruptions continue I shall be obliged to take serious notice of them. the most serious disputes that have occurred in the Commonwealth of late have been due to the natural and justifiable feeling of trade unionists that the Arbitration Court does not afford' that speedy means of settling disputes that was intended when the Court was set up. I do not blame the Justices of the Court for this, because I recognise the difficulties under which they labour on account of the limitation of their powers by the Constitution. As we havefailed to secure from the people the right to extend the powers of the Court, it seems to, me that those who seek topromote industrial peace must now look for some other means of settling disputes. ber is doing some fine dirty work for the Government by staving off the motion of censure'. member for Darling to withdraw that remark. he has been put up for the especial purpose of preventing the discussion of the censure motion of which the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) has given notice. member to withdraw the expression to would rather have the censure motion, proceeded with. students of our industrial legislation must have the greatest sympathy with the Court because of the limitation of its powers,. but it is manifest that under present conditions some more speedy means of dealing with industrial troubles is needed to prevent them from reaching' the stage when they are beyond control.

Every one who regards the results of that departure from established custom must admit that it was for the benefit of the whole of the people of this country. On. a subsequent date, when the then Acting Prime Minister and! Treasurer ( Mr Watt) intervened in similar circumstances with a view to preventing Australia being thrown into the turmoil of a great industrial dispute during the war, there were considerable criticisms of his action; but I think time has shown that he did a service to the Commonwealth.

I stand by the action that the then Acting Prime .Minister took when he met the miners in conference and settled that dispute, and .so prevented others from being diverted from the work of prosecuting the war, which was then of supreme importance. To-day we see on every hand evidence that, unless some such effective action is taken by the Government, outside of any action which is possible to .the Arbitration Court in the present congested state of its business, and with itslimited powers, this, country may at any t day be plunged into another of those great industrial upheavals which cost the people such immense sums of money. estimate the losses to the working people of the Commonwealth due to industrial troubles that could have been cured had they been taken in hand at the proper time and in the proper way. Speaking with a long experience of these matters, I say it is the imperative duty of the Government immediately to take such steps as will enable the disaffected coal miners to place their case before an independent tribunal which has power to take the. steps necessary to effect a just and reasonable settlement of the questions at issue between the parties. I am reluctant to discuss the matter .as it affects the Arbitration Court to-day at any great length, nor is it necessary that I should do so, but I do ask that the Government may, at the earliest possible moment, provide for this industry a continuing tribunal which shall be able to take notice of troubles in their early stages, before they develop into tlm serious issues which they so rapidly become, and which shall be able to keep an -oversight of' the industry continuously, -occupying, as it were, the position of coning drastic should be done. ciliators, trying to bring the parties to .agreement in the early stages of the conflict. That, it. seems to me, is the prinin view of the wages they earn. I want cipal work of arbitration. We thought when the Conciliation and Arbitration -Court was established that conciliation would form the principal part of its work, but we have lived to see that, owing to the legal technicalities with which the Court is surrounded, and the limited powers it possesses, most of its time is devotedto matters remote from the issues that cause [109]-2 . industrial disputes. SoI hope that at this period the Ministry will immediately take into consideration a method of setting up a conciliation tribunal to deal with the coal-mining industry, and that, when that is dealt with, the principle may be extended to other of the larger industries of the Commonwealth, whose welfareis inextricably bound up with the industrial and commercial life 'of the community. It is quite true that the coal-mining industry is in a disturbed condition, and it is necessary, in the interests of the industrial life of Australia, that a tribunal should be granted to it. We all know that the Arbitration Court is so It is impossible to overcongested, that it is utterly impossible for it to deal with an industry like coal mining, which requires immediate action when disputes occur. If they are .allowed to remain in abeyance for any length of time they become magnified, and,, as a result, industrial trouble disastrous to the whole Commonwealth ensues. tion .Court congested? always appealed to the Federal Arbitration Court. They are an Inter-State body, because the ramifications of their union .extend -throughout Australia, and the industry affects all Australia. They, therefore, come within the purview of the Commonwealth Court. I understand that the Prime Minister intends to meet the representatives of both-parties during next week, with the object of granting a Commission to inquire into the existing dispute. The miners, who held aggregate meetings about a week ago, decided that, in view of the probability of this tribunal dealing with their case in the near future, nothThere is an impression abroad that the coal miners take undue action which is not justified to point out that the articles appearing in the Argus during the last day or two, written, I am convinced, by some one representing the coal-owners, are misleading. They do not convey to the public the true position.

The output is being increased, but handed men, with the earnings of men in other parts of the world, we find that their in keeping with what they are entitled increase is nothing like the increase obtained by the miners of Great Britain and elsewhere. The cost of our coal is lower than that of coal in any other part of the world, yet we are constantly told that we are increasing the price unnecessarily. The Minister for the Navy informed me recently that we paid £2 15s. per ton on board for the best Welsh coal for the use of our warships. We supply coal at Newcastle for 17s. 6d. a ton. If the people of Victoria are paying an exorbitant price, the increase must take place between the port of shipment and the delivery here. of coal in Victoria; it is the inability to get any. is a shortage here, and it is contended in the Argus articles that that shortage is due to the men not working. I can assure the House that during the currency of the war no men suffered more than the coal miners because of the irregularity of work. mentioned suggest that there were so many strikes and so many lost days in the year through the action of the men themselves. That is wrong. Whilst there may be a disturbance in one particular mine in the district it docs not affect the output of the coal unless there is a demand for the whole of the coal produced, and they are unable to meet the demand. We put large quantities of coal on the grass during -the war to find employment for men who were starving. bought the coal iu order to find work for men who were out of employment in consequence of the f oreign trade bein"" cut off during the war, and also because the ships formerly engaged in carrying eoal from Newcastle were taken off our coast. Yet we are asked to believe that the coal miners are responsible for the dearth in the supply of coal. As a matter of fact they are supplying more coal to-day than they did at any period during the war. 1 am glad to say that as great a percentage of miners went to the Front as of any other body of men in Australia. As those men come back, they are returning to their old occupation, and producing more the rate of wages they are receiving is not to in comparison with the high cost of living. While their wages went up 39 per cent, the cost of living has gone up by over 60 per cent. The labourer who works in the coal mine is getting 13s. 6d. per day, but he does not receive that' every day, although the public are led to believe that he does. He gets only pit time, and sometimes avi occasional day over pit time. has gone up from 12s. to 18s., or 50 per cent. coal went up during the war, and the wages of the miners went up accordingly, but our coal to-day is cheaper than any other. Latest newspapers from England show that Yorkshire coal for bunkers was selling as follows:-Screened, 80s. a ton; unscreened, 75s.; slack, 60s. Welsh coal for export was from 110s. to 112s. per ton for large, and 97s. 6d. for small. We sell the very best of ours for 17s. 6d. We sell what is called "" shandygaff,"" or unThe articles I have screened, for l is . or 12s. per ton; so that our commodity is produced very cheaply compared with what is charged in otlier parts of the world. prices at the pit's mouth? cutting off the export at Home at the present time because of the shortage. The main pivot of the present dispute here is the pay of the coal-mine labourer, although there are other claims which have ""The British Government to be settled between now and October. The labourers, as I said, get 13s. 6d. per day. At a recent conference in Sydney the owners promised to give them l is . 6d. Many people are under the impression that that would mean six days' work at 14s. 6d. a day. Let me show honourable members what the labourers have been earning during the last year or two. Prom 15th May, 1919, to23rd March, 1920, their wages were as follows:-A t Aberdare the number of days worked was 162-jr, and the men earned £109 17s. each for the year.

Those figures are vouched for as showing the exact amount of money that these men have l if t ed during recent years. The result is dissatisfaction; but can we expect anything else? Can men support families on such wages? Some action must be taken immediately. that, the men are responsible when a dislocation of industry takes place. They have given ample notice and have endeavoured, by conference, to have the whole matter adjusted. The off-hand men are asking for £ 1 per day, and in view of the present high cost of living that is little enough for them. average, during the year, only three or four days' work per week, and in that event w ill earn only £ 3 or £ 4 per week. sary to increase our own allowance. Musti t not be more necessary for them to obtain increased pay? of the high cost of commodities it is only fair that these men should be granted an increase. On different occasions in this House, when I have been dealing with the question of high prices, I have heard it said, "" What about the miners? Are they not exacting all they can from the public?"" I hope we shall not hear that statement repeated. The coal miners, during the war, behaved splendidly, and th© Prime Minister's action, at that time, in appointing a tribunal to settle their differences was quite justified. Since then the* cost of everything has increased. Miners' tools, for instance, cost to-day 120 per cent, more than they did before the war. been a big increase in the cost of extions in industrial organizations know plosives. over100 per cent, more than they did postpone definite action in the hope before the war. The same may be said that something w ill turn up to relieve the with regard to detonators and fuse. The position. When disappointment follows cost of everything used by' the miner has disappointment, the men ultimately beconsiderably increased. Many miners are come exasperated. Their patience gives paying, out of their wages, as much as out, and when that happens they get out £ 2 per fortnight in respect of their tools of control. No matter how anxious the ' and the union and other charges. more than they did before the war. war their outgoings in that respect probably amounted to about 10s. per fortnight. Costs have increased to such an extent as to amply justify the appointment of a tribunal before which the miners' grievances may be brought and adjusted. To leave the settlement of these differences to the ordinary routine It is not f a i r to say of the Arbitratio n Court would be very unsatisfactory. Both sides would welcome the appointment of a special t r i bunal for the industry, before which they could go from .time to time and state their grievances, so that on the evidence given a decision as to what was a fair thing could be arrived at. 'The miners They may themselves do not desire any dislocation of the trade and industry of the Commonwealth. They are most anxious that their disputes should be amicably settled, and there can be no doubt that they must be adjusted. The men cannot continue on a mere pittance, quite insufficient to support them and their families. If they cannot promptly obtain redress from us -Exactly. In view we must expect industrial trouble. From that there can be no escape. I hope therefore that the Prim© Minister w ill grant a tribunal to the industry. Such action on his part is absolutely necessary if a crisis is to be averted. I think I can safely say, on behalf of the leaders of the miners, that if we give them a fair deal they will do all they can to keep the wheels of industry going. They have publicly stated that they w ill ; they have made such announcements at meetings of the men. It is very hard for the officers of the unions, at the present time, to restrain the men, who ara very anxious to have their wrongs speedily righted.

51,Mr Burchell,"I shall leave it to to whicli he was subjected, as to the aeed for the appointment of a tribunal to .deal with the particular difficulties that confront the coal trade at the present time. On both sides of the House there is a recognition of the fact that the tribunal created under the War Precautions Act was necessary, and that since that Act and the regulations made under it will shortly disappear some other tribunal for the industry should be created, so that employers and employees may. meet before it, and have theirgrievances dealt with. In the first speech that I made iu this House after my return from the. United Kingdom last year, I outlined my strong belief in and support of proposals to bring together employers and employees, so that my attitude in supporting the honourable member for Illawarra this morning is entirely consistent with that which I have taken up since my return. I believe in the principles embodied in the report of the Whitley Commission, wbich must commend themselves to both employers and employees in this country. Knowing how employees in the. United Kingdom have been able, not in isolated cases, but in many instances, to improve their position, while employers in their turn have been able to look into the difficulties that confront their employees under the system recommended by that Commisison, I feel satisfied that its adoption here would bring about a better and more complete understanding between the two' parties. If , as the result of this debate, we obtain from the Ministry this morning a statement as to how they intend to deal with this question, the action taken by the honourable member for Illawarra will have been amply justified. I repeat that all the Statesare interested in this matter, and I make no. apology for referring to the Western Australian point of view. In that State we are dependent onNewcastle for the bulk of our bunker coal. has been tried, and in some instances it has; been found wanting,, while in others their heads together to give preference it has proved very satisfactory.

It is as the representative of the chief seaport of Western Australia, and as one possessing a knowledge of how shipping is sometimes delayed, that I speak in support of the action proposed by the mover of this-motion. The moveV of the motion, will deserve congratulation if, as a result of his action, this morning, the House and the people have an opportunity of receiving from the Government a statement as to their future policy in this regard. I shall be interested to hear from the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) the reasons why Inter-State colliers have been held up at Newcastle during the past ten or fourteen days. I do not propose to say a great deal on this motion, because the state of the coal industry is a matter of such importance that we could well afford to deal with it in more detail on another occasion. thorough overhaul. tion of the industry is not fully understood by the people. During the period of the war the whole of the export trade was practically suspended, whilst, in addition, many vessels were taken off the coastal trade. As a result, the mines and. the miners had a very rough time. The. war having terminated, shipping is gradually returning to the coast.

That is a phase of the question into which the Prime Minister would be well advised to look. WhilstI do not wish to hamper or restrict the export trade in any way, I think that in respect of coal, as with any other commodity, Australian requirements should be met first. Apart from the dislocation of the industry caused by the war, the coal miners have always been misunderstood and misrepresented. They stand in a different position from any other workers, inasmuch as they are, to a large extent, contractors, and although published statements of the gross receipts of a couple, of coal miners would make it appear that those engaged in the industry are . receiving a very good wage, yet, after deducting the expenses of upkeep of tools, lighting, explosives, and other charges, the net wage is considerably reduced. The wages of the coal miners are usually referred to by the daily rate instead of by the weekly or fortnightly rate. instances be receiving £1 per day for three miners may be working in hard ground; months while he happens to be working in a good place, but, on the other hand, he may be only working two or three days per week.

Of course, the men have never looked for work on every Saturday, because they have always been accustomed to work only eleven days per fortnight. they would refuse. would, because the eleven-day fortnight suits both parties. right; but where a mine is held up by the action of a wheeler, the union ought to deal with the wheeler and get the mine going.

To-day the next month they may be working in soft ground. The machinery of the Arbitration Court is not such as will give a speedy settlement in respect of irritation and disputes that arise from the contry.

I hope there is truth in I have not worked the press statement that the Prime Minister proposes to consider a method of dealing with industrial disputes that would be more direct and speedy than the Arbitration Court. The coal-mining industry is second in importance to none, and I hope that Before this year is concluded the Government will have appointed a tribunal to regulate the conditions.

77,Mr Watkins,"The Prime Minisminers of Australia may be able to earn wages at least us good as those which obtain in the Old World to-day. No doubt, as the result of experience gained under war conditions, the conditions of the industry in England have been so improved that they are now even better than those in Australia. I ask the Prime Minister to appoint, at the earliest possible moment, a tribunal for the control of the coal-mining industry, and to take steps to insure that due attention is paid to local requirements of coal, without unduly harassing the export trade. ister and Attorney-General) [11.59] The honourable member for Newcastle has put to me a question concerning a matter in regard to which both the employers and employees have had several conferences with me in Sydney; and I ought not to leave the miners any more than the mine owners and the general public in any doubt as to what the Government propose to do. I had not the advantage of hearing the whole of the remarks of the honourable member who moved the adjournment of the House. neither the occasion nor the scope of the motion permits one to deal with the question of remedial industrial legislation as f u l l y as it deserves. opinion now, as it always has been, the first question, the great question; all others are subordinate. It is very evident that, unless production goes on smoothly, neither the financial, political, nor general circumstances of the Commonwealth can be satisfactory. Honourable members know my views in regard to arbitration. I speak as onewho has had some experience in the A r bitration Court, and has had direct relations, as had the honourable members for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) and Hunter( Mr Charlton), w it h the. unions themselves; and I say deliberately, as a result of that long experience, that I am moro than ever convinced that the present arbitration machinery is quite inadequate; and, indeed, unsuited for the purposes of many industries. Further, I cannot seo how any alteration of the present machinery of the Arbitratio n Court-sweep ing away this or that obstacle-ca n enable it . to grapple with the circumstances of an industry of this kind. I am sorry that the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) has moved the adjournment of the House just at this moment; but, since he has done so I w ill avail myself of the opportunity to say what I think upou this matter; because every act that I have taken 'in the direction of dealing w it h disputes which have arisen has been the subject of very severe criticism, not only by the press, but by the President of the Arbitration Court. Now, as practical men, we have to deal with things as they are. Strikes occur. No doubt they ought not to occur; but, as a fact, they do. And we have to deal with facts as they are. It is no good saying that when there is a strike we should sit down and do nothing. Strikes must be dealt with. When I was the leader of great unions I did exactly as I do now. I endeavoured to deal with facts as they existed. It is no good saying to the unions-an y more than Canute to the on-coming tide"" Thus far, and no further."" We have to deal with facts; and the great fact of the industrial world is industrial unrest, which sometimes, despite every effort at prevention, manifests itself in strikes. We say I am sorry that to the unions, "" Here is the Arbitration Court. Enter here; attorn to this jurisdiction; seek remedy for your grievances in a Court where, perhaps, if you are forI t is, in my tunate, you may get ail award in twelve months' time."" I repeat what I have already said here. When I was leading the transport workers, after having tried every otlier means to secure more speedy redress, and having failed, it became absolutely necessary to strike in. order to get into the Court. The union struck accordingly. And I would act again in the same manner if I were placed in the same position to-day. But if the coal miners were to strike, and remain on strike, what would be the position? They would i m mediately put themselves out of Court; for the Court, quite properly, has said, "" You cannot have strikes and arbitration too."" That is true, but one of the reasons for the precipitation of strikes is that arbitration is so tardy, the approaches to the Court are so tortuous, the pitfalls so numerous, and the expenses so huge. Conditions may change completely between the date of approaching the Court and the time of securing an award. A union may apply for an award to-day and get no relief until eighteen months' time. Meanwhile, conditions may have",26,Adjournment

As matters are now, the coal miners are working under awards or orders made under the War Precautions Act. A special tribunal was appointed under that Statute.' The orders regulate the price of coal, the wages to be paid to the miners, and, indeed, all the circumstances of the industry. It was a convenient and flexible tribunal, always ready at the moment when it was wanted. I established this tribunal originally in 1916; and when I was away overseas Mr Watt dealt further, with the matter, and the miners are working under these orders or awards to-day. I am not touching on the merits of the case, but it is now said that circumstances have changed. It is stated, for example, that the lower-paid wage earners, who are receiving the 13s. 6d. rate, cannot make sufficient in an elevensettlement of industrial disputes. days' fortnight upon which to live. That is the main point. They cannot get redress in the Arbitration Court for that principal grievance. There is no tribunal but the tribunal created under the War Precautions Act.

That hypothesis involves the establishment of a special tribunal. It means, amongst other things, the appointment of a tribunal specifically to settle disputes and interpret awards or agreements in and for tbe coal trade only. Why not? Is there any good reason why there should not be such a tribunal? None whatever! Tho honourable member for Newcastle (MT. Watkins) stated that the coal-mining industry was a basic industry.

Let me describe for honourable members the kind of tribunalwhich I believe in ; and I wish them to think the matter over, because a B ill w ill be introduced next week to give effect to these ideas. I believe in a tribunal based somewhat on the lines of the shipbuilding tribunal. There is a body on which both sides are represented; and there is a chairman also. I do not isay for one moment that, in addition to a tribunal to deal with the coal mining industry as a whole, subordinate tribunals should not be appointed to deal with various parts of the New South Wales coal fields and, indeed, the scattered coal centres, no inatter in what part of Australia. But I am speaking of the' general principle. The proof of the pudding is in. the eating. The tribunal which deals' with the shipbuilding industry frequently issues two and three awards in one week. As they come before me I read these decisions of my friend, Mr Cbnnington, with the greatest pleasure. judgments in industrial matters ought to be. And, after all, the objective of all such legislation is to get and keep an industry going, and the outstanding fact is that the shipbuilding tribunal has kept the industry going; which is the very best commendation one could utter. know the reason why it is successful ? It is because the ""devil's brigade""the lawyers-ar e kept out. the only reason. There are others, but it is not proposed that lawyers' shall have access to the tribunals which I intend to create. I must say this on behalf of my much maligned profession, however, that I have'found, when lawyers' have been excluded from the Court's, that there has arisen a class of men, with regard to whom I am bound to associate-the phrase cacovthes loqwcndi.

The Government proposes next week to bring in a B ill for the creation of special tribunals for the control of different industries. Theset r i bunals w ill comprise an equal number of employers and employees, presided over by a chairman. They w ill have jurisdiction over disputes and over the circumstances of particular industries. They may partake of the for m _ of the shipping ' tribunal which is always available, so that, in the case, for instance, of the mining industry, if any dispute occur and a stoppage of work be threatened, there w ill always be ready to hand a t r i b u n a l to which the miners and the mine-owners may turn. The shipping tribunal does settle in this way disputes such as demarcation troubles, the question as to which, They are models of what trade shall do this work or that work, and other similar differences.

Nobody will pretend that there is not something about coal raining that breeds a good deal of discontent. suspect that if I were a coal miner myself I should be at the head of all this agitation. I am notifying honourable members generally, and particularly the representatives of the coal-mining industries, the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr for every important industry. I do not Hector Lamond), the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins), of the intentions of the Government to create special tribunals to deal with all disputes that cannot be, or are not, dealt with by the Arbitration Court. This should not be regarded as a reflection on the Arbitration Court at all. That Court has. done excellent work, but, in my opinion, it is not flexible, speedy, or economical enough to serve the varying circumstances of many industries in this country. [12.20] -No subject is of more importance to the general community than this question of industrial unrest, particuany other method. larly in the coal-mining industry; and I should like to make one or two observations with reference to the proposed special tribunals mentioned by the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes). I have always contended that a great centralized Arbitration Court must necessarily be a . clumsy, slow-moving piece of machinery, quite unable to attack problems as they arise from time to time in the varied conditions of Australian industries. I believe a Court for every important industry will prove the ideal method of handling industrial disputes in the future. How can it be expected that a Judge of the Arbitration Court shall know everything of every industry? And yet it seems to be a fundamental theory of the Arbitration Court procedure that the Judge should be master of all the facts of all our industries, and thus be able to appraise conditions with an approach to equity. possess all these qualities. I know of no one who is big enough and wise enough to handle all these problems in their own atmosphere and environment. procedure is, to some extent, due to the fact that a Judge has to spend days and days possessing himself of the facts in relation to a dispute. These facts have to be hammered. into him by experts on either side, when in reality he ought, at And that is only natural. I the outset, to be thoroughly conversant with all the facts'in a broad and general way in relation to the industry concerned. Therefore, it seems to me to be proper that we should seek to set up special tribunals in the form of a Court know that I should favour an elaborate Court such as we have to-day. I prefer some kind of simple Court of Conciliation, with arbitration in reserve, to attack the various problems as they arise, and on the spot. I have in mind the experiences of the Mother Country in this matter. Compulsory arbitration is not favoured in England. Thev can do much better by means of special tribunals comprised of men who devote the whole of their lives to the settlement of industrial troubles in relation to particular industries. proach more closely to that system than "" sack"" a man concerned in industrial troubles. the very satisfactory results achieved by Sir Rupert Kettle in the coal-mining district of Staffordshire. For forty years he was called upon to settle 'disputes in the coal and iron trades in chat district. his decisions? called his decisions into question. Both sides had confidence in his'judgment.

It s people, therefore, are vitally interested in the establishment of the proposed industrial tribunal, and, as I have before stated, they are also intensely interested in the question of shipping. The statement made by the honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) regarding the output of coal for foreign parts is a serious one if it means that the industries of Australia are going to be faced with a shortage of coal. I hope that this particular aspect of the situation w ill not be lost sight of. tim© unduly, because I understand that the honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Hector Lamond) wishes to reply, but honourable members opposite must surely recognise that the proposals which have been outlined by the Prime Minister will do something to ease the present situation. If they are not of that opinion, why do they not submit concrete proposals of their own? I sincerely trust that effect will be given to the proposals outlined by the Prime Minister, because I believe they will be to the advantage of the coal industry of Australia. I intend to speak only for a few minutes. When the Minister for the Navy( Sir Joseph Cook) rose to speak to this motion, he questioned my right to smile, and asked me my reason for smiling. I think it is perfectly obvious to every honourable member why this motion has been submitted. The reason has been made clearer by the fact that both the Prime Minister and the Minister for the Navy have spoken at considerable length upon it . In short, their speeches smacked a good deal of Ballarat, and were evidently for the purpose of preventing a motion standing in the name of the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Tudor) from being debated. Had the Government been siricerelv desirous of preventing industrial unrest they could have taken steps long before this to make such amendments in our Conciliation and Arbitration Act as would have rendered the approaches to the Arbitration Court less .tortuous, and would have expedited the hearing of cases coming before that tribunal. They .have not done these things, and, in; my humble opinion, no effective tribunal will be established to deal with these matters unless it has the power of deciding upon the purchasing power of the wages which it awards. A f t e r all, that is the real question. The Prime Minister stated that he had no power to bring to ani end the War Precautions Act, under which a certain tribunal now exists. I joined issue with him, and I denied his statement. the second time that the honourable member has denied it . the section ini the War Precautions Act which gives the Prime Minister the power which he says he does not possess. SectionI have no desire to occupy 2 of this Act provides that the Governor General may proclaim the date upon which tlie war shall be deemed to have ended. If the Governor General issued such a proclamation, it would be issued on the advice of the Prime Minister and his Ministers, and there is no doubt that, in such circumstances, the Act would come to an end. But even in the absence of such a proclamation I intend to show, upon the authority of the Prime Minister's own, words, uttered in this House on the 1st October, 1919, that the War Precautions A ct has expired. Upon page 12843 of Hansard of last year the Prime Minister is thus reported: Whatever powers we have at the present time under tlie War Precautions Act have their roots in the defence sub-section. From the judgments of even the majority in the bread case it is perfectly clear that, whatever powers we have, which are not strictly those belonging to the Commonwealth under the Constitution, spring wholly from the existence of a state of war, or of preparation for war. Neither of these conditions is now present. War is oyer; peace has come to us with complete victory over our enemies. Neither war nor the need for preparations for defence against a declared enemy exists. In three months the War Precautions Act itself expires; our powers under the War Precautions Act have now shrunk, if, indeed, they have not altogether disappeared. have said to-day, namely, that it is necessary for another Act to support this tribunal. honourable gentleman said to-day was that he had no power to bring the War Precautions A ct to an end. was that I had no power to bring the war to an end.

Finding my motion at the head of the business paper, which the Government always arrange, I naturally assumed that it would be the first business called on to-day. The Government, who admit they are hanging on by the skin of their teeth, have not been courteous enough to intimate that they had no intention of allowing me to submit it to the House or discuss its merits. I spoke to you, Mr Speaker, this morning, and from what you told me I assumed that my motion would be callad on as the first item of business to-day. I do not know what has transpired since. By not treating my motion as a censure motion, the Ministry are doing something which has-never been done previously in the case of no-confidence motions. I can call to mind many instances in which motions of dissent from the rulings of the Chair have been placed at the bottom of the business-paper, and honourable members thereby deprived of the opportunity of debating them, but the Government have not intimated to me, nor to any honourable member of the Labour party, as they should have done, that they intended to take similar action in regard to my motion.

The ordinary way in regard to no-confidence motions is to allow them to be called on for discussion.

If the Government intended to treat the Opposition in this fashion, they should have intimated, either publicly across the table, or privately, that they had no intention of treating .my motion as a no confidence motion,. and would place, it at the bottom of the business-paper; but, in view of the fact that you, Mr Speaker, or the Government, or you and the Government, have placed my notice of motion at the top of the business-paper, it . cannot be removed from that position except by a vote of the House. Let a Minister move to postpone it until Doomsday, or until the Day of Judgment.

He charges. the Government with discourtesy. He claims that we should have notified him that>we intended to act other than as provided by the customs of parliamentary procedure and the Standing Orders of the House. The Standing Orders are perfectly clear. The procedure to be followed is set out in standing order 119, of which the honourable member cannot plead ignorance, because on one occasion, when I had the honour of being a colleague of his, I was pulled up in the middle of a very spirited harangue on a motion which had been moved by my right honourable colleague, Mr Andrew Pisher, although I had not been going five minutes by the clock-. I was Government arpulled up because the operation of standing order 119 interrupted all further debate on the motion. As its effect was quite new to us all, this sank into our minds, and the .honourable member for Yarra( Mr Tudor) knows perfectly well how the standing order applies.

If notices of motion must have preference, and the Government treat this motion in this way, there will be no possibility of receiving answers to the questions, because it can be kept there so long of the Day and Notices of Motion inas this Parliament lasts. Several honourable members rising, require any assistance from honourable members in connection with this matter, and I am prepared to give my ruling. The point has been 'decided long ago, and we have a well-established precedent for the course now being adopted. I can fully appreciate the position mentioned by the honourable member for Hunter( Mr Charlton), but, unfortunately, that is a difficulty which is not of my making, and one which has resulted owing to the operation of our Standing Orders. able members know, is that at the expiration of two hours from the time of the meeting of the House, all motions not then disposed of must be interrupted and Orders of the Day called on. That has been our practice whenever motions of this character have been before the House. Questions upon notice have, at times, been taken before Orders of the Day, with the concurrence of the House. But it is not strictly in accordance with the Standing Orders. The practice of calling on Orders of the'Day on the expiration of the two-hour limitation for motions is departed from on occasions when the Government decide they will not transact any business until a no confidence motion 13 disposed of. In this ease, the Government have intimated their intention of going on with public business in the ordinary way; so, although the notice of motion in question is the first on the business-paper, and is placed before Government business, it must be on a dealt with before the expiration of two hours after the meeting of the House, at which time Orders of the Day must be called on or be interrupted. This question was debated on the 7th November, 1913, when the present Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) took an active part in a discussion relating to a no-confidence motion moved by Mr Eisher. On that occasion, a Friday, the motion was reached and discussed, and after the expiration of two hours it was interrupted understanding order 119, and was set down on the following Tuesday's notice paper, a copy of which I have before me, as a first Order of the Day as private members' business, Government Orders tervening. In this instance, the two hours allowed for motions had expired before this particular motion had a chance to be called on, and I had no option, under the circumstances, but to carry out the Standing Orders and allow the Orders of the Day to be proceeded with as the next business. The trouble this morning was that the motion was not reached owing to the -honourable member for Illawarra ( Mr Lamond) moving the adjournment of the House to discuss a matter of urgent public business. the facts. Several honourable members rose in their places to substantiate the urgency of the motion, which, therefore, had to be allowed to proceed, and the allotted two hours were absorbed before the motion of the honourable member for Yarra was reached. The fact that this is a no-confidence motion does not alter the principle at all. I quote from a ruling in Hansard on the 7th November, 1913, where the following appears:The fact that this is a no-confidence motion does not alter the principle at all. If it had been intended to specially exempt no-confidencemotions from the operation' of the closure provisions, it would have been so stated in those provisions. that occasion a no-confidence motion was discussed at least two hours, but the.

253,Mr Speaker,I can only speak of,39,Motion Government Had Been Desirous Of Having
254,Mr Tudoe,"That does not apply. Onthis occasion is that the two hours allotted had already expired before the motion was reached. A motion for the adjournment of the House to discuss a question of urgent public business had to be interrupted, and at the expiration of two hours it became necessary to call on the Orders of the Day, because the House had not ordered otherwise before the expiration, of that time. Mr Speaker, I desire to draw your attention to the fact that you have ruled, with reference to motions, that after two hours have elapsed the Government are quite in order in going on with their business. I contend that deals only with motions, and does not relate in any way to other business on the notice-paper. Standing order No. 92 readsAfter notices have' heen given, questions may -referred. be put to Ministers of the Crown relating to public affairs, and to other members relating to any Bill, motion, or other public matter, connected with tlie business on the notice-paper, of Standing order No. 95, relating to questions on notice, readsNotice of. question' shall be given by a member already been called on, and I should have delivering the same at the table fairly written, already left the chair had it not been for signed by himself, and showing the day proposed for asking such question.

WhilstI have been a member of this House, I have never known such an extraordinary procedure as this to be adopted in connection with the busiuess set out on the notice-paper. Whenever the time expires for the discussion of motions,, whatever their nature may be, questions upon notice have always been called on. No reason has been given to-day for the nonanswering of the questions on the business-paper. No Minister asked that they should be postponed, and I contend that until they have been disposed of, either by being replied to in the usual courteous way, or by being postponed at the request of, or on the motion of, a Minister, other busiuess cannot be taken. mentioned by the honourable member really -apply to the present position. Standing order 119 explicitly directs that, on the expiration of two hours from the time of the meeting of the House, Orders of the Day must beHaken in rotation, ""un* less the House order otherwise."" That procedure has been followed. with standing order 119That the consideration of Orders of the Day be postponed until after the consideration of notice of motion No. 1. motion at this stage, because it has been decided on many occasions that when it -is desired to alter the order of business provided for by the standing order just -mentioned, action must be taken within .two hours of the meeting of the House. iT'he point was raised and thoroughly discussed on the occasion to which I have .That Mr Speaker do now leave the chair.

Clause 73Section 231 of the Principal Act is repealed, and the following section inserted in its stead :""231. (1) Except as prescribed, every foreign-going ship, Australian-trade ship, or ship engaged in the coasting trade(a) carrying more than twelve passengers, or (6) being of 1,600 tons gross registered tonnage or upwards, shall be provided with a wireless telegraph installation, and shall maintain a wireless telegraph service, as prescribed, and shall be provided with one or more certificated operators and watchers, as required by the regulations.

She had discharged her cargo of oil in New Zealand, and was coming to Australia, travelling light, met with an accident, and for some time *was d r if t in g about the ocean. Her supplies of fuel became exhausted, and in order to obtain enough power to drive the dynamo, and so operate the wireless equipment, it was necessary practically to break up and use the whole of her fittings. In all probability she was a vessel of about 4,000 tons, and would carry a crew of forty or fifty. the clause as it stands would be compelled to have wireless equipment. anxious to extend this provision so that every vessel carrying a crew of twelve would have to be equipped w i th wireless. The Ministerf o r Trade and Customs( Mr Greene) w ill probably say that no such requirement was embodied by us in the Bill of 1912. I am quite willing to learn that that B ill is not as up to date as should be a Bill passed during the present session. Since 1912 marvellous ""Wc strides have been made with wireless telegraphy. When the principal Act was passed, wireless was practically in its infancy. Por every vessel trading to Australia which carried wireless in those 'That Act has days, there are now at least ten or a dozen; so equipped.

As a matter of fact, since 1917 the Opposition in this House has not been able to carry one amendment which the Government have opposed. early days of Federation, when we were dealing with non-party measures, the Opposition frequently carried amendments which were objected to by the Government of the day. To give a concrete illustration, when the original Public ServiceB ill was before us I secured an amendment of clause 40 dealing with temporary employees, and also an amendment in regard to the minimum wage.

In the course of my second-reading speech I dealt chiefly with the question of wireless and the necessity for compelling all ships to carry efficient crews. Wireless equipment is all important for the safety of shipping. It has been the means of summoning aid again and again to vessels in distress. Subsequent.to the wreck of the Titanic, and before the holding of the Conference for the Protection of L if e at Sea, the Voltuna caught ' fire in the Atlantic Ocean. By means of wireless she summoned to her aid vessels of almost every nationality; but owing to the heavy sea that was running, not one of them was able to launch a boat to go to the help of her crew. Ultimately, by means of wireless, she got into communication with an oil tank steamer, which, on arrival at the scene, poured large volumes of oil on the waters, and so settled them as to enable a rescue to be effected. vernment time to consider this question by moving that the Chairman do now leave the chair? hear the views of the Minister on this subject. it on the motion for the second reading, and as I had the honour of piloting through the House the B ill passed in 1912, I think I am entitled to expect from him the courtesy of a reply.

It is estimated by experts that on only about one day in five it is possible to launch a boat in the Atlantic. has a list to starboard on the port side are practically useless, and although a ship may be able to summon assistance, the chances of rescue are not great. every opportunity of rescue, and that is why I plead for better conditions in regard to wireless. Many vessels that, were torpedoed during the war remained afloat sufficiently long to summon assistance by wifeless. Vessels that have lost their propeller have drifted in mid-ocean for days. The honourable member for Parkes( Mr, Marr), who was a wireless operator during the war, will realize the necessity for , proclaiming the Act , so that the men who were trained in wireless during the war. but were not permitted to leave Australia, may have a greater opportunity of earning a livelihood at that profession. I shall listen to the Minister's explanation for altering the provision in the original Act , and if it is not satisfactory, I shall move the amendment I have indicated. move That the clause be postponed.

388,Mr Greene,"The assistance offeredupon wireless being installed upon all vessels. When the Leader of the Oppositou ( Mr Tudor.) was Minister for Trade and Customs; and was charged with the duty of piloting the Navigation Bill through this Chamber, it was thought that a vessel carrying fifty persons should be regarded as the smallest vessel upon which wireless should be installed. Personally, I think that that limit is too high. The Government, therefore, propose to grant a further measure of protection to our seafaring men. Under this Bill there are many hundreds of sailors who will be trading along our Australian coast, and who will be adequately protected by the installation of wireless, but who were not similarly protected under the Aet whioh is already upon our statute-hook. As the ordinary hour for adjournment has been reached, and as I shall probably have a further opportunity of addressing the Committee on this matter, I do not intend to unduly trespass upon the time of honourable members at this juncture. A l though I have been on my feet for perhaps balf-an-hour, I have not' succeeded in making a five-minutes speech. Progress reported: House adjourned at 4 p.m.",48,Paths
