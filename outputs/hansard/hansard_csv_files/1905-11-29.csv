It was That this House dissents from the ruling of Mr Deput] Speaker, that an honourable member is not entitled to repeat an argument already used by another honourable member in the same debate. I consented to the postponement of this motion yesterday, because I had no desire to interfere with the arrangement entered into between Ministers and other honourable members with regard to certain business. I think, however, that the matter should be disposed of to-day. The ruling to which I take exception was given during the debate upon the proposed new standing orders. WhilstI was speaking, the Deputy Speaker, with whom I regret to have to disagree, called me to order for repeating an argument which had been already, used by another honourable member in the same debate. He referred to standing order 276, which reads as follows:The Speaker or the Chairman of Committees may call the attention of the House, or the Committee, as the case may be, to continued irrelevance or tedious repetition, or the taking up of time by a speech of such unwarrantable length as to obstruct the business on the part of a member, and may direct such member to discontinue his speech. I should like to draw attention to the fact that no question of irrelevance or tedious repetition was involved, but that a broad ruling was given in the terms I have indicated. I respectfully submit that when the Deputy Speaker gave his decision he was under a misapprehension as to the ruling. which you, sir, had already given.

17,Mr Johnson,"Every honorableseems to me that if a question is to be discussed at all, it is impossible for it to be fairly debated without honourable members referring to arguments which have been already used, and, perhaps, for purposes of clearness and emphasis, repeating them. It is easy to imagine that a proposed law which is advocated by honourable members upon one side of the House may be opposed by the first speaker upon the other side of the Chamber, on the ground of its injustice. The injustice which it would inflict may be the central argument upon which the whole opposition to the proposal rests. Does anyone suggest that because the first honourable member-wh o has been fortunate enough to catch Mr Speaker's eye-ha s used that' argument in opposition to the proposal, other honourable members ought to be prevented from employing it? It is due, not only to the members of the House, but mouth piece they are, that they should have the freest right to express their opinions upon a matter of that kind, even though they might feel called upon to repeat arguments which had already been adduced. If it were not so, it must be clear to anybody who considers the matter, even from a superficial stand-point, that a Presiding Officer who was disposed to be tyrannical would be vested with power to effectually "" gag "" every honourable member. That condition of things ought not to obtain in a free Parliament. Mr Deputy Speaker relied, in support of his action, upon the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. be found on page 300 of May's Parliamentary Practice, which says, in relation to irrelevance or repetitionA member who resorts to persistent irrelevance may, under Standing Order No. 24, be directed by the Speaker or the Chairman to discontinue his speech, after the attention of the House has been called to the conduct of the honourable memberIt will be seen there that the attention of the House has first to be called to the conduct of the member who is guilty of persistent irrelevance. May continuesand akin to irrelevancy is the frequent repetition of the same arguments, whether of the arguments of the member speaking, or the arguments of other members; an offence which may be met by the power given to the Chairman under Standing Order No. 24. It will be observed that there is a very important qualification imposed by the introduction of the word "" frequent."" My reading of the standing order in question is that it is not disorderly to repeat an argument which has previously been used either by the same speaker or by another honourable member; but it is disorderly to frequently repeat it. That is an important qualification, which appears to have been entirely lost sight of in the Deputy Speaker's ruling. It seems to me that the standing order of the House of Commons does not preclude reference to arguments which have been used by other honourable members, nor the repetition of an argument which the speaker himself has previously used. What it does preclude is the frequent repetition of the same argument. Turning to page 828 of the appendix of May, I find the following, which deals with the question of irrelevance or repetition :(27th November, 1882, and 28th February, 1888) That Mr Speaker or the Chairman, after having to their constituents, whose called the attention of the House or of the Committee to the conduct of a member who persists in irrelevance, or tedious repetition either of his own arguments or of the arguments used by other members in the debate, may direct him to discontinue his speech. In this connection, I say that we have a standing orderI refer to standing order No. 276-whic h gives Mr Speaker power to deal with honourable members who are guilty of tedious repetition. And there was no necessity under the circumstances to fall back upon the British House of Commons procedure, unless it was desired by the Chair to arrogate powers which the Standing Orders did not confer or contemHi's supposed authority is to plate. But May's Parliamentary Practice does not support the Deputy Speaker's attitude. In the quotation whifch I have just made, it will be noted that the word "" repetition "" is again qualified by the word ""tedious."" Tedious repetition, I take it, means more than one repetition. Indeed, itt means more than one repetition by the same person. .From both these readings it seems that a reasonable interpretation of the standing order is that an honourable member may use an argument which has been previously employed by another honourable member irrespective of whether he does so designedly or as the result of inadvertence. But it is clearly disorderly for him to indulge in tedious repetition of that argument-in other words, to say the same thing over and over again. If it were not so, it would be useless to debate any question, because two or three honourable members might virtually advance all the main arguments either for or against any specific proposal, luck."" therefore, operate very unjustly. The honourable member for Bland himself might be excluded from speaking under such circumstances. He might spend a considerable amount of time consulting-authorities in the library in order that he might be qualified to address himself to a certain question, and yet he might be denied an opportunity to give expression to his ideas; because durmember say, again and again,; that we ing his absence some one else had forestalled him and employed the arguments he intended to employ. He might attend in this Chamber with the intention of delivering an important speecha speech which not only concerned the House and his constituents, but the country at large, and which by virtue of its importance ought to go before the country. But under the ruling of the Deputy Speaker, he might be absolutely prevented from delivering that speech, and consequently the pearls of wisdom which might otherwise have flowed from his lips would be lost to the present generation and to posterity. I am not arguing this question from any sense of personal ill-usage. I am eliminating the personal element entirely, and viewing the matter simply from the stand-point of reason and justice. It seems to me that if the ruling of the Deputy Speaker be enforced within such % narrow limits, the proceedings of this House as, a deliberative assembly will be reduced to an absolute farce. some honourable members are anxious to decide this quesfion-whic h is one of far-reaching importance-withou t any debate whatever. It is with considerable diffidence that I address myself to the motion, and I can assure honourable members that they will not facilitate its early settlement if I am interrupted at the outset. think it is a pity that the members of the Government, who should be the constitutional guardians of the liberties of honourable members, have not addressed themselves to this question with a view to showing whether or not, in their opinion, the ruling of the Deputy Speaker, if upheld, would curtail those liberties. the honourable member did. speech as brief as possible, in oider that my honourable and learned friend may have an opportunity to deal with the question. Some references have been made to English' precedents in connection, not with this ruling, but with rulings which you, Mr Speaker, have given, and which, on the occasion in question, appear to have been followed under a misapprehension. I maintain, first of all, that in a House of this size, English precedents should not concern us. ought to accept this and that ""because it is English."" events, I am a convert to, the views of the honourable member. I think that he will agree that in a Chamber so large as is the House of Commons it would be impossible to give that liberty of speech which should be extended to members of so small an assembly as this is. If we had 600 or 700 members of this House, each exercising his opportunities to speak, obviously no business could be transacted; but we have only seventy-five members, and the difficulty of properly representing the sparselypopulated constituencies of this great continent are such that every honourable member should be given complete freedom to express the views of his constituents. While I.should be the first to admit that to repeat over and over again arguments used by previous speakers would be to take an undue liberty in a House of this character, I cannot agree with the ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker that to repeat an argument which has been used, it may be only once or twice, by a previous speaker must necessarily be out of' order. What would be the position if that ruling were upheld'? An honourable member, hostile 1 to the question at issue, might easily forestall another who wished to put a certain question in a serious way before the House, and, having forestalled him, I he might take a point of order that arguments already used by him were being repeated. not even agree with him by saying, ""hear, hear."" of order.

Rulings from the Chair are designed not only to maintain order but to facilitate business, and all business in this House must be conducted upon a representative basis-the basis on which we hold our seats. That being so, it is clear that any ruling which aims at the root of the representative basis upon which we hold our seats in this Chamber should not be upheld. Let us consider the position which must arise if this ruling be accepted. The honourable and learned member for Illawarra has a large number of constituents who have entrusted him with their representation in this House. wrongly, they think that no other representative should be left to voice their views. The honourable member for Melbourne, for example, might be able to put the views of the electors of Illawarra with even greater forcefulness than could the honourable and learned member representing that constituency. But I hold that the electors of that constituency are ithe only people entitled to judge of that matter. If this ruling be upheld, it is clear that the rights of the constituencies will be interfered with. That is the principal grounH upon which I support this motion. I trust that the Government will give us that assistance which we are entitled to expect from them in dealing with it. must the House should endeavour to forget the rancour or feeling under which it has been labouring for some time, and deal with the question in a dispassionate way. with it. not. If he would, I should be perfectlysatisfied. The question will be put to the House, and I therefore ask honourable members to deal with it in a judicial manner. The question with which we are concerned relates not to the past, but to the future. Let us divest ourselves of any of those bitternesses which necessarily resulted from the all-night sittings on. the occasion on which this ruling was given. If that be done, honourable members will recognise that this ruling, if upheld, must seriously curtail the liberties of the House, and will therefore support the motion of the honourable and learned member for Illawarra. External Affairs) I trust that the motion will not be assented to, more especially if its acceptance is to involve the adoption of the views that have been urged in support of it. If each honourable member, because he represents a different constituency, is to be entitled to repeat the same argument for the sake of his constituents way. member is to be permitted to repeat his own arguments, and those of others, ad infinitum, debate will be at an end, and Parliament will cease to be. Rightly or porate existence of Parliament in those circumstances would be destroyed. We should have a gathering of irresponsible individuals, whose places in this respect might be supplied by so many gramophones or phonographs which, without the exertion of physical force, could keep on repeating what had' already been said. The contention of those who have supported the motion would reduce the proceedings of the House to chaos. Here, as in the House of Commons, the unlimited right of an honourable member to repeat his own arguments, or those of others, would lead to absolute paralysis of business. Are we compelled to choose between a doctrine of that character and the ruling now subAs this ruling mitted' to us? I regret! that the motion, necessarily affect all parties, as proposed, appears not to truly represent the actual position. Deputy Speaker, and was fixed up by him. pute that point. But surely honourable Unfortunately he will members will agree that the consideration of this ruling requires us to have regard to the time, the place, and the moment of its deliverance. No one would say that in no Circumstances should an honourable member be permitted to repeat his own arguments, or those of another to which he desired to replv. Such a ruling, if not fatal to debate, would seriously cripple it. I venture to submit that when we look at the time and circumstances of the ruling, we shall find that arguments were being repeated with the object of convincing no one, elucidating nothing, advancing nothing.

Our Standing Orders, properly read, and the rulings of Mr Speaker, as I have heard them, properly understood, imply that while there are times and places at which, a re-statement of an argument is absolutely necessary, and is in many other cases justifiable, there are also times and places in which it is absolutely unnecessary. If Mr ruling that an honourable member is not Speaker and the Chairman are not to interpose in such circumstances, and, with the weight of their independence and mature judgment are not to guide us, for what do we require a Speaker or Chairman? Do we expect the Standing Orders to operate automatically? Do we not intend that they shall be applied by Mr Speaker and the Chairman according to the problem that happens to be submitted to them. It appears, therefore, that the fair and reasonable view is that the ruling having regard to the circumstances in which it was given was absolutely right; and that, while in other circumstances it would not apply, that fact does not detract from its soundness. I venture to assert that it would be impossible for Mr Speaker in any ruling, to define all the circumstances in which such' a ruling should be accepted absolutely, qualified in some particulars, or rejected. I take no exception to the submission of this motion, and certainly none to the way in which it was put before the House. It was dealt with argumentatively, and as briefly as possible. But I take a different view of I defy the honourable the ruling from that which the honourable and learned member for illawarra has adopted. He has read it as applying absolutely at all times, to all honourable members in all debates. My reading of it is that it applies only to the time and place and debate in respect of which it was given. In others it might have been wrong. On a general principle our Standing Orders conStanding Orders of the House of Commons, When repetition becomes irrelevant, tedious, or useless!, whena point has been made and sufficiently enforced, Mr Speaker or the Chairman must be allowed to intervene to enable public business to be transacted. We must trust them to interpose at the right moment to prevent abuse of the forms of the House and loss of public time.

Prime Minister is of opinion that no exception can be taken to the submission of the motion, I shall not debate that aspect of the question; but I wish to say, as briefly as may be, that I think he has evaded the question before the Chair. The honourable and learned member for Illawarra asks the House to dissent from the entitled to repeat an argument which has already been used by another honourable member. The Prime Minister said that when there has been tedious repetition of an argument for the purpose of delaying business, it is within your province, Mr Speaker, or that of the Chairman, as the case may be, to as.k an honourable member to discontinue his speech.

41,Mr Robinson (Wannon),"As thepage 5370 of Hansard, in the following words:The ruling was that our rules prevent an honourable member from repeating an argument which has been previously used. Then, again, on page 537 r, Mr Deputy Speaker is reported to have saidMy ruling was that an honourable member would be guilty of irrelevance or repetition if he argument which has been used only once were to use arguments used by an honourable member previously in the same debate. Therefore, it was twice stated that it is not within the province of an honourable member to repeat arguments used by another honourable member. Not a word was said about circumstances, time, place, and conditions, nor were any of the qualifications added which the Prime Minister has introduced. If Mr Deputv Speaker had ruled that an honourable member is not entitled to repeat an argument which has been used by a dozen previous speakers, when it is obvious that the repetition is for the purpose of delaying business, 1 should have supported the ruling, and opposed the motion. That, however, is not the ruling which was given, and the motion of dissent asks the House not to allow the hard-and-fast rule to be laid down by Mr Deputy Speaker that, once an argument has been used, it cannot be used again by another speaker. ""gag-"" ruling would be a most iron-handed proceeding. We shall) shortly be dealing with certain clauses of the Trade Marks Bill, the arguments in regard to which will revolve round the point whether what is known as boycotting will result from the passing of those clauses. The same arguments will be repeated over and over again, though presented in different ways, and it is necessary for the information of the public that they should be so repeated. But, under the ruling which I have read, no honourable member would be entitled to address himself to the subject after, say, two speeches had been delivered on each side of the Chamber. I do not object to any reasonable prohibition of repetition, and would strongly support any ruling against unreasonable repetition; but' when an officer of the House rules that a member is not entitled to repeat an argument which has been used only once before-whic h was the ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker in so many words-it is the duty of those who differ to express dissent in the manner provided for in the rules of the House. The Prime Minister has admitted that repetition is sometimes desirable, though at other times it is not desirable. But, having admitted that it is under some circumstances desirable, it is his duty to vote for the motion, because the motion dissents from the ruling that repetition of an is not permissible. I intend to support the motion, because no reply has been made to the contention of the honourable and learned member for Illawarra, whilst the speech of the Prime Minister evaded and clouded the real issue, by introducing qualifications and limitations which were not used in the ruling of Mr Deputy Speaker, and were not mentioned during the debate. The rulings referred to by the honourable and learned member as given by Mr Speaker seemed to me to be supported by May and all the leading parliamentary authorities, and to such rulings, of course, we all bow. learned member read mv original ruling? Mr Speaker has already ruled, and it is in accordance with the practice of the House of Commons, that repetition may consist not only of a re-statement of a matter by the honourable member who is addressing the House, but also of .1 re-statement of the arguments of those who have preceded him. As the statement which the honourable member was making has already been made by other.honourable members, I ask him not to repeat it. Then follows the re-statement of the rulings which I have already read. The discussion of a motion of this kind presents difficulties to honourable members, but unless the ruling is cut down to make it accord with the practice stated in May and by Mr Speaker, I shall feel it my duty to vote to dissent from it. I shall do so with regret, but I feel that it is more necessary to get rid of a wrong ruling than to avoid giving pain to an honourable member, however high a position he may hold in the House. to discuss the question raised by the Prime Minister, whether, under the circumstances, Mr Deputy Speaker was entitled to call upon an honourable member to discontinue his speech.

If it had remained at that, I would let it pass, because the circumstances would explain it, but when the honourable and learned member for Werriwa moved! to dissent from the ruling, Mr Deputy Speaker saidI rule that the honourable and learned member's statement of his dissent is but of order. It does not correctly represent my ruling. further on he saidI should like to point out that the dissent expressed in writing by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa does not correctly state the effect of my ruling. The ruling wasThen follows this re-statement of it in more explicit terms, after consideration, and the moving of a motion of dissent, in which it had been wrongly expressedThat our rules prevent an honourable member from repeating an argument which has been previously used. That means that, if an argument has been used by any honourable member, it cannot be used by another. The honourable and learned member for Illawarra then saidI have put my dissent in the following form r "" I dissent from the ruling of the Deputy Speaker that an honourable membeT is not entitled to use an argument already used by another honourable member."" Mr Deputy Speaker would not agree that that statement of his ruling was correct. [REPRESENTATIVES.] jrom Speaking of the honourable and learned member, he saidThe terms he has used in his protest scarcely express the effect of the ruling. I will give the honourable member an opportunity to put his protest in proper form if he so desires. My ruling was that an honourable member would be guilty of irrelevance or repetition if he were to use viously in the same debate. So that the final statement of his ruling by Mr Deputy Speaker, was that, to use arguments previously used by another honourable member in the same debate, would be to be guilty of irrelevance or repetition. Mr Speaker has There is nothing to limit or qualify or mitigate the absolute generality and severity of the ruling. If an honourable member uses an argument, no other honourable member can use it in the same debate, without being guilty of irrelevance and repetition. I do not know how it could be irrelevant, and presumably repetition is the offence. I think that even the Deputy Speaker will admit that his ruling is expressed in too general terms. It was expressed at a trying time, when a good deal of difficulty was being experienced, and I submit that there are some very important limitations to be placed upon it. So far as I am concerned, if this House were to become seized of the fact that the ruling was not of that broad, drastic, general character that its words implied, I should be satisfied. I should be very loth to vote for any moHon dissenting from the ruling of the Chair under any circumstances. I believe that the Chair should be supported to the utmost of our power; but it is because the ruling in question is so broad and sweeping in its character that I feel bound to direct attention to the fact that it is, on the whole, a deliberate decision, which makes no reference to any particular circumstances. I imagine that the honourable and learned member for I llawarra would be satisfied if he were informed that there were unexpressed limitations connected with the ruling. I do not see how the House could support it in its present broad form. I trust that we shall receive some intimation that it is not meant to be construed to mean as much as it says, and that we may be able to avoid the necessity of voting either by way of assent or dissent upon a ruling given, as I freely admit, under circumstances of some difficulty. this as a non-party question.

A statement may gain considerable weight by repetition, owing to the fact that honourable members represent so many different States, and so many different sections of the electors of the Commonwealth. No disadvantage could attach to allowing one honourable member after another to speak in the same strain upon such a subject, for instance, as the remission of fodder duties in a time of drought. The very multiplicity of statements might afford the best possible ground for interfering with the Tariff, and dislocating trade arrangements. Therefore, the repetition of argument in certain cases may be desirable, and in keeping with a strictly relevant discussion. If the ruling were interpreted in the strictest sense, the representation of the States might be to a large extent stifled, and the citizens of those States would have to look to the Senate, instead of this House, lo protect their interests. I am bound to say that I understood the ruling to have particular reference to the time and to the circumstances under which it had been given. ""and learned member had withdrawn his opposition that the ruling was given in its general form. the ruling to have direct reference to the circumstances under which it was given. That being so, I could readily accept the Deputy Speaker's assurance that that was the case.

Leaving out of account the possibility of altering the standing order so as to make it more strict than it is, I take it that the ruling given by Mr Speaker several times during the debate of last week points to an insistence upon the repetition being ""tedious "" before an honourable member is ruled out of order. Irrespective of whether we carry or reject this motion, Mr Speaker's ruling will stand. I am content to leave the matter there.

In the first place, I should like briefly to relate the circumstances under which mv ruling was given -o r intended t'o use-the plural, the Those circumstances must be taken into consideration, and I do not think some of the instances given are apposite. The adjournment of the debate had been members to the motion. The honourable and learned member for Illawarra then rose to advance reasons in support of it. He spoke for some time, and then attempted to use the condition of the officers of the House as an argument in favour of the proposal to adjourn. I drew his attention to the fact that that argument had been previously used in the debate. I hive looked up Hansard, and I find that it was employed by two honourable members, namely, the honourable and learned member for Wannon, and the honourable member for Macquarie. I had a distinct recollection of it having been used, and I drew die attention of the honourable and learned member for Illawarra to that fact, but did not give anv ruling. He then asked whether the fact that an argument had been previously used by another honourable member would debar him from repeating it. I then gave my main ruling, which was not quoted by the honourable .and learned member for Wannon, but which was read by the honourable and H as not that statement learned member for Corinella.

That ruling was at once questioned by the honourable and learned member for Werriwa, who handed me a dissent in writing, which I ruled out of order, because to mv mind it did not express the ruling which I had given, either fully, or even impartially. The honourable and learned member then withdrew his dissent, but in the meantime the honourable and learned member for Illawarra had prepared another. Between the period when I gave the ruling, and 'that at which the dissent was handed in, the matter had been referred to two or three times. There was a good deal of confusion prevailing, and directly the Hansard proofs were supplied to me, I noted th'aft where I used singular had been employed by the reporter.

' hesitate to add to this debate, and should not have done so but for the remarks of the honourable member for Bland. If anything would induce me to advise the honourable and learned member for Illawarra to withdraw his motion it is the attitude which has been assumed towards it by the leader of the Labour Party, who even yet seems to be almost savage in his desire to stifle debate. I see no trace of his calming down upon that matter, even after having secured possibly the severe application of the closure rules to future debate.

Deputy Speaker, if it be upheld, means neither more nor less than the application of another form of closure, even more direct and effective than any of the forms which have already been adopted by the House. I venture to submit that,the House has no intention of placing any such arbitrary power in the hands of any speaker, neither is there any constitutional justification for so doing. Certainly there is no authority for such a proceeding. When the honourable member for Laanecoorie rose to make his explanation, I expected fit to modify in some way the attitude which he assumed upon the occasion to which allusion has been made. Instead of that, he finds fault with the drafting of the motion, and emphasizes his view as to the correctness of his ruling on the occasion referred to. He attempts to buttress his own ruling upon that occasion by the ruling given previously by Mr Speaker in relation to the same question. ThereinI think he makes a very great mistake. I draw a clear distinction between the unqualified statement of Mr Deputy Speaker arid the more qualified statements of Mr Speaker in relation to this point. When Mr Speaker gave his ruling, he pointed out that it was not in. order to repeat arguments to which utterance had already been given "" in the same way "" by other honourable members. Then, again, he used the qualifying words, "" in the same relation."" That makes a vital distinction.

There was no mention of Speaker went further, and said that arguments were not to be repeated in the same way and in the same relation. He meant; no doubt, that honourable members should not be permitted to continue droning out statements uttered in almost identical language by other honourable members. I do not cavil at Mr Speaker's ruling. It is a wise restriction to place upon debate. But I do not think that he intended to lay down the rule that there should be no repetition of argument in connection with any matter that he would have seen before the Chair. Such a ruling would mean that only two or three honourable members would be permitted to speak on any question. There are certain well-defined lines of argument in connection with almost every debatable subject that comes before the House. Take the union label clauses of the Trade MarksB ill , with which we are to deal almost immediately. If an honourable member is not to advance arguments against the union label on the ground, for instance, that it may lead to boycotting, there will be little debate on the whole subject. When we come to discuss the union -label clauses, one or two arguments will form the staple of the whole of the opposition to them. them !

The simplest thing to do is to allow an appeal direct to the Court from the Registrar in the case of opposed applications Under the English law, the decision of the Registrar is subject to appeal to the Court, or, with the consent of the parties, to the Board of Trade, which is the exact opposite of the provision in the B ill . clause 45, as I suggest, would be to make our law similar to the English law. Mr. M c CAY I think that it would be better to provide that any party aggrieved by the decision of the Registrar may appeal to the Court direct, or, if both parties consent, to the Law Officer. of Trade is final. MrM c CAY Yes . In England there is only one appeal from the decision of the Registrar-to the Court, or, if both parties consent, to the Board of Trade. I suggest to the Attorney-General that we should provide for only one appeal here-to the Court, or, if both parties consent, to the The wealthier party may Law Officer. I do not think that the Law Officer would have much to do under such circumstances. In my opinion, it is undeT h e appeal to the Law sirable to have an intermediate stage. Counsel is briefed at subject, which supports me in the opinion that, if it were provided that all cases should be taken to the Court, the result would be that in trivial matters a man would have either to abide by a decision of the Registrar, at which he felt aggrieved, or to undertake very expensive litigation. cases out of 100, the decision of the Registrar will be as good as that of the Law Officer. I think that the case will be met if we provide, in clause 45, that if either partu desires, the appeal may be direct to the Court. I do not think that both the parties should be forced to the Court. I suggested that if both parties consented, they might appeal to the Law Officer.",26,Trade Marks Bill

It must be remembered, however, that if they appeal to the Supreme Court, there is a possibility of a further appeal to the High Court. If the appeal in the first instance is to the Law Officer, the party who loses may agree to end the proceedings, as he has not lost very much; but if the appeal is to the Court, and the decision carries heavy costs, there will be an inducement for the losing party to proceed still further. I think that we should allow applicants to avail themselves of the cheapest procedure, and that we shall go far enough if we provide that, if either desires, the appeal shall be to the Court. honourable and learned member for Corinella should be satisfied with the arrangement suggested by the Attorney-General. I am almost prepared to leave the clause as it stands. I would not put it in the power of one party to say that he would not use the Law Officer.

As the Attorney-General knows, the ordinary transfer of land is effected by one of the most simple documents in the world. By the use of that form, lands to the value of hundreds of thousands of pounds are annually transferred and registered. Surely some simple form of that character could be adopted by the trade marks authorities. I see nothing in this clause to prevent that being done. the desire of the Trade Marks Department will be to make the procedure as simple as possible. If we have the assurance of the Attorney-General that the intention is that the regulations shall provide for a simple form of registration, enabling a man to secure his title as easily as he may secure a certificate of title under the State Land Act, we should be satisfied.

I think that the clause as it stands is rather wide. The defendant in a subsequent action, if he knew that the right to the exclusive use of a trade mark had come into question in a former action, and was determined in the plaintiff's favour, might feel it useless to challenge that right, and I think that he should be saddled with costs as between solicitor and client only, if he persisted in raising an issue determined in the plaintiff's favour in the previous case. -Section 46 of the English Act makes provision for what the honourable and learned member suggests; but there is another amendment which I should like to make.

B . EDWARDS (South Sydney). I do not quite like this clause. It seems to me that it involves an abnegation of our constitutional rights. Under section 51 of the Constitution, we are fully empowered to deal with trade marks, and it seems to me that we are now being, asked to surrender some of our rights in the Constitution by giving back to the Imperial authorities the right to apply to tbe Commonwealth anv law of the United Kingdom for carrying into effect any arrangement made with the Government of any foreign State for the protection of trade marks. I do not think we should do that. In clause 100, it is proposed to deal with British Possessions which have made certain provisions for the protection of trade marks on reciprocal lines, and my idea is that if we enter into any arrangement with foreign Powers we should do so upon a similar basis. If it appears to the Governor General in Council that forei.cn countries have made provision for the protection of trade marks registered in the Commonwealth we ought to give reciprocal protection to the trade marks registered in such countries. I do not care, however, to submit to the control of the Imperial authorities in this regard. I notice that it is provided that applications under the clause should be made within six months. I should like to make the registration for English or foreign trade marks subject to the condition that they were not identical that with one already on the register, with respect to the like goods, or so nearly resembling a Commonwealth trade mark as to be likely to deceive.

Mr' CROUCH do that than to allow the K in g in Councilwhich would mean the President of the Board of Trade-to do so. I think that we should exercise some control over the power proposed to be exercised under the clause. I would point out. further, that there is no provision made in this clause for reciprocal action, such as is contemplated in the case of British Possessions. Some of the States have entered into reciprocal arrangements among themselves, and I see no reason why we should not follow a similar practice in regard to British Possessions and foreign countries. But we must keep the control in our own hands in the same way that land did in regard to the treaty with Japan relating to Asiatic immigration. That gave the Government of Queensland the right to bring into force the treaty which the Imperial Government had concluded with Japan. If we take up the position that the Governor General, acting on the advice of his responsible Ministers, shall be the only person who can bring this provision into operation, a similar article will always be inserted in new treaties. If the honourable member for South Sydney has no amendment to submit, I am prepared to move that the'word "" K in g "" be struck out, with a view to insert' in lieu thereof the words ""the Governor General."" MrG . B . EDWARDS (South Sydney). I ask the honourable and learned member for Corio to consider whether the insertion of the words "" foreign state or "" before the woids ""British Possession"" in clause 100 would not achieve the object which we both have in view. If we applied that provision to foreign countries, as well as to Bri tish possessions, we should insure that we should receive reciprocal .rights from those countries, and we should give our own representative of the Crown the power to call this latent legislation into existence. Personally, I have a decided objection to introducing into our legislation the King's orders in council. J u s t in the same way about this provision. If honourable members will look at the Patents Act they will see that a similar provision is embodied in secW o u l d the honourable and tion 121, and for a very good reason. We wish to secure protection for our trade marks and patents in those .countries which are parties to the International Convention, as well as in our own. The International ConI t would be better to vention of 1884 was not originally signed by Hi's Majesty's Government, but it was afterwards subscribed to by the Imperial authorities. Only the K in g can apply it to the British Dominions, if it is applied at all. The Commonwealth is not a party to that agreement, and I suppose if we requested the British Government not to apply it to us it would not be applied. If we choose to say that Australians shall be excluded from the benefit of having their trade marks protected in other parts of the world, H is Majesty will doubtless give effect to our wishes. Upon page 532 of Sebastian it is clearly laid down that the benefits to be gained are reciprocal. We have already inserted .a similar provision in Queensthe Patents Act. Honourable members will recognise that it would be awkward if we could not secure for a patent protection all over the world. I cannot carry in my mind every provision which is contained in the Convention, but my view is that this clause is necessary if we wish to enter into the concert-if we wish to say that any person applying to register a trade mark in the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man, or in the other oountries which are parties to that Convention, shall be granted priority here in accordance with the date of its registration.

But such is the wording that counsel would find a great deal to say upon the other side. In view of the fact that at every step one takes in our series of Courts, the previous decision is usually reversed, we need to exercise care. In sub-clause 3 it is provided thatThe application for the registration of a trade mark under this section must be made in the same manner as an ordinary application under this Act.

274,Mr Mccay,"I do not think that the English Act, refers to the history of the goods. What it means is the place of origin; as, in the case of guano, the islands from which it has come. If the word ""origin,"" as used in the clause, refers to the circumstances under which goods are made, why are the words ""conditions of manufacture"" also used? The English section provides that goods may be marked to show that some authority certifies them to be of certain quality or grade; but, under the clause, the conditions of manufacture may also be certified to. This is a tremendous step towards legalizing the trade union label; but I would suggest to the Attorney General that the words should be omitted from the clause,and the matter left to be dealt with in Part VII . The clause differs from the English provision rJso in the fact that the Minister of Trade and Customs is substituted for the Board of Trade. I cannot at the present moment think of any other authority who might take the place of the Board of Trade. and Customs is a very good substitute. stitute, because it is conceivable that we might have a Minister whose views would unconsciously be coloured by his political opinions. imagine such a thing happening in. connection with the present Minister; but future Ministers may not all be like him. If the words "" or conditions "" are left in the clause, it can be used, not only for the legalization of workers' trade marks in the way proposed 'to be sanctioned by the Attorney-General, but even in the wav in which they are used in the United States, where the consent of the registered proprietor of a mark is required before it can be used. Therefore, the clause is really worse than the Attorney-General's workers' trade marks provisions. Any association, if the Minister judges it to be to the public advantage, mav be authorized to register a brand relating to the conditions of the manufacture of goods, and have the goods issued with that brand on them, whether it is, or is not a trader, and is, or is not possessed of a goodwill in connection with such examination and certifying.

If such an association, as I have indicated asked the Minister of Trade and Customs whether he thought it would be in the public interest to allow a label to be registered, what would happen? for Maranoa makes that astounding interjection from the place where the Minister usually sits, and that makes it all the worse. Whether the Minister said "" yes "" or "" no,"" a purely trade matter could be made a political question of the most acute character.

The clause would enable a trade union to undertake the examination of goods, and to certify whether they had been made under union conditions-irrespectiv e of whether other goods have been made under fair conditions. And if the Minister considered it in the public interest-and I think some Ministers would have generous ideas upon that point-the association would be enabled to register its mark as a trade mark. The mark would then belong to the union, which could agree or refuse, as it chose, to place it on goods. It could decline to attach the mark to goods made under conditions that would justify its being applied to them. All the union would have to doiwould be to undertake the examination of the goods with respect to the conditions of their manufacture, and no doubt they would perform; that part of the work with great cheerfulness. They would also succeed in giving the Minister reasons why their label should be registered. I think that some Ministers, in the generosity and kindness of their hearts, might be very easily persuaded on that point, and yet the only bulwark between the position I have put and the discriminating use of the union label is the non-approval of the Minister.

Nobody ever dreamed that any other part of it was pregnant with the, possibilities to which reference has been made by the honourable and learned member for Corinella. I say that the Attorney-General should have frankly assisted the Committee to understand the extent of the application of this clause.

323,Mr Glynn (Angas),"Afte r lookingthat they may be registered. the alteration which has been made fits in with the scope that the Bill has acquired, by reason of the excision of some words which appear in English legislation, and of the addition of others. I agree with the remarks of the honourable and learned member in this connection. The words ""mode of manufacture"" may appear to be comparatively innocent; but I may tell honourable members that in the case of Regina v. BramaU, which was brought under the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887, they were held to refer to the question of whether an article had been machine-made or hand-made. nothing whatever to do with the union label. What particularly struck me when I saw these words introduced, was that in some of the leaflets issued by associations in America for the purpose of expounding the objects of the union label, it is actually stated that they are intended to secure certain forms of label. Is not that significant? Leaflets have been distributed in the United States, setting forth the objects ofi the union label, and in these it is stated that it is designed to secure fair corfditions of labour. Mr J. B. Reynolds, who is the head of the well known college settlement in New York City, on behalf of a committee who were organizing to push the union label, issued a leaflet explaining what the label was designed to do, and in one part of this leaflet it is stated thatIt means or aims to insure that work is done under wholesome conditions. Is it not significant that the words "" conditions of manufacture "" are used in this clause? It seems to me that the words ""conditions of ""labour"" and ""conditions of manufacture "" have practically the same meaning Mr Reynolds went on to point out to the public thatTo promote the use of the union label means then to unite with workers in the struggle to make long. the conditions of labour under which work is done more sanitary, the conditions of the worker safer, and the products of better quality. He then went on to point out thatThe Committee regards the label as the only sign which indicates that the work has been done under suitable conditions. These are the words of the head of a representative body which met chiefly to discuss the extension of the union label, objection having been raised that its use was against the consumer, as the products to which it was applied were not always of the best quality. One of the professed objects of the union label is to insure better "" conditions of labour."" In this clause, we 1 have the words "" conditions of manufacture,"" but ""conditions of labour,"" in relation to the union label, have been held to refer to proper sanitation, shorter hours, and the class of house in which the goods bearing the union label are manufactured. I think it ought to be fairly clear to the Committee that by retaining these words we really extend the scope of the Bill, and that even if the subsequent clauses be not accepted by the Committee it will be possible That has for the Minister to recognise the union label. The clause would enable a certificate to be placed upon goods indicating that they had been manufactured under conditions whichi the unions thought suitable. In addition to that, this clause falls in with those dealing with the Commonwealth label which appear in Part VHA . in the list of amendments. Even if that part be not accepted, this will practically accomplish all that is desired. There may be some difficulty in applying the clause. A man may not have power to walk into a factory to see under what conditions work is carried on. No right is given, but we know that men do make such inquhies. tion of the goods show the condition of their manufacture? man may walk into a factory and make inquiries. nation of goods show their manufacture in that sense? sense, but of what may take place under this clause.

What is the meaning of ""association"" as used in this clause ? It is simply this: That there are some persons, whether in association or not, who hold themselves out as expert examiners of goods, and who may issue certificates in respect of goods that are submitted to them. We have, for instance, the goldsmiths, who issue certificates in respect of gold and silver plate; but this clause is to apply to all goods. Certificates may be issued by an association, and if it acquires a high reputation, the Minister, if he thinks it to the advantage of the public, may permit it to secure a trade mark.

My objection to the words proposed to be struck out is that they make it possible to introduce a false standard of comparison in Australia-on e which is alien to the spirit of the wise Australian legislation which has provided fpr Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards to regulate the conditions of work. another phase of this question which I should like to present with a view to indicate the necessity of retaining the words which the honourable and learned member for Corinella wishes to strike out. Any one who has watched the trend of legislation in the States must realize that the interests of the public are being conserved to a greater extent every day. Foods Bill is before the Victorian Parliament, and measures of a similar character have already been passed by other States Legislatures, and we should, by means of the Bill now before us, endeavour to assist the States to carry on their good work. It can readily be recognised that in order to make effective the work of a State Department, or the work of an association which may be formed for the specific purpose of examining and certifying as to the quality of goods,, some provision must be made for the registration of the marks which will indicate that the goods have been made under satisfactory conditions, and that they are pure and up to standard. Let us take the case of the Victorian butter industry. Not only is the produce examined as to quality and branded accordingly, but inquiries are made as to the conditions under which it is manufactured. In the event of faulty samples of butter being received, inspectors are sent to the factories from which they were received to instruct the managers in the most approved methods of production. a Trade Marks Bill? which I contend have an important bearing upon the amendment. Every one knows that the conditions of manufacture affect the quality of many goods-particularl y articles of food. At present the States authorities make provision for the inspection of meat and rabbits, and other articles of food, with a view to protecting the public as far as possible against the dissemination of disease. It is well known that goods made in sweating establishments have been the means of spreading disease, and it is surely necessary to provide some safeguard against the sale of such articles. Unless goods are made under wholesome conditions they cannot be pure. I contend that if we agree to the amendment, we shall incur considerable risk in this connection. think that we are getting on splendidly. We only need to hear a few more speeches of a similar character to those which have been delivered by the Attorney-General and the honourable member for Darling, to realize exactly what is contained in this Bill. The Attorney-General has told us -now that it is an anti-sweating Bill, and the honourable member for Darling has inA Pure formed us that it is a Factories Bill and a Health Bill. objects to those measures? ject to introducing provisions of that nature into this Bill. We ought to have been told what was the intention and purport of the measure. It is not a Trade Marks Bill in the ordinary sense of the term at all. It is a measure which seeks to promote the health of the^ people, and to insure that they shall work under fair conditions. I say that we have not the constitutional power to do anything of that kind. During the present and previoussessions, we have been endeavouring to secure an alteration in the Constitution, so as to permit the Commonwealth to legislate in regard to factory inspection and' uniform industrial laws. We cannot do that without first securing an amendment of the Constitution, but we can "" sneak"" those matters into this Bill, I suppose? member calls insuring fair conditions to the workers"" sneaking '' them into the Bill? the relevance of the honourable member's interjection.

We require another set of laws entirely to compass those objects. What we cannot do under the Constitution by means of factory legislation, we are endeavouring to clandestinely effect in this B ill . conduct; and I venture to say that it will be entirely ineffective for the purposes contemplated by honourable members opposite should it ever be placed upon our statute book. We have not the power power to register a trade mark which relates to the conditions of manufacture and the examination of ""goods. As far as I can see, we can get no trade mark which will take the place of a Factories Act. If we desire to enact factory legislation and to provide proper sanitary conditions for the workers let us support the honourable member for Melbourne Ports in his endeavour to secure an amendment of the Constitution which will enable us to obtain control of these powers. Then, we may use them throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I say again, that in this B ill we I am just as are seeking to usurp a function which is already provided for in the CommerceB ill .

CerIt is not within our legislative compass to do that. To insert this clause would, at the best, be a meddling interference with the States. If we want these further powers let us take the straightforward course suggested by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, and ask the States That is not straightforward to grant them to us.

The amendment of the honourable and learned member for Corinella will have no more effect than will the proposal of the Attorney-General, and, consequently, I decline to support it. that the Attorney-General has gone a considerable distance towards removing the fear that I had entertained in regard to the possible application of this clause. But in the most complete way he has justified the discussion which has taken place. He admits that he had in his mind that a State or Commonwealth authority might interfere with the conditions under which goods are produced. I am sure that the public did not for one moment believe that such a sinister proposal was hidden in this clause, and I regret that the Attorney-General has not dealt more frankly with the Committee. Honourable members opposite must not imagine that they possess a monopoly of the desire to protect the workers. I claim that I am as anxious as is any honourable member to improve the lot of the working classes, and in support of that statement would point to my record outside. The desire of the Opposition 'is that this Bill shall be so framed that the public will be able to tell at a glance for what purpose it is designed. We do not wish it to be converted into a Public Health Bill, a Wages Board Bill, or anything of that kind, and we hold, therefore, that it should relate strictly to trade marks. opinion of the Opposition, the proposed new Part VII. is opposed to the interests of the workers, and will afford ground for a fair fight between the opposing forces. But we did not expect that an outpost in the shape of this clause would be put forward lest the main army might be defeated. We have not been fairly treated, and I resent the suggestion made by the Attorney-General, that the Opposition, in opposing this clause, are influenced by a desire to prevent all work being carried out under humane conditions. Our opposition is based on the one ground that such a provision as this should not be introduced in this part of the Bill, and that we ought to have had from the Attorney-General a frank explanation of the effect of a new clause brought in by himself. If we cannot repose the fullest confidence in the Attorney-General, we have reached a sorry stage. The honourable and learned gentleman told me the other day that he was Attorney-General not only for the Ministry, but for the House, and I should like him to deal with the Committee from that stand-point.

A person shall be deemed to forge a registered trade mark who either(a) without the assent of the proprietor of the trade mark or the authority of this Act,-makes it or a mark so nearly resembling it as to be likely to deceive; or (4) falsifies any registered trade mark, whether by alteration, addition, effacement, or otherwise. 78W -(i. ) A trade mark shall be deemed to be applied to any thing if it is woven in, impressed on, worked into, or annexed or affixed to. the thing. (a) A trade mark shall be deemed to be applied to goods if (a) it is applied to the goods themselves; or (J) it is applied to anv covering, label, reel, or thing in or with which the goods are sold or exposed or had in possession for any purpose of trade or manufacture: or (f) it is used in any manner likely to lead to the belief that it refers to or describes' or designates the goods.

Progress reported. ExternalA f f a i r s ) In movingThat the House do now adjoum, at this comparatively early hour, I desire to inform honourable members that we can scarcely hope to conclude our sittings at this time in future. In view of the early, close of the session, we must sit not only. for longer hours, but upon more days than we have hitherto devoted to the business of the country. I hope that honourable members after this early adjournment will give us their best assistance in disposing of the Trade Marks Bill this week, because, even with the extra days and hours at our disposal,, our strength will be taxed to the utmost to dispose of the measures awaiting our attention before Christmas. fairer to honourable members, especially those who are in the habit of returning to their homes at the week end, if the Prime Minister at once informed them whether he proposes to sit after the usual hour of adjournment On Friday next, and on the following day. have disposed of the Trade Marks Bill. great .a pity to interfere with, the private liberties of honourable members in regard to going to and returning from their homes, as it would be to endeavour to force through the Trade Marks Bill by the application of the "" gag."" It seems to me that we ought to know definitely what we may expect, because many of us have to make arrangements ahead. For instance, I have made an appointment to proceed to my constituency, with a Minister in order to attend to certain departmental requirements. If the House is to sit late on Friday next, and meet on the following day, I shall have to abandon all my plans. It should be fully understood that the decision to sit on extra days is not due to any action on the part of the Opposition in delaying business, but to the desire of the Government to push through an undue amount of work before the session closes. If it were the intention of the Government to close the session at the end of next week, I could quite understand the proposal to sit on extra days. I trust that the Prime Minister will not this week sit later than the see no reason, however, why we should not afterwards sit on Mondays, or meet at an of earlier hour on the ordinary sitting days. Prime Minister will adhere to his determination to make the fullest possible use of the time at our disposal between now and Christmas. In view of the time that",56,Honourable Members Hear Hear
