If there were anything the Government could do to compose this unhappy difference, we should be most anxious to seize the opportunity; but certain conditions must be fulfilled before action can be taken by the Commonwealth. 'Until then, or unless other means of action are suggested, the better way is, as I suggested on Friday last, to remain silent. It is not from want of a sense of the far reaching consequences of the dispute, or from lack of readiness to interfere, if that could be done effectively, that I repeat that counsel aware that there is something wrong with the Queensland telegraph lines? telegram which I have received during the last fortnight has been a day or two, and sometimes three, days, behind time. In one case, a letter arrived more quickly than a telegram. Quite recently I have received two telegrams, one sent from Longreach at fourteen past 2 on the 15th, arriving at fourteen past 12 on the 16th-a n unreasonable time for transmission; and the other taking from 3.30 to 7.56 to reach me.

Section 128 readsThis Constitution shall not be altered except in the following manner :The proposed law for the alteration thereof must be passed by an absolute majority of each House of the Parliament. That is one of the terms of the agreement dure and practice to recognise another stage into which the people of the different as necessary after the third reading of a States entered when they accepted the ConBill. stitution-that before it could be altered the proposed law to alter it must be passed quite by an absolute majority of each House of future date or to move that the further conthis Parliament.

I wish to submit that if . the Constitution contemplates a further stage after the third those who entered into the agreement emreading of a. bill, that after the third bodied in the Constitution, understood that reading has been agreed to, the question it was contemplated by the Constitution shall be put "" That this Bill do now pass "" that it could only be altered in. a certain no standing order of ours can in any way way, and we have a right to insist that abrogate that provision. power to extend the meaning of the proConstitution could be done shall be done visions of the Constitution.

23,Mr Hall,"I am going to submit thatshow that in the Imperial Parliament also it is the practice, at least in the House of Lords, and has been the practice in the House of Commons, that, after the third reading of a measure, it must pass through another stage, when the question is put ithat the Bill do now pass. I hold that, when the Constitution provides that an absolute majority is required to pass a Bill proposing an amendment of the Constitution, that is the stage in contemplation, and that an absolute majority is required in favour of the motion, "" That the Bill do now pass."" At page 472, May, in explaining the practice in the British House of Lords, saysA Bill has been read a third time and further proceedings on the question "" That this Bill do pass"" ha-ve been adjourned to a future day. Then an example is given in these wordsAfter the third reading of the Queen's Degradation B ill in the House of Lords, ioth November, 1820, the further consideration of the Bill ""was put off for six months. Who can say that honourable members of this"" House might not have desired to follow tlie example of the British House of Lords in the case quoted, and put the Constitution Alteration (Finance) Bill off for another six months? to have done that. Because, if they could have put it off for six months, they would have put it off for all eternity, since it would never have been brought on again. able member is on a bad wicket. three weeks, it would never come on again. cedure referred to by May is not now followed in the House of Commons. The putting of the question ""That the Bill <lo now pass"" has been omitted in the House of Commons, although there is an entry made in the journal of the House that the measure has been passed. I submit that we have a right to claim that what is done in the British"" House of Lords and what is done in the Canadian Parliament, and, further, what is contemplated by the Commonwealth Constitution"", shall be done in this case, and that the actual motion required for the passage of -Constitution provide? the Bill shall follow the motion for its third reading. I submit, further, that it -shall pass, but the House has -declared that is upon that motion, and that motion alone, -fhe third reading of a Bill is the test of that, under the Constitution, it is necessary that there shall be an absolute majority of the House in the affirmative. ral) [3.18] I am afraid that the ingenuity of the honourable member for Werriwa has not,in this case, enabled him to discover a point worth much consideration.. This is about the first occasion upon which we have found honourable members opposite seeking their precedents from the House of Lords, and ignoring the practice of the Commons. If the honourable member bad consulted the latest book on the subject, published, I think, by the Clerk of the House of Commons, on the procedure of Parliament, he would have found that fhe practice of putting the question "" That the Bill do now pass"" is an old fo:mula still observed in the House of Lords, but discarded by the House of Commons. Atpage 162 of the ClerJt's Manual, he will find that, in accordance with paragraph 2 °.SAfter the third reading of a Bill no question is put to the House"" That the Bill do pass."" SoI am at a loss to understand what the honourable member is complaining of if it is admitted that we are here following the practice of the House of Commons,; then I have to point out that section 49 of the Constitution provides that the powers, privileges, and immunities of the House of Representatives sha'l be such as are declared by the Parliament, and that until then they shall be those of the House of Commons. Under section 50 it is within our competence to make rules and orders with respect to our powers and privileges and conduct of business. As a matter of fact, so far from our having by the Constitution adopted anything in the way of the procedure of the House of Commons, in the first Parliament we had no Standing Orders whatever. We had to proceed on common-sense lines, and to trustto a regard for that decorum on the part of honourable members which is recognised as essential. Our Standing Orders prescribe the third-reading stage as the last stage of a Bill, and declare that when ihe third reading has been carried the Bill is passed. I do not know what the honourable member was thinking of.",16,Privilege Constitution Alteration Finance

If my honourable friends wish to learn anything in this regard, I hope that they will not go back to that House of anachronisms, the House of Lords. appeal to prejudice. honourable member suggests is allied to the practice of the House of Lords, and not to the House of Commons, and that the only reference in the Constitution to any procedure that we want relates, not to the House of Lords, but to the powers, privileges, and immunities of the House of Commons. The only test is our own Standing Orders, or, if there be none, that the House has passed the B ill by any resolution. Our Standing Orders provide, however,, that the third reading is the final stage of a B ill , and that stage has been passed in the case of the measure under review. know whether I have convinced honourable members, but if they desire to refresh their a B ill , after it has passed the first and knowledge they have only to look up a recent addition to our Library-Redlich' s monumental work of three volumes on the Procedure of the House of Commons. That work, written by a foreigner, has been exceedingly well spoken of in England; and, as it points out, until comparatively recently there was no such thing as a reading. The readings are not the essentials. There is ho difficulty in this case. 1'he third reading has been carried in accordance with our Standing Orders, and that is all that we have prescribed as to the was followed on Friday last. Section 128 test of passing. Once the matter passes beyond our ken, the records of the House <n matters of procedure are absolutely coiv elusive and unchallengeable as to what has been done. seems to me that there is open to honourable members opposite a far more efficacious means of testing the validity of our action on Friday last than that of bringing the matter up in this House. It will be remembered that some three or four years ago we passed a B ill providing for an amendment of the Constitution to enable members of another place to remain there a few months longer than they would have been empowered to do without an alteration of the Constitution. If my honourable friends opposite have any doubt with regard to this question, they may test the validity of that Act in the H i gh Court of Australia. That measure was passed in exactly the same way as the Constitution Alteration (Finance) B ill was passed last Friday, and if honourable members opposite won on an appeal to the High Court as to is simply an the validity of that Act, they could win on an appeal in regard to the passing of the Constitution Alteration (Finance) B ill . I trust, however, that they will not take such action, because I have no desire to inconvenience the members of another place. first point raised by the honourable member respecting the entry in the Votes and Proceedings"" Mr Deakin moved, ' That the Bil l be now read a third time.' "" I may point out that it has always been the custom in .this House and in the House of Commons to take these formal motions as being moved by the Minister in charge on his signifying, by nodding his head, that he desires that they shall' be so taken. I do not Honourable members will recognise that, since it is well known who is in charge of second-reading stages and has gone through Committee, it is unnecessary for the Minister to make a formal motion that the Bill be read a third time. Strictly speaking, however, a formal motion should be made, and in my opinion, should be put in writing before it is made. In future, perhaps, it might be well to submit such motions in a more formal way. With regard to the second point, I do not think that there is anything inconsistent in the practice that has been adopted hitherto with that which of the Constitution provides that a proposed law for an alteration of the Constitution must be passed by an absolute majority in each House, and, acting upon the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution, this House has adopted certain Standing Orders, one of which defines exactly the word ""passed."" Standing order 186 provides thatAfter the third reading no further question shall be put, and the Bil l shall be deemed to have passed the House. The course adopted on Friday had been followed previously. As was pointed out by the Attorney-General, it is not now the custom in the House of Commons to put a further stage to the House, and, in the circumstances, I feel that in regard to this matter we have been following, not only our own practice, but, as provided for by standing order No. 1, the practice of the House of Commons.",17,Privilege Constitution Alteration Finance

If it is necessary to ask junior sorters of the receiving and delivery rooms to pass a test of the work required in the despatch room, is it not also necessary to ask junior sorters in the despatch room to pass a test in the work required in the delivery or receiving rooms? 11. If not, what are the reasons? 12. If all the sorters now engaged in the receiving and delivery room pass the despatch room test, will they be retained in the despatch room ? 13.

47,Mr Dugald Thomson,"I said from the spirit in which the honourable member has moved his amendment, or of the fairness with which he has put his case before, the Committee. It must, of course, be remembered that there is nothing in the agreement to prevent the Commonwealth from allowing any of the States to connect with the overland line. We have power to build it, if we so desire, from Port Darwin right down to the Queensland border at Camooweal, and a connection may be made at Camooweal first. Probably that would be the first connection made with any other State. suppose that the Commonwealth, when intrusted with the power of building the line, will not immediately construct a long nonpaying railway and incur a heavy deficit and interest burden. What the Commonwealth will do will be to construct a line having chiefly in view the development of the Northern Territory, which will be the first obligation of the Commonwealth when it takes the Territory over. be, not to do what is best in the interests of South Australia, or of any other State, but to do what is best in the interests of the development of the Territory itself. It is quite possible that we may construct a line to Camooweal, and then continue it down the Queensland border. Further, no specific time is mentioned as to when the line shall be constructed. It is not necessary to build it within the next few ye*.rs. To require that would probably be to retard the development of the Territory. agreement has been so framed as to enable us from time to time to build sections of the railway in the interests of the development of the Territory as we think fit. South Australia to say that the objective in view is the construction of that line, and not to work towards that objective would certainly not be carrying out the spirit of the agreement.

The agreement contemplates connecting Port Darwin with Oodnadatta, and the chief reason for proposing that condition is the desire to develop particularly the MacDonnell Range country. regarded by South Australia as offering the brightest prospects so far as its ultimate development is concerned. development of the MacDonnell Range country is assured. For the past fifteen or twenty years prospecting has been going on in that country, and particularly on the White Range, and mining operations have been carried on as far as it is possible to carry on such operations without the advantage of effective mining machinery. The use of such machinery has, of course, been altogether out of the question on a field so remote from any railway. goorlie there yet? not yet found a Kalgoorlie, but I can tell the honourable member that the Government of South Australia have had established cyanide works in the MacDonnell Ranges for fhe last twelve years.

Manyprospectors who have heen earning a good living for years in the MacDonnell Ranges confirm the opinion expressed by the Government officers who have been in charge of the works referred to. They are all of the opinion that if by railway communication up-to-date mining machinery could be landed on the spot a very important permanent mining industry would be developed there not a mushroom industry which would be in progress to-day and gone tomorrow. the returns there are very few white miners vernment of South Australia in the future. working in the Territory. try they have to cross in order to get terfered with the revenue earned by lines there. ferring to the MacDonnell Ranges.

I do not wish to delay the Committee, but I thought it was necessary to That part of the Territory is answer two or three statements whichwere quite contrary to the facts, and to put before honourable members the real position, The mineral particularly in respect to the MacDonnell Range country. Minister of External Affairs has told the Committee that this particular paragraph is vital to the agreement. I was sorry to hear that, because I feel compelled to support the amendment proposed by the honourable member for NorthSydney. I have regarded the construction of the railway as a matter which should be left entirely to the Federal Parliament. We areprepared to take over the Northern Territory with all its obligations and develop it. I am sure that members of this Parliament will always feel themselves under an obligation to do all they possibly can to develop every portion of Australia. The Minister has indicated that we are not bound to any particular line, but it seems to me that we should be bound under the agreement to make a connection with the Port Augusta railway. I direct the attention of the Committee to paragraph g, which readsAllow the State to connect any new railway hereafter constructed by the State in South That is the deAustralia proper with any railways acquired or tralia proper. That paragraph, it appears to me, must have an important bearing upon the proposal. I believe that under it it would be possible for the South Australian Government, at some future time, to construct lines of railway which would come into active competition with the Commonwealth line for the carriage of produce from areas on which we should have to depend for revenue to pay interest and maintenance charges of the Commonwealth line. honourable member refer?

Northern Territory, we are to construct a railway line costing .many millions of money, and involving the Commonwealth in a large annual expenditure, I think that it would be infinitely better to devote the money to subsidizing some lines of steamships to carry the produce of the Territory to a market. wealth might gradually develop the Territory by establishing settlements in a few favoured localities. I should be prepared to give a certain number of people land in the Territory for nothing until such time as some value for it had been established. This, of course, would involve the expenditure of money, and we might have to construct railways from the coast to the settlements in order to enable the settlers to get their produce to a port. But the money would be expended within our own territory, and we should be free to expend it in the best place according to the judgment of our own expert officers. I think that with our limited population the proposal that we should construct a line to connect Pine Creek with Oodnadatta is premature. It would be too big an obligation for us to undertake at present. heartily in accord with the proposal of the Government to take over the Northern Territory. thing to do. After we have taken it over we might discover that the line proposed in the agreement is the best that could be constructed, and when that could be shown I should be prepared to support its construction. to think that it would be very much better for us to retain a free hand to develop the Territory according to our own wisdom and judgment. Holding that view, I shall support the amendment. 1 am, to a great exthe amendment should commend itself to the common-sense and business judgment of the Committee. I quite recognise the advisableness from the military and from I believe that it will be demany other points of view, of the Commonwealth having control of the Northern Territory. I must, however, say that, in my opinion, rather too much importance has been attached to the defence aspect of the question. I do not think the unoccupied position of the Territory at the present time offers any very serious menace to the peace of Australia. I do not think that it offers any very no great inducement to an invasion by any foreign Powers likely to assail Australia. If , on taking over the It has been suggested that in the event of any trouble arising with eastern Asiatic nations the Northern Territory,in its unoccupied and unprotected condition, wouid offer a very tempting invitation for the landing of an invading force. But one important factor in this connection has beenoverlooked. That is that, although there I think that the Commonmight be facilities for the landing of an invading army in the Territory, there would be no means of sustaining it , and the difficulty of transporting an army across such an enormous stretch of comparatively barren and foodless country, before it could come into contact with the more popular centres of Australia, would be insurmountable. I think, therefore, that very great weight need not be attached to the defence argument in favour of the acceptance of the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth. I do not attach very much importance either to the magnificent word pictures which have been drawn by some honourable members who have advocated the transfer. Some of us have visited the Territory, and, so far > as the limited means of transport, and the time at our disposal, would permit of an inspection of it , the portion of it we were 1 am able to traverse afforded no justification for the high encomiums passed upon it by some enthusiastic members of the Committee, esDeI believe that that is the proper ciallv those representing South Australia.

91,Mr Johns On (Lang) [4.26],"I thinkavailable, the fact that opportunities to settle this Territory have existed for generations, and that the teeming millions of Europe, although they have been looking foi generations for a suitable place to which to migrate, have seen no attraction in it, seem to me to afford absolutely conclusive evidence that it is not the most desirable place in the world for a white residential population. The Northern Territory was known to the Spaniards as far back as the sixteenth century, long before the Britishers knew of Australia or settled here. It has been known to the Spaniards, Portuguese, and Dutch, ever since, and though within easy reach of fhe Straits Settlements of the Dutch has offered, apparently, no temptation to them to migrate, and settle there. honourable member discovered some armaments in the Northern Territory ? another visitor, I found buried on the seashore an obsolete cannon and other ship's gear which were at least 150 years old, and might have been considerably older. That shows that the Territory was known to other generations and was visited by ships before we, as colonists, settled in any part of the continent, and certainly, if it is the magnificent country that some would have us believe, the colonizing instincts of 'hose who visited the northern shores of Australia long before the British landed on this continent would have induced them to form settlements there. That they left it severely alone is primd facie evidence no fair criterion of production under normal that it was not considered a very desirable or profitable country to occupy. Another noteworthy fact is the absence of vegetation, and the stunted growth of the timber, which is sparse, and of poor character. grass. seenI am speaking of the country along the line of railway from Port Darwin to Pine Creek-excep t tall, coarse, cane grass, which grows luxuriantly, after the heavy rains, to a height of from ro to 12 feet. The soil, however, is porous, and over a wide area is micaceous in character. does not seem to retain the moisture. There seems to be no moisture, even round the roots of trees, and that largely accounts, perhaps, for their stunted growth and unhealthy appearance. has gone out of the ground, this tall grass easily be overcome by means of a landwithers, and, being unable, apparently, to grant railway. support its own weight, falls. The heavy rains are all at one period of the year, and the greater part of the year is droughty. Yet residents told us that the soil would grow anything, from fruits, vegetables, and other products grown in the most temperate, if not the most frigid,, climates, to those grown under the equator itself. On fhe face of it, such a statement with regard to one class of soil and climate is absurd, although made,seemingly, in all seriousness by our informants. We were told that around Port Darwin fruits and vegetables of every kind could be grown in profusion. Yet we were unable to obtain a potato or a cabbage, fruit of any description, a teaspoonful of fresh milk, or an ounce of fresh butter. All such products are imported. One would imagine that if the land is what it is said to be, people who have been there for twenty or thirty years, would have vegetables and fruits growing close at band. Land values are extremely low; land can be obtained almost for the asking j yet there is nothing to indicate an attempt to grow anything. That seems to furnish sufficient proof that the soil is incapable of producing to anything like the extent that some of the inhabitants tried to make us believe. Many things are grown to perfection at the Botanical Gardens at Palmerston; but the ground is in a particularly favorable spot; cultivation is carried on under special treatment, and the supervision of experts. The results thus obtained are conditions. With all these disadvantages, I think that South Australia has, in the Northern Territory, more than she can carry. I have no doubt that, if the Commonwealth does not take it over, she will is plenty of have to let it revert to the Imperial Government, or to New South Wales, to which it originally belonged. I do not think that: New South Wales would be particularly desirous of taking over the Territory once more, and the probabilities are, therefore, that, if it were not taken over by the Commonwealth, it would fall back into thehands of the Imperial Government.

As a matter of fact, settlement has decreased instead of increasing.

The further fact that even' the. Chinese, who can live where most other people are unable to eke out an existence, are at last abandoning the Port Darwin end of the Territory, does not suggest that the prospect for permanent white settlement is very hopeful. sons why the Commonwealth should take over the Territory, but there is no reason why, in assuming such a heavy responsibility, as will be the cost of developing the Territory, we should be saddled with the responsibility of entering -into a compact to construct, at an expenditure of millions, railways that will certainly prove unprofitable. The Commonwealth Government should be absolutely free to take over, or to construct, .any railways that it pleases. I shall cer. tainly oppose that part of the agreement which binds them to take over certain railways and to construct others which will involve the Commonwealth in an enormous load of expense and annual loss. On the map exhibited in the chamber there is shown the route of a proposed railway, which, to my mind, is infinitely preferable when railway connection has to be made to the railway which is proposed in this agreement. The raihvay from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, that we should be bound to construct if this agreement were accepted in its entirety/ would be of no use to any part of the Commonwealth outside of South Australia. I doubt it . I do Possibly, that part running through the MacDonnell Ranges country might be of some advantage to Port Augusta, but . that is a purely local consideration, and offers no attractions from the point of view of the Commonwealth. From the stand-point of South Australia, it is a very good proposition, since it means that she would have constructed through her Territory a railway, only a fractional proportion of the cost of which she would be called upon to pay, and which would give to her alone the benefit of any development that might take place. The whole of that Pioneering in the Northern Territory advantage would go to South Australia. To that I should have no objection, for I am not one of those Federal representatives who think that every Federal question should be viewed from the stand-point of their State alone. But, while South Australia may look at the matter from a special State point of view, the representatives of other States, who claim also to represent the interests of the whole Commonwealth, should bear that fact in mind. If the railway is to be constructed, the State which will reap the benefit, if any is to be derivedand that is problematical-shoul d certainly bear the largest proportion of the oost of its construction and maintenance. But However, there are many reaI am informed that an alternative line from Pine Creek, which would traverse the northern portion of Queensland, and connect with the State capitals, would pass through country which is really worth developing-countr y which is well watered and well grassed, and which offers every facility for profitable settlement. This country, I am told, requires only the construction of a railway to enable the products of settlers to find their way to different markets. Such a line, seems to me to be an eminently desirable one, because it can be connected with different ports along our coast at which goods may be shipped to all parts of the world. From Port Darwin, along the north-western side of the coast of the Northern Territory, there is scarcely any shipping, but on the eastern seaboard there are some of the finest ocean-going services to be found in the world. Between Sydney and Thursday Island there are quite a number of ports, such as Brisbane, Rockhampton, Townsville, and Cairns, some of which are already accessible by rail, and these ports can readily be linked up with a trunk line' from Pine Creek. The alternative",28,Northern Territory Acceptance Bill
97,Mr Johnson,"route would be from Pine Creek to Camooweal, thence to Mount Elliott, thence to Cork, and thence, to Thargomindah. By means of a short connection from Longreach to Cork, a distance of 150 miles, and another connection from Wyandra to Thargomindah, a distance of 170 miles, railway communication could be established between Port Darwin, Rockhampton, Townsville, Brisbane, and Bourke; and thence by the main line with Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide. The alternative route would continue from Thargomindah to BrokenH ill and Port Pirie, and the main portion of the trade over this line would go direct to South Australia. offers facilities for the transit of goods to a number of ports. Such a claim cannot be established in respect of the proposed transcontinental line, which would connect only two ports, namely, Port Darwin and Port Augusta. a number of ports would be lurked up at which steamers are continually calling, and thus cheap freights to all parts of the world would be assured. It seems to me that such a line ought to appeal to our business instincts as the one whicli is most likely to offer us a profitable return upon our expenditure. that, even in the distant future, the direct line from Port Darwin to Port Augusta would prove a remunerative one. Indeed, it is almost certain ihat A railway from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta would remain a white elephant, if not for all time, at any rate for many years 10 come. I shall certainly oppose that portion of the agreement which pledges the Commonwealth to take over the existing raihvay in South Australia, and binds it to the construction of the direct transcontinental line. I shall support the amendment of the honourable member for North Sydney, as one which is prompted by business considerations, as weil as a desire to conserve the best interests dealt with from a tropical stand-point. The of the Commonwealth. I think that this proposal ought to receive the serious consideration of the Committee,both from the stand-point of the State whose interests a.re so intimately concerned in it, and from that of the Commonwealth itself. Unless we can see our way to take over this large portion of the continent, with a view to insuring its substantial development, we had better not touch it at all. If we are going to accept the transfer of the Northern Territory we must be prepared to commit ourselves to a large initial expenditure. Anybody who is acquainted with the efforts which have been made by South Australia to develop it must recognise that it would be idle to pursue the lines which have hitherto been followed by that State. Any such policy must spell failure. If we are to succeed, a new and vigorous policy must be initiated,and we must be prepared, not only to incur a large expenditure, but to wait a considerable period before we can hope to receive anything like a fair return upon it. I know that I should not be in order in discussing what has recently taken place in this Chamber, but the Committee cannot shut This route, I repeat, their eyes to the fact that the Commonwealth has just deprived itself of a large proportion of its revenuea proportion which is represented by 25s. per head of its population. How it is going to meet that obligation and to incur fresh liabilities Under the alternative scheme, in the development of this country is a problem which, I think, we ought seriously to consider. I do not see how the Commonwealth can finance the Northern Territory under the conditions which now obtain. If it attempts to do so the present d r if t in the affairs of that Territory will There is nothing to indicate only become more accentuated. I have already endeavoured to inform myself as to the conditions which obtain in this portion of the continent. Some two years ago, thanks to the courtesy of the South Australian Government, I was afforded an opportunity of visiting and of travelling over a considerable portion of it. Quite recently, too, I journeyed to Oodnadatta for the purpose of acquiring a personal knowledge of the conditions which prevail there. I am free to admit that the Territory contains a large area of very fine land-lan d which ought to lend itself to profitable settlement. But it must not be forgotten that it lies in tropical latitudes, and must, therefore, 'be southern' portion of the Territory has been pictured as a desert, as a country which may be fittingly described as the "" dead heart of Australia."" Whilst it is true that a large area of it is -by no means first class, it certainly does not partake of the nature of a desert. Considerable tracts are capable of supporting population. Appearances suggest the presence of mineral wealth, and there are large areas over which artesian water is obtainable. It must be recognised that these are great aids to settlement. But it must not be forgotten that settlers in the Territory will be confronted",29,Northern Territory Acceptance Bill
98,Mr Thomas Brown (Calare) [4.52].,"by enormous disadvantages, and that whilst suitable land is obtainable in the southern States-lan d from which markets are more accessible-it must inevitably lag behind. It will be necessary for the Government, if the Commonwealth takes the Territory over, to ascertain how much money will be at its disposal for developmental purposes, and then to decide how to expend it in order to secure the best returns. The South Australian Government endeavoured to develop the Territory in the forty years during which it had control. It made an heroic effort to carry out the task, in the face of great natural disadvantages, not the least of which was the fact that the Seat of Government and settled portions of South Australia were separated from the Territory proper by the whole breadth of the continent. It is not to be wondered at that the Governmental authorities in South Australia were unable to deal with the problems of the North in an effective way. They endeavoured to handle them from a South Australian stand-point, and met with failure. In the document which the Minister of External Affairs Jias placed before honourable members an effort is made to indicate the reasons which led to the failure of the South Australian Government to settle and develop the Territory. Under the head of general reasons, it is. stated that most of the township blocks and agricultural lands within 40 miles of Palmerston were bought from the Government in the first instance by speculators, who demanded excesssive rents or prohibitive prices from those willing to utilize them. Consequently when the country gave promise of being developed the speculator came along, and became, as elsewhere, a hindrance to the efforts of the Government. That problem, in a most accentuated form, will have to be faced by the Commonwealth, because not only the land around Palmerston, but large areas of the most suitable and accessible grazing areas are held by speculators. There are 82,960,000 acres of pastoral lands held under 259 pastoral leases, with forty years' tenure, maturing at different periods from 1933 to 1943. the land in the Territory most suitable for settlement, and that one of the great difficulties which the new settler has to encounter is to secure within a reasonable distance of a port land adapted for his purposes. He is forced out into the far distant parts if he wants to obtain a decent holding. embracing 112 leases, and covering an area of 21,662,720 acres. These, I understand, carry the promise of conversion into pastoral leases Commonwealth will have a right to deal with them. fact that, according to the terms of the leases, the lessees are promised consideration on lines similar to those of the old leases ? we have not granted a lease for more than an annual term, the object being to leave the Commonwealth free to act. mits represent leases granted . since .1901. The other leases to which I previously referred have been granted for some years past, and embrace the best land. Talk about a pepper-corn rental ! The total rental from, those pastoral leases and permits, which cover a total area of over 103,000,000 acres, is only £ 8 , 3 2 9 per annum. There are a number of conditions in regard to stocking and improving attached, but their observance is apparently not insisted upon. Another cause for the failure of South Australia to handle the Territory is stated to be the fact that the Government did not keep faith with the original settlers in providing surveys within five years. This led to a great amount of litigation, and ultimately landed the South Australian Government in a loss of .£73,000. Another reason advanced is the absence of a bold and vigorous policy in administering the Territory. The Commonwealth must be prepared to benefit by South Australia's failure in that regard. It must be ready to initiate at once a vigorous policy suitable to local conditions, but that cannot be done without ample funds. The con-' ditions that have led to the failure of mining-and the Territory has a large mineral area-ar e stated to be mismanagement, inexperience, extravagance, and the erection of obsolete and other unsuitable machinery.

Further reasons are lax administration of the law in regard to working conditions, and the fact that the Chinese are permitted to engage in mining 'pursuits, and tn hold mining leases.

That is a matter duce them to settle, and then only to a limited extent. The Chinese are not there to develop the Territory, but are merely birds of passage. Their object is to obtain sufficient money to enable them to return to their own country, and they work upon lines that are utterly unsuitable for the development of the Territory. One of the reasons that have led to failure in the pastoral industry, which ought to be the great standby of the country, and which practically is the only industry in the Territory that has obtained a substantial footing, is stated to have been the speculative gambling in leases which I have already indicated. handled by the Commonwealth if we want the Territory to progress. As those leases embrace the besf and most accessible pas( toral areas, the Government must be prepared to compensate the speculators who hold them in order to obtain the right to ine the land for settlement. reason advanced for comparative failure is that the leases are too large for the lessees to comply with the stocking conditions. ings are reckoned, not by acres, but by square miles. Another reason set down is ""insufficient capital of the lessees, who were The record was 3.31 inches for too frequently only the nominees of banks nnd mortgage companies, which charged high rates of interest."" Heavy initial expenses, and the existence of the disease known as red water, are also cited as causes of failure. Red water has seriously affected stations along the Queensland border, and one. of the problems which we in New South Wales have had to face in recent years has been how to prevent its spreading in our territory. Again, the absence of suitable markets for live stock, the great distance which they have to travel, and the want of permanent water in many of the districts, are indicated as the reasons which have led to the failure of the pastoral industry, as compared with its success in other States. So far ns agriculture is concerned, the reasons advanced for its failure are-firstly, the surgrass; that, in order to overcome that difMr Thomas Brown. vey and subsequent cultivation of land un suitable for the purpose, entailing a loss; secondly, bad management, extravagance, and incompetency; thirdly, absence of suitable labour; and, fourthly, want of confidence in the industry on the part of capitalists. One of the great difficulties in the development of the Territory is the long period of the year in which there is of very serious consequence with respect to grazing and agricultural pursuits. It is true that rain does fall. For instance, the rainfall at Port Darwin, in 1908, which, I presume, was a fair average year, is given as 61.63 inches; at Brock's Creek, 53.96 inches; at Pine Creek, 43.65 inches; and so on through other centres. Getting further inland, the rainfall dropped. In that year, it was 24.96 inches at Daly Waters, 10.63 inches at Powell's Creek, 19.12 inches at Newcastle Waters, 17.74 inches at Borroloola, and 21.69 inches at Roper River. In the southern States, such rainfalls would indicate fair grazing and agriThat problem will have to be cultural conditions, and the natural deduction would be that it would be possible to find suitable country and carry on grazing and agriculture at a fairly remunerative figure. But it must not be forgotten that these districts lie within the tropics, and that the rains are practically confined to A further three months of the year. In 1908, the rainfall at Port Darwin was 10.74 inches in January, 15.47 inches in February, 11.01 inches in March, and only 2.13 In the Territory, holdinches in April. In May, June, July, August, and September, there was nothing beyond an indication of rain. October, 6.13 inches for November, and 12.80 inches for December. So that in this large tract of country known as the Northern Territory, November, December, January, February, and March are the months of the year in which the great proportion of the rainfall takes place, while for a considerable period, notably May, June, July, August, and September, there is little or no rain. That means that graziers have to make special provision for their stock. That does not apply to the southern districts, where, during the rainy months, there is a superabundance of grass. It grows coarse, rank, and tall; but, during the dry months, it retains no moisture, and I am told that it often happens that stock are poor or dying from poverty; that they cannot be found in the long useless ficulty, the settlers have to handle the grass in the proper season; and that by burning it off the heavy dews make good the shortage of rainfall in those months. In that way the stock-owners are enabled to provide feed for their stock; but that requires great care and constant attention. It also indicates that, so far as agriculture is concerned, it must be of a tropical character, and dealt with from that stand-point. These are problems which the settlers have had to face and fight against, and which have militated, to some extent, against the success of settlement. These are problems which the Commonwealth will have to face and find money to overcome by encouraging a class of settlers who will handle the Territory in accordance with its .natural conditions. l t seems to me that one of tlie essentials far stock purposes in the Territory is the provision of feed, by ensilage or other means, which will enable settlers to tide over a very considerable dryextend the railway from Oodnadatta, but period which happens, not intermittently, but regularly every year. That also applies to agricultural land. Again, railway communication must be secured. Northern Territory is a country of magnificent distance. For days we travelled"" over a similar kind of country. The difficulty is to get the crops to anything like a reasonable market. After visiting South Australia, and travelling over the railway to Oodnadatta, I am not prepared to admit that the connection of that point with Pine Creek is an unsuitable scheme, or that it is unnecessary for the development of Australia. In my opinion, a great deal can be said for the scheme. 1 believe that if the intermediate country is to be developed and brought into reasonable use, an extension of that railway must be made. One of the things I cannot understand is why it was allowed to stop at Oodnadatta for such a lengthy period, instead of being extended to the better country in the MacDonnell Ranges. Those who are competent to express an opinion with .respect to its character say that it is both a mineral'and a fairly good grazing country, but that its progress is retarded in both directions by .the fact that it has no reasonpreliminary action being taken. What we able means of communication. The only method of communication it has at present is by camels. The necessity of travelling over hundreds of miles of country by that method means that its development must be very considerably retarded. engineering difficulties to be encountered there ? as I travelled the engineering difficulties seemed to be very little. Of course, there may be a few cn route, but nothing approaching to those which bad to be overcome in taking the railway over the Blue Mountains in New South Wales. The bulk of the country to which I refer is as flat as a billiard table, and there are practically no engineering difficulties to be overcome. The probability is that if it had higher mountains it would be richer than it is at present, or is ever likely to be. I am informed that the MacDonnell table-land rises gradually, and that the difficulty connected with bringing a railway into that country is not more considerable than the difficulty experienced in bringing the line from Port Darwin to Pine Creek. If the Commonwealth is to take over the Territory it would be wise to take in the Bill not only the right to also the right of access to Port Augusta and of extension, westward through South Australia if the time should ever come to conThe struct the other transcontinental railway. At the same time, I think that it would be unwise to tie the hands of the Commonwealth Government to the construction of that line at an early date, or prior to considering the question of developing the Territory from"" other stand-points. tioned in the agreement. that unless the point is made very clear the people of South Australia will read a date into the agreement and ask the Commonwealth to honour the undertaking which it has mnde. So far as the establishment of the Federal Capital is concerned, the Constitution did not mention the date when that event should take place, but it was understood at the outset that it should be brought about as speedily as possible, and the people of New South Wales consider that a breach of faith has been committed because a period of practically nine years has been allowed to pass without more than want to understand definitely is that like conditions do not apply to the construction of this railway; that the Government shall have the right to acquire the railway from Oodnadatta to Port Augusta, and to exercise harbour and other rights when they feel that it would be in the best interests not only of the Territory, but also of the Commonwealth to take that course.

106,Mr Thomas Brown,"I assumesome extent in sympathy with the honourable member for North Sydney in seeing that no immediate obligation is imposed with respect to railway extension. While1 admit that a good case can be made out for the agreement in that regard, I think ihat if a railway is to be of service to the development of the Territory, the alternative lines which have been suggested, notably by Mr Alexander Wilson. and Mr Milne, of the Raihvay Department of New South Wales, ought to be considered from the Australian standpoint, and more particularly from the strategic point of view, seeing that they would bring the eastern capitals and peoples into very close touch with the Territory. According to a diagram showing the comparative distance from Port Darwin to the principal cities of eastern Australia, vid .Oodnadatta. and Camooweal, compiled to ander Wilson, a railway might well be constructed from Pine Creek via Camooweal to Mount Elliott, the present terminus of the railway from Townsville; then on >to Longreach, the terminus of the line from Rockhampton; and thence to Thargomindah, with branches to Wyandra, a point between Charleville and Cunnamulla, on the line from Brisbane, -and then to Bourke, on the line from Sydney, and to Torowangi to connect with Broken Hill and Adelaide. give easy communication to Townsville, Rockhampton, Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide; the distance to Melbourne being shortened by the construction of a line from Broken Hill to Mildura. Such a railway connection would not clash -vith the proposed Pine Creek to Oodnadatta railway, but would open up quite different country. From Port Darwin, via Oodnadatta, the distance to Adelaide would be 1,896 miles; to Melbourne, 2,379 miles; to Sydney, 2,961 miles; to Brisbane, 3,686 miles; and to Rockhampton, 4,082 miles. Fancy bringing troops distances like those ! And we are' asked to consider this proposal from the stand-point of defence. Via Camooweal, the distances would be: To Adelaide, 2,215 miles; to Melbourne, 2,412 miles; to Sydney, 2,238 miles; to Brisbane, 2,104 miles; to Rockhampton, 1,708 miles; and to Townsville, 1,551 miles. All the great cities on the eastern coast of Australia would be in close touch with the Northern Territory if that line were brought vid Camooweal, ancl country which is now fairly Mr Thomas well occupied would be still further developed. The Territory, too, would benefit greatly by such railway construction. Why should the Commonwealth tie its hands and, instead of remaining free to construct whatever line it thinks best in the interests of Australian defence and the development of the Territory, be bound to construct a line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta ? The Commonwealth, if it takes over the. Territory, should be free to develop it as experience suggests. It should not.be committed to a raihvay following any particular route. Should the Territory be transferred, our first aim will be to prevent the existing retrogression, by making it prosperous. What we desire is to plant there a healthy, thriving community, which will add materially to the welfare of the Commonwealth, and aid in the defence of Australia.

It has been said rfiany times in this House that when Western Australia was drawn into the Federation, she received practically a promise that the transcontinental line to Kalgoorlie would be constructed. If Ave enter into this agreement, the result must be that the Northern Territory line will be constructed before that to Kalgoorlie. In deed, it seems to me that we should be guilty of a breach of the agreement if we took over the Territory with a condition in the agreement as to the construction of the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, if we did not build that railway before constructing that from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. There are so few people resident in the Northern Territory that, even if the whole of them were carried up and down the northern line every week, it would not pay. On the other hand, Western Australia is being rapidly opened up. It has a large population, which is steadily increasing, and is, in short, a magnificent country worthy of every consideration. It ought certainly to be connected by rail with the eastern States. We are hardly in a position to build the proposed railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, in view of the fact that a certain loss would attach to its construction. We ought not to undertake to build it before we have constructed a line that we have had in hand practically for many years. I shall vote for the amendment, and trust that it will be carried. surer) [6.11] -The honourable member for Perth, in the opinion of the honourable member for Wentworth, has placed me in somewhat of a dilemma, but I do not think that he has. able member for Perth, in so far as he believes that the railway from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta is very urgent. him, I am unwilling that any other work should interfere with its construction.

Central Australia is, undoubtedly, the most difficult territory with which we have to deal. It has many natural disadvantages, and we cannot hope to overcome them and to subdue the country between Port Darwin and Oodnadatta, except by providing means of transit. When this question was before the Cabinet, I felt that whilst the Northern Territory remained unoccupied and unutilized, it must always be sometliing in the nature of a menace to the rest of Australia, and that an effort should be made to develop it . ' I realized, also, that South Australia was not in a position to undertake that work. I , therefore, supported the Prime Minister in the agreement that he made for the transfer of the Territory to the Commonwealth. The taking over of the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta was almosj: an afterthought. I do not know that it was strongly urged upon us by the Government of South Australia, but it seemed to us that if we were to undertake the development and settlement of the Northern Territory, it would be a great advantage to have possession of railway communication with the sea both northward and southward. We felt that if we could secure it, the Commonwealth would be enabled to deal thoroughly with the whole problem. propose that we should build the line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek before the Western Australian line is constructed? propose anything of the kind.

Australia did not respect the promise which was made by its responsible men in respect of a transcontinental railway prior to Federation. grievance in that connection, but I do not intend to be always discussing it. Of late years, a new feeling has arisen amongst us a feeling that we are bound together by common interests, and by sympathy with one another. I believe that a railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie can be constructed at very little cost to the Commonwealth, and that such an undertaking will involve no permanent burden upon anybody. It will pay its own way almost from the beginning. Consequently, I do not see how the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth, with a view to its development and the removal of what is now a menace to the safety of Australia, can injure the prospects of the construction of the line which I have so much at heart. After all, many years must elapse before the Northern Territory can be subdued and developed. We cannot build a railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek in a moment. we should complete it immediately. The work will have to be undertaken gradually, and as the circumstances of the Commonwealth permit. Not so the southern transcontinental line. line is to be constructed to provide a means of communication between the population of the eastern States and of Western Australia, it will have to Otherwise it will prove of very little value. I am not so sanguine as are some honourable members in regard to the success which will attend our efforts to develop the Northern Territory. We shall be shouldering a great responsibility, and I do not profess to see daylight ahead to the extent that some honourable members do. At the same time, it is our duty to make a great effort to develop that Territory. The MacDonnell Ranges country is said to be worth 'developing, and there is no reason why the railway from Oodnadatta should not be carried thus far. In the same way, the line from Pine Creek might be extended southward to the point at which it would pay, and thus eventually the two lines would be connected. I have made inquiries into the matter, and I am assured that there is a large area of good land to the east' towards Port Essington-lan d which it is dimcult to develop, but which is capable of great improvement. I ask the honourable member for Perth not to press his amendment. If he does so, I do not think that he will accomplish anygood. I would rather rely upon the sense of justice of the people of the several States than I would insert in this Bill the amendment which he proposes. In the past, I have had some cause for misgiving, but I have always been prepared to trust the people of eastern Australia to help us to secure the construction of the transcontinental line from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie. That line, I repeat, will pay its way almost from the beginning, and certainly will not be a permanent burden upon the people. I have no desire to ask my honourable friend to do anything that is opposed to his own interests, but I do not think that his amendment-eve n if adopted -woul d have the effect of accelerating this great undertaking by a single day. That being so, perhaps he will accede to the request of the Minister of External Affairs that he should withdraw it. It was never intended that that the Government have intimated that they share my view that the construction of the transcontinental railway from Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie has a prior claim to any other railway undertaking of a transI f that continental character, I do not feel disposed to press my amendment to a division. Under clause 16 of the Bill, Westtern Australia will undoubtedly receive an advantage, in that' the powers which have be constructed in its. entirety. hitherto been vested in the South Australian Parliament in respect of all railway construction which the Commonwealth may desire to undertake will be conferred upon this Parliament. We know that in the past South Australia has thrown some obstacles in the way of railway construction through her territory; but, if this Bill becomes law, those obstacles will disappear. In view of the fact that I cannot command the necessary majority, and that the Government have declared that they share my view of this matter, I ask permission of the Committee to withdraw my amendment.",39,Pairs

Western Australian line. we are not negotiating for the transfer of the whole of the territory to be served. In this case we are offered a large area of territory through which a line has already been partly constructed. tiations our desire was to have vested in the hands of this Parliament complete power to determine the course of the line between the two terminal points, Port Darwin and Port Augusta. But while negotiating to obtain complete control and fix our own route, we had to take into consideration the position of the line from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. South Australia, acting under a belief which she thought right, began to construct a line which it was intended to run right through the centre of the Territory, as indicated on the map, and has already constructed the portion as far as Oodnadatta. lieved that that line, when completed to Port Darwin, would develop the Territory, and be in the end self-supporting. Now that she has constructed an arm as far as Oodnadatta, we step in and ask for the right to build the line across the continent along whatever route we think necessary. That being so, South Australia might be confronted with a position in which that arm would be useless. great deal of money in it, and intended it to be part and parcel of a transcontinental system. Obviously, it could not be self-supporting unless there was some objective further north than Oodnadatta. developmental work in South Australia. but the objective was not Oodnadatta. It would never have been built unless the South Australian Government had had some objective further north. They had, however, the objective of reaching the MacDonnell Ranges, the Arltunga and other auriferous fields, the development of the country to the north for other purposes, and an extension further north still. If the Commonwealth had power to build this line as it thought fit, anywhere through the Northern Territory and through South Australian territory to the sea, it might leave the existing line useless. That would be doing a wrong to South Australia. She would be left in possession of a large arm of railway, which could never be productive unless the Commonwealth itself made arrangements to continue it north. In the circumstances, after considering tlie whole position, and seeing that whatever line we took north would of necessity be used for Commonwealth purposes at least up to Hergott Springs, we felt under an obligation, in dealing with South Australia, to take over the railway from Port Augusta In the negoto Oodnadatta. By adopting this provision no wrong will be done to the Commonwealth, and we shall be treating the people of South Australia fairly, because by handing over the Northern Territory to us they will be depriving themselves of the right to continue that line to its objective, and so making it more productive. When the route comes to be surveyed, it may be found advisable to continue the railway north from Oodnadatta; or it may be found infinitely better, instead of going from Oodnadatta right through the MacDonnell Ranges, to go round from Oodnadatta, as has been suggested, towards the QueensShe beland border; or it may be considered advisable to go from Hergott Springs to thc east of Lake Eyre. line be made? the information in my possession.

When that difficulty was raised, I communicated with the South Australian Government, and received, in reply, from Mr O'Loughlin, Commissioner of Public Works, the following letterMy attention has been called to the statements route from Hergott to Birdsville is impossible for a railway because of the flood waters of the Diamentina and other streams. I have to inform you that the preliminary survey for a railwhat bssis of expert investigation was there way from Hergott to the boundary a little to the east of Birdsville which was made by our Engineer-in-Chiefs Department some years ago, and the route of which was shown on the plan forwarded to you a few days ago, traverses a perfectly practicable and fairly favorable route for the whole distance. It crosses Cooper's Creek at a very narrow part known as the Stony Crossing a little to the east of ICopperamanna, thence it turns to the south and east of the country inundated by the flood waters of the Diamentina River, thus escaping the whole of the flooded country, and. terminates on the bountion, that the agreement does not provide dary between South Australia and Queensland about thirty-five miles east of Birdsville. If the agreement were modified so as to permit the railway crossing the Nortliern Territory, there is, according to this report, quite-a practicable scheme from Hergott to Birdsville and thence north. But, as I said, it is an agreement for the construction of a railway to go through the Northern Territory itself. In that respect the criticism which was submitted at one time in the debate apparently is not correct. miss the MacDonnell Ranges? would tap the western part of Queensland in a line with Charleville. The distance from Charleville would be about 450 miles if that line were continued north Then the distance from Longreach would be about 360 miles, and the distance from Cloncurry about 150 miles if these liries were extended to meet in the way which is indicated. I have mentioned that merely to show that what the Commonwealth was aiming at was a national line which would go from north to south, and that, as part of the negotiations, it was not just to .the State to leave this portion unprovided. For the reasons I have stated the Commonwealth Government agreed to the acquisition of the line as a part of. the contract. Minister's statement lands us in rather a queer position, because he made it perfectly clear that in the negotiations which a previous Government of the Commonwealth entered into with a previous Government of South Australia, it was made an axiom practically of the whole transfer of the Territory that the railway connecting northern Australia with south-eastern Australia should go, at any rate, through Hergott."" that a practicable proposal seemed to indicate that. for the Prime Minister of Australia, who is not an expert on such matters, or the Premier of South Australia, who knows nothing about the country outside its boundaries, to decide absolutely ex parte as to what was the best route to be traversed by this line? orable member, to prevent such a contenthat it should go through Hergott, but only f 10m Port Augusta to connect with the line to Port Darwin. Minister anticipates that at some period oi its progress the line will go as far south as Hergott. What does that mean? If it goes through Hergott, but not through Oodnadatta, it means that the line from Hergott to Oodnadatta is to be run at the Commonwealth expense for the exclusive benefit of the people of South Australia. I do not wish any ill to the people of that State. I shall be very glad to see It them get an absolutely fair thing.

They appear to have been quite content to allow the head of a previous Administration to enter into a conclave with the head of a previous Administration in South Australia, and to decide between them an agreement which is expected to bind the intelligence and judgment of every member of this Committee. We have heard the Minister's reply to some amendments from the honourable member for North Sydney. In each case, he said that if a single feature were altered, it would cease to be an agreement. If Parliament is content to be placed under the whip in this way, it will devolve all its duties ancl responsibilities upon a few persons who are not responsible to our constituents.

A number of honourable members on my side did not share my view, and the Government found no fault with them. voted for the agreement. most ungrateful. This is not an agreement entered into by the present Administration. It was certainly signed by the present Prime Minister, but he did not lead all of us then. I can remember honourable members who were then in Opposition denouncing the agreement. What has become of their denunciations? Have the exigencies of the taxpayers altered since that time, or have the exigencies of party government changed in some extraordinary way ? I believe that we owe the same duty to our constituents now as we did two or three years ago. I am upholding the same view now as I did North Sydney. Take some of the Ministers who denounced the agreement some time ago. Have not their constituents the right to demand of them as their representatives as loyal an upholding of their interests on this question now as they expected then ? WhatI object to most strenuously is the way in which this proposal is being log-rolled through the Chamber. We on this side joined together to form a great party. Was this agreement ever considered by its members ?"" member not to discuss the agreement. sir, for the latitude which you have extended to me. From the sound of the cheer from the Opposition bench, one might think that the House was crammed with Australian legislators. But when I look round, I find the representatives of South Australia anxious to push through a little Bill in the interests of the squatters of Oodnadatta. I cannot find anybody else here.

I sincerely hope that the Government will see fit to let the people of South Australia know the real opinion of this Parliament. Some time ago, we sought to have clearly placed before the people of the Common-, wealth exactly how far this Parliament was prepared to go. What did we find then ? We found a Ministry strenuously pledged out of respect to South Australia not to alter an agreement to which the State had put its seal. which to place the National Parliament ? 1 do not think it is. Not only we, but our constituents, are entitled to some consideration, but that ' ght is being denied, ls it ; not an extraordinary thing that the Minister selected to pull this agreement through the House is one who represents an electorate in Queensland. Surely there is no person in that constituency who does not realize that if this provision is carried, its ambitions for the construction of a line between Pine Creek and Brisbane are doomed to utter disappointment. the belt. why ? The honourable member may know more about these things than I do. The measure is essentially a non-party one, the only duty of the Administration in regard to it being to bring it before Parliament, every honourable member being required to consider, first, last, and always, the needs of his electorate, and the necessities of Australia. pretend that they are doing that. sound, parochial view ! government mean if not the representation of electorates by those elected for the purpose? I think that an explanation will Le required by the electors from those who reverse their previous decisions on this question, and I hope that honourable members who have done so will be able to satisfy their constituents that, while paying the keenest and most slavish regard to Ministerial exigencies, they have not overlooked or betrayed the interests of the people. It seems to me that an endeavour is being made by the States to put their nonpaying concerns on the Commonwealth, which is being asked to bear their burdens. I have never before seen so much logrolling as there has been in connection with this Bill. Ministers have been continually buttonholed and interviewed in regard to it. No doubt the same thing will happen again when the Western Australian railway proposal is before us. The representatives of Western Australia will probably then say to those of South Australia, '' We helped to carry your line; you ought to help us now."" A number of honourable members entered Parliament to look after, not the interests of the CommonAvealth, Is that a fair position in but those of their States. This ought not .to be the position of members of a National Parliament. members arc a glorious exception to the rule! Had the honourable member been here when the first Tariff was under discussion, he might hold a different opinion. representatives are the worse of all. any greater log-roller than the honourable member for Wakefield, who had a great deal of experience in tbe South Australian Parliament. He is a pastmaster of the art, and is making good use of his knowledge now. It is proposed that we should resume a railway built on a 3ft. 6in. gauge. Does any one think that that would be a proper gauge on which to build a railway to the Northern Territory? How much stock or produce could be carried on such a line? raised in Central Australia? of the matter, probably the gauge would is a good, be wide enough to carry all the traffic that there will be for the next fifty years. I should like to know what a cow, brought by rail from the Northern Territory to Adelaide, would be worth on arrival. The suggestion has been made that in times of drought stock would be carried from Queensland, New South Wales, and Victoria to the Northern Territory; but I ask, 'How would they be fed on the journey, or even watered? It is unjust and unfair to ask the Committee to approve of the resumption of the existing line, or to commit the Commonwealth tn the construction of another line. This Government had nothing to do with the original agreement. Why, then, should Ministers press it on the Committee?

Ministers are delighted to get their votes, in order to "" dish"" their own supporters. There are some, however, who would save the country from being ruined, and would prevent, if they could, any absolute waste of money. The Commonwealth cannot afford to burden itself with all these of the Minister was that we should not schemes. Honourable members talk about the Commonwealth borrowing, but what will be the value of its credit when it has. handed over most of the Customs and Excise revenue to the States? It is proposed that we shall take over an existing line, build a new line, assume all the liabilities of South Australia in regard to the Northern Territory, and then settle the country. When we have built two railways and the Federal Capital, we shall be in great need bf money. I do not know how we shall carry on Many honourable members regard the problem with a light heart, leaving the future to take care of itself. They will be very sorry, however, that they supported some of the proposals which will be passed this session. speech of the honourable member for North Sydney is entitled to a better answer than was given by the Minister of External Affairs. The Minister has not rebutted the case made out by the honourable member. Until he spoke I think few members fully understood one of the provisions of this precious agreement. I did not imagine that we were committing ourselves to the assumption of a State railway, to be worked for unnumbered years in the interests, and for the development, of a single State. The proposal is that, immediately on the transfer of the Northern Territory to the Commonwealth, we shall take over and work the railway from Port Augusta to Oodnadatta. I could appreciate that proposal were it intended to establish a con-"" nc-xion with the Pine Creek railway, to fill the gap at present existing, and have through connection from sea to sea. But we may not build the transcontinental line for a generation to come. It was always understood that the Western Australian transcontinental railway would be made before a line from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, but the construction of the former is not yet within sight. If it is not intended to construct the latter immediately, why take datta? Is the Commonwealth to create a Railway Department of its own, with a commissioner, secretaries, and undersecretaries, merely to manage and control this railway? I say nothing against the country which the line traverses; but it is well known that money is being lost on it now, and how can the Commonwealth hope to make it a success? A curious argument vote for the amendment because we cannot alter the agreement. in the Bill was a clause of the agreement with South Australia. ment be altered in any respect, even by the omission of a comma, it will have to be re-submitted to the Parliament of South Australia; but I am prepared to take the risk. Although the representatives of the State in this Parliament, the Adelaide newspapers, and the members of the State Parliament, say that they do not desire that the Commonwealth should take over the Territory, they are extraordinarily eager for the passing of the Bill. the honourable member was for the passing of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill. honourable member and his colleagues acted generously in that matter. WhatI have to complain of is action amounting to breach of faith on the part of the State Parliament and Government. I do not charge the State representatives in this House with being parties to it. tralian Government is not responsble. : ber say that the present Government can repudiate the solemn engagements of its predecessor, on the strength of which the people of Western Australia were induced to enter the Federation? I do not know on what advice the Prime Minister and the late Premier of South Australia made this compact; but, in any case, we must exercise our independent judgment in regard to it, and give the most serious attention to the proposal of the honourable member for North Sydney.

202,Mr Henrywillis,"My point isbeen disposed of on the first paragraph of this clause. The Bill involves, not merely the an eminently reasonable suggestion. taking over of the Northern Territory, but the beginning of a Commonwealth railway system, which in itself is a proposal, the discussion of which might occupy a. considerable time in this Parliament. As the Government would appear to be determined to carry the matter to a finish, I warn honourable members that the clause with which we are now dealing involves the expenditure of millions of money. We are to begin by taking over a railway which is not paying, and is not likely to pay. It cannot possibly pay, because it runs to nowhere, and picks up no trade on the way. The people of South Australia had a definite policy in the construction of this railway from Euroa. line. It was their intention to connect it with the line at Pine Creek, but the Minister of External Affairs says that that is not the policy of the Federal Government. Their policy is to fulfil this agreement at some time, but to provide for communication with Port Darwin by dodging round the coast of Queensland for many years to come. Theirs is a go-as-you-please proposal. I hope that the Committee will reject this paragraph, and will ask the Premier action as would render the line of value of South Australia 'to retain control of the Port Augusta railway. The honourable member for North Sydney has pointed out that the Government of South Australia are not desirous that the Commonwealth should take over this railway. They see how unwise it would be on our part to take over a line which is at present worked at a' loss.

Previously, the witsystem of postal voting, the matter having ness has not been required to know the applicant for a form, but, under proposed new section 109B, he must be satisfied as to fect, and, as has been pointed out by the his identity. I am opposed to the provisions Leader of the Opposition, postal voting is for voting by post, but I realize that there a corollary to universal suffrage. The is very little chance of inducing the Committee to abolish them. If anything can be done to curtail it, I shall support an amendment in that direction. The opinion of the Committee regarding voting by post should be definitely tested. A number of honourable members object to the continuance of the present system, and if any one moves to abolish it I shall support the amendment. -With a view to testing the feeling of the Committee as to the retention of postal voting, I move That the crossheading "" Part X. Voting by fore, oppose the amendment suggested by post"" be left out. I shall not occupy time discussing the matwould give every woman, whether ill or ter, because it has already been debated very fully. It has been proved, not only that the system is open to fraud, but that fraud has been so common under it that a change should be made. 1 am surprised that any objection should be raised to the abolition of voting by post. It is not my wish to disfranchise any elector, but we should not allow wholesale abuses to exist merely to give a few electors the opportunity to exercise the franchise. Home Affairs [9-48] -Practicall y the whole of the adverse criticism which was directed against the Bill on its second reading was in regard to the provisions dealing with voting by post. Little material change is proposed in this direction, election, and to carry out the provisions of but the wordingof the clauses has been altered to make the provisions clearer to the public, and stricter, with a view to preventing fraud, while the classes of persons who may witness postal voting have been added to. As to the matter brought under my notice by the honourable member for Yarra, the opinion of the officers of the Department is that it will be advantageous to require the witness to satisfy himself as to the identity of the applicant instead of requiring him to declare that the applicant is "" personally known to the witness,"" which has frequently led to confusion. I agree with the honourable member for Hindmarsh that it is unneceshave been used both for and against the been so thoroughly discussed. No doubt abuses have occurred, but no system is perhonorable member for Hindmarsh. has himself informed us that postal voting was originally instituted to meet the case of shearers, seamen, and other persons who, to earn their livelihood, must frequently absent themselves from the divisions for which they are enrolled. l t also meets the case of those who are sick, more especially the women electors, who now enjoy the same franchise as the men. I do not think that any one would wish to deprive the sick, especially women, of the right to exercise the franchise. But, whilst 1 wish to retain postal voting, I am not disposed to extend the principle, and shall, therethe honourable member for Balaclava, which not, the right to vote by post. I am surprised that the abolition of postal voting should be proposed by a member of the Labour party, seeing that the system originated with that party, and is of advantage chiefly to electors who might be expected to support it. voters' provision. I prefer that persons voting out of the divisions for which they are enrolled should go before returning officers rather than that ballot-papers should be taken to private houses. be no delay in taking a test vote on the question. We shall very soon have an the Bill it will be necessary to call together and instruct the returning officers, who, in turn, must instruct their assistants. Much work must be done to get everything ready. The measure is merely a machinery Bill, having no party significance, and I trust that when the matter which has chiefly provoked comment has been disposed of, honourable members will assist to pass it speedily. What the Minister has said in favour of postal voting was said in its favour in the Queensland Parliament, where it was, nevertheless, thought better to abolish the system altogether than try to amend it,",54,Statutory Rules

306,Mr Bamford (Herbert) [9.56],"because it was seen clearly that, if it were continued, abuses were bound to continue. Abuses must creep in under our provisions .for postal voting, if we retain them; no machinery that we can provide will prevent some persons from acting improperly. WhilstI feel that the Committee is not in favour of the abolition of postal voting, I should like to have a test vote on the subject. The abuses which came under my notice in Queensland, to whicli I have already referred, were such as to convince me that, do what we can to safeguard these provisions, our intention will be frustrated. The measure is a better one than we have yet passed, but the Minister would do well to allow us to strike out the postal voting provisions. -The Minister has declared himself opposed to my suggested amendment before hearing my reasons for it. Under such circumstances, a member has not much chance of gaining his end. In the cities and large towns, women have ample facilities for voting, and there is comparatively little trouble in going to the poll. But in the country districts there are many struggling selectors, and often both husband and wife cannot leave the home together. If the husband goes, the wife must remain to look after the children. Very often a considerable distance has to be travelled to reach a polling booth. In what is now the electoral district of Corangamite, it once took me eleven hours to ride on horseback from one town to another, a distance of 19 'miles. People living in some parts of that country would take six hours to get to the nearest polling booth. They might have to climb a range 400 or 500 feet high, and when they got to the bottom of it on the other side they would find themselves in a morass, -where their horses would be up to their girths in the mire. Having got through the morass they would have to climb another range. It is more difficult to travel 5 miles in some of the country districts than it is to travel 20 miles along a level road. forgets that the elections will be held in fine weather. no difference. There is a rainfall of 45 inches in the Otway Forest, and the settlers in that district will have great difficulty in getting to the nearest polling booth. The desire of Parliament is that every man and"" woman in the Commonwealth shall have the right to vote, and yet some honourable members would debar the unfortunate people who are settled in some districts from the exercise of that right, because they happen to live 3 or 4 miles from the nearest polling booth. At the same time they are willing to give every facility to people living in towns, although they can make use of trams, motor cars, and cabs, and would have no difficulty, even if they were required to walk, in getting to the nearest polling booth. ber aware that at the last Federal election there was a larger percentage of country votes than of city votes polled throughout the Commonwealth. whether that statement is correct or not) but it does not affect the question. I believe that under this Bill, unless further facilities are afforded, many country electors will.find it impossible to record their votes. whom the honourable member refers secure witnesses for their ballot-papers? have a week or ten days in which to do that. not merely for applications for postal voting certificates, but for postal ballot-papers, and they will hardly be found except in the vicinity of a polling booth. rized witnesses has been extended under this Bill, and as the result of the extension of our State school system it may not be difficult to get a person to witness an application for a postal voting certificate; but I think that every facility should be afforded to women in the country to vote by post. The Minister was prepared to say that he could not accept my amendment before he listened to the reasons in support of it. That seemed to me to be a strange stand for the honourable gentleman to take with regard to a proposal made by either a supporter or opponent of the Government. member's references to the Corangamite electorate on the second reading of the Bill. gentleman had not heard the reasons which I have given now.

Is the law to be so administered in the future? might as well wipe out the whole of these penalties and give every man a free hand to do as he pleases so far as the electoral law is concerned. [10.30] -Whil e there may be some difficulty associated with the insertion of the word that I propose, I am sure that the Attorney General could if he wished draft an amendment to meet the object that I have in view. The more we look at the safeguards to which reference has been made by the Minister, the more ridiculous do they appear. He asked us to recollect that, under paragraph c of proposed new section 109B, an authorized witness would not be permitted to witness an application for a postal vote certificate and postal ballot-paper unless he were personally acquainted with the facts, or had satisfied himself from inquiry of the applicant as to the truth of the statements contained in the application! What an absurdity is contained in that provision ! It merely provides that an authorized witness shall accept the statement of an individual who may be making a false declaration. When we come to deal with that portion of the Bill, I shall submit an amendment to it. It is a fair thing that an authorized witness shall make himself acquainted with the facts before he attests any application for a postal vote certificate and postal ballot-paoer. I entirely agree with the remarks of the honourable member for Yarra. If there be one Act vhich the Government ought to see is properly administered, it is the Electoral Act. Breaches of that Act have far more reaching consequences than have breaches of the Customs Act, and yet, as we know, no breaches of the latter statute are countenanced. We ought to insure that only persons who are entitled to receive these postal be-secured, because the Department would ballot-papers shall be able to obtain them. I recognise that under my amendment there would be a difficulty in prosecuting offenders. I would ask the Attorney-General whether, if the words "" has reason' to believe that "" be omitted from paragraph a of proposed new section 109, a person who has obtained a postal vote certificate and postal ballot-paper, and who, upon polling day, is found within 7 miles of any polling place for the division for which he is enrolled, can be prosecuted and punished? cuted, but he cannot be punished. If it is, then we may as well allow the Bill to remain in its present form, because we shall have no means of punishing a person who makes a false declaration. (Hindmarsh) [10.36] I do not think that the honourable member's amendment, if adopted, will help him a bit. The honourable member for Corio has very properly pointed out that Courts do not convict men who express opinions regarding something which may happen in the future. If the proposal of the honourable member for Hindmarsh be agreed to, it will be construed as meaning that an elector believed that on polling day he would be 7 miles distant from any polling place for the division for which he is enrolled. The Courts will not convict a man for making a declaration to-day regarding something which may happen a fortnight hence. This is not a clause under which prosecutions will be -frequently initiated. ft is a provision which really contains its own check against abuses. If honourable members will turn to the list of authorized witnesses, they will see that the latter consist of men of some standing. Fairly onerous duties are cast upon them, and one of those duties is to acquaint themselves with the facts stated in the application, so far as they can do so. That provides a guarantee of the bona fides of any applicant for a postal vote certificate and postal ballot-paper. I repeatthat the Bill contains precautionary provisions against abuse. the applicant in case of fraud will be permitted to go free. in which a conviction could be secured. not prosecute. with the facts as they stand. The point has been raised as to whether an undertaking should not be given that, in all cases, the facts should be brought before the Court. If a clear case of fraud can be made out, the Department will prosecute; but no Minister can bind his successors to undertake a prosecution in every case in which representations as to a breach of the law are made. In some cases, prosecutions are conducted by the States, and Commonwealth. But I would point out",59,Pairs

Many men would not care to walk 7 miles to a polling place and 7 miles back in the heat of summer. I think that the limit should be fixed at 3 miles. It would be very hard indeed if electors who applied for postal-vote certificates and postal ballot papers were required on polling day to transport themselves 7 miles distant from a polling booth in their division, in order to save their skins.
