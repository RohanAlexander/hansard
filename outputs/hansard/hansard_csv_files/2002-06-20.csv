This department has been a part of La Trobe University for 30 years, providing professional training primarily leading to careers in geology, granite petrology, geophysics and fluid flow. Eighty-five per cent of its graduates find work within three months of graduating. This of course speaks volumes for the quality of teaching, the expertise of the students and the high demand for their skills. Closing this department means that up to 170 students will be affected, from first-year students right through to PhD students. They will not be able to study part time, and they cannot fail a unit, because if they do it is unlikely they will be able to finish their degree at La Trobe. Australia is the highest spender on minerals exploration. In the year 2000 almost $700 million was spent, making departments like the Department of Earth Sciences at La Trobe vital. It is the only undergraduate geology course in Victoria that offers extensive coverage of environmental subjects, particularly water geochemistry and hydrogeology. This closure also affects students in Mildura and Albury. Of course, the question is: where will these students go? Last week I visited La Trobe to talk to the devastated earth sciences students and staff. Some students came to La Trobe specifically for the individual academics and their specialisation. I spoke to one new PhD student who has a supervisor in this department who is the only specialist in Australia, if not the world, teaching a particular area of hydrocarbon study. If this department closes, this student faces the question of where she will go. Will she follow her supervisor wherever he ends up? If he goes overseas, will she follow? Of course, this would contribute to something that I do not think that anyone in this parliament would want to see-that is, any further brain drain. These are very difficult questions and options facing these students. Then there is the staff: one of the academic staff members thinks that he will be able to find another job and two of the administration staff will be redeployed within the university, which leaves at least 10 of the staff without jobs. Their options are not attractive. They could look for a job now, but that would mean abandoning their students. They could wait until the department has breathed its last and then face the insecurity of looking for work while unemployed. Most disappointingly, the corporate knowledge of these academics will be lost. (Time expired) Petrie Electorate: Community Aged Care Grant Petrie Electorate: Domestic Violence Grant Ms GAMBARO (Petrie) (9.43 a.m.)-The Petrie electorate has recently received a boost to community aged care with an announcement of $22,000 in funding to the Wesley Mission Brisbane at the Wheller Gardens settlement in Chermside. This money is a veteran and community grant and will assist the Wesley Mission Brisbane with the establishment of some community aged care packages. The funding will be used to alleviate the loneliness of clients,",103,Notices
394,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. I.r. Causley) Took The Chair At 9.40 A.m.,"4112 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 2002 to form a friendship club, which will involve trips and events, and to encourage that very much needed social interaction between people. Last FridayI was absolutely delighted to officially present this grant to Wheller Gardens. It was a lovely afternoon, and I was encouraged by the words of someone who had at first really not believed that the program could help him. Jack was amazed at how valuable the service had become for him and his wife, and he demonstrates how important this funding is in making his life and the lives of other Australians much more fruitful. Veteran and community affairs grants are administered by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. They help develop projects, and they provide practical support to veterans and ex-service men and women across Australia. As a nation we owe an enormous amount of debt and gratitude to those veterans and service personnel, and the grant demonstrates the federal government’s commitment to meeting the needs of people in both the Petrie and the Lilley electorates. Domestic violence affects many lives right across the community, and families in the Redcliffe area have greater access to domestic violence services, particularly counselling, following the announcement of $100,000 for the Redcliffe Domestic Violence Action Group. This funding from the Stronger Families and Community Strategy will enable a part-time counsellor to provide direct support to families experiencing domestic and family violence in the Redcliffe Peninsula region. This was an election commitment, and I am really happy to deliver on that commitment. In the past, many local sufferers of domestic violence, both men and women, have had to utilise services at Caboolture, which were a fair distance away from the electorate. That stopped them from getting help much sooner. This two-year project is in response to a high level of need in the Redcliffe Peninsula. In Redcliffe alone, there are up to 15 cases of reported domestic violence each week, and the work of a specialist counsellor will significantly boost the advocacy, information and referral services provided by the volunteers of the Redcliffe Domestic Violence Action Group. Families will be clearer on the range of support services available and will be empowered to make decisions about their future which will improve their safety and their ability to function as a family. This funding is testimony to the federal government’s commitment to creating and maintaining stronger and more supportive communities that will help parents, young people, older citizens and families. Employment: Employee Entitlements Ms JACKSON (Hasluck) (9.46 a.m.)-I would like to take the opportunity today to express my grave concern at the tunnel vision of this government concerning employee entitlements. We have a government-and a Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in particular-which appears to have an unnatural obsession with the union movement. We have a minister who has no original policy thought, whose only contribution is a constant attack on working Australians and whose only ambition-or should I say crusade-appears to be the continued reduction of democracy and equity in the workplace. Instead of pretending to represent the interests of Australians in the workplace, the minister should face the facts. The only interest that the minister represents is that of stripping employee protections from the workplace. If the government were serious about protecting working Australians, it would address important issues such as the full protection of employee entitlements. The government’s own figures show how their two current employee entitlement schemes have failed dismally. Figures revealed in answers to questions asked by Labor during a recent Thursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4113 Senate estimates hearing show that the two schemes have failed to deliver workers anywhere near 100 per cent of their entitlements while, at the same time, costing taxpayers a fortune. Evidence given by the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations also showed the schemes are riddled with delays, shortfalls in payouts and cost overruns. The shortfall is due to the unrealistic caps placed by the government on the schemes. Under both schemes, redundancy entitlements are capped at eight weeks, even where an employee has served for more than 30 years. The real shortfall in entitlements is certainly higher, as these figures do not include unpaid superannuation contributions, because they are not covered by either scheme. This further highlights the need for a comprehensive national scheme to protect 100 per cent of employee entitlements. By failing to make employers accountable and allowing them to avoid their responsibilities, the government is failing hard-working Australians and their families. It is not at all serious about protecting employee entitlements. How many more corporate collapses do we need to see before the government gets serious about protecting employee entitlements? Labor has proposed and does support a comprehensive scheme. A bill has been put before the parliament by the member for Prospect. This bill will see the creation of a national scheme to cover 100 per cent of employee entitlements. Under Labor’s scheme, larger businessesthose with more than 20 employees-would be required to contribute to the fund and would ensure that 100 per cent of workers’ entitlements were covered in the event of insolvency, and the federal government would make payment on behalf of small businesses. It is time for a scheme to comprehensively protect workers’ entitlements. That is where this government and the union movement differ. The union movement, unlike the minister and the government, truly represent the interests of working Australians and their families. They do not pretend. (Time expired) Centrelink: Bereavement Payments House an issue which is very close to my heart: a loophole in the social security system that has been overlooked until recently. It is an issue which I am working with my colleagues to see addressed. The current social security system makes allowances for a bereavement payment. This is made to the surviving partner of somebody who has passed away, in order to help them financially following their partner’s death. This payment can be used to help meet the cost of providing a decent funeral service. However, there is no provision for a similar payment to be made to the children of a deceased person if the deceased is unmarried or divorced or does not have a partner with a legal responsibility for the children. Being a single parent myself, I think about what would happen to my children if something ever happened to me. This has given me an insight into, and an understanding of, how desperate some people can be when the time comes to bury their loved ones. Clearly, they are distraught and they have difficulty dealing with the emotional ramifications of the death, let alone the financial ones. I ask the members of this House to consider a situation where a sole parent has relied on welfare benefits. Often there are no savings to pay for a funeral. While a state funded funeral can be applied for in these cases but is not always given, I ask you: what child deserves to have their parent buried in an unmarked grave without a fitting funeral service? This issue was brought home to me by some members of my community in Campbelltown, and I know of a family where orphaned children actually had to get an advance on their youth allowance",105,Representatives Main Committee

I see it as my job as the representative of the people of Macarthur to bring this issue before the House and to see that this discrepancy in bereavement payments is corrected. That is why I am currently working through this issue with the Minister for Family and Community Services, and I ask all the members of this House to support me in this endeavour. Banking: Travel Agencies local travel agency but also on behalf of the broader travel agency community. These are the little franchises that dot the landscape and provide an invaluable service to the community. The problem is that a number of these agencies have been in peril as a consequence of some interesting actions by the banks arising out of the collapse of Ansett and the collapse of the travel industry after September 11. I would like to raise the specific case of Arriba Arriba Travels, which is a franchise owned by Dr Romero. This was a very successful business. It was located in Springvale and then was relocated to the city in about August 2000. What happened with Arriba Arriba was that, post the collapse of Ansett, a number of people who had purchased tickets through the travel agency requested that their money be refunded. These purchases had been made through Visa or Mastercard. When someone had been to a travel agent like Arriba Arriba Travels and purchased a ticket via Mastercard, that money had been passed on to Ansett Airlines. When the company could not get the money back from Ansett Airlines for the refunds, people sought their Mastercard or Visa refunds through their bank. What the banks have been doing to local travel agencies is automatically debiting that refund amount through the travel agent. Effectively, the travel agent has received the money, the money has been passed on to the airline, the flight has not been delivered and the person has gone back to the bank seeking a refund. The banks and the insurance companies have not paid the money; the travel agents have paid the money. There are a lot of small franchise travel agents all over the country that have been almost bankrupted as a consequence of this action. It is interesting that when Arriba Arriba Travels were first discussing these sorts of transaction arrangements with the bank-in this case, it was the National Australia Bank-they were given a one-page document. They were not told that there may be difficulty in terms of the collapse of an airline. No-one had envisaged that. A one-page document was provided to Arriba Arriba Travels discussing the transaction arrangements. Lo and behold, when they made an inquiry concerning this matter, they received a three-page document which detailed the exact nature of the arrangements. My contention to you is that this is an example of what is happening all over the country. Banks are great at taking money; they are lousy at taking social responsibility. The actions of banks like the National Australia Bank are imperilling a lot of good small businesses and travel agents across the country. They should develop a social conscience for a change and allow these people to continue to function without debiting money from their accounts.

I am sure that all members of the House would agree that selection for such an honour is indeed very rare, and I compliment him on his selection. Julian, who is in his final year of school, was amongst only 10 young Australians to be selected to represent our nation at this conference. I think all members would also agree that the pressures of being at school are quite significant in today’s world, but this young man is able to make a substantial contribution to his community and hence has been rewarded by this selection. It is not the first time that Julian has represented our country. He has also been to Japan. He was a participant in the Pacific Rim International Camp in Japan last year. Julian has a very strong interest in foreign affairs and the world of diplomacy-international relations-and seeks to represent our country in that arena sometime in the future. Last week I had the opportunity of meeting with Julian and his mother, who is of course a very proud mum. I had the pleasure of presenting to Julian a certificate that acknowledges his selection and his inclusion in this wonderful opportunity. I gave Julian an Australian flag and a lot of information about our system of government and all the values of our country. He said he would promote our nation with great vigour and enthusiasm: he would be very proud to do so. It is a wonderful opportunity for Julian: he gets to meet young people from around the world to discuss important issues facing youth. The theme of the Global Youth Leadership Conference in Washington and New York is ‘Leaders of tomorrow preparing for global challenges and the responsibility of the future’. I know that young Julian will learn a lot. I think it is important that this House acknowledges the contribution of young people in all that they do, and I know that my friend and colleague the member for Macarthur also has a very strong interest in young people. I wish Julian the best of times during this wonderful opportunity to make some friends and some significant contacts as well. I have a very strong interest in promoting in my community young people and all their aspirations, and I say to the people of Ryan that they can count on my very strong enthusiasm for the interests of young people in Ryan.

In the area of aged care provision there are increases in money set aside for aged care nurses, which is welcome, residential aged care subsidies and community aged care packages. But there is a growing crisis in the provision of aged care generally within my area of the central west. We are told that the region is overserviced in respect of the existing ratio of 100 aged care places per 1,000 people over the age of 70. It has been suggested that aged care bonds may be a way of attracting investment into that sector. We have an ageing population in regional areas and-to put it crudely-we have a resource in our aged population. It is not going to disappear in any sort of a hurry and it strikes me that it could be a very attractive investment option if such bonds could be structured and government guaranteed as an investment vehicle for the very scarce resources available-or not available-for the aged care sector. We have heard of the phantom beds and the licences being granted to aged care providers right around Australia but many of them, particularly in places like Lithgow, are really struggling to raise the capital necessary for the bricks and mortar. Aged care assessment teams tell me that there is a continuing overdemand for nursing home places-demand is in constant excess of the supply of such places, despite the fact that we are told that the central west is overserviced in terms of that 100 per 1,000 ratio. Exacerbating the problem is the continuing pressure on the state hospital system from aged patients who by any judgment should be in a nursing home. Last week the son of an 84-year-old woman who is in Orange Base Hospital and seriously ill-in the terminal stages of her lifewas angered that she is to be shifted as a public hospital patient to Eugowra, 70-odd kilometres away, because there is no bed available in the Orange area. The bed in the hospital is obviously needed for more urgent medical patients. This lady is in addition to the 30 people assessed as needing nursing home accommodation in Orange, yet the recent announcement of nursing home places for the central west put out by the minister in the last week or two has no provision for aged care providers to apply for any high or low care places. All that is on offer are home based care community care packages with a chance for people to apply for 40 unallocated low care nursing home places. I commend the minister for detailing these allocations before aged care providers go to the trouble of preparing detailed submissions in the vain hope of winning some licences, but it is no good funding home care packages without providing more medium and high care nursing home places, because inevitably home care aged will need intensive nursing care for the remainder of their lives unless they choose to die in their own home and their family can support that wish. We have a situation in country Australia where the population is ageing and the policy of ageing in place does not offer the family care option as much as it perhaps might in the city. The kids are not there; they have headed for greener pastures, sometimes overseas, to the cities or to the coast. I contend that there is a greater need for aged accommodation in major regional centres like Bathurst, Dubbo and Tamworth than there is in more populated areas on the coast. I know that the statistics say that 90 per cent of older people choose to stay in their own homes as long as they can. (Extension of time granted) Perhaps there has been a disproportionate concentration on bricks and mortar aged care as opposed to home care because 90 per cent of people do choose to stay in their own home. The government must be applauded for Thursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4117 extending the home and community care process but we must be careful that these packages are real care packages. We cannot afford to cut corners. I believe the care packages should include the bed and breakfast option-not in a food sense but the care should be provided at the beginning and the end of the day when the most need for that backup is required, and when the most comforting aspect of that service can be provided rather than a once-a-day visit. That is the lonely time and the period of the day when a person’s well-being, comfort and loneliness in their own home is most obvious. I know that, having had my mother die in her own home, refusing to go anywhere else and causing great stress to the family, which was dispersed to all points of the compass, and feeling guilty that the pressure was on the neighbours to keep an eye on her. It was a very difficult situation. I think the packages at this point are lacking in both their quantitative and qualitative component. The degree to which aged care providers take them up should not be the measure of their success. They are a much needed income stream for many nursing homes and some of them are converting-as is Wontama in Orange-some of their residential aged care beds into community care packages. They have good intent and they deliver a good service, as far as it goes, but I think that they need to be looked at in terms of greater quality of service delivery. While there is a welcome allocation of an extra $211 million for subsidies for residential aged care, the figures I have detailed on the allocation of places in the central west highlight the fact that not enough licences are coming through to areas of real need-areas which the formula says are not in need. I know things have improved significantly over the past five years since the aged care reforms but I also know there is a tremendous administrative load on staff of aged care facilities with the new compliance regime. There are precious few resources to cope with this. The member for New England also mentioned this in his delivery yesterday. The allocation of increased funding for aged care administration is targeted at compliance investigation, community care program management and assistance to Indigenous and rural aged care. That is very welcome but I suggest that more will be needed to take the administrative burden off nursing and management staff, who are struggling to meet their compliance requirements over and above their care duties to their clients. Minister for Ageing, who represents the Minister for Health and Aging in the House of Representatives. He has been called away on urgent ministerial business. Without knowing exactly who they were or the content of their contributions, I wish to thank members for their involvement in this debate. I am sure the contributions varied. I suspect, although I cannot be entirely certain, that the contributions of members on the government side far outweighed the significance, capacity and intellectual rigour of the opposition members’ contributions. I hope that members on the other side addressed the government’s budgetary measures in regard to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I would be disappointed if they did not. I would not be surprised but I would be disappointed if they did not concede that the government’s measures were balanced, reasonable and necessary. It has been an issue of much debate in the House of Representatives during question time, so I will not go over old ground. The argument of the government is simply that to make the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme viable and sustainable into the future for the benefit of many Australians, especially those in the low income area, it must be put on a more secure financial footing.

Their obstruction is deliberate despite their knowing the integrity and urgency of the government’s reforms. It is very disappointing and I think it will come back to haunt the opposition, particularly should they ever, at some time in the future-as far away as it might be imaginable-win government. The other aspect of the portfolio’s business and responsibility is aged care. Here the new minister is taking to the job with great enthusiasm and dedication and already we are seeing a flow of new beds into the aged care sector and new standards of care. Consequently, I believe that even though this is the most pressing financial and social imperative the minister is well on top of his work, as is Senator Kay Patterson. They are two outstanding ministers doing very fine jobs. I will bring my remarks to a close and urge opposition members to come to their senses and support the brave and, above all, enlightened measures of the government. penditure for the Department of Health and Ageing be agreed to.

It seems that, if the Reid electorate produces nothing else, it certainly produces politicians. Going to the question of foreign aid, I refer initially to a comment by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, in May 2001 when he said: Australians believe we should give aid to look after those less fortunate, for humanitarian and moral reasons, and because Australia is wealthy and can afford it. Noble sentiments, but the comments of Mike Steketee in the Australian a year and a half previously were somewhat more accurate. He said: Alexander Downer is particularly proud of Australia’s foreign aid program. He shouldn’t be. Not only has Australia’s foreign aid budget failed to increase in line with our increased wealth, it has fallen by about 15% per head of population since 1967-68. Whilst Australia’s practice is symptomatic of many other nations, it is still nothing to be proud of. Only Denmark, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and Luxembourg today ascribe to 0.7 per cent of GDP that has been the aim-and which is the aim today-of ACFOA.

That represents a very real decline since this government came to power. In our own region we can talk of 800 million people living on less than a dollar a day. We can see that financial assistance overall from wealthy nations declined by 0.4 per cent in the year 1999-2000. Perhaps Africa is not a focus of our foreign aid in a very real sense but its dramatic problems are possibly more in the minds of constituents of my electorate who frequently write to me about foreign aid. If we look at Zambia, for instance, we see a situation where, because of trade policy changes, it has shed 32,500 jobs in factories since 1990. In 1991, they had 140 factories in the textile sector employing over 300,000 people. Today they have eight. The situation is that the country has a debt of $6.6 billion. The repayments are three times what the country spends on primary education. The reality is that illiteracy is growing and school drop-outs are forced to work in essentially a marginal economy. The full-time work force has basically disappeared. These days the textile industry is characterised by the sale of second hand charity cast-offs from the First World. US trade policy, which is having a dramatic effect in Africa, is typified in Burkina Faso. Many rural cotton farmers live on a dollar a day. If it were not distorted by US cotton subsidies, that situation could be improved so that basically half the population could get above the poverty line within six years. That is the reality. While the United States has finally increased its measly foreign aid performance from 0.1 per cent to 0.13 per cent in the last year, the $10 billion in foreign aid pales into insignificance compared with the impact of the subsidisation of its products in Africa, basically impoverishing the farmers of that country. We are also seeing in Australia a very real cut to multilateral aid work and to UN agencies. Quite frankly, the government can talk until the cows come home about the impact of the movement of people internationally but the reality is that, unless people have reasons to remain where they live and unless they have reasonable jobs, education and futures, they are going to press internationally. It is all right for the government to say, ‘We’re going to put up barriers; we’re going to stop people coming.’ Europe can say the same thing, and if they can reduce the problem then so be it. But the reality is that this international movement of the First World, the wealthy countries, to reduce their foreign aid commitment is part of a fundamental problem, and until it is arrested we will continue to have these aid issues. It is also said that in Africa a quarter of the nations are unlikely to meet the target of all of their children being even in elementary school by 2015. This is the size of the international problem. It is all right for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to say a few nice words about our performance, but it is pathetic and it is internationally behind most of the OECD nations. It has declined and it is basically making a very small contribution internationally. the Foreign Affairs portfolio and is a matter for which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Downer, has had principal carriage these last several years. In fact, it was Minister Downer who made a very clear statement in 1996 that the development, signing and ratification of an international criminal court would be a principal human rights objective of the Howard government. It has been a somewhat tortuous process since then. Based on today’s media reports in the Australian newspaper and in other media outlets, it seems that at last the government’s agony has been drawn to a conclusion. It is to be hoped that the government will now proceed to ratify the Rome statute, which establishes the International Criminal Court.",112,Representatives Main Committee
405,Mr Rudd (Griffith) (10.16 A.m.),"The International Criminal Court lies primarily within4120 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 2002 I am saddened that neither the foreign minister nor a representative of the foreign minister appears to be here in the Main Committee to respond to these matters just at the moment. I am sure his advisers are watching on the television monitor, and I send them a hearty cheerio as we proceed through this debate. But the key question, of course, is where Australia’s long term interests lie with the International Criminal Court and how the interests of the international community are best served by it. The reasons for an international criminal court have been long established and are clear. First and foremost, what the world needs and what the world has needed since Nuremberg is a permanent, properly resourced, international criminal court capable of sending a clear message to any would be perpetrator of crimes of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity that they will be apprehended and that this will not be an episodic exercise in which perhaps the international community, depending on the circumstances at the time, may establish an ad hoc tribunal with the intention of doing something about a particular set of war crimes in a particular environment; there is a permanent body which will not cherry pick and which will not be dependent on the prevailing international politics of the time. So the world at large will know that you will be got, you will be apprehended, you will be brought before a tribunal and justice will be meted out to you by the international community on behalf of our common humanity. The world has been demanding for this to occur at least since Nuremberg. A commission was established by the United Nations, I believe in 1948, with a view to establishing an international criminal court. Fifty years of the ebb and flow of international diplomatic negotiations finally culminated in the agreement to the Rome Statute, which was signed by this country and more than 100 others in 1998. Not only does an international criminal court provide a long-term deterrent, a long-term capacity to deal with crimes of this magnitude across the international community; it is also, importantly, designed to create a deterrent against future such crimes occurring. It is not just the existence of a permanent body in The Hague that will do that; it is the fact that the statute requires the incorporation of the entire body of the statute into the national law of those parties that ratify the statute so that the crimes of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes are incorporated into the national statutory regimes of every participatory state, thereby establishing a second level of deterrence. So it is not just the existence of this body of law of an international character but that this body of law is incorporated and driven into the domestic statutes of all participating states; again, establishing a second line of deterrence. If that fails and if in the future we have another Pol Pot, if we have another person of the type of Milosevic-given the nature of the accusations which have been made against himif we have other perpetrators of crimes of such horrendous proportions and magnitude against our common humanity, then justice of a retributive and restorative nature will be meted out to them. Permanence is an important feature of this. We have had ad hoc tribunals, such as the one dealing with the former Yugoslavia and also with Rwanda. But we have had no such tribunal which has dealt with war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Cambodia and in other parts of the world. This provides a powerful, fundamental argument as to why such a body is long overdue in the troubled history of humankind. Those who oppose the International Criminal Court have raised a range of arguments. The principal argument among them is that it results in a limitation of Australian legal sovereignty. (Extension of time granted) The sovereignty argument is advanced along these lines: if we Thursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4121 establish an international body of this nature then, as a matter of logical fact, our legal sovereignty is diminished. There are two principal arguments against that. Firstly, the doctrine of complementarity is alive throughout the statute itself. What it says is that there is a complementary regime between the International Criminal Court in The Hague and the national regimes which will be established to complement it. If a person has a case brought against them in terms of the crimes which fall within the scope of the statute, then under those circumstances in the first instance it is the expectation requirement of participatory states to take those individuals through the domestic legal and judicial processes of that participatory state. It is only under the circumstances where those processes are not applied at any level that mechanisms exist within the statute for such a person to be brought before the international court in The Hague. The doctrine of legal complementarity is a robust one. It is one which has been worked on in great detail with Australia’s negotiators in Rome and with negotiators of other participating states as well. So the notion that, if an Australian here is accused of a crime against humanity there, automatically on the third day they will be hauled before the international court in The Hague, as a matter of some sort of automatic consequence, is a factual nonsense and those people who advance that proposition need to carefully read the provisions painstakingly drafted within the statute itself. I said there were two arguments against the sovereignty approach. The second is this. It is a matter of axiomatic logic that, on each occasion this nation signs any form of international undertaking, as a result of that our sovereignty changes. It has ever been thus. The body of statutory law to which this country has become an adherent since the last war and prior to the last war causes us to enter into a form of shared sovereignty with the rest of the international community on each occasion. It is an axiom. If you have a treaty with another multilateral body, it follows as a consequence that your sovereignty, in small part or larger part, is shared with that international body. When it comes to the other treaties of a non-UN nature, shall we say, such as the ANZUS Treaty, perforce of the existence of the ANZUS Treaty our sovereignty is again shared under the terms of that treaty. We have a shared concept of security with our treaty partners in the United States. So a doctrine of international law, as a definitional concept, means that sovereignty is a shared phenomenon when specific treaty obligations are undertaken. There is nothing novel in that. If there were an objection to it by those who argue the sovereignty argument against the International Criminal Court because Australian sovereignty must be maintained at every level, as a matter of logic that is an argument against withdrawing from all of our international treaty obligations of both a UN nature and a non-UN nature. I have never heard that argument advanced by those who have sought to attack the International Criminal Court. As I said before, it is heartening news that at last the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has decided to save the foreign minister’s bacon on this question. There has been intense dispute and disagreement within the coalition party room on this question. It has been amply reported in the media; there is no particular need to repeat it here at great length. What we have had, though, is a foreign minister who has been found wanting because of the extraordinary statements he has made to the international community and to the parliament of Australia about the automaticity of Australia’s ratification of this instrument-that is, the Rome statutewithout having first sewn together his own party room on it. The first and unqualified statements which the minister issued on the ratification of the International Criminal Court statute were made to the Australian parliament in the year 2000 on two occasions. These were 4122 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 2002 made to the Australian parliament in the year 2000 on two occasions. These were not qualified statements; they were unqualified statements. What we have sought to do as an opposition in the period since then is hold this minister to his word. It was his solemn word to the parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia. His solemn word prior to that was given to the international community when he addressed the United Nations General Assembly, when he said not only that Australia would proceed towards the establishment of an International Criminal Court-which I think by that stage had already been established per force of the actual agreement itself-but that ratification would ensue as well. These definitive statements to the parliament, to the international community and to the parliament of the international community-namely, the United Nations General Assembly itself-were clear-cut, unambiguous undertakings. What we have had since then is an 18month long, drawn out process. (Extension of time granted). It has gone on and on and on, as the government at various levels has sought to bring on board this large phalanx of malcontents within its own ranks on this question. This has been a failure of ministerial responsibility. You cannot make a solemn undertaking to the world, a solemn undertaking to the UN General Assembly or a solemn undertaking to the national parliament without having brought your own party room along with you. The Prime Minister’s role in all of this raises the question as to what happened in 1998 when this statute was signed in the first place. I will address my question to the foreign minister’s advisers. Was the Prime Minister himself consulted in 1998 when the foreign minister, Mr Downer, issued the authorising instructions in order to sign the statute in 1998 or was this some independent foreign policy frolic by the foreign minister himself? My knowledge of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade processes-and I have worked in that department myself in the past-is that you do not proceed to sign any international instrument until ad minima it has been cleared by the Canberra based bureaucracy and ad maxima on questions of substantial international treaty law it has been cleared at the political level as well. It beggars belief and I would ask for the minister or the parliamentary secretary who will respond in this debate to provide some clarification to the House on this very question. When the thing was signed in 1998, did the Prime Minister give it the tick? In his absence did the head of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet give it the tick? Or did both give it the tick? If it was given the tick and approval by the Prime Minister and those representing him within the bureaucracy at the time, it follows as a matter of consistency that that is why the Prime Minister has gone from a position of belief to a position of agnosticism back to a position, it seems this morning, of grudging belief. That seems to be what has occurred. If the foreign minister engaged in a frolic of his own in 1998 then that needs to be a matter of substantive record and I would appreciate clarification from the parliamentary secretary at the table on that very specific point. But, if in order to save the foreign minister’s bacon the Prime Minister has finally agreed that we can now proceed with ratification, that is a good thing for Australia’s national interest. It is a good thing for the international interest as well. The function which we as an opposition have performed throughout this has been to ensure that the foreign minister honoured his word to the international community and to the parliament of Australia. That is why we have raised question after question in this parliament for Thursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4123 the last several weeks. That is why we have sought to put the foreign minister on the spot. That is why we have sought to put the Prime Minister on the spot. That is why we have sought to put the Deputy Prime Minister on the spot. The Deputy Prime Minister, not just the Prime Minister, has issued statements himself in the past, lauding Australia’s leadership in the development of the International Criminal Court statute-the Rome agreement of 1998. He said so in this parliament’s millennium debate in the year 2000 about our broader obligations to the international community and Australia’s commitment to multilateralism. We have the trifecta: a PM on the record in the same debate in the year 2000 lauding Australia’s leadership on the ICC, the Deputy Prime Minister saying the same thing and the foreign minister making more statements than paper could be supplied by the entire national forest estate of the ACT about why Australia should proceed to ratification and signature. Our job in this process has been a responsible one. Plainly those opposite have not liked the questions I and others have asked in the parliament in the course of the last several weeks, but the function we have performed-and I address this again to the minister, because he never seems to want to be in the chamber any time we seek to debate him-is to make the minister honour his commitments, to create sufficient political embarrassment for the minister in the House of Representatives in the Parliament of Australia to make the minister realise that there is no middle course out of it and, more importantly, to make the Prime Minister conclude that there are only two options in this: support your minister-that is, support the foreign minister in his early statements to the parliament and the international community that ratification would proceed; or, in the absence of that, utterly denigrate the standing of your foreign minister and leave him in an invidious position where the only alternative, in terms of one of honour, would be for him to resign as minister. That is the function we have performed. Those opposite have squirmed, they have not liked it, but we have actually acted as a responsible opposition in holding this government to account for its firm public, parliamentary and international undertakings on this important question of Australia’s obligations under international law and our commitment to better global governance as a consequence. What we do not know is where it all goes to from here in terms of whether or not the government will issue some interpretive statement or interpretive declaration at the point at which government’s ratification legislation is advanced. (Extension of time granted) The question, of course, arises as to what sort of interpretive statement is inserted at the point at which the government’s ratification legislation is advanced. This is a matter of continuing concern. Broadly in international law, there seem to be three types of declarations which can be made at the point at which ratification legislation is passed through a parliament and statements by the responsible ministers made. First, there are declarations which are broadly described as ‘procedural’; that is, those which describe the vehicles and bodies which are nominated for cooperation within the statute in question-in this case, the ICC-and how in fact those bodies for cooperation and/or implementation are going to be used in the execution of the specific provisions contained within the statute. Second, there are what would be described as ‘political declarations’; that is, the use of what I would describe as general political rhetoric to make a rhetorical point in order to provide comfort and solace to offended domestic constituencies while not in any fundamental sense affecting the legal content of the statute itself. In other words, a bit of political window-dressing to make those who have been rolled in the coalition party room process on this question feel a bit happier about it in the morning, but not in any substantive sense altering the real content of the statute itself in terms 4124 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 2002 of the provisions of the ratification legislation. The third type of declaration can broadly be described as ‘interpretive’. An interpretive declaration can be of a type which has some substantive qualification of the provisions outlined in the statute itself. The key question here is whether any such substantive interpretive declaration varies as a matter of substance from a specific undertaking contained within the body of the statute itself. This is where we have to pay particular attention to what the foreign minister will come up with in order to provide himself, not with a face-saving device for the international community-that will lie in the actual act of ratification itself-but a face-saving device politically for those in his party room who have argued long and hard that he should not proceed with ratification. The only provision for a substantive reservation from the provisions of the International Criminal Court statute are those outlined in article 124 of the statute, which says: ... a State, on becoming a party to this Statute, may declare that, for a period of seven years after the entry into force of this Statute for the State concerned, it does not accept the jurisdiction of the Court with respect to the category of crimes referred to in article 8that is, war crimeswhen a crime is alleged to have been committed by its nationals or on its territory. A declaration under this article may be withdrawn at any time. That is a specific reservation articulated in article 124. Of those states which have proceeded to ratification, only one so far, I am advised, has actually exercised its options under article 124. The problems with states embarking upon article 124 are, firstly, that it does send out a message to the rest of the international community that for a seven-year period, as that is the maximum period of time stipulated, I am advised, for the period under which a reservation under 124 can operate, war crimes are off the agenda. If Australia was to do that, it would be sending a message to the international community that somehow we were establishing some moral hierarchy between war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide and that war crimes were somehow regarded as a more problematic or lesser category from which Australia could remove itself from its obligations. I think that would be a very poor message indeed. Secondly and more troublingly, it would send a message out to the rest of the international community that this is an acceptable course of action. Of course, there is the overall problem that, if you were to do that, it conveys a subliminal message that this government believes that Australia has something to hide on this question. We take our solace on this question from the Australian Defence Force, not only because of its 100-year long proud professional history in that it has discharged its professional functions in the absence of any charge against it of crimes against humanity, war crimes or genocide but also because of the substantive comment made by the Chief of the Australian Defence Force, where he says the ADF has nothing to fear from the statute in its entirety, not subject to this particular article of reservation being invoked. Apart from 124, the other important article to draw attention to is 120, which says quite unequivocally that no reservations may be made to this statute. It actually completes the symmetry of the logic contained within the convention itself. If you are not doing 124, there is no other way you can go if you choose to have or are seeking to have a substantive reservation from the operational content of the statute itself. (Extension of time granted.) If the foreign minister is saying that the reservation which he has in mind or which the Prime Minister has in mind is something other than procedural, as I outlined earlier in my remarks, or other Thursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4125 than political, as I outlined earlier in my remarks-that is, a face-saving device-and is in fact substantially interpretive and at substantive variation from an operational obligation contained within the statute itself, if it is of that nature, this would be a matter of grave concern and we would need to examine with complete detail what precisely the minister was advancing. If you start to cherry pick as far as this statute is concerned, there are large roll-on implications for the rest of the international community. If a country with Australia’s historical standing on questions of international law were suddenly to wave in the air a substantive reservation which gutted in a substantive respect our obligations under the statute, what is the ripple-on effect in terms of those states which we are most concerned about around the world in terms of their obligations under this International Criminal Court statute? We have an obligation to the international community to own this statute as it stands, not to cherry pick parts of it from which we would seek to separate ourselves. If a substantive reservation were entered, the statute provides areas where impermissible reservations under international law may have objections lodged against them. In fact, a state might invoke article 119(2) of the statute, which requires negotiations, followed by reference to the assembly of states parties and ultimately, it is possible, to the International Court of Justice. One would hope that things never get that far as far as the Commonwealth of Australia is concerned. We wait with interest to see the definitive statement from the foreign minister, given that we have had a certain lack of definition from this foreign minister on this question for some time. We wait most particularly for the detailed text of the reservation statement, the interpretive statement, from the government. We wonder what its content will be-procedural, political window-dressing or something else. That must be subject to detailed scrutiny. I would be most grateful if the parliamentary secretary representing the minister in this debate were able to provide us some information as to the content of the government’s proposed interpretive statement. We would be enormously grateful for that. I am sure the parliament and the country would be grateful to know where precisely the government intends to come out on this. If it is not a substantive reservation, if it is purely political window-dressing, and if we have got through this tortuous process to the end point-whereby the minister has been humiliated into accepting a position whereby the Prime Minister has had to save him and as a consequence save the International Criminal Court statute-then my view on all of that at the end of the day is that all is well that ends well, because Australia’s body of international law and our commitment to international humanitarian law will be enhanced as a consequence. It is a profound pity that we have been through this ugly and sordid exercise on the way through, because the undertakings given originally to both the parliament and the international community should have been honoured and should have been cleared internally within the government’s party room in the first instance. We have seen many ugly debates emerge as a consequence of this. The government has sought to somehow justify this in terms of the proper operation of the treaty process. The treaties committee has looked at this for 18 months. It has been a substantive, long-term investigatory exercise. If there were to be issues cleared within the coalition party room, surely that was the final and most appropriate opportunity for that to occur. Instead it has come down to five minutes to midnight. It is my hope that we get to a stage where we can proceed with substantive legislation to ratify the statute in order to meet the 1 July deadline. I hope that will be the case. I would ap4126 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 2002 preciate clarification from the parliamentary secretary in this debate as to whether that will be the case and whether we will have ratification legislation introduced into this House so that it may be possible for it to be advanced through the Senate in time for ratification to occur. That is an important matter. As a precondition to that we need to have an opportunity to examine the content of the interpretive statement-that is a conditioned precedent. Thank you, Deputy Speaker Price, for the opportunity to address this important matter. We hope that this will be resolved finally in the interests of the Australian community and the international community. We look forward to dealing with the government on the substance of this exercise as soon as possible. We await-and I address my final remarks to the minister’s advisers watching on the monitor-an early copy of the interpretive statement so that we can make a considered judgment on it. (Time expired) (10.41 a.m.)-So far in the debate on the appropriation for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 we have heard the member for Reid and the member for Griffith. FirstlyI will address some of the remarks made by the member for Reid, who unfortunately is not still present in the chamber. He expressed some concern about the level of Australia’s aid program. He quoted a press release from ACFOA indicating that they would like Australia’s aid program to reach 0.35 per cent of GDP. For the benefit of the member for Reid, who has indicated that he believes it is not high enough, I point out that Australia’s aid as a percentage of GDP is still above the donor average of the world. Our current level is 0.25 per cent-although I must say that last year, with the Afghanistan issue and some other expenditure, we actually got to 0.26 per cent. In the budget papers it is 0.25 per cent of GDP. Maintaining 0.25 per cent this year is an increase of three per cent in real terms because, of course, GDP has increased in the meantime. There has been an increase in Australia’s aid budget and it has maintained its level of aid in terms of GDP. As I said, that is above the donor average, which is 0.22 per cent, but it is also considerably above that of the United States and Japan. It is quite interesting that we have seen articles recently in the papers, following the Financing for Development Conference in Monterrey, which congratulated the US for increasing its aid and, at the same time, criticised Australia for not doing the same. However, those articles failed to mention that the US is raising its percentage of GDP from an extremely low base of 0.11 per cent to 0.15 per cent, which is still, as members would agree, considerably below that of Australia’s level of overseas aid. There was also an implied criticism that Australia’s aid is not as effective as it could be. This totally contradicts what has been printed and said about Australia’s aid program not only by Australians and the bilateral countries that receive the aid from Australia but also by the OECD. In 1999, the OECD published a report examining the aid programs of various countries and Australia got an extremely good report as being one of the best deliverers of aid. This is because Australia concentrates its aid in the region it knows best, the Asia-Pacific, its own region. Australia has agreements with the countries in this region on the type of aid that they need to move forward. In this way, Australia’s aid program has done much to reduce conflict situations in the region. Australia has worked in countries such as East Timor and Bougainville in post-conflict situations. I do not think there is anybody in Australia who has not got enormous pride in what we achieved in East Timor not only through our decision to",113,Representatives Main Committee
406,Mrs Gallus (Hindmarsh,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs)Thursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4127 support independence in that country but also in the way we assisted and continue to assist that post-conflict country. After talking about aid the member for Reid moved on to America’s trade policy. On this, I could only agree with the member for Reid. The trade policies of many of the richer nations are impoverishing developing countries. The US farm bill has added to that existing problem. I would like to point out to the parliament today that, overall, $360 billion is spent each year by rich countries in protection of their own agriculture. (Extension of time granted) That is almost $1 billion a day-an enormous amount. It is seven times the amount that those same rich countries spend on their aid programs. I would like to draw a parallel. As an aspirational goal for Australia, the member for Reid put the figure of 0.35 per cent-and that may relate to the European Union’s aspirational goal of 0.35. I remind the member for Reid that that is still an aspirational goal. Even if they reach 0.35, which is highly unlikely, it is nowhere near enough to undo the damage that their agricultural policies are doing to developing countries. Developing countries tend to have most of their production in the agricultural sector. Unless they can export their agricultural products, they will never move to an economic base where they can relieve poverty in their own areas. When attending the International Conference on Financing for Development in Monterrey, it was impressive to hear the developing countries themselves calling for a sensible trade policy and a removal of all those restrictions-subsidies, tariffs and quotas-that are keeping the developing countries out of the markets of the rich countries. These factors keep the developing countries out of the markets of the rich countries and there is also a problem when countries like the US subsidise their own products. This enables the rich countries to export cheaper products into developing countries and to overprice products in those developing countries so that, for instance, in a country like Bangladesh, when someone on a subsistence income buys their weekly supply of rice, they do it on a cost basis and not on a national interest basis. The trade policies of the richer countries are seriously affecting developing countries moving forward out of poverty. The member for Griffith spoke on the ICC. It was very good that the member took so much time to give us his full knowledge of the ICC, and we are all very grateful. As he informed the parliament of many of the details of the ICC, there is no reason for me to go over ground that he has already covered. But I say to the member for Griffith that some of his comments were untoward and clearly not true. He referred to an ‘ugly and sordid’ debate, which is hardly a description of democracy that I would like to put forward. Unlike the Labor Party, the coalition take very seriously their responsibility to the wider Australian public and to listen to all points of view. Of course, we do not have the tradition that they have in the Labor Party of a very small executive who make the decisions-and here I am talking about the party as a whole. In the coalition, we have a much broader church and a much greater willingness to listen to even the most-I do not want to say insignificant-uninvolved member at the branch level. We do not listen to just the heavies at the top; we listen to everybody. Because there was some concern, we felt we needed to air those concerns and, consequently, we had one of the more interesting debates that I have been a part of. I must congratulate my colleagues for the way in which they conducted that debate and for the seriousness with which they took the issue. I do not think it is any secret that I was extremely pleased with the outcome. But, even if the outcome had not 4128 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 2002 pleased me, at least I would have been glad to see that my party was willing to examine issues and not to take them as a fait accompli. I would like to congratulate both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs for the way in which the whole exercise was conducted. (Time expired) Foreign Affairs for her comments. I would like to make a couple of comments in response to her observations. Firstly, on the question of Australia’s overseas development assistance, she represented the Australian government at the Monterrey conference. That was an important conference, which was attended by some 50 heads of state and by some 200 ministers of various governments from around the world. At various stages of the conference, I believe that there were representations from President Bush, Prime Minister Chretien of Canada and President Chirac of France. The parliamentary secretary would know better than I who was there. The fact that the parliamentary secretary was there representing the Australian government was of itself some concern. I make no reflection on her, because it is not her fault that she was sent to represent the government. My criticism goes to the government itself as to why at least the Minister for Foreign Affairs could not find the time of day to attend the conference himself and, had the benchmark been applied which was applied by other governments, why the Prime Minister himself could not have found time to have done so. Symbols in international relations count. When we dispatch a person who is not even a junior minister but a parliamentary secretary to represent the Australian government at a major international conference on development, it sends a symbol to the rest of the world that we are not fundamentally serious about the task-and that is the problem. When it came to the substance of the Monterrey conference, there was a range of undertakings from various governments about what they would do in the future as far as their commitment to ODA was concerned. There was a commitment from the government of the United States that it would increase ODA by some $5 billion-a remarkable commitment. There was also a commitment by the European Union to increasing the proportion of GNI, which the union and member states would be committed to in terms of their contribution to ODA as well. I am advised also that there was a commitment from the government of New Zealand to raise its current contribution to 0.7 depending on the availability of financial resources over time. The point I am making is simply this: the world community was represented at the most senior levels and our country was represented at the most junior levels. That of itself was of symbolic significance. But, on the substance, those represented at the Monterrey conference used the conference as an opportunity to pledge increased effort, by and large, in terms of their contributions to ODA. There were significant statements from the US, from the European Union, from New Zealand and from others. What did we have from Australia? My question to the parliamentary secretary is: did you provide any commitment to the Monterrey conference about increasing Australia’s ODA commitment? I take it from the parliamentary secretary’s silence on that question-though she may answer in a subsequent reply-that we said nothing. That is the point. Symbolically we were represented at a junior level and, in terms of our increased commitment to ODA, there was nothing. That presumably is why the foreign minister could not find time to attend: because he had nothing to say about Australia’s contribution or proposed future contribution. When we look at the numbers and deconstruct them, they are of some significance. Currently, as the parliamentary secretary said quite accurately, our ODA stands at 0.25 of GNI. At the height of contribution to ODA under",120,Representatives Main Committee

What we have seen in the period of the Howard government is an incremental, decreasing effort in our contribution to this important area of international responsibility. When we apply it to the specifics of certain circumstances, it becomes even more acute. This is a government which has talked to us long and hard about the whole problem of asylum seekers in this country. This is a government which has caused every Australian citizen to become concerned about the problem of Afghan asylum seekers in particular. This is a government which has said that, when it comes to Afghan asylum seekers and the problem of boat people, Australians need to be very concerned indeed. If we were to take the government’s rhetoric seriously and apply it to core components of a proper, considered and integrated policy response, what would those responses be? First and foremost it would be addressing the problem of Afghan asylum seekers at source. It goes to the question of the problems of radical underdevelopment and insecurity within Afghanistan itself. I visited Pakistan in December last year and spoke at length with representatives of UN agencies. (Time expired) one of the things that I resent in the parliament is the government’s accusation that somehow Labor members are less patriotic, less nationalistic, than those on the other side of politics. I think we need to put this allegation to rest. We need to put it to one side, because basically it is untrue. I would argue that Labor members are more patriotic than those on the government side. In the broad history of this parliament, one incident stands out above all others. There has been only one serious threat to Australia’s survival, and that was during World War II-a time when the conservative parties fell to pieces, a time when the Tories were unable to govern themselves, let alone govern the nation, and Australians had to turn to a Labor administration, led by John Curtin, to secure our future, to secure our borders, to secure our sovereignty. In the context of Australian sovereignty, we have today, with the decision of the government to ratify the instrument for the ICC, half the government’s own backbench believing that this is an administration that surrendered Australia’s sovereignty. So even their own people are doubting this claim about the patriotic credentials of the Howard government. In terms of sovereignty, we have a Prime Minister who has just come back from the United States with a brown nose, a Prime Minister who has just come back from the United States with a lot of skin off his knees, a Prime Minister who has grovelled and agreed so rigorously with the American administration that he has proved himself to be more American than Australian. Because no Prime Minister who truly believed in our national interest would have so little to say before their Congress about the important issue of the farm bill, about the important issue of protecting Australian farmers, about the important issue of fair and reasonable free trade. So the Prime Minister’s credentials in this regard have been damaged in recent times. I would also argue that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations is more British than Australian. He is, in his values and public statements, more British than Australian: born in Britain, a rigorous supporter of the British monarch-basically hanging out the backside of the British monarch whenever he can. He is more British than Australian in his values and attitudes. On all these issues I stand up for Australian sovereignty, and I say to the people in my electorate that it is the Labor Party that is the patriotic party in this country. We will not sur-",122,Representatives Main Committee

We will not tug our forelock to British institutions and think that British institutions do things better than we can do in this country. In the Australian Labor Party we will not surrender our islands and excise large tracts of Australian land in a surrender to people smugglers. This is what we have got in the parliament today-an act of appeasement to the people smugglers. Rather than a defence of our borders, we have got an act of surrender by the Howard government. I reject out of hand the notion that somehow the government is more patriotic than the opposition. Australian history does not show that; the evidence in the parliament does not show that. On so many issues the government is willing to give away our sovereignty instead of defending it. On the question of border protection, I say to the people in my electorate that I am as solid as a rock. I despise people-smugglers. I despise people who break the rules. I despise people who want to subvert the rule of law in this country. As long as I am the member for WerriwaI will always stand up and defend the very strongest level of border protection, but it has to be effective-common sense border protection: strong but with common sense. There is no value in excising, in giving away, our islands to the people-smuggling rackets. We have to defend our borders, not rub them out. I also say to the people in my electorate that, when it comes to mandatory detention, I fully support the Labor policy, which is an acknowledgment of the need for mandatory detention. Let us not have any claptrap from the government about this particular issue. After all, it was a Labor government, the Keating government, that established mandatory detention in this country; it was not a Liberal administration. This was one of the proud achievements of the Keating administration, and it is a policy that Labor maintains to this day. You do need mandatory detention for the checking and processing of asylum seekers to find out who is genuine and to find out who is not. SoI reject totally these allegations from the government. What we see on the issue before the parliament today, in particular, is the government playing politics. The government are not interested in national interests; they are interested in political interests. One needs only to look at the cold, callous, calculating nature of the immigration minister to see that he is interested only in political advantage, not advantage for the Australian people. I think it is shameful that the government play politics on this issue. If they were true patriots, they would not be playing politics on such an important issue as border protection; they would be standing up and defending Australia instead of surrendering our islands to the people smugglers. (11.02 a.m.)-I will not take up much of the chamber’s time; I will quickly redress two remarks by the member for Griffith. First of all, he clearly does not understand the process of the FfD. Yes, the President of the United States and President Chirac of France did appear at the FfD and they gave set speeches. Most of the work at the FfD is actually done in the roundtables. I inform the member for Griffith that Australia was present at all those roundtables; in fact, our contribution was such that, at one stage, Venezuela, which was head of the G77, said that they had nothing to add to the debate because Australia had led it so well. In relation to the shadow minister’s statement that he finds my presence at the FfD inadequate, I say to the member for Griffith that I in fact have responsibility for Australia’s aid budget. Perhaps he would like to think about who is more appropriate to go to a conference on aid than somebody who has responsibility for Australia’s aid budget.

Since he made his statement about Labor’s fantastic contribution to aid, I actually looked up its record on that. And indeed he was right: it was the first year that Labor came into office that it had such a good record. It is interesting that, out of 13 years, the member for Griffith quoted the first year in office and not the subsequent ones. Indeed, in their first year in office the Labor Party gave $1.775 billion in real terms. By 1990 that had in fact dropped to $1.4 billion. So the record is not as the member for Griffith suggested. It was in fact over that time a decrease of 16 per cent and it never went back up again. I just wanted to put that on the record. Thank you for allowing me these extra comments. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources Proposed expenditure, $853,143,000 Australian economy. It heavily influences economic performance, international competitiveness and, therefore, Australian living standards. The development of a national energy policy is crucial to Australia’s economic and social well-being-a policy that provides competitively priced, secure, diverse, sustainable and environmentally sound sources of energy in a manner which delivers maximum benefits to all Australians. The inherent complexities of the sector makes such policy directives extremely difficult to implement. A policy change in one area has important flow-on effects for the rest of the sector, the broader economy and the wider community. Moreover, it is not a static sector but continues to change and to develop in ways that have implications for all energy users, suppliers and stakeholders. The energy policy debate is one marked by great conflict between economic output and the environment, conflict between fossil fuel dependence and the use of renewable energy sources, conflict between government revenue and investment incentives, conflict between regulation and market forces and their impact on investment. That is why, in my view, the government needs a broader, more overarching approach to energy policy development; not just a COAG review-which the opposition supports-but a more holistic approach to the national energy strategy. The key focus for any national energy strategy should be the development of a national gas market and a national gas pipeline and grid.

I just want to say something very quickly about one particular aspect of gas that we are currently debating in this nation and give the parliamentary secretary an opportunity to share with the House information in relation to the ongoing debate about the gas in the Sunrise fields in the Bonaparte Basin. He could also explain where the government is in its attempts to ensure that that gas is brought onshore for both value adding in an LNG plant and the provision of domestic gas not only into the Northern Territory but also into the south-east gas markets. It would provide greater competition in those markets and, as a result, those markets would have more competitively priced fuel. I would like to say something about that market itself. The future energy demand for gas will be heavily influenced by economic growth, population growth, falling energy intensities and fuel switching. Economic growth is poised to outstrip falling energy intensities, and therefore the net effect will be continued absolute growth in demand for energy, particularly gas. grow by over two per cent a year. Natural gas is expected to grow strongly-three-plus per cent each year-although coal and oil will continue to supply the bulk of our domestic energy needs. Renewables will grow moderately, reflecting recent policy measures. Natural gas’s share of the electricity generation mix is expected to grow from 10 per cent now to 12.1 per cent in 2009-10 and to 18.3 per cent by the year 2019-20. Australia’s exposure to imported crude oil is expected to increase significantly. Although still bullish on natural gas and therefore positive for our national grid, ABARE’s new figures are more conservative than their earlier forecast in 1999, which was for over four per cent. Gas demand growth has been driven primarily by stationary applications such as boilers and kilns in the manufacturing sector and cooking and heating appliances in the residential and commercial sectors. Strong growth now in the use of natural gas is also expected in the iron and steel and basic non-ferrous metal industries and in the use of gas and electricity generation. (Extension of time granted) Much of this will be in the north-east of Western Australia, so it may not add much impetus to the prospects of a national grid. Our gas market growth over recent years has been at a rate of 2.5 per cent per annum, comfortably above the growth rate of most other forms of energy. The national market demand now stands at over 880 petrajoules per annum, which equates to 18 per cent of the primary energy market. This is expected to rise up to 24 per cent by the year 2019-20. That is the picture of what is happening in the national market. I want to turn to the Greater Sunrise field and the prospect of that field being brought onshore to Darwin. I want to share with the House some of the claims that the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory is making about the benefits of bringing that gas onshore not only to the Territory but also to the national economy generally. She claims, based on consulting work done by ASIL, that the project onshore would produce an additional 10,600 jobs nationally and $15 billion in additional national wealth and, more importantly than that, boost gross state product in the Northern Territory by 40 per cent per annum in future years. This would mean a significant boost to the economy of a territory which has historically been and continues to be so economically dependent, including on subsidies by other states. So it will be a win-win situation for all concerned if we are able to get that great source of gas onshore into the Territory. Thursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4133 Some of the projects which hopefully will have the potential to come on stream as a result of that, of course, include the $3 billion aluminium smelter and power station; the Compass and Mount Grace projects; a pipeline to Gove to allow the expansion of Nabalco’s aluminium plant; and the proposed pipeline linking Sunrise gas to Moomba, therefore introducing competition to the eastern states. I know that the government has not been entirely sitting on its hands on this issue. I understand through media reports that Minister Macfarlane did send a delegation to the Northern Territory to discuss these issues with the Northern Territory government and, hopefully, with the venture partners, including Shell, Woodside and Osaka Gas. I question whether enough has been done. I do accept that at the end of the day the development of the Sunrise field will be driven by market forces, and I do accept that Shell has undertaken significant marketing work in the domestic market to determine whether bringing Sunrise onshore will be economically viable. As is so often the case in these matters, we tend to get one side of the story. I hope and trust that the government has been using the resources available to it to cut through all that voluminous paperwork to determine whether it is true that there is not a domestic gas market for Sunrise. The timing of this is becoming fairly critical now. The Bayu Undan field is coming onshore to Darwin to an LNG facility, which is welcome news, but very soon a decision will need to be made on the capacity of that pipeline, which will take Bayu gas to Darwin. The proposal was for Sunrise gas to share that pipeline to Darwin. If the Bayu pipeline is constructed to such capacity so as not to be able to accommodate Sunrise, then we might indeed lose the opportunity to bring Sunrise gas onshore forever. This morning I am inviting the parliamentary secretary to share with the House the government’s views on these issues, the information the government have as a result of their inquiries in the Northern Territory and what attempts they have made to ensure that the gas from Sunrise comes onshore to Darwin for value adding in an LNG plant and for domestic gas purposes. I acknowledge that exporting natural gas from a floating LNG facility is not such a bad thing for Australia. It is a good thing to be exporting our natural gas resources but the overarching responsibility of government is to ensure that that non-renewable resource is developed in such a way as to produce maximum benefit to all Australians. I hope that the government is doing all in its power to ensure that that is the case. and Resources) (11.15 a.m.)-In response to the honourable member for Hunter’s queries about Sunrise gas coming onshore to Darwin, I can assure the honourable member that we are very aware, from a government perspective, of the financial benefits of the gas coming onshore. There has been considerable effort put into having discussions with the various proponents of this project. As the honourable member rightly said, at the end of the day it has to be commercially viable. They have to be able to justify the significant expenditure of bringing it onshore. We are well aware that at the moment there are two different views within the partnerships. Shell, supported by Woodside, has concerns about the viability of it, whereas Phillips has been a very strong proponent of bringing it onshore. We had officials meeting in Darwin as recently as 9 May and I met with representatives of Shell, Woodside and Phillips in Darwin just after that. I do not have my diary, so I do not have the time-but it was about the same",125,Representatives Main Committee
415,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism4134 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 2002 time. At that time. I reinforced that from an economic perspective it would be of immense benefit to Darwin and the Northern Territory in particular and to Australia generally if it were possible to have it brought onshore. I also acknowledged that there were economic concerns. Subsequently, on 16 May, the Sunrise joint venture partners announced that they would be conducting an urgent review-they would be going back and having another look at it. We certainly welcome that. The review, I understand, will be completed in about October before a commercial decision is made about the preferred option. It was encouraging to see comments recently by MIM supporting an onshore option. The loss of the Methanex project to Western Australia was a bit of a blow. You mentioned Nabalco and Gove: the Northern Territory Power and Water Authority were also expressing an interest in this gas. One of the things that came out in the discussions that I had with the representatives is that there are a lot of projects or claims of interest but unfortunately there is not a lot of ink on the paper at the moment. It would certainly help if some of the groups that were expressing a very strong interest went a little bit further in committing themselves to the project, because at the end of the day that is what is going to make that decision. I actually raised this with representatives of the Northern Territory, suggesting that maybe they could encourage some of those that have an interest in it to be a little bit more committal. Given that there is that review happening at the moment, I think there would be an opportunity for them to consider that within the commercial reality. to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources agrees that the delivery of Sunrise gas onshore would be more beneficial to the Australian economy than a floating LNG facility, but I have to say that he was fairly vague in his responses. I welcome the fact that he met with the venture partners on 9 May, and I share with him the joy that Woodside and Shell had indicated their preparedness to review the situation and report back by October this year. I do wonder, though, what implications that has for the Bayu Undan pipeline, and if the parliamentary secretary has any information about that he might be able to share that with the House. I acknowledge too recent comments by MIM and the hope that it will bring Domgas onshore to provide that more competitively priced gas not only to MIM but to the wider market. WhatI would like to hear, if I can, from the parliamentary secretary is whether the government has or will have any involvement in the review of the joint venture partner decision to go with the floating LNG facility. For example, has the government indicated that it might be prepared to give commercial support in some way to the project? For example, has the government been engaged in discussions about depreciation caps? For example, has the government partly delivered on depreciation caps in the context of Sunrise? If so, does he expect that Woodside and Shell and the other venture partners will be now factoring in any impact that caps would have on the viability of the project? and Resources) (11.22 a.m.)-I will deal firstly with the latter questions. With regard to what we are able to offer, I understand that some time ago Phillips were awarded a major infrastructure facility by the Commonwealth government. In doing this, of course, the Commonwealth opened options there, should they require them. There certainly have not been any additional requests from the partners. Certainly from the meeting that I had I am not aware of",127,Representatives Main Committee

With regard to the depreciation of pipelines, I am sure the honourable member would be aware that the government decided that the statutory 20-year cap should be applied to gas transmission and distribution assets, with a statutory cap of 15 years for oil and gas production assets. That was welcomed very much by the industry. I am aware that there has been some suggestion that there is some opposition to that, and that would concern me. I know the honourable member has been very supportive of this initiative, and it is certainly needed to provide that incentive for what are huge amounts of investment in this industry. I had to seek some advice with regard to the Bayu Undan project. The honourable member will be aware that on 20 May Australia and East Timor signed a Timor Sea treaty, an exchange of notes for provisional arrangements until entry into force of the treaty and the memorandum of understanding on an international utilisation agreement for the Greater Sunrise fields. These documents underpin the continued exploration and development of that area. It is important for both nations that we continue to provide a climate that attracts investment, particularly in the Bayu Undan and the Greater Sunrise developments. Early stage development of the Bayu Undan field has commenced, with revenues expected to flow from 2003. The gas from the field will be processed onshore for export from Darwin, providing substantial downstream benefits for Australia and greater export revenue. I hope that answers some of your queries. Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources for that information. I can assure him that Labor’s decision to refer to a Senate committee the government’s position on the implementation of statutory caps on depreciation should not be read as opposition to that part of that bill but rather as an exercise in securing more information about the impact of that proposition on the Commonwealth budget. Even more particularly, we are seeking a sectoral breakdown of the impact of that initiative on the budget-for example, how much of that money by way of depreciation would go to the aviation sector and how much would go to the oil and gas sectors. I am intrigued that the parliamentary secretary has shared with us the view that the venture partners in Sunrise feel that nothing more is required other than the establishment of a sound domestic market. I understand that this is a chicken and egg situation. You have people on one side saying, ‘We would come if the gas were there,’ and people on the gas side saying, ‘We would come if we knew the industry was going to be there.’ Given that the government has costed its initiative on statutory depreciation effective life caps at something like $400 million over five years and $1.9 billion over 10 years, the government must have some view as to what would be the likely rate of additional investmentwhich would, of course, drive those costs-and whether the government had factored into those costs the possibility that the Sunrise field gas might come onshore. and Resources) (11.28 a.m.)-I am sorry; I do not have those figures on me. Dr EMERSON (Rankin) (11.28 a.m.)-I have a number of questions in relation to key programs that have been cut or frozen in the portfolio. The first is in respect of the R&D Start program.

In respect of the R&D Start program, I am very keen to know how many companies had applications in the pipeline at the time new applications under the R&D Start program were suspended. I would be keen to know whether there are any plans to compensate those businesses for the resources they put into their applications for the R&D Start program or at least whether it is contemplated that the government will put them in the front of the queue when the R&D Start freeze actually thaws. I am keen to know why the decision was made to freeze the program and what alternatives to freezing it were considered. I would also like to know when AusIndustry was made aware of the freeze in the R&D Start program because there was a considerable period during which the minister was saying one thing and AusIndustry, to its clients, was saying another thing. There certainly seemed to be a disjunction there. Is it true, as we have been told by a number of companies, that AusIndustry was still encouraging applications in the weeks and months leading up to the suspension or to the freezing of the R&D Start program? Why would applications be encouraged when a decision was imminent or had already been taken to freeze it? I would like to know the extent of cost over-runs in the program and whether that was the basis for the freeze. I am keen also to know whether applicants for the program were required to develop expenditure plans with milestones before they started receiving funding. If that is the case, and I believe it is, shouldn’t these plans and milestones have provided some indication of the forthcoming funding requirements so that the government could look to fund those applications? There is a range of questions in relation to the R&D Start program. The parliamentary secretary may be able to help us with those. WhatI should do within the time is go on to a couple of other programs so we may be able to get a more comprehensive response. I turn now to the Printing Industry Competitive Scheme and the Enhanced Printing Industry Competitive Scheme-PICS and EPICS-both of which were abolished in the budget. I would like to know when the minister decided to abolish the two schemes and what roles, if any, the department of finance and the minister for finance had in those decisions. Isn’t it the case that EPICS had a key role in the government’s action agenda for the printing industry, Print 21? Was EPICS part of the GST compensation package negotiated with the industry in 1999 when the government introduced a GST on books? Didn’t PICS implement an election commitment from the 1998 election? What will be the impact of the abolition of these two schemes? How will the 64 companies with lapsed EPICS applications be affected? Are there any plans for compensation? And why is it that applications lodged under PICS before the budget announcement would be honoured but only applications that were approved under ence there? Finally, to summarise, isn’t it true that these two schemes were solid election commitments in the case of PICS and, in the case of EPICS, compensation for the GST? How can the government justify breaking its promises in relation to those? I will come back to the strategic investment coordination program when we get some response on those two matters from the parliamentary secretary. and Resources) (11.33 a.m.)-As the honourable member for Rankin rightfully said, there is",129,Representatives Main Committee
420,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, TourismThursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4137 quite a bit of detail that he requires on both of those questions. It is just not available to me at the moment, but we will of course take on board both issues. With R&D Start we will need to seek advice from both the department and the minister’s office on the various questions he has asked with regard to the number of companies involved and why the decision was made. The same with PICS and EPICS-there is no way that I would have available to me at the moment information on how the companies will be impacted. That is information that I will seek. I will get back to the honourable member with the details on those various questions. Dr EMERSON (Rankin) (11.34 a.m.)-I now move on to the strategic investment coordination program. I am interested in getting some information on the criteria against which applications for funding under the strategic investment coordination program are judged. What is the level of transparency in these criteria? Which applications have been approved and how many applications have been rejected? I do not necessarily seek the names of the project proponents for applications that have been rejected, but I would like to know how many have been rejected. I would also be interested in knowing whether there were applications that were supported by the strategic investment coordinator but ultimately rejected by the government. Again, I am more interested in knowing the number of applications, not necessarily the names of the applicants. In relation to the strategic investment coordinator and the coordination program, when the Ralph review came down, the government removed accelerated depreciation but indicated that for companies that regarded accelerated depreciation as important to future ventures there could be scope under the strategic investment coordination program either to restore accelerated depreciation or to compensate those particular companies for the loss of accelerated depreciation. I would like to know whether any companies have applied under the strategic investment coordination program for either the restoration of accelerated depreciation or compensation for the loss of accelerated depreciation, and what outcomes have emerged as a result of any such applications. Obviously, I would be keen to know the number of such applications. I will now move on to the South Australian project called SAMAG. Can we get some information as to why the AMC proposal in Queensland was supported? I am happy to say that I was pleased with the decision to support the AMC proposal in Queensland, but the SAMAG proposal in South Australia was for a similar plant, as we understand it, for Port Pirie, and it was not supported. It was rejected by the government. Again, we understand the government has said that there is room for two magnesium plants in Australia. If that is the government’s position, why did it reject the South Australian project? Could we get some indication of what advice may be provided to the South Australian project proponents of any other assistance schemes? I would like to know the basis of the rejection and where those proponents might go from here. My final question is in relation to the freeze on the R&D Start program. It raises the question as to whether there are any other departmental or AusIndustry programs subject to slowing down or freezing, like that experience for the R&D Start program. In particular, is the freeze? and Resources) (11.37 a.m.)-Again, the honourable member for Rankin is seeking very spe-",130,Representatives Main Committee

Again, I will have to seek that advice on notice, as I will with the SAMAG issues that you raised. It is just not available to me at the moment. As for the other programs, again, I will seek that advice from the department. I will get back to you in a timely manner and provide you with the details you require. sider in detail the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 and to seek a response from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. I want to highlight, coming from Moncrieff, Australia’s premier tourist destination of the Gold Coast, the significant benefits the Gold Coast region has been able to take advantage of as a result of a very good budget. There are two principal elements. The first is the general emphasis in the budget on the advantages of having Australia recognised as a safe destination. The second key element in this budget that has benefited the Gold Coast directly is the focus on increased funding that has been made available to the tourism industry and in particular the $50 million that will be spent over the next five years on a number of key tourism initiatives. These include the additional expenditure of $24 million for the Australian Tourist Commission, $8 million for the See Australia program and $8 million for the Regional Tourism Program. I seek from the parliamentary secretary some outline, in particular for the See Australia program and the Regional Tourism Program, of how the Gold Coast and tourism operators on the Gold Coast may seek to benefit directly as a result of this additional expenditure. I can say that the seat of Moncrieff-and Surfers Paradise on the Gold Coast, in particular-really is the focal point of the tourism industry in Australia. As a result of the success that we have had, the Gold Coast enjoys over five million visitors each year and on average they stay for four nights. This injects some $3.1 billion directly into our local economy and represents some 25 per cent of our local GDP. It employs directly some 36,000 people and indirectly a much higher number than that. It is little wonder that the Gold Coast really is rapidly growing-and we have seen, as a result of the latest census, that the Gold Coast is the fastest growing region in the country. It is expected that by the year 2011 there will be over 550,000 people living in the city. TodayI seek to take advantage of a response from the parliamentary secretary on a number of key areas that the tourism industry would like some additional focus on. The Gold Coast’s tourism industry is heavily reliant on inbound tourism. Although it has benefited from a budget that has helped deliver Australia, in terms of perception, as a safe destination, the Gold Coast tourism industry remains very reliant on a long-term sustained increase in inbound tourism. I seek the parliamentary secretary’s comments on the approved destination scheme and the way in which it operates and will benefit the Gold Coast. There are two major inhibitors to continued growth for the tourism industry on the Gold Coast. Those two principal inhibitors are airline capacity and investment in infrastructure. I would like to raise for the parliamentary secretary’s consideration the first issue of airline capacity. The Gold Coast suffers as a result of a very limited capacity in and out of the Gold Coast Airport and Brisbane Airport. It would seek to have an increase in capacity and, al-",131,Representatives Main Committee
422,Mr Ciobo (Moncrieff) (11.38 A.m.),"I seek to take advantage of the opportunity to conThursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4139 though these types of decisions are commercially driven, and should be driven by the marketplace, there may be opportunities for the federal government to directly assist to make it either more commercial or more attractive for airlines to operate additional airline capacity into Gold Coast Airport and into Brisbane Airport. The other issue is the requirement for greater investment in infrastructure. I use the term ‘investment’ very deliberately. Unlike other regions in Australia, it is important to recognise that any investment in infrastructure in tourist areas really does reap dividends for the Commonwealth. I would like to bring to the parliamentary secretary’s attention the direct benefits that flow from government spending that is an investment in infrastructure. It is important to recognise that one of the primary drivers of tourism-and especially inbound tourism-is the need for a destination to have a constant rejuvenation of its supply side services, a constant rejuvenation of those various activities, services and attractions that flow as a result of increased infrastructure investment and also, especially, a good public transport system and investment in roads. I would seek the parliamentary secretary’s response on that. Finally, I would just like to raise the issue of the 10-year plan. I commend the parliamentary secretary and the minister for bringing together the fourth white paper that this government has issued since it was elected in 1996 and for its strong focus on developing a coherent and very clear plan in consultation with the tourism industry about the future direction of tourism. I would be most interested in the parliamentary secretary’s response to how the Gold Coast in particular-but more broadly, the Australian tourism industry-is responding to and moving with government to develop good public policy in relation to the 10-year plan. Thank you. (Time expired) propriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03, and it particularly concerns the area of tourism. My concern can be expressed this way: whilst we of course must, in relation to the appropriations and the performance of the government programs, at all times be concerned to ensure that we promote tourism and encourage overseas and internal tourism wherever possible, we also should be alive to the costs and have regard to the infrastructure strains that sometimes do arise. I am particularly concerned in respect of my electorate at recent stresses that have been placed on the infrastructure in terms of roads, public transport and more mundane issues, such as parking, the availability of public facilities, the cleanliness of streets and associated street crime in the area of Bondi Beach and the suburb of Bondi. The infrastructure costs arising from the promotion of, and increase in, tourism in some parts of Australia-and Manly and other places have been mentioned as well-do need to be addressed when we are putting forward a thoroughgoing tourism program. I ask the minister-and I am grateful that the parliamentary secretary is present and I ask him to have regard to this issue-to ensure that those infrastructure issues are addressed when we put into place the tourism program that will be part of the appropriations. However, the states and local government must not ignore their responsibilities. Leadership can be shown by the Commonwealth but, at the end of the day, the various infrastructure programs that need to be put in place are very much part of the responsibilities of state and local governments. They cannot seek to deflect those responsibilities by blaming the Commonwealth. All three levels of government need to work together but, critically, the state governments-and in particular the New South Wales government-need to address the major concerns that I have raised. I support the appropriations and commend them to the parliament.",132,Representatives Main Committee
423,Mr King (Wentworth) (11.44 A.m.),"I wish to speak only briefly on one aspect of the Ap4140 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 2002 and Resources) (11.47 a.m.)-I welcome the comments of the member for Moncrieff and the member for Wentworth with regard to tourism and tourism initiatives. They are quite understandable, in both members’ cases. The Gold Coast is certainly a premier tourism destination in Australia known by all. To address some of the issues that the member for Moncrieff raised, the See Australia program has been extremely successful and is something that we need to continue to focus on, given that 75 per cent of all tourism in this country is domestic. A very large portion of those domestic tourists travel regularly to the Gold Coast. The See Australia program is something that we see as a means of continuing to encourage domestic tourism. We need to encourage more, because 30 per cent of Australians still do not take a holiday. If we can encourage a greater percentage of such people to take one, that is certainly an opportunity to increase domestic tourism. There has been an additional $8 million allocated through the budget over the next four years to continue to promote the See Australia campaign. As for what we can do, the Regional Tourism Program is something in which I am sure some of the constituents in your region could be involved. We had the first announcements only last week. There were 29 successful applicants. Between them, $2 million in Commonwealth funding was allocated to assist in the development of a diverse range of product to accommodate the increased numbers that will be coming in as the tourism industry continues to go from strength to strength. Funding for the Regional Tourism Program will be over a four-year period, and I would encourage your constituents to apply to this program. While it is competitive, it is spread right around the country and there is good opportunity there to access some support. It is quite unprecedented for that sort of Commonwealth funding to go into individual destination projects, and so I would encourage your constituents to get involved. You are right when you raise issues regarding the need for constant rejuvenation of product so that it does not get tired. You are also very right about the aviation issues: if they are not functioning properly, regional aviation in areas like Coolangatta in particular will suffer badly. So this is something we need to make sure we have in place. Of course, you have an international destination there as well. You mentioned the 10-year plan. I think a lot of the questions you were asking are being asked by the industry itself. With regard to the 10-year plan and the 202 questions that have been asked, I will refer some of my response to the member for Wentworth, because this is going to deal with a lot of those issues. These questions are specifically being asked. You talked about investment and about what government can do. The question is in there: what can government do? That 10-year plan has been embraced overwhelmingly by industry. We will have the first submissions finalised by the 28th of this month. It will then be considered and a green paper will come out in about September. That will then go back to industry and will come out as a white paper. It will be only the fourth white paper from this government and, certainly, the first one for tourism. There are great opportunities there. We will also identify a range of opportunities, particularly with regard to investment in infrastructure. This has been a major problem. (Extension of time granted) One of the areas of opportunity identified for infrastructure is superannuation funds. At the moment, there is something like one per cent of superannuation funds-and we are talking in the vicinity of something like $600 billion in superannuation funds. These funds are growing very significantly and very quickly and are looking for opportunities for investment. So the minister is",133,Representatives Main Committee
424,Mr Entsch (Leichhardt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry, TourismThursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4141 very much of the view that there would be great opportunities. For example, if we were to increase the investment in tourism infrastructure through these superannuation funds to an equivalent amount of our GDP, close to five per cent, we would be looking at an automatic increase of something like $28 billion becoming available for investment in tourism infrastructure. So there is some serious work being done on that at the moment. I know that some of the large banking and superannuation organisations are looking at putting in a submission. There are issues such as security of investment and returns et cetera, but a lot of these funds are now looking at what they call the triple bottom line: it is not just an economic return; it is a social return and it is an environmental return. I think this may well put ecotourism and the development of product in that area in a very good position. You talked about encouraging overseas visitors to Australia, and a major role is being played by our inbound tourism operators who have, again, embraced this very enthusiastically. They will be dealing with a range of issues, including visas et cetera. Also, the 10-year strategic plan does not have just industry, tourism and resources involvement. There are 16 various departments involved in this, right through the whole spectrum. In my own area, a number of these submissions are almost completed. I know that would also be the case from a national perspective. I am sure both the member for Moncrieff and the member for Wentworth would be actively involved in encouraging tourism groups within their own electorates to put in these submissions. I am pleased to see that they are both playing a very active role in making this happen. I believe this is the biggest thing that has ever happened in the tourism industry. It is presenting a great amount of opportunity. It gives us, as a government, an opportunity to be totally focused and to work in partnership with industry. As the member for Wentworth rightfully said: when we talk about infrastructure like roads et cetera, it is not just a Commonwealth responsibility; it is also a state government, a local government and an industry responsibility. It is a matter of us working together. I think this will give us the opportunity to do that. Proposed expenditure agreed to. Attorney-General’s Department Proposed expenditure, $1,779,689,000. placed on yesterday’s Notice Paper, because it goes to the heart of a serious matter in terms of the public interest. That question relates to a number of recent media reports that appeared in the Courier Mail and to a series of questions that I have run on the Notice Paper over the past two years concerning the current state of health of former Senator Malcolm Arthur Colston. This is a very serious issue. In 1999, the Director of Public Prosecutions determined that there was a prima facie case that former senator Malcolm Colston should stand trial on 28 charges of defrauding the Commonwealth through travel rorts. This caused great public outrage at the time. It gives all members of parliament a very bad name because of the serious nature of the issues associated with these charges. If protecting public revenue is not in the public interest, I do not know what is. It is a fact that, in May 1999, I was able to establish that former Senator Colston was examined by two so-called expert medical specialists. From my questions on the Notice Paper, I was able to establish from the reports by the specialists that former Senator Colston had, at best, only months to live. He was clearly terminally ill.",134,Representatives Main Committee

I do not know how well he is, and I do not wish ill of former Senator Colston, but I think it is in the public interest that he be examined at the earliest opportunity to establish the truth of his medical condition and of his capacity to stand trial. The so-called eminent expert medical specialists who examined him in May 1999 concluded that he would never be fit to stand trial. Those specialists were either lying or they were incompetent, or perhaps they should be nominated for the Nobel prize for medical science because Dr Colston, three years and one month down the track, is still alive. You would think, because of Dr Colston’s protestations through his family that he is terminally ill, that he would want to clear the record and make himself available to new specialists who have never previously examined him to establish the veracity of his state of health. I draw to the Attorney-General’s attention question No. 555. It is a serious matter in the public interest, because it is all about protecting public revenue and it also reflects on the integrity of all members of the federal parliament. If you have a look at the history of this particular case, you see that the charges relating to Senator Alston-sorry; to former Senator Colstonmination to change cross-media ownership laws and allow newspaper proprietors to own newspapers, television stations and radio stations in the one market. I know the member for Hinkler, who is sitting here at the table, understands that well. But we will get to that next week. I want to get back to this very serious issue. It is important in the public interest to establish the true state of health of former Senator Malcolm Colston. As I said, if he were well enough, I am sure that he would be very happy to make himself available to independent specialists who have never previously examined him-and that is the nature of my question No. 555-to establish his state of health at this point in time. I call on the Attorney-General to prosecute this matter at the earliest opportunity and have the DPP arrange for former Senator Colston to be examined as soon as possible to settle this matter once and for all, because it is giving us all a bad reputation. (Extension of time granted) Are there any officers of the Attorney General’s office here this morning to take up my concerns? If no officer is here, I would ask that a request be made to the Attorney-General to come into the House and explain why the DPP is not prosecuting this matter. As I said, it is germane to the public interest because, quite plainly, the doctors-the so called eminent medical specialists who examined him three years ago-are either lying or incompetent, or else they should be given the Nobel prize for medical science, because Dr Colston has certainly defied medical science if he was expected not to survive more than a few months and it is now more than three years later. Clearly there is something wrong, and this matter should be looked at as a matter of urgency. stration) (12.03 p.m.)-I am representing on short notice the Attorney-General, who I under-",135,Representatives Main Committee

430,Mr Slipper (Fisher,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and AdminiThursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4143 stand is participating in a media conference at this point in time. I am very pleased to be able, on his behalf, to sum up. I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate. The Attorney is a particularly diligent minister and likes personally to be present at events such as this, because he takes a very keen and close interest in all that happens in relation to the Attorney-General’s portfolio. I suspect that that is broadly accepted and broadly appreciated right across the chamber amongst political parties represented in this place. In the 2002-03 budget, the government announced that it will provide $789.3 million over four years for initiatives in the Attorney-General and Justice portfolios. Funding of $184.2 million for 2002-03 for these initiatives is included in Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-03 and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2002-03. This major funding boost will greatly strengthen national security and the protection of Australians from terrorist attacks. It will also enhance our border protection and law enforcement capabilities and continue to encourage better use of our courts and alternative methods of dispute resolution. Following the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States, the government has acted quickly to bolster Australia’s counter-terrorism arrangements. Building on a range of previously announced measures, the 2002-03 budget provides new funding of $426.6 million over four years in the Attorney-General and Justice portfolios to strengthen Australia’s ability to combat terrorism. In the 2002-03 budget, the government has also fully delivered on its election commitments to make Australia a safer, more secure place for all; to further strengthen the protection of our coastlines, ports and airports; to continue the fight against drugs; and to pursue innovative ways to make it easier for Australians to solve their legal problems. We will continue to build a safer, more secure Australia by providing an extra $124.2 million over four years to the Australian Federal Police. This will be used to protect Australia from transnational crime such as terrorism, people-smuggling and drug trafficking and to expand the AFP’s research and development capabilities. We will provide $11 million over four years for the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence to enhance its analytical and predictive crime capability. We will also provide $1 million extra funding over four years to the Attorney General’s Department to support the highly successful National Crime Stoppers Network. To strengthen the protection of our coastline, ports and airports, the Australian Customs Service will receive an extra $175.8 million over four years to double its National Marine Unit’s surveillance and response capacity and to purchase additional container and pallet Xray machines. Coastwatch surveillance flights monitoring Australia’s approach routes will be expanded, and communication capability will be enhanced. The AFP will acquire five small boats to allow the Indonesian National Police to patrol extensive areas within the Indonesian archipelago, with particular focus on areas identified as havens for people-smuggling activities. An extra $1.5 million will be provided over four years. To strengthen the Prime Minister’s Tough on Drugs initiative, the AFP will receive $4.7 million over four years to extend the National Heroin Signature Program to include tracking the origins of cocaine and amphetamines. To make it easier for Australians to solve their legal problems, the 2002-03 budget provides $27.2 million to fund ongoing community based counselling and mediation services, $5.3 million to continue to support community legal services in rural and regional areas and $1.3 million to continue the operation of Australian Law Online. (Extension of time granted) In addition, an extra $9.8 million will be provided to the royal commission into the failure of the 4144 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 2002 HIH Insurance Group, to take into account the extension of the completion date from 30 June 2002 to 28 February 2003. The High Court of Australia will receive $900,000 to fund activities celebrating the centenary of its first sitting. On behalf of the Attorney-General, I would like to thank members who participated in this debate, and I commend the bill to the House. mentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration has arrived here in time to represent the Attorney-General. The parliamentary secretary, with great respect, would not be aware of the matter that I was raising, which I would ask him to take back to the Attorney General. It relates to my question No. 555, which appeared yesterday on the Notice Paper. It is a matter that is germane to the public interest because it is all about protecting public revenue; specifically, it relates to the state of health of former Senator Malcolm Arthur Colston. I was saying in this chamber just a moment ago that two so-called eminent expert medical specialists examined Dr Colston in May 1999 and determined that he had only months to live and was not fit to stand trial on 28 charges of defrauding the Commonwealth through travel rorts. I want to make it quite clear that I do not wish ill of Dr Colston, but it is plain from the media reports and from some of the utterances of his family that clearly he is not capable of standing trial. But the doctors who examined him in May 1999 determined that he was possibly capable of surviving for another three months. Those so-called eminent expert medical specialists were lying or incompetent, or they deserve the Nobel prize for medical science for keeping Dr Colston alive. This gives all of us in this House a bad reputation because the naston never left Queensland in relation to some of those charges and claimed thousands of dollars of travel allowance. He should be given his day in court in the public interest to have his name cleared if he believes he is innocent and if he is capable of standing trial, because all the anecdotal evidence suggests that he is. He and his family are insisting that he is innocent. If that is the case, and if he is not just relying on those so-called expert independent medical specialists who examined him three years ago, you would think he would make himself available. The thrust of my question, arising from reports in last weekend’s Courier-Mail, was to the effect that in the public interest he should be given that opportunity. AllI am asking the Attorney-General to do is to crack the whip with the Director of Public Prosecutions to have Dr Colston rounded up and have him examined by two new independent expert medical specialists who have had nothing to do with his case in the past, so that once and for all we can settle this grave matter in the public interest and put it to bed. It is a very serious matter which has been going on and on, and the Courier-Mail, as late as last Monday, had an editorial making it quite plain that this matter should be settled. If you could take that back to the Attorney-General and ask him to answer my question and get the DPP cracking on this one straight away, I am sure that the public of Australia will greatly appreciate that. stration) (12.13 p.m.)-Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I thank the member for Lowe for his question.

434,Mr Murphy,"I don’t know. He might like to examine former Senator Colston. I reckonThursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4145 cine, it was indeed a very precise and accurate art. The member for Lowe mentioned that Dr Colston is the subject of charges, not allegations. As a person who has practised law, I should point out that, under our system of justice, everyone is innocent until proven guilty. Charges are, in fact, allegations that are usually tested in the court. No-one can suggest that anyone is guilty until such time as a court of law has determined that. I heard earlier that the member for Lowe had raised the question of Dr Colston’s fitness to stand trial. In response, I am pleased to be able to advise him of the circumstances as I understand them. The DPP discontinued the prosecution of Dr Colston because, in the light of medical evidence, there was no prospect of this matter being able to proceed to trial. The Director of Public Prosecutions advised the Attorney-General that in March 2001 he reviewed the position, which confirmed that Dr Colston was still unfit to stand trial and that there was no prospect that he would become fit to stand trial. Dr Colston’s health, the Attorney is advised, has deteriorated since the prosecution was discontinued and this deterioration is expected to continue. The DPP has previously indicated that he would, if necessary, review the matter in the future. I also want to reassure the honourable member for Lowe that, as with any prosecution, this matter has been dealt with independently by the Director of Public Prosecutions in accordance with the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth. So it is not a political decision; it is a decision that has been arrived at independently by the Director of Public Prosecutions exercising his duty. I am happy to pass the honourable member’s comments on to the Attorney-General personally, but the situation as I have advised him is the situation as we understand it to be. parliamentary secretary just said. Back in May 1999 Dr Colston was given only a few months to live by the so-called ‘eminent expert medical specialist’ and he has been deteriorating and deteriorating ever since. In the public interest, in terms of the issues that I have raised, we should have that opinion tested by other experts who have never examined him previously. stration) (12.16 p.m.)-Very briefly, if that is the point of view that the honourable member for Lowe has, then maybe he should communicate with the Director of Public Prosecutions.

The minister’s media adviser made some comments in response to me on Sunday and Monday, suggesting that I was simply trying to deny a legitimate employer access to the New Apprenticeships scheme and that there had been no allegations about any misbehaviour by the Geelong Football Club.

438,Mr Cox (Kingston) (12.17 P.m.),"I raise with the minister at the table, the Minister for4146 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 2002 really should fit within the definition of a new apprentice. I am aware that there are many young Australians who miss out on training opportunities at TAFE because there are not sufficient funds available for them to get into entry level courses for trades and occupations. There is quite a queue for those things. I wonder whether it would not be advisable to put some kinds of guidelines around this scheme that would stop it being used for people who are highly skilled and have salaries of $400,000. The article also raised some issues which I thought were dubious and did bear some investigation by the minister or his department. The Geelong Cats’ chief executive, Brian Cook, said the club would benefit from a sponsorship arrangement with Corpfit-which I understand is the training provider for these players-and in return had to provide a set number of trainees. That leaves me wondering whether an organisation that is paying a club’s sponsorship and then receiving a certain number of trainees and support from Commonwealth grants for those trainees is doing that for the purpose of providing training or for the purpose of providing sponsorship and having it paid for by the Commonwealth. I would be most grateful if the minister would respond to that. It seems to me that this is an area where definitions need to be tightened up in relation to what is an eligible trainee. There ought to be some kind of guidelines to deal with inappropriate arrangements between employers and training organisations where the actual purpose of the commercial arrangement between the two is something other than providing training. The other issue that I wanted to test the minister on is the budget decision to stop Commonwealth funding for state ITABs. Considerable effort was expended in estimates committees to get an explanation from officials of ANTA as to what the policy motivation for that was. I have seen some correspondence, from various people involved in training and state ITABs, that suggested that this decision was taken against ANTA advice. The minister might like to clarify that point. The ANTA officials that were questioned on it at estimates simply said that it was a budget decision. They did not comment on it further. I do not know whether a budget decision means that it is a decision that defies sensible explanation or not. I would welcome the minister’s clarification on that point. you for the $360,000 committed to the establishment of a graduate diploma in Environment and Planning at the University of Tasmania. There was little else in this 40-year vision budget that I thought would give anyone great cause for joy in terms of education. I am particularly concerned at the moment about the whole issue of the deregulation of university fees and payments, because of an issue that I have mentioned to you before. That is the whole question of incentives for people to go on to further education. The cost to people of being educated is rising. If we look at the support mechanisms that exist to allow people to get into higher education and to continue education, the income threshold benchmarks are so low that you really have to be on a very low income in order to get that support. The whole question of benchmarks in terms of income should be looked at. The whole question of independence by around the age of 25 but being at home and dependent on your parents is another issue that we need to look at. Minister, the issue I would like to raise specifically with you is one I have raised in the House several times. How do we go about supporting people who receive no financial support from the Commonwealth nor any other financial support for their education but who must live away from home in order to study? I specifically mention people who must leave the north-",139,Representatives Main Committee
439,Mr Sidebottom (Braddon) (12.22 P.m.),"Thank you for being here, Minister. I thankThursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4147 west coast, where I come from, and go and study in Hobart, Launceston, Melbourne or anywhere else, because they cannot do their courses where they live. It strikes me that the inequity here is based on geography and a lack of access to education. That could represent a $10,000 differential between those people who have the same economic circumstances in Hobart, Launceston, Melbourne or Sydney and those people who come from my regional area. I believe that $10,000 differential is an important inequity in our system. I believe that, in terms of fairness, we should at least look at somehow supporting those families and those students by some form of recognition of that differential, even if it is in the form of a tax rebate or a claim on accommodation. If it is a $10,000 differential based on geography, I believe that is totally unfair. We do this for isolated students. I noticed that in their media release on the budget they claim the government basically neglected them again, particularly in light of increased costs for education and accommodation. Minister, I am particularly interested in your response to that. I believe it is a question of equity, not of giving a handout to anyone. I believe that that differential, based on geography and a lack of access to further education, should be redressed in some way or another. I would like to leave you some time to deal with these issues. Dr NELSON (Bradfield-Minister for Education, Science and Training) (12.25 p.m.)Mr Deputy Speaker Mossfield, I congratulate you and acknowledge the supremely high quality of the clerks working with you today. In the 4½ minutes remaining, I would like to respond to some of the specifics that have been raised. The member for Kingston raised some issues in relation to members of Australian football clubs undertaking training. As I understand it, there are about 73 individuals engaged in new apprenticeships associated with football clubs. They are footballers and people who work in administration. The three areas in particular in which they are training are IT, management/administration and fitness. I point out to the member for Kingston that this was an initiative of the Labor government, announced by the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Simon Crean, in a press release in August 1994 entitled ‘Government endorses plan for 1,200 AFL trainees’. I think it is important that we in this country recognise that all Australians, irrespective of their occupation or circumstances, are entitled to receive training. I confess a potential conflict of interest-I strongly support the Swans, but when I am in Melbourne I do not mind backing the Saints if they are not playing the Swans. I think it is important that we make sure that those people who work for football clubs-not all of which have enjoyed a sound reputation at all times for the best financial management-are appropriately trained to an industry standard. Also we need to recognise that those who undertake sporting activities, in football or anything else, have a limited working life. Part of this government’s program-and, I understand, that of the previous Labor government-is to see that people are able to recognise the need for training and reskilling for life beyond whatever occupation they are currently undertaking, including in the area of football. In terms of the specifics, I would be very happy to ask the department if there are some issues in relation to sponsorship. The government are not in the business of trying to limit the opportunities for reputable organisations to support admirable sporting activities like Australian rules football; nonetheless we will examine the specifics of the nature of the sponsorship. The member for Kingston might be interested to know that there are currently 123 state industry training advisory bodies. There are 18 alone in Tasmania-six more than the number of 4148 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 2002 senators that Tasmania sends to Canberra. We also have 23 national industry training advisory bodies, and my department has also been funding another six recognised training bodies throughout the country. The industry training advisory program has served Australia well in developing vocational education and training packages, but it became clear to me in my movements throughout the country that the intrastate ITABs provide specific industry training advice to state and territory governments. Those who have written to me about this issue have emphasised that very point. The Commonwealth had been providing $10½ million a year to state and territory ITABs and the states between them had been providing around $8½ million. I have put it to the states that we need to streamline our processes for industry training advice. We also need to put to the states and territories that, in the process of streamlining, they will be able to decide what kind of industry training advice in particular they would like. WhilstI did canvass with the Australian National Training Authority board and its officers the general nature of industry training advice, they were not asked for specific advice in relation to state and territory ITABs. I can confirm that their advice to the Senate estimates committee was accurate.

He rang my office to indicate his displeasure at the manner in which he had been treated and the manner in which he saw a lot of other people being treated by the local banks. It is a fairly ordinary story; unfortunately, it is also a fairly typical story of what is happening particularly to elderly people in our society. Being from Sefton, he went to the Commonwealth Bank at Chester Hill. There had been a fire there and it had not reopened, so he went to three different banks to draw out money to pay his bills. At each of the banks, queues stretched out into the street. He waited for some time but never got to the counter and walked away in disgust. There were no chairs for the aged or the feeble, nor for young mothers carrying babies. He made the further comment that many people in the queues were complaining-just as he had problems, so did they have problems, because so many of them were aged and in discomfort because of the conditions. This, unfortunately, is not unusual. I suppose the correction to that statement is that the unusual thing is he had three other banks to choose from around the place. If he had been in Greenacre, he would have had zero, because there are no banking institutions left in the shopping centre of Greenacre. One after the other, they have been pulled out. The argument from the Commonwealth Bank, Westpac and the other banks is that there is plenty of provision around the area of Bankstown and all people have to do is make their way down to Bankstown Square and they will be able to get service there. We know from the experience in both Greenacre and Yagoona that, when people have been forced to go to Bankstown Square, they join queues which are already long at each of the banks in Bankstown Square. People who are aged and dependent upon a social security pension have also got the problem that it costs them a lot of money, relative to their income, to go to the bank and take their money out to do the rest of what they need to do-shopping and so on. Mr Macdonald was extremely upset. He went back to his club-he is active in both the Bass Hill and Bankstown RSL clubs-and he found that not only he but everyone to whom he spoke was fed up with the lack of customer service by all the banks. Everyone complained about bank closures and the difficulties they encountered when seeking over-the-counter withdrawals. Mr Macdonald stated that in protest the people he was talking to decided not to pay their bills until such time as the banks (a) stopped closures, (b) reopened closed branches and (c) improved their service. Mr Macdonald stated that, when the creditors came chasing their money, he would refer the creditors to me, their member of parliament.",142,Representatives Main Committee

447,Mr Hatton (Blaxland) (12.32 P.m.),"One of my constituents, Mr Jack Macdonald from4150 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 2002 I can only advise Mr Macdonald to pay his bills, because (a) I do not see that, in the short or medium term, there is a prospect of the banks stopping the closures-although that tide seems to have been stemmed a bit-(b) the banks have not moved to reopen closed branches and (c) given that the banks have taken away so many services, there has not been a great move to improve service provision. For Mr Macdonald and my other constituents this is a fact of life which is very difficult to accept. The two shining lights are that the Punchbowl Credit Union has opened up in Greenacre and that the Bankstown City Credit Union exists-and has existed for decades-in Bankstown. Mr Macdonald would find, if he signed up with the Bankstown City Credit Union, that there are very few queues there, that the service is open and friendly and that the staff do all they can to assist their customers. So there is another way of addressing this problem; that is, through the credit union movement. To those of my constituents who are not familiar with the credit union movement, who are looking for real alternatives when banks are not providing the service that they should-when there are queues and when there is not enough concern about people who cannot access the Internet and cannot find all the quick and easy ways of doing things that the younger people of the population use-and who need direct help across the counter, I suggest the Bankstown City Credit Union or the Punchbowl Credit Union can fill the gap that has been left by the banks. The banks need to be rapped over the knuckles. They need to be made to reintroduce service and become customer driven organisations. (Time expired) Budget: Disability Support Pension my opposition colleagues have been employing in the debate on the budget. I exempt some of those opposite, and I am not in any way disparaging what a former speaker said in illustrating his point with a case in his electorate. But I do object to the use of the names of people who supposedly are not getting proper medication, who have three young children and this, that and the other, without an examination of what drugs they are taking. A lot of the drugs that were under the old level of $22.40-drugs that cost $14, $15 or $17-will not go up in price, nor under the new regime will drugs that fall between $22.40 and $28.60 go up in price. It is interesting that a whole range of drugs that are used by families are being mentioned in the cases cited by the opposition, drugs like Ventolin, $19; Panadol, $7.75; Panadeine Forte, $9.43; and Amoxil, an antibiotic which is commonly used by families, $10.46. None of those drugs will change in price, and yet we have these bleeding heart stories trumpeted in the parliament. A lot of opposition speakers are very careless in saying that everyone will have to pay $6.24 extra for their scripts. This simply is not true. In fact, the drugs which will cost $28.60 or more are those drugs that are immensely more expensive. Some of them cost in the range of $200, some cost up to $1,000 and one particular course of 30 tablets costs up to $1,200. Another thing I would like to speak about briefly is disabilities. In 1981, 13.2 per cent of the population self-assessed themselves for the pension as being disabled; in 1988 it was 15.7 per cent; in 1993 it was 16.6 per cent; and from 1998 and since it has been over 19 per cent. Clearly, there are not that many disabled people in Australia. In fact, since June 1992 the number of disabled people has nearly doubled-it has gone up 72 per cent, from 378,000 to 652,000. In that time not that many Australians were disabled. Workplace health and safety was a lot tougher than it was and we have had quality control and workshops, many more",143,Representatives Main Committee
448,Mr Neville (Hinkler) (12.37 P.m.),"TodayI want to talk about a technique that some ofThursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4151 safety signs on beaches and around swimming pools and so on. The causes of disability have also been reduced dramatically in that period. Last year, 77,000 people applied for the disability pension and in future years it is estimated to increase to 80,000 a year or more. If you use that progression, within 4½ years a million Australians will be seeking disability pensions. That is clearly unsustainable. I have no objections at all to people who are genuinely injured, genuinely disabled-in fact, I have a disabled son myself-receiving pensions. WhatI do object to is the idea of, ‘Poor old Jack is not doing too well. We will put him on the disability pension.’ I have mentioned cases cited by the opposition before, such as Mr So-and-so, who has a disabled son, is worried about who will look after him when he dies. Four categories of people will not be affected by these measures: the severely disabled; the blind; those who cannot work 15 hours a week; and those working in sheltered workshops and receiving less than the award wages. With assistance from the government-that assistance will cost more over the next two years than will be saved in pension savings-we are trying to get people back into the work force with dignity and make them productive and motivated members of the Australian community. Budget: Disability Support Pension Ms HALL (Shortland) (12.43 p.m.)-I have a few words to add to those of the previous speaker, the member for Hinkler, Mr Neville. I have been working with people with disabilities for 13 years and have been trying to help them find employment. I suggest that the member for Hinkler has a look at this issue as he does not understand the issues associated with disability. I say that in the nicest way. I am not being critical or saying that he is a person who wants to do people over with disabilities. There are a lot more issues that need to be fixed rather than the simplistic fix that is outlined in this piece of legislation. Mr Dean Papworth, a young man with a disability, has written to both Simon Crean and the Prime Minister. In the letter to the Prime Minister, he states: ... I’m a 31 year old Intellectually Disabled Man from Lake Macquarie in NSW. I’m writing you this letter in absolute Disgust at what you and your Government are doing to this absolutely wonderful country of ours. You& your government are destroying everything that you put your hands on at the moment. … … … It would horrify me & many other Australians like me who have got a disability for the rest of their lives that wanted to work in open employment that you would have the guts to want to do away with their disability support pension just because they just want to be like everyone else and earn a decent wage packet like everyone else. Dean is a young man I have known for many years. He actually featured in an article in the Newcastle Herald. The article highlighted the fact that there is a number of people who are unemployed. In the Hunter area there is an unemployment rate of 11.1 per cent, which is 5.1 per cent above the state average. I strongly implore the government to employ some labour market programs that look at addressing this need. We need infrastructure programs, job creation and a system for a person like Dean, who is so desperate to work and who has held open employment. Unfortunately, he injured his back whilst working as a gardener at a local nursing home, and that has further prevented him from finding a job. He is so motivated. He applies for jobs each and every day. 4152 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 2002 He has rung me on so many occasions begging for assistance and asking the government to do something for someone like him. He pointed out that the paper had reported 55,000 full-time workers had lost their jobs last month, while only 11,600 part-time jobs were created to replace them. Dean is like so many other people in the area that I come from. He is a person who can see that, if the government creates job opportunities for him and for people like him, overall it will be better for our community and for our economy and it will make a better lifestyle for everybody. It is not a good country where some people have and some people have not. Dean is ready to get married, and that is creating even more anxiety for him. The other person I quickly want to mention is a lady called Gae Frost. Gae Frost is unemployed and just three months away from receiving the age pension. She has been sent a letter from Centrelink and has been told that she must go along and do an intensive assistance program-three months before she gets the pension. We have contacted Centrelink. They have said, ‘It was generated by the system. We’ve got to work out what we can do about it.’ The staff can see that it is wrong. They have been in touch with the policy section. This was over a week ago and the policy section in Centrelink is still trying to work out how to deal with it. My office spoke to Gae today; she still has not heard anything from Centrelink. Despite the best efforts of everyone associated with it, it seems that it is the government’s policy to punish people rather than help them find work-and that is the real problem. Popovic, Mr Tomislav for Shortland, it is clearly in the budget papers that anybody within five years of retirement age or reaching age pension age would not be required to do intensive assistance, nor would their pension be changed. I can send you a copy of the budget papers if you so wish. Ms Hall-Maybe you should send it to Centrelink. They are the ones who do not know. Mr Tomislav Popovic. Tomislav Popovic has had a very adventurous life, although much of it was not of his own choosing and has resulted from events in war torn Europe. Born in Yugoslavia, Tomislav was arrested at the age of 16 for opposing the new communist regime that took power at the end of World War II. It must have been a terrifying experience, particularly for one so young. In Tomislav’s own words: Human life meant nothing to the Communists in those days. In a dramatic and successful rescue attempt, a friend broke down the door of the room in which Tomislav had been interrogated and they both fled from the communist authorities and their beloved home town. Tomislav escaped across the border to Greece, where he spent 2½ years, and then to Italy, where he spent another 1½ years in a displaced person’s camp. When officials from an international refugee organisation visited his camp, he applied to come to Australia. All he knew about our country, at that time, was that it was very big with millions of sheep and cattle. He does not recall ever having heard of kangaroos before coming here, so we can only imagine the shock he got when he first saw one of our most celebrated native animals bounding up and down in the Australian bush.",144,Representatives Main Committee

452,Mrs Draper,"I would like to pay tribute to a constituent from my electorate of Makin,Thursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4153 Arriving in Melbourne in 1950, Tomislav was taken to a camp where people were allocated different places to work. For a time he picked grapes and fruit along the Murray River, with Berri as his base. Eventually Tomislav came to Adelaide and lived at the Finsbury Hostel for a while. Like so many of our migrant population, Tomislav was determined to succeed in his new country and succeed he did. But he also has a strong sense of community and genuinely cares for his fellow man. For six years, Tomislav served tirelessly and with dedication as the President of the Serbian Community in South Australia. More recent political events in his country of origin have not always made his role an easy one, but Tomislav is a very tolerant man. With his wife, Jelena, his two sons and a daughter and eight grandchildren, Tomislav can take pride in the fact that he has lived a good life and made a wonderful contribution to his adopted country. Recently this country was able to show its gratitude to Tomislav by awarding him the Medal of the Order of Australia in the Queen’s Birthday Honours List. It is a fitting tribute to a man who has served his community well and provided a fine example for other new arrivals to our shores. The last word should go to the man himself, Tomislav Popovic. He gives credit to his family and to Australia, which he says ‘gave me freedom, for which I am immensely grateful’. Banking: Credit Cards about the issue of burgeoning credit card debt in Australian society. Reserve Bank of Australia figures released in the last several days show that in the month of April the average credit card debt for Australian consumers was over $2,150. That is the highest on record. Total credit card debt, again in April, was $20,316 million, which was up slightly from $20,305 million in March. That is, in fact, the second highest figure on record for overall debt. Total card limits-that is, the total available amount of credit-was at $58,992 million. That is the third highest monthly figure on record. And the average limit on a credit card for an individual in society was up to $6,244-plus, which is again the highest on record. Those are the circumstances that we face today in terms of apparently increasing interest rates and in a situation where the Reserve Bank has suggested that those rates are still to go higher. Although we are moving from historical lows the fact is that, with this debt growing to such a great degree, there are some real dangers for a lot of people in society with respect to that debt getting out of control. It is interesting to look at how that debt has grown in recent years. I will on this occasion compare that with the circumstances under Labor and give you an example of this issue. Credit card debt increased by 45.3 per cent between February 1993 through to February 1996, and available credit limits increased by some 28 per cent. But let us look at what has happened from February 1996 through to the early part of 2002. Total credit card debt in February 1996 was $6.7 billion. The figure is now, as I mentioned earlier, over $20.3 billion. That is an increase in excess of 200 per cent during the time of the Howard-Costello government, and credit limits have increased by well over 170 per cent during the same period. When we look at the question of debt per account, what we can see is that figure I mentioned earlier-$2,150-plus, which is the highest on record. Back in February 1996, the figure was some $964. So in the period from 1996 to 2002 we have seen an increase of more than 123 per cent. This issue poses real problems for many Australians in society in terms of man-",146,Representatives Main Committee
453,Mr Griffin (Bruce) (12.51 P.m.),"I rise today to talk briefly to the Main Committee4154 MAIN COMMITTEE Thursday, 20 June 2002 aging that debt. It has the potential to lead to greater personal bankruptcy, particularly in younger people, who will tend to rely on credit card debt to provide them with the capacity for smaller loans. Something has to be done about this, and this government has to take some action. At the last election, Labor’s policy was to: ... work to ensure that financial institutions provide credit in a responsible way. In co-operation with the States, Labor will seek to reform the Uniform Credit Code to: require that a credit card provider can only increase a credit card limit if the credit card holder has made a request for an increase; prohibit unsolicited promotional material with pre-approved credit limits; and require that credit card statements have a warning about how long it will take to repay debt at the minimum level of repayment. Credit card debt is here and it is here to stay, but the fact of the matter is that we have to make sure that information is provided to consumers to ensure that they are better able to manage it and that they are in a situation where they do not get themselves too far into hock in circumstances where they will not be able to deal with it. The state governments and the federal government need to take a lead in order to ensure the reform of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code so as to take some of the pressure off and some of the circumstances away that are creating greater levels of credit card debt into the future. This government has to take a lead. The government says much about its role in economic management-well, here is an issue which, in concert with the states, it can do something positive about. I urge the government to look at this before it gets worse for many people in Australian society. Pollies for Small Business Day the Pollies for Small Business Day. This initiative was brought into being by the New South Wales State Chamber of Commerce and it allowed federal and state politicians to enter a small business and work for a day. Small business is the essential driving force of the Australian economy and is vital for healthy figures on a national level. This is why the Howard government has made such a big effort with reforms in this area. Nationally there are some 1.2 million registered small businesses, and small business accounts for one-third of the economy-a very significant proportion. I had the opportunity to work at the Yowie Bay General Store. The store is owned by Mr Peter Michaels and he is assisted by his wife and an excellent staff. During my time with his small business I was required to undertake a number of tasks, including serving customers, bringing in the fruit, stacking vegetables et cetera. It gave me a first-hand appreciation of what it is like in small businesses. The No. 1 issue that I was impressed by was the length of hours that these people work-15-hour days are the norm. It is the crack of dawn as they go into the markets to pick up the vegetables and fruit, they are there until 10 o’clock at night, and it starts all over again the next day. There are no holidays-they work through public holidays. It is a tough existence. The quality of the fruit and the goods that are brought into the store are important. I talked to Mr Michaels about how government policy impacted on him and what some of the issues were. One of the things I asked was how he found the GST. He said that, yes, there were some problems with it at first. The categorisation of products to which GST applied was",147,Representatives Main Committee
454,Mr Baird (Cook) (12.56 P.m.),"I recently had a tremendous opportunity to participate inThursday, 20 June 2002 MAIN COMMITTEE 4155 a significant problem. If a product was 100 per cent orange juice it was exempt, but if it had any other content such as water, so that it was less than 90 per cent juice, it was subject to GST. If chocolate chips were in a cake they were exempt but, if used as confectionery, they were not. He said that, over time, they did get used to it. He managed to introduce the MYOB program. He told me that in all honesty it had assisted in terms of their cash flow planning. He now believes that, in terms of the overall implementation of the GST, it has been a plus for him as an individual and for the store. Of other issues that affected him, he said the No. 1 issue was crime. Twice in 15 years he has been held up at gunpoint. He said it is a real issue and a real concern, particularly when his wife is serving in the store by herself at night. The second issue that he raised was public liability. He told me that someone fell into a ditch that had been dug by Telstra outside his store. Now that person is suing him for damages, even though there is a question as to whether they sustained any injury at all. So the threat of public liability is also an issue, especially when it has to be resolved with state governments. A third issue was problems he faced with the unfair dismissal bill. He is a lovely guy, his wife is a tremendous person-they are wonderful people-and the staff they employ are very friendly. He said that in the past if you employed someone who was not suitable you used to be able to say, ‘I don’t think things are working out,’ but now you have to go through a complex procedure if you want to terminate someone and it makes you reluctant to hire extra staff. He said, ‘I would like to employ my wife less in the shop, but the problem with bringing on staff is that you have difficulties if things do not work out.’ Overall, it was a great learning experience for me to see small business first hand. Being the son of a shopkeeper, it was not entirely new to me, but dealing with fruit and vegetables was a little different from dealing with shoes. Of course, some of the issues have changed as well. I think all of us can take advantage of the Pollies for Small Business Day. It is a great initiative by the chamber of commerce. I congratulate the Michaels family for being such great citizens of the Sutherland Shire and for their contribution to the community. Main Committee adjourned at 1.02 p.m. The following answers to questions were circulated: Hasluck Electorate: Work for the Dole Programs (Question No. 361) Ms Jackson asked the Minister for Employment Services, upon notice, on 15 May 2002: How many Work for the Dole programs operate in the electoral division of Hasluck.
