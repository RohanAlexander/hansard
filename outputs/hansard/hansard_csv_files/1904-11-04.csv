Prime Minister Whether, In View Of The De","cision of the High Court limiting the powers of the Legislatures of the States iri the. matter of direct taxation, and of the fact that there is a continuous falling off in the revenue from Customs and Excise, he will further consider the opinion which he has expressed against the imposition of direct taxation by the Commonwealth Parliament ? full text of the judgment of the High Court in the matter referred to. My impression is. that it affects only payments for services made by the Commonwealth to members of the Parliament, Ministers; and public servants, which is a small matter in comparison with .national taxation. I see no real difficulty in the way of members and 'Ministers continuing to pay income tax to the States, despite the decision of the High Court.

I thought that ten o'clock was sufficiently late for them to be away from their homes. members present, including the Chairman of Committees, twelve were members or supporters of the Government, and twelve were members of the Opposition. Chairman, the Opposition had an actual majority. If the Government can muster only eleven of their supporters when an important matter such as the Estimates is being considered it would almost seem that their own followers are losing confidence in them. They could succeed in keeping here only eleven honourable members out of thirty-eight. have counted out the House when the last Government were in office? ber could have done so, I have no doubt he would have taken advantage of the opportunity. able members were present one evening. a lot of mercy. the honourable member is in order in addressing members as "" fellows.""

And yet at 10.15 o'clock they could only muster eleven of their supporters. Only three Ministers were present. Of course Ministers can please themselves whether they come here or stay away. They can stay away altogether, so far as I am concerned. At the same time, if they do Out of (twenty-four absent themselves they can scarcely rely upon the attendance of theirsupporters.

I object to being made a convenience of by certain honourable members who desire to go away to attend to their own private business. Honourable members can stay away as often as they like. I shall not care if they absent themselves altogether. That is entirely a matter for themselves, and their constituents. But I object to their making a convenience of me. I understood that the Ministry came into power in order to restore responsible government, and also with the object of crushing the Labour Party-of strangling the Bengal tigers and removing from the Ministerial side the steerage passengers. Whilst these are the objects of the Ministry,. I am not prepared to assist them, even by helping to form a House. I believe in harassing and hampering the Government as much as possible, because I do not agree with their policy, and do not approve of their occupancy of the Treasury benches. I take it that if the proposal of the Treasurer is not carried the Government will be hampered, and that is my reason for opposing it. honourable member has referred to honourable members being paid to attend here. I hold, however, that we are not paid. We receive £ 4 0 0 per annum as an allowancea starvation allowance, against which we should enter a protest. I shall vote with the Government, but not on account of any pay I receive. MrM c DONA LD (Kennedy) I should like to say a few words in regard to this matter, because my action was practically the cause of the count-out. I take up exactly the same stand as that adopted by the honourable member for Barrier. If I were near the door of the chamber, and the Government desired to form a quorum, I should move further away instead of entering the House. On another occasion I told the honourable member for Dalley when he came into the labour room, that I would not assist to form a quorum, and the honourable member for Barrier was there and took exactly the same position. the honourable member upon that score, but other honourable members occupy a different position. suming that attitude is that I consider that no Government can possibly carry on with such a slender majority as that possessed No ; I am speaking for by the present Ministry without inflicting humiliation upon themselves, and degrading Parliament. The late Government occupied an entirely different position. If the leader of the Opposition were Prime Minister, and attempted to carry on under similar circumstances, I should not support him for one moment. In fact, I intimated 1 that fact to him very Dlainly. The Prime Minister knows perfectly well-h e has stated it repeatedly in this House-that any one of his thirty-six supporters can turn him out of office. that any one of them might create a lot of trouble. turn the right honourable gentleman out of office. ter. stances no Government can carry on with credit to themselves or to the country. I am quite sure that thejight honourable gentleman realizes that fact quite as well as does any honourable member of this House.

In my judgment there are two distinct proposals involved in that motion. I can quite understand a proposition being submitted affirming that we should resume the conI n addresssideration of business at the point at which it lapsed. The argument will probably be advanced that the Committee of Supply has lapsed. That, however, is not so. because our Standing Orders provide that we can which had been restore any lapsed business to the paper and resume its consideration at the point at which it was dropped.

In this case, the House in the first place is called upon to resolve that the consideration of business shall be resumed* at the point at which it lapsed, and in the next when that consideration shall be resumed. To resolve that its consideration shall be resumed without fixing a date for such resumption would be obviously futile.

I feel that a certain proportion of the business of the country, including the Estimates, must be passed, whether we have confidence in the Government or not. These Estimates are framed on lines of which 1 have generally approved. The late Government were, to some extent, responsible for their general preparation although they are not exactly as framed by us. There is no doubt that the finances of the country must be kept going, and, notwithstanding our lack of confidence in the Government, I do not think that we should be justified in taking steps to prevent the passing of these Estimates and the maintenance of -thefinancesof the country in a proper condition. Sir -never has any confidence in a Government. constitutional position of every Opposition. The authority for such an attitude comes from the people. The people whom we represent have no confidence in this Government, and it is our duty, whenever a reasonable opportunity offers, to show that that is so. I do not say, however, that my lack of confidence in the Government would lead me to go so far as to oppose the passing of the ordinary Estimates for the services of the Commonwealth. I have no objection to the motion, but I do not think that the Government can complain if some criticism is levelled at them in regard to the causes of the present position of business. External Affairs) I hope that honourable members will proceed to transact the business of the country. The granting of the supplies necessary to carry on the services of the Commonwealth is a very important matter, affecting thousands of persons, who are not at all interested in these personal pleasantries or tactical moves. -agree with the leader of the Opposition that it is the duty of the Government to maintain a quorum, and it is also true that several members of the Ministry and a number of Government supporters were absent when the count-out took place on Wednesday night. I have no complaint to make against either the leader of the Opposition or the Opposition as a body, although I have my own opinions as to the conduct of one' or two of its members in taking advantage of the weakness of the House at a particular moment. I have my own opinions as to the methods which one or two of them adopt in the transaction of public business, but I have not much complaint against the honourable member for Kennedy or the honourable member for Maranoa, because, while they are two of our bitterest opponents, every action they take against us is thoroughly open and straightforward. I cannot say that of every member of the Opposition, although I can for the great majority. I admit, as I have done over and over again, that it is always within the power of an Opposition, whose numbers so closely approximate to those of the Government, to bring about a crisis. I believe I am correct in saying, however-and 11 speak now with some authority, because I have the advantage JOHN FORREST -An Opposition of knowing the opinion of more than one honourable member opposite-that some of the Opposition are perfectly satisfied that all that party fighting requires has been attempted by the two attacks-on e by the leader of the Opposition, and the other by the honourable and learned member for Indi -o n the Government, and that they are not going to be parties to any attempt by mere obstruction to bring about a crisis in this House. ber knows more than we do. ways open to the Opposition to seek to bring about a crisis by obstructing public business, and I can assure honourable members that there will be no lack of a sense of the duty and the powers of the Government should such a situation arise.

But occasions arise when it is necessary to enter a protest, and I think that the honourable member for Barrier, and those who support him, are quite justified in protesting as they have done. On Wednesday night I was in indifferent health, but remained in the House until within two minutes of the count-out. I went away then only because I was very unwell. A Government with so precarious a majority as have the present Administration, ought really to demand more from their own followers than they appear to expect from honourable members of the Opposition. I do not think that honourable members should deliberately walk out of the Chamber when the Estimates are under discussion, but they are entitled to do so when they find that Government supporters care less for the business of the country than they do for their own private affairs. In such a state of things we find justification for the position taken up by the honourable member for Barrier. were absent were accepting the hospitality of the Governor General. a House for a Government whose supporters are away accepting the hospitality of the Governor General, who, I am sure, does not expect us to figure as his guests to the detoo early.

It is somewhat remarkable that, although I have been as close an attendant as any other honourable member of the House during the nine months in which we have been in session, the countout took place during the only quarter of an hour that I have been absent. As a matter of fact, one of my constituents, who was visiting Melbourne, called on me here, and I accompanied him to the foot of the steps as far as the front pavement. I heard the bell ringing, but, as I had not yet learnt to distinguish between the sound of our bell and that of the Senate, I was under the mistaken impression that it was a call for a divison of the Senate on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, and therefore disregarded it. I had no suspicion that it was a call for a quorum in this Chamber. I returned just after the doors had been closed, and learned too late of tbe true state of affairs. No one can justly accuse me of having failed in my attendances, and I think it right that I should be allowed to make this explanation. that when I was Government whip I used to ask members of the Opposition to help to form a quorum. As Opposition whip I always ask members of my own party to help to form a quorum for the present Government. Last Wednesday night I paired with the Prime Minister, but I broke my pair in order to try to prevent a count-out. I shall vote for the motion of the Treasurer, in order to facilitate the transaction of public business; but I am surprised at the statements of honourable members opposite that their party would never be guilty of such tactics as counting the House out. When the Arbitration Bill was under consideration, and the honourable and learned member for Corio was opposing some proposal of the Government, he asked the honourable member for Bland to consent to an adjournment. The Prime Minister replied that it was rather worth then approached the honourable and learned member, and said, ""You move to report progress.""

It is a deplorable fact that the attendance of honourable members here in large numbers seems only to interfere with the progress of business.

I recognise that the business of the country must be carried on, whether it be by a Government having a large or a narrow majority. It very often happens that the business is more efficiently transacted by. a Government with a narrow majority than by one having an overwhelming number of supporters. A Government which is confronted hy a weak Opposition very often fails to accomplish its purpose. For these reasons, I am not favorable to anything in the way of opposition which will involve a mere waste of time. The Government appear to think that this debate is a pure waste of time; but it may accomplish some good by directing attention to the unsatisfactory manner in which the busiI s there no principle ness of the country is being carried on by reason of the absence of a large number of honourable members, who, whilst professing to serve the country, are more concerned I quite believe that in looking after their own private interests.

Some reform should be effected in this d i rection. We, do not want more talk or longer speeches, but a more regular attendance, and fuller consideration of the measures -which are being placed upon the Statute-book. The Prime Minister, when he was Premier of New South Wales, was able to arrange for all-night sittings, and, indeed, all-week sittings, in order to push through the work of the country. He had no difficulty in maintaining a quorum, because he had the Labour Party behind him. He must now realize that he is in a very different position, and that if he desires to keep a House he must rely upon supporters who have not been remarkable for the regularity of their attendance. Honourable members should recognise their obligation to attend here, not merely for the purpose of maintaining a quorum, but also in order that the measures which are brought before us shall fairly reflect the wishes of our constituents. The honourable member for Barrier has done good service in raising this question, and pointing to the need of more regular attendance on the part of honourable members.",22,Supply 1904 5

He accused me, by inference, of adopting the same tactics that were resorted to by some honourable members on Wednesday evening, when they had the House counted out, although only routine business was under discussionI was told that I had harassed the late Government by similar methods. I find that on the occasion which I think the honourable member referred to, the House sat until half-past eleven. I considered that the Government were seeking by the aid of their majority to force their will upon the House in regard to a matter which should not have been disposed of except after the fullest discussion. The honourable and learned member for Corio moved that progress be .reported, and as far as my memory serves, I think I asked him to take that course.

People are beginning to wonder why this national Parliament should exist, if it is to devote the whole of its time to paltry intrigues. Those who wish to bring about a change have the remedy in Uheir own hands. There is no man in this House who fears a dissolution less, or who has less cause to fear one, than has the Treasurer. We all know that he was practically driven into office, and that he would be glad to relinquish it if he did not feel that he has a publicduty to perform. able member for Barrier may scoff at the Treasurer's patriotism, but if , when his political career has terminated, he can point to as good a record as can the Treasurer, he will have something to his credit of which he may be proud. I am glad that the Treasurer has spoken, in the way that he has. It is time that this solemn farce came to an end, and I again invite those who are so anxious for a dissolution to avail themselves of the forms of this House. Any two members of the Opposition could bring about an appeal to the country within a fortnight. The Prime Minister has already admitted that he cannot carry on the Government of the Commonwealth without the co-operation of members of the Opposition. WhilstI am not anxious for a dissolution, I should prefer to face my constituents rather than continue the existing state of affairs. Sir WILLIAM LYNE (Hume) -It is refreshing to hear the speech to which honourable members have just listened. That deliverance is reminiscent of the utterances of the oid colleague with whom I used to We must make prowork. I know that if he were sitting in Opposition he would be one of the strongest If we want members in this House to carry out what he has stated can. be done. I can assure him that if he will endeavour to bring the Government to book, and to force an appeal to the country, I shall be veryhappy to assist him in every possible way. To-day the Prime Minister has declared that he intends to await his own convenience, and then to dissolve this House. The Opposition, I claim, have no right to study his convenience. It is their duty to force a dissolution at the earliest possible moment. It is incumbent upon them to prevent the Ministry from continuing to humI do not bug the country. I have no confidence either in the Prime Minister or in the Government. I have given sufficient evidence of that. 1 What has the Prime Minister done during the past ten days? He is opposed to the Manufactures Encouragement B ill , and yet He professed an anxiety to afford the honourable member for Eden-Monaro an opportunity to carry it into law. He is opposed to any' interference with the Tariff, and yet he has promised to appoint a Commission to inquire into its operation, with a view . to interefering with it . He is opposed to preferential trade, yet he proposes to give the House an opportunity fo deal with it ; he is opposed to granting protection to Australian manufacturers, and yet in the course of a speech delivered by him a few days ago he said that he would give them a preference. When \ve have such a right honourable member at the head of the Government the Opposition is' not only justified in taking any action that it may deem desirable to show that, in its opinion, the Government lacks the confidence of the people, but would be recreant to its duty if it did not do so. Sir WILLIAM LYNE I have been after the right honourable member for some time, but he cannot accuse me of wobbling. I do not say one thing and mean another. I have never attempted to humbug the country. I am prepared to stand by any statement. I have made, and to defend any position that I have taken up.

If an urgent appeal were made to electors to enrol their names the work of compiling the rolls would be carried out in three or four weeks. The discrepancy between the number on the rolls and the actual number of persons entitled to vote is nothing like as large as has been suggested, and in these circumstances I feel that I am justified in the attitude which I take. The country expects the Opposition not merely to speak, but to act, on an occasion of this kind. I am daily in receipt of large numbers of letters from persons living in all parts of the Commonwealth, who desire to know when the Opposition is going to turn this Government out. It is all very well for the Prime Minister to say that he has received an assurance from certain members of the Opposition that they will not vote against the Government, but I should regret to learn that such an assurance had been given. ance had been given. orable member stated that he had the assurance of some honourable members, supposed to belong to the Opposition, that they considered the Government had been sufficiently attacked by means of the two votes of censure which had been moved, and that they were not going to support any further attempt to displace them. honourable members to say whether I have not quoted in effect the statement made by the right honourable gentleman. the statement.

I know that that which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro has said is absolutely true. If half-a-dozen members of the Opposition feel as strongly as I do in regard to the position of the present Government, and as to the personnel of a section of it, they will prevent them from making a pretence to carry on business with which they do not really intend to deal. They will prevent time being wasted -because , after all, that is what the action of the Government really means if they have no intention of dealing with the business which they have promised to consider.

As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro said, I shall exercise my own judgment as to how I act and vote. I have not come into the Federal Parliament to be hampered in my actions. I should hail a dissolution with great satisfaction, as the only way to bring about a better state of things. I do not think we should wait until it suits the Prime Minister and his supporters to go to the country. The Prime Minister has stated on the public platform, and in this Chamber, more than once, that the next battle cry will be ""unionism or non-unionism, labour or capital?""

There is also the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, in which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro is so interested, and of which most honourable members, with the exception of the Prime Minister and myself, and a few others, are in favour. Another important measure is the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill which has been sent to us by the Senate. That body is beginning to feel that we are not desirous honourable member for Eden-Monaro with of dealing with measures sent to us by them, and we should do nothing to encourage that feeling. We should let the Senate understand that we are very wishful to consider such measures. If the Government do not try to conciliate the SenateI give them this advice in all friendliness-the y may refuse to pass the Appropriation Bill, which would create antagonism between the Houses, and the Government are already in a minority in the Senate inregardto certain matters. The resumption of the consideration of Ways and Means in Committee is another order of the day which might be dealt with. According to the last returns, our revenue is falling month by month, so that it is only a matter of a short time when we shall not be able to return to the States even the three-fourths required to be returned by the Constitution. That is a very serious matter, about which all the present States Treasurers are much concerned, and it will have to be faced at an early date. Government might therefore give us some information as to what they intend to do in regard to it. We might very well postpone the resumption of the consideration of the Estimates until next week, when we can make a fair start, and go straight on, and to-day, in the few hours which are left to us, dispose of the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill, which we might possibly pass this afternoon. The Treasurer, in moving the postponement of the orders of the day, should have explained to us much more fully the reasons why he made such a motion. I urge him to withdraw it, so that we may proceed with the consideration of lhe business upon the paper, and I am sure that in making this request I shall be supported by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the right honourable member for Swan. I understand that the right honourable member for Swan desires to get away for a few days, and if the Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta Railway Survey Bill is not proceeded with to-day it will probably be dealt with in his absence. The Government should show some consideration for their supporters. I propose to get into close communication with the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, with a view to ascertain the way in which two honourable members can bring about a dissolution. mark of the honourable member with regard to getting into close communication with the a view to bringing about a dissolution is relevant ? the right honourable gentleman has raised an objection is not relevant.

The right honourable gentleman accused the members of the Labour Partv of delaying the passing of the measure by bringing, forward a no-confidence motion, but now, when he is in a position to bring pressure to bear upon the Government, he is content to sit silent. I can only come to the conclusion that the right honourable The gentleman is not so sincere as he would have honourable members believe. I am not here to champion the Bill, but am content to continue to play the part of humble follower of the right honourable member for Swan in regard to the measure. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro should press the claims of the Manufactures Encouragement Bill.

Seeing that the consideration of the Estimates lapsed as the result of an accident, and not of design, it would be only an act of grace upon our part to allow the business to be reinstated as soon as possible. If the leader of the Opposition chooses to submit a direct no-confidence motion, it can be dealt with in the ordinary way; but I object to any unnecessary waste of time when we should be engaged in the transaction of public business.

269,Mr Kelly,"I assure the ' honorableber's assurance. I wish now to refer to the count-out which took place on Wednesday night. When I called for a division, I had no desire to place the Government in an awkward position. Honourable members are aware that throughout the consideration of the Estimates I have been fighting an principle against the granting of increases, which, in my opinion, are too high, and that the call for a division was made on an amendment to reduce a certain item. HadI known that there was not a quorum, I certainly should not have pressed it. As it was I tried to withdraw my call, for I had no wish to place the Government in an unenviable position. I intend to fight them, as I have said, at every turn, but always in an honourable way. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro said this morning that we could soon send the Government to the country if we fought them properly under the Standing Orders. I have since been looking through the Standing Orders, and I intend to adopt his suggestion. I tell the House frankly that I do not desire to go to the country-no t because I fear that I might lose my seat, but because I do not care about the prospect of travelling for four months throughout the length and breadth of Western Queensland. for a dissolution. honourable member. I think that there is some need for a dissolution. Let us look for a moment at the position which the Government occupy to-day. remind honourable members of the humiliating position in which the honourable member for Wilmot placed not only the Government, but the Opposition when he said that he held both parties in the hollow of his hand. The Prime Minister is not the man I take him to be, if he tolerates such a position. I am under the impression that he will yet tell the honourable member when he makes one of his wild, mad statements ber must not say that an honourable member makes mad statements. ""mad."" It seems to me that the Prime Minister will yet give a decisive answer to the honourable member when he again makes one of his wild statements to the effect that he holds the two parties in the hollow of his hand. Where was the honourable member for Wilmot that he did not attend on Wednesday night, and save the Government of which he thinks so much ? The Prime Minister treats the matter in a jocular way; but from what I know of him, I do not think he is pleased with the position of his Ministry. If we are to take any notice of the statement made this morning by the honourable member for Eden Monaro, his majority has disappeared. That honourable member said that if this guerilla warfare were carried on. to such an extent as to prevent the transaction of public business-if it were shown, after every constitutional means to transact business had been exhausted, that only a dissolution would right the Parliament-h e would support our efforts to bring about that result. He is not anxious that we should go to the country, but if we continue to fight the Government, and make it impossible for them to transact the business of the country, he will assist us in forcing on a dissolution. In view of that statement, it must be seen that the Government majority has disappeared. If the honourable member means what he says-and I believe that he does-h e will shortly have an opportunity to carry out his promise. I shall fight the Government in every constitutional way. have they done? done., but what they have not done. It seems to me that they would do a great deal more if it were not for the protectionist members of the Cabinet. I was sorry to Let me hear the honourable member for Barrier read the names of those who were present when the count-out took place. I do not think he acted wisely in doing so, and I think it is still more regrettable that the honourable member for Kennedy should have read out the list of those who were absent. I feel assured that no one is more sorry than he is for his action in that respect. He must recognise that he has done an injustice to many honourable members. No one is more regular in his attendance than is the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who was one of the absentees.

In the House of Commons the leader of the Government and the leader of the Opposition rarely leave their seats while the House is sitting, because they regard it as their duty to be on hand continuously, in order that they may give information or -advice as required. In this Parliament, however, neither the leader of the Government nor the leader of the Opposition seems to fully recognise the obligations which rest upon him in that regard. If the leaders are not present, how can the rank and file be expected to remain? point the honourable member as leader, and ihen we shall have a model. the honourable member for North Sydney upon the facility with which he is adopting the practice of his leader, and substituting personalities for argument.

I am aware that subsequently the Prime Minister made some reference to the mental equilibrium of the honourable member in question, but that was a mere afterthought.

I can well imagine how brilliantly the present Prime Minister would attack any other individual who persisted in holding office under similar circumstances. But it is the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, who has proved the kindest friend of the members of the Opposition. He has informed us how we can blow the Government to atoms, 7 and regain possession of the Treasury benches within a fortnight. It may not be long before he will occupy a seat upon this side of the House. We must recollect that the Manufactures Encouragement Bil l has yet to be considered, and that he has staked his political existence upon it. It is a great honour to be intrusted' with the charge of such a measure, when the Government themselves are afraid to shoulder the responsibility of passing it.

As an Opposition we are justified in doing all that we can to regain a position which we never should have lost-to get back to the Treasury benches by fair and honest means. We shall countenance no "" sand-bagging "" in our efforts in that direction. We wish to regain possession of the Treasury benches, because we feel that the best interests of the people will not be served by a continuance of the present Government in power. It has been painful to watch the sufferings of the honourable member for Lang since the Government have been, so to speak, on the gridiron. He has indicated time after time that in his opinion the Opposition are actuated by a desire to obtain possession of the Treasury benches, and that he is prepared to do his utmost to keep the Government in power, although they gained office by 1 -methods which we should not adopt.

I sympathize with the position of the Government whip, who is responsible for the two days' waste of time which we have had. The Government which he supports, however, is prepared to remain in office, no matter how humiliating the circumstances. If we have to go to the country, let us go quickly. Five or six months will not make a material difference to the position. In that time the average Member of Parliament, no matter how economical, cannot save more than £ 2 5 or £ 3 0 , and, therefore, at the end of it, would not be much better off than he is now.

We shall not allow a Government which has declared that it intends to throw itself across the path of labour to remain in office very long. I will not use those If the Prime Minister threw himself across die path of labour, no one coming into contact with him would hurt himself very much, because there would be no corners to catch on. But I warn him that the labour coach is a very heavy one, and that the men on board earnestly desire to arrive quickly at their destination, so that if he takes any such action, it will be the end of him politically. The Labour Party are prepared to remove all obstacles from their track that they may secure good government. They understand the wishes and the needs of the. men at the bottom of the ladder, and know their sufferings, because they have been there themselves, while, at the same time, they respect the members of every other'class according to their merits.

This is the second occasion during the term of the present Ministry upon which a count-out has occurred. Such an event always reflects discredit upon the Government. first occasion the Prime Minister, in his Ibluff and hearty style, merely chuckled and laughed, as if the matter were of no importance. He merely said that the countout was due to a trick of the Labour Party, and that if they intended to interrupt the course of business in that way, he would pay them back in their own coin. He assured the House, however, that such a thing would not happen again. In spite of his boast, however, another count-out has occurred, and it would appear that his followers have not sufficient respect for him to attend here and assist in keeping a House. Ministers and their followers were absent on Wednesday evening, because they desired to attend an important social function. Opposition were also at that social function. the Government, who are responsible for keeping a House.

If the Prime Minister found it necessary to absent himself from the House because he regarded an invitation to a. ball' as equivalent to a command, he should have endeavoured to make some arrangement with the leader of the Opposition.

No one has greater respect than I have for the right honourable gentleman and the political work he has done, and in common with many other honourable members. I was sorry when he listened' to the seductive voice of the Prime Minister and became a member of the present Administration. He is out of touch with some of his colleagues and supporters, and if he wishes to bring to an end the present unsatisfactory state of affairs, the Thomson, D. A. way is quite open to him. There are honourable members on this side of the House who are quite prepared to join hands with him in doing the work which he has at heart. The sole aim of the Ministry seems to be to placate their opponents by giving them measures in which they do not themselves believe. So long as they pursue that policy they may hang on to office; but as soon as , the Prime Minister attempts to give to those who are heart and soul with him the measures they want, trouble will begin, and the Treasurer will find it impossible to remain any longer in office. Why should he wait for that time? I trust that the honourable and learned member for Ballarat and the Tieasurer will find some means of bringing over to this side of the House those honourable members who are totally opposed to the principles of others with whom they are now associated.

I maintain that there has been no waste of time. The discussion which took place this morning was in the interests of the country generally. .

I should like to ask the Prime Minister whether he intends to act upon the sugges-. tion of the honourable member for New England? the right honourable gentleman must stiffen his back,"" otherwise the honourable member for New England will kick over the traces. against the remarks of the honourable member for New England, because I do not think the Prime Minister should be told by one supporter after another that he must stiffen his back to expedite the conduct of public business. Personally, I would not allow my worse enemy to be trampled upon, and, therefore, I feel it is my duty to stand up like a Briton and defend the Prime Minister. I hope that no further threats will be made to destroy the Government if the Prime Minister does not become even more petrified, politically speaking, than he is at present. I should like the Government to invite the House to meet at 10.30 a.m. each day, so as to expedite business.
