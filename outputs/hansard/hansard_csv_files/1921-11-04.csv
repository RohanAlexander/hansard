It is stated in the paper which I propose to lay on the table that the New Hebrides Company say that, failing immediate acceptance, they must deal elsewhere.

Our main interest, however, lies in the fact that the natives of New Hebrides are decreasing, and labour must be imported. The French own the bulk of the land, and it is understood are anxious to import Asiatic labour. The presence of any considerable number of Asiatics so near Australia, especially as we pursue a policy of exclusion in our own island territories, would be embarrassing and possibly dangerous. The French own 600,000 hectares out of a total of 1,200,000 hectares of land. The natives own about 522,000 hectares. A French company known as the Society Francaise des Nouvelles Hebrides is the owner of the 600,000 hectares above mentioned, and in addition has been granted trading concessions",20,Sugar Industry

All the bases and ports except Port Olry form part of the company's land, and are susceptible of exclusive private ownership with unrestricted sea rights. The possibility of the sale to British interreason why I am opposed to the acceptests has been disclosed to the French Government, and it is stated that the transaction will meet with no objection on their part. On this point I cannot speak officially. The purchase of this property by British interests would reverse the present position so far as dominant land ownership in the group is concerned, and such would pass from French to British control. It is understood that Japan is pressing the sellers for an offer failing Australian acceptance.

On the 21st October a cable. was received stating that the company was holding a general meeting on the 27th October, and would greatly appreciate any information available before that date.

I have no doubt that the missionary societies would strongly favour the purchase of this land by the Commonwealth, but the question is whether we would be able to get a good title for it.

The Prime Minister( Mr Hughes), very late in the day, has given the House an opportunity to deal with it. He states that he has brought the matter before us now because of its urgency, that the offer was made to him while he was in the Old Country, and that he secured an extension of the option so as to enable him to consult Parliament. able member has said also that he is opposed to the purchase of the land, and since that is his view it might have been said of him later on had he failed to take this action, that he had allowed the Commonwealth to miss an opportunity to acquire this interest in the New Hebrides. The offer was made some months ago, and we should have been given a chance Honourable before this to consider it. As it is, an endeavour should be made to obtain an extension of the option for some months, so that Parliament may deliberately deal with the whole matter. I am not committing myself in any way, since it would be ill-advised to express an opinion on a proposal of which one knows practically nothing.

Por a considerable time there has been anxiety connected with the control of the New Hebrides. The Condominium has nob been a success, and during the last six or seven months there has been much correspondence in the newspapers, particularly in the Sydney Morning Herald, on the affairs of the New Hebrides. Apparently the and that of general control was considered some time ago, and it is in this regard that Parliament feels some anxiety; perhaps, more than in regard to the purchase of the lands held by the French company. This purchase may be essential, of course, to proper control, but without the fullest information it is not possible for honourable members to form any opinion as to the value of the option, and what action should be taken. If the Prime Minister( Mr Hughes) feels any anxiety about laying these papers on the table of the Library, I suggest that he might make them available to honourable members in his own office, so that any one feeling a special interest, would be able to peruse them.

Senate's Request -Ad cent. t for Trade and Customs) [11.47] I move That the requested amendment be not madeFor a number of years past a small fixed duty per gallon has been imposed on varnishes, and by that means we have built up, to some extent, the manufacture of low-grade varnishes. But, owing to the fact that the fixed rate represents an almost infinitesimal ad valorem duty on the higher grade of varnishes, nobody attempted, until after the outbreak of war, to manufacture them locally. During the war considerable progress was made in this respect, and we decided to provide for an alternative ad valorem duty upon high-grade varnishes, that being the only effective method of protection. The mere increasing of the fixed rate of duty would not achieve that purpose, because it would provide too high a rate of protection on the lower grades of varnishes, but would not give sufficient protection on the higher grades unless it were made so high as to become an absurd impost on the lower grades. The only way to give satisfactory protection to both classes is to have a fixed rate of duty on the lower grades and an ad valorem duty on the higher grades. Q out in a letter, which no doubt the Minister has seen, that these duties range from 75 to 350 per cent. when the schedule only provides for a duty of 25 per cent. What the writer means is that the 25 per cent, ad valorem duty is a 350 per cent, increase upon the protection formerly provided. The mere fact that a 25 per cent, ad valorem duty the honourable member has indicated shows the utter absurdity of the fixed rate of duty on higher grades of varnish. Committee (Consideration of per Mr cent, McWILLIAMS -Does not the 350' increase indicate a little abwe are imposing is only 25 per cent. The val., British, 15 per grades of varnish being manufactured locally ? industry was started as a result of the war and is growing. The Committee would be taking a retrograde step if it were to do anything to destroy what has already been achieved. If the manufac-' turers of high-grade varnishes abroad care to come here and set up their works, as manufacturers of other commodities have done, good luck to them. The more experience of that character we can gain the better local firms are producing high-grade varnishes ? are making them in quantity. TheTe may be other firms producing on a small scale. what prices are being charged in Melbourne for local varnishes? ticulars, but I think the price charged for the local article compares favourably with the price charged for the imported varnish. that affects the Government considerably. plaint from the Government. trade has sent in numerous protests against the high duties. from all side?'-fro m the manufacturers that the duty is quite inadequate for their .purpose, and from the users that the duty is ruinous.

I willingly admit that it is a considerable advance on the fixed rate of duty, hut I repeat that the latter is simply a revenue duty on the hligher grades of varnish, and does not produce the result for which we look. countries do we import our varnishes principally ? Great Britain sends us the bulk of the varnishes we use, but there is also a considerable importation from America. During the war large establishments for the manufacture of varnishes were brought into existence, and Mgh quality varnishes are being produced to-day which in years gone by the local manufacturer could not attempt to make. The Committee would do well to adhere to the duties to which it originally agreed. This item provides another illustration of how .the ulfrra-Protectionlists, having, It would be spoiled if any attempt were first of all, put as high a duty as they eould possibly get on the raw material, use that duty as an argument for increasing the impost on the manufactured article. ber forgotten that he was one of those who asked for a duty on the raw material from which varnishes were made? discussion on the TariffI said that I would vote for any duty which I considered fair, and throughout the schedule I have been consistent in my attitude.

The British varnish, which this item affects, is sold at 34s. per gallon. Therefore, the consumers will be penalized by every additional penny of duty we impose. If the fact that the price of the British article is 100 per cent, higher is not sufficient Protection for the local product, .the Australian manufacturer is not worth his salt. Some honourable members seem to think that it is our duty to make' the imposts upon all imports as high as we possibly can. They are doling nothing to protect the users of varnishes. One statement has been made with the deliberate intention of injuring the reputation of imported varnishes. It has been said that the British varnish is thinned down after importation to a consistency of one in three. British varnish is left in vats for twelve or twenty-four months and then tinned in gallon measures and exported. made to thin it down. I am told, not only by varnishing firms, but also by people who are excellent authorities on the subject, that it is not possible to do so. The only effect of increasing the duty will be to increase the cost of the best class of work. The Minister says that he is not in favour of having a fixed rate of duty on the better quality varnishes, but the Australian manufacturer should not require more than a fair handicap in the race of competition with the British manufacturer, whose output is absolutely necessary and is used on a great deal of Government work. A very unjust differentiation will be created by the adoption of an ad valorem rate on the higher quality varnishes. The oils used in some of the local varnishes are not of good We have quality. Any painter will admit that the linseed oil used at the present time is quite inferior to that which was imported in pre-war days. Quite recently I had the exterior woodwork of my house painted.

F. RUSIITON, Chief Mechanical Engineer. In South Australia Australian varnishes have been subjected to the actual test of use on railway carriages. If the firm on whose behalf efforts are being made is desirous of supplying high class varnish to the Australian public, let it establish itself in Australia. We should be glad to have it make varnishes here, bufc we should not, while it is merely an importing firm, give it an advantage over the local manufacturers of varnish Surely Australian varnish is not to be condemned merely because the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Eoley) is not satisfied with the result which he obtained by putting oil on a house iu Western Australia. As the raw materials from which varnish is made are dutiable, the manufactured article should also be dutiable. [12.19] -During the Tariff discussions many misstatements have come from the Corner party, and now we have the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr Foley), a direct Ministerialist, proving that he is not particular about what he says, though a inember of his long experience might be expected to weigh his remarks carefully. He said that Australian varnish is inferior to imported varnish because of the oil used in it. He found fault with the quality of Australian linseed oil. He said that that oil is not as good now as it was in pre-war days. I do not know that the honourable member would recognise good varnish if he saw it. I admit that I would not, though I might be able to say whether a job done with a particular varnish was a good or a bad job. Bad workmen are accustomed to blame either their tools or their material, and the honourable member, after varnishing a house, possibly laying on the varnish as if it were whitewash, appears to have been dissatisfied with the result, and blames the Australian varnish for it. When he was speaking there was within the Chamber a gentleman who knows something of a Victorian varnish company. This gentleman says that the local oil has been very regular in quality. quality is medium, good, bad, or indifferent? one question at a time. T. hold that as we protect the varnish-making industry we should insist on the use of local oil in its manufacture. of that oil? with the honourable member's statement that the quality is not as good now as it was in pre-war days; iu otlier words, that it has been irregular. I wish to refute the honourable member's statement that tlie Australian oil is irregular in quality My authority, who knows something about varnish, says that it is his experience' that it has been very regular in quality.

Varnish making is not a new industry; it is estabturers of perfumes here two days after lished in all the States, and gives a considerable amount of employment. understand that upwards of £1,000,000 is invested in the industry, and that its annual output is something like 800,000 gallons of varnish. With the necessary encouragement, the local manufacturers could supply the total requirements of the Commonwealth. clone with Australian varnish? Prince's carriage varnished with imported varnish instead of with Australiau varnish? but I know that locally-made varnishes are used by the railways and. tramways departments of Victoria, South Australia, and, I think, New South Wales, and it will not be suggested that the officers responsible for the varnishing of the Government rolling-stock would use an inferior article. Locally-made varnish is also used throughout our public institutions. We are justified in encouraging this industry. I have no objection to protection being given to this industry, but surely the Committee might well discuss the amount of protection to be given. I do not know, much about varnish, but I wish to see fair play. The Minister and the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) both evaded the point. 'We should not unnecessarily provide manufacturers with the opportunity of making enormous profits out of the public. The other day the Minister said that he had consulted [497]2 various manufacturers regarding the duty on perfumed spirits. But I am afraid that he has been badly advised in regard He must have used imported, not to matters of this kind. The Minister discussed very fully the arguments advanced in opposition to the proposals ins regard to perfumed spirits, and stated that the 'information obtained by his Department was that the higher duties were* essential.

I have no personal interest in this matter, and the only information I have witli regard to it comes from an interested source. I have here a circular from W. Harland& Sons, and their agent here, who is naturally desirous of protecting h!is principal's business. In this circular it is pointed out that under the old duty, the amount payable on 93S gallons of varnish of the net value of £1,023 would be £117, whereas under the present duty £281 would be collected.

We should live entirely ito ourselves, neither importing anything nor exporting our products. The honourable member for Maribyrnong ( Mr Eenton) took up that attitude with regard to agricultural machinery, and we now have the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Mathews) expressing the same view with regard to the importation of varnishes. The suggestion is absurd. That £281 should be collected by way of duty on varnish of the value of £1,023 is preposterous. If local manufacturers cannot carry on without such an enormous duty it is time that they closed down. orable member would like. member is the last man I should expect to be anxious to assist the exploiter. I am told that the tradesmen themselves are protesting against the high duty under the British preferential Tariff.

I could carry such a motion. that the duty as passed by this Committee is altogether too high, and cannot be justified from even a Protectionist"" point of view. I hope the good sense of the Committee will lead to the acceptance of the Senate's request. Surely a duty of 15 per ceut. under the British preferential Tariff is sufficient. We have no objection to the higher duties under the intermediate and general Tariffs, but we think a duty of 15 per cent, as requested by the Senate is ample in respect of British varnishes of the high value shown in the invoice to which I have referred. I know that the honourable member for Kooyong( Sir Robert Best) is a sturdy Protectionist anxious to build up Australian industry, but if the figures quoted by Harland& Sons are correct they suggest that the high duty under the British preferential Tariff would lead to the exploitation of the people, and I do not think he would support anything of the kind.

Por instance, a large quantity of marble of this class is used m the making of tables. It was a request from the monumental masons of Sydney which induced a member of another place to have this marble made free, but I may say that no request of the kind came from any other State. I ask the Minister to reconsider hi3 proposal. It is within my own personal knowledge that a company is being formed in South Australia to de? velop the white marble industry, and that already an order has been received for 12,000 table tops a year.

In the first place the Phosphate Company is not guaranteed these concentrates, and, The manager of the Phosin the second place, if it were guaranteed Co-operative Company of Austhem, it would be compelled to erect for machinery to the value of £100,000. The wrotecompany has a registered capital of £300,000, and it is not yet able to start operations. In order to erect the necessary plant to deal with concentrates, it will have to increase its capital to £500,000. It is not prepared to do that. The Electrolytic Zinc Company cannot supply the Co-operative Phosphates Company with sulphur because sulphur cannot be made from concentrates; they yield only a crude form of sulphuric acid. If we have to importvolcanic sulphur or brimstone, the primary producers of this country will be penalized to the extent of fro m 6s. 3d. to 8s. on every ton of superphosphates used in the Commonwealth. Before the war the farmers I propose to place certain were able to get the superphosphates at £ 4 7s. 6d. a ton. The price increased year by year until to-day it is £ 6 3s. per ton, notwithstanding the fact that bags The are only half the price this year that they were last year.

The manager of the co-operative company's works writes as follows: The term """"brimstone"" should be used instead of the term ""volcanic sulphur,"" otherwise there is a probability of American crude Bulphur being held by the Customs Department to be not of volcanlic origin. It has not been geologically practicable to determine the origin of the American sulphur beds. proportion of ten tons of superphosphate to one ton of sulphur is not applicable to this company. working it is eight tons of superphosphate to one ton of sulphur. Company is reported to have purchased 750,000 tons of zinc sulphides lying at Broken Hill from the British -Government, which had bought them for their zinc contents during war time, and is reported to have sold them at a considerable loss. Under the practice of the metal market it is improbable that either the British Government or the Electrolytic Zinc Company paid anything for the sulphur in these concentrates, as in that form it has no commercial value. It is unfair that the farmer should be made, by duties, to pay the Zinc Company for what it probably did not pay for itself. The sulphur must, in any ease, be roasted,out of -the sulphides as a prements in which apply also to the matter liminary to treatment for the zinc contents. In view of the stocks of concentrates held at Broken Hill and elsewhere, it is improbable that .the miner will, by increase of work, reap any benefit for many years. There is an iron sulphides deposit inland in New South Wales: but, owing to the cost of transport, such iron sulphides can have nothing but a local value. Honourable members opposite need not imagine that by adhering to this duty they are conserving the interests of the men working in mines. They are merely building up a huge concern that will not give a co-operative company an opportunity to live, to say nothing of reducing the the cost of production. There are already sufficient conoentrates on hand at BrokenH ill to last for many years, and this duty I could not say. will not improve the miners' position in any way. The following appeared in the Argus of the 26th October last: T h a t may be so, but if The British Board of Trade announces that it has instructed Broken Hill, to supply zinc concentrates, with the view of enabling British smelters to resume work. It also invites offers of concentrates, deliveries to extend over a period. [Under the terms of a contract entered into between the Zinc Producers' Association (of Australia) and the British Board of Trade, I have the assurance of the Board was to take uip to 300,000 tons of zinc concentrates a year for a period of ten years after the termination of the war. Owing to the subsequent reductions in the price of zinc, the shipments to Great Britain were small, and although the concentrates -were paid We can get no assurance for by the British Government, they were allowed to accumulate at Broken Hill. In September the Board of Trade sold 750,000 tons of these concentrates to the Electrolytic Zinc Co., Tasmania. Although no prices were stated, if. is understood that the British Government sustained a .serious loss under its purchase of Australian zinc concentrates. Under the contract deliveries of these concentrates to the Electrolytic Zinc Co. extend over several years. In August the British Government was stated The to have 056,000 tons of concentrates stacked at Broken Hill.

Up to date shipments of concentrates have heen small, but instructions have been received to forward larger consignments.] It is quite plain that it is impossible to produce sulphur from concentrates. I have here some extracts from a letter written by William M . Hamlet, an analytical and consulting chemist, of 32 Elizabeth-street, Sydney, which have more application to sheep dip than to superphosphates', but some of the argunow under consideration. They are as follow: Having jfiven some consideration to the problem of sulphur in Australia, and from my experience in the manufacture of sulphuric acid, the question appears to narrow itself down to the two following propositions:(1) Tlie economic production of crude and refined sulphur in Australia.

Had all those who were engaged during the war in manufacturing or in vending goods acted similarly, there would have been nothing heard about profiteering. complains that superphosphates are dearer now than they were before the war. Well, everything that is manufactured is dearer. Wages have risen, freights and charges dependent on the cost of wages have risen, and as wages and freight charges are both big elements in the cost of superphosphates, these are dearer now than they were before the war. That cannot be a matter of complaint. the superphosphate companies, it must be But it is to be done at the ' said that they have shown, with each rise in price, the details of tlicir increased overhead charges. tion of the trade should convince any one that no impropriety has been inflicted upon consumers by the manufacturers.

The liigher price to-day, compared witli pre-war rates, can be easily understood.

It is my belief that the chief compelling element at the close of the Avar in Europe was the absence of superphosphates, for more than four years, in the German agricultural soil. Germany went down because tillage had become less productive, due to the absence of superphosphates. Germany was forced to her knees, apart altogether from Ihe military position, by economic pressure, which sprang from restricted rural production and the consequent shortage of foodstuffs.

I agree that the manure manufacturers acted fairly during the war period; they recognised the peculiar position in Australia. great difficulty in delivering phosphatic rock and sulphur to their various works, and the shortage of shipping added to their costs. bers to appreciate the facts. in Western Australia paid before the war £4 2s.

That is the means by which we can add to the production of, not only wheat, but everything that comes from the cultivation of the land. It pays even the dairyman to apply superphosphates to his grass lands. It would be a fine thing for the Commonwealth manures available. tend production for the benefit of all. The State Governments have recognised the importance of cheap artificial manures, and in Western Australia they .are carried on the railways at the lowest rates in the schedule.

The Committee by this impost is asked to .allow the farming community further penalized. that are extracting important to Australia, let the whole people pay to help them by means of a bounty. I like to hear those honourable members who are farming in the cities of Melbourne and Sydney talk glibly, about the importance of the sulphur industry to the farmers. Mr Prowse. for Balaclava ( Mr Watt) referred to the quantity of artificial manure he uses; I guarantee that it is not enough to bury himself in. He asked where would the Australian farmers have been during the They experienced war but for the locally-produced artificial manures? What a ridiculous question!. The whole of Australia depends on primary production, and when. that But I ask honourable memceases, Australian settlement will revert The farmers to a few scattered villages and whaling stations. I do not know what the Committee will tax next. An effort is being made to tax out of existence every form of primary industry. This item and a later co-related item manuresOn acshould be free of duty. The -benefit which would result would not only go directly to the primary producer, but indirectly to the whole community. No other factor can be regarded as of greater importance than the factor of increased primary production.

Lands which cannot be profitably cropped under natural conditions can be made profitable by the application of artificial manures if they can be obtained cheaply.

He not only takes his own share of the general duties, but is also called upon to pay duty on the raw material of the orchard implement maker. He is burdened with increased cost of cases and increased freights. He suffers more than do others in the community by the increased price of sugar. He is at the mercy of frost, hail storms, droughts and wind-storms, and also numerous pests. The only means by which he can cope with these pests is by spraying with arsenate of lead. tends that the fruit-grower ought to be able to purchase any kind of spray, and should not be unduly penalized for using the imported article.
