Wednesday, 6 Octoier, 1948. took tbe chair at 10.30 a.m., and read prayers. QuABTEBS. Minister's announcement that the Qovernment proposes to spy on members of this Parliament, will the right honourable gentleman inform the House-(a ) whether instructions have been given to tap the private telephone conversations and tamper with the private mail of members of this House; (6) whether this work will be entrusted to a special political police force to be recruited from known members of the Communist party in the Government's employ; (c) whether members of the Government consulted the Communist leader Thornton during their interviews with him in Canberra recently, about the operations of the N.K.V.D. or Soviet Political Police, with the view of adopting its methods here; and (d) whether the Government proposes to introduce into this Parliament legislation similar to that now Parliament, to make any form of opposition to the Government a crime to be dealt with by a secret court ? first portion of the question, which relates to the alleged spying on members of the Parliament, I have issued a very simple instruction to tbe Acting Attorney General, who is in charge of the Oommonwealth Investigation Service, to ascertain, if possible, in what possible ways documents have been used, or may be used, and how such documents could oome into tbe hands not only of members of this Parliament, but also of other individuals who are in this building only as a privilege. The Commonwealtb In vestigation Service has been asked to ascertain whether there has been a leakage of information, and, if so, how. it has occurred. Tbis instruction is not aimed at any particular person. The object is to find out how certain confidential, and in some instances, secret, government documents could be allowed to pass into the hands of individuals other than those who are entitled to the possession of them. The Government desires to know what is happening and who is responsible for it. If the inquiry brings into the net members of the Parliament, or other individuals whose presence in this building is a privilege and not a right, that will be noted. This work, naturally, has been entrusted to the Acting Attorney-General, whose department, as I have said, administers the Commonwealth Investigation Service. When a report has been made on the investigations, it will be brought to my notice. I made it perfectly clear yesterday that whatever is done in regard to this matter will not be done in order to gain any political advantage. of that. silence the Opposition. members that the Government is more concerned with the interests of this country than with the gaining of some political advantage over any particular individual. The honourable member for before tbe Czech Communist Beid has mentioned a visit to Canberra by Mr Thornton. I did not see Mr Thornton on that occasion, and I do not know anything about the contacts that he might have made while he was here. I do not remember any request having been made by Mr Thornton to see me on that occasion. Had he made such a request as the secretary of a union, his representations would have been given consideration in the light of the time available as would those of any other union secretary. to the Prime Minister regarding press reports which state that the Government of Malaya has decided to ban the entry into Malaya of all Communists and Communist sympathizers.

9,Mr White,"I address a questionnationalities including Australians, and mentions the name of Lawrence Sharkey, a Moscow-trained Communist who is the leader of the Communists in Australia and adds that information is heing gathered about him and his operations wliile he was in Singapore some time ago. Will the Prime Minister or the Minister for Immigration offer the closest co-operation to the Malayan Government to see that the ban is enforced and that the troubles that that country faces to-day are not further fomented by undesirable Australians who go there? the Minister for Immigration has already made it perfectly clear that if any Government makes a request that certain individuals shall not be granted passports or visds for entry into its country its wish will be carried out hy the' Australian Government. That has already been done in an instance involving India and Pakistan and precisely the same thing will be done in regard to Malaya. Regarding the other matters raised, the fact is that the Malayan administration has for many months refused permission for even Chinese and Indians to enter Malaya. There was a great deal of discussion in this Parliament about certain Malayan individuals. On my visit to Singapore I found that there had been a ban placed on the immigration into Malaya of particular nationalities, yet the Malayan authorities complained about Australia's attitude to immigration. I have no doubt that the Malayan Government adopted its policy for its own reasons. I am not questioning its reasons which were no doubt quite sound in the circumstances. Minister seen the report in this morning's press that police officers of the Malayan Government are investigating statements and examining captured documents concerning conversations between the Australian Communist, L. Sharkey, and Malayan leaders in Singapore last March, shortly before the outbreak of Communist terrorism in that area? Will the Australian Government request the Malayan Government to forward to Australia information of the result of this investigation in order that the extent of the part of Australian Communists in the Malayan troubles shall be made known to the public of this country ? statement in this morning's newspapers to which the honourable member has referred. In fact, I have not yet read any of to-day's newspapers. The honourable gentleman mentioned a report that, the Malayan authorities, presumably at the instance of Mr Malcolm MacDonald,. who is the Governor General of Malaya and Special Commissioner in South-EastI understand that Asia, are examining certain captured documents. From my communications with Mr MacDonald from time to time, I have been able to obtain his views about a number of matters affecting the Malayan Union. I assume that if Mr MacDonald desired to inform us about any particular matters affecting the Malayan Union, as he has already done in requesting arms and equipment,, he will do so. However, I shall examine the matter which the honourable member has raised. JURY SERVICE. representing the Acting Attorney-General inform me whether high administrative officers, when called up for jury service in the Australian Capital Territory, have heen refused exemption from such service despite requests for it from their departmental heads? In view of the extra pressure now applied to public servants will he state whether sympathetic consideration will be accorded to representations for exemption from jury -service of high administrative oflScers? whether the facts stated are correct hut I shall consult the Acting Attorney General and I am certain that he will give consideration to the point the honourable member has raised. to the Minister for Labour and National Service concerning representations madeto me in relation to lighthouse-keepers on the Victorian coast.

15,Mr Bowden,"I address a question,fact that the hours of lighthouse-keepers have not been improved in the last 80 years and that for over 20 years the lighthouse-keepers have not been able to secure the appointment of an arbitrator to hear their claims. ""Will the Minister investigate this claim with a view to granting conditions to lighthousebeepers which will be at least comparable with those enjoyed by other Commonwealth servants? that no improvement has been made in the conditions of lighthouse-keepers during the last 80 year3 the position should certainly be investigated. These omcers are employees of the Marine Branch of the Department of Shipping and Fuel, and are members of the Public Service. Of my own knowledge I am aware that the lighthousekeepers have appeared before the arbitration courts from time to time, and I have attended conferences concerning their conditions. I shall investigate the matter but I shall be surprised if the facts are as stated by the honourable member. presenting the Postmaster-General aware that radio station 3DB, Melbourne, which is owned by Sir Keith Murdoch and his associates has sent out letters to its clients announcing that an additional charge of 33-J per cent, will be made for radio advertisements? Is that development due to the transfer of control of prices from the Commonwealth to the States? Since lilcences for radio transmitting stations have to be renewed annually, can the Postmaster-General take action to prevent radio advertisers from being exploited, because any increase of the cost of advertising must be passed on to the general public by increased prices for advertised goods? matter to the notice of the Postmaster General in order to ascertain, first, whether station 3DB has increased its charges by 33^ per cent., and, secondly, to ascertain whether any other radio station has acted similarly. I shall also ask the Postmaster-General to ascertain whether he has power under the Australian Broadcasting Act to limit the degree to which holders of radio transmitting licences can exploit the public in the manner in which it is alleged Sir Keith Murdoch and his associates are doing. I shall also request the Postmaster-General to inquire into the result of the recent transfer of control of rents and prices from the Commonwealth to the States insofar as it affects matters connected with broadcasting, Prime Minister furnish any detailed information about the method of working ancl distributing the phosphatic deposits on Christmas Island? I should like to know whether the Government proposes to allow private enterprise to continue to work and distribute the phosphates or whether it contemplates establishing a trading concern which will compete with private enterprise along similar lines to those followed by Trans-Australia Airlines in the field of civil aviation. tioned by the honourable member has been the subject of discussions between the New Zealand and Australian 'Governments, and Mr Gaze, an official of the British Phosphate Commissioners, was authorized by both Governments to conduct the negotiations. Although certain matters of detail have yet to be decided, I can assure honourable members that steps have been taken to ensure that ample supplies of phosphatic rock, which is so important to primary producers, will he made available to both countries. The Government considered the matter to be of such importance that it authorized the Minister for External Territories and Treasury officials to engage in discussions with New Zealand officials concerning the purchase price of the undertaking, and the rights associated with the present leases, which run for 42 years. It was considered that the New Zealand and Australian Governments should acquire those rights, and that has heen done. General negotiations have been conducted by Mr Gaze, but certain formalities relating to distribution have yet to be determined. In principle, we have agreed to the acquisition for £2,750,000.

It would seem that, having regard to the transport difficulties available in a number of places involved, the Commission was in the best position to undertake the distribution ment would like them to be, principally of the phos.phatic rock from Christmas Island. These matters have yet to he finalized. The objective of the Minister for External Territories is to arrange for the commissioners to act as the operating agent at Christmas Island. Mrs. BLACKBURN I have received a number of inquiries about food commodities regarded as necessaries by a great many families, which are at present, and have been for many months past off the market, at least in Victoria. Can the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture inform the House what has happened to treacle and golden syrup, and why these commodities are not available to the people? How long does the honourable gentleman suppose the people are likely to be deprived of these nourishing foods? I have not the faintest idea what has become of treacle and golden syrup. I am aware that both are nourishing foods. X. shall make it my business to institute inquiries, and I shall endeavour to furnish the honourable member with the desired information as early as possible. tions have been made to me by grocers in tlie midland districts of Tasmania regarding the grave shortage of sugar, stating that they have been out of supplies for more than three weeks. As the next shipment of sugar is not due at Launceston until the l l t h or 12th October, will the Minister representing tbe Minister for Shipping and Fuel, through the Australian. Shipping Board, make representations to the companies concerned, with a view to speeding up this shipment of sugar, if possible? Will the have enhonorable gentleman endeavour to have shipments to Tasmania made with more regularity and also arrange for better spacing of ships on the Tasmanian service ? supplies of sugar are not as readily throughout Australia as the Governbecause there is not sufficient labour available in the refining factories to ensure that adequate supplies are on hand to meet requirements. Insofar as the shortage in Tasmania relates to transport difficulties in that State, I shall draw the attention of my colleague the Minister for Shipping and Fuel to the situation. I am certain that if it is possible for him to have a ship made available immediately for the purpose of transporting to Tasmania these urgently needed supplies, he will do so. I shall also ask the Minister to inquire into the regularity of the shipping schedule between the mainland and Tasmania and I am sure that he will do his utmost to assist. Dame ENTD LYONS -In view of the statement in this morning's press, under a Washington date-line, that there is no record in the State Department of the United States of America of an agreement that the "" Manila girls "" would be returned to Australia after their war service, can the Minister for Immigration say whether the agreement is in writing? If so, who were the signatories? Oan he now disclose the exact nature of the document on which I seek information? honourable member for Darwin that rumour was ever a lying jade and the rumours that are circulating in Washington and that have been published'in the Melbourne Herald in relation to documents or other records that exist, or are said to exist, concerning an agreement between myself and memhers of the American Embassy, are not to be relied on.

26,Mr Calwell,"I would say to thed'Affaires, Mr John Minter, with a request that a number of Australian girls should be permitted to accompany the American Army to Manila. Previously, Colonel Jordan had "" spirited "" fourteen girls out of this country without passports or documents of any sort, in an American aircraft which left from Brisbane. He claimed that he had the right to do that because the girls were members of the American Army. They were Australian citizens, and only civilian members of the American Army. We protested to the American authorities against this high handed action by Colonel Jordan, although I believe that he acted in good faith. The girls were returned to Australia and we were asked to allow not only those fourteen girls but a considerable number of other girls to go to perform duties for a period of six months. I agreed after consulting the Prime Minister and the girls left in batches for service in Manila and later, in Tokyo. We were asked to permit them to accompany the American Army to Tokyo. We were told that the American forces would not require them: for more than six months in all, and we agreed that they should go for that period, while they were serving with the American Army, and, as the Prime Minister reminds me, while American girls were being trained to take their places. honourable member for New England is entirely out of order. He is not allowed to cross-question the Minister.' Charge d'Affaires promised me that those girls would be returned, and subsequently an American colonel came to my office and gave me an explicit undertaking that after the completion of' certain work, and at the end of their period of service, the American Army would return the girls toAustralia. This Government has acted very generously in regard to the American and British authorities, but to some degree our generosity has been imposed upon. When the war was over it was thought that Australia should supply typists and stenographers for the British Army in Malaya and Burma, and in other places, and for the American Army in Malaya and Tokyo. We already had a great shortage of labour in this country. We were trying to attract migrants to Australia, and whilst we were prepared to act reasonably in respect of both theBritish and American authorities, we expected that we would receive co-operation from those authorities inrespect of any agreement we entered into. We had no trouble with the British, but it seems that many changes have since taken place among the staff of the United States Embassy in Canberra, and there seems to have been a certain amount of remissness on the part of high officials there in making notes of what they had promised, and what they had undertaken to do. The American Army authorities, having got what they wanted, made nonote of the obligations into which they had entered. Beyond certain documents, which are sufficient in themselves, there is not a complete record of all that transpired to back my protest to the American Embassy here, and to the State Department in Washington. However, there is extant sufficient evidence of the agreement, and there would have been no trouble whatever if the United States Army authorities had honoured the obligations they had entered into. In some instances, instead of returning the girls to Australia at the expense of the United States, the American Army officers persuaded the girls, or the girls persuaded the Army Officers, that they should sign agreements releasing the American Army of any obligations to return them to Australia. Yesterday, I answered a question on this subject, and pointed out that two of the girls who had gone to the United States of America were already stranded there, and their parents were asking the Australian Government to pay their passages back, to this country. Another girl is also in unfortunate circumstances, and I have no doubt that the Australian Government will be asked to bear the expense of bringing her back to Australia also. I have taken my stand on a matter of principle. The United States Government, through officials of the American Embassy in Canberra, entered into an agreement with the Australian",15,Recall Of Australian Citizens From Overseas

29,Mr Calwell,"The American-Government, and the United States Army authorities have not fulfilled the agreement. I body, particularly the representatives of a great power, to escape the obligations which they entered into with the Government of this country. Immigration whether the young Australian ladies who are known as the "" Manila girls "", are minors, or whether they have reached, the age of twenty-one years? Is it not a fact that, in attempting to foree American authorities should be visited tliose ladies to return to Australia and bring them in behind an iron curtain in this country, the Minister is acting in breach of the Declaration of Human Rights the draft of which is now being considered by the Committee on Human Rights of the United Nations General Assembly of which, I the Attorney-General is chairman? Is not the Minister abrogating human rights, in breach of that convention, by preventing persons over the age of 21 years from emigrating freely from their own country to any other country? If so, why is he acting in breach of the draft convention and attempting to take coercive action against the young women? placed upon the rights of any persons in Australia who wish to emigrate. There is in the instance referred to by the bonorable member for New England a special situation, which I went to pains to explain in answer to a question asked by the honourable member for Darwin, in which the Government of the United States is involved because of an agreement which it made with the Australian Government. I propose to continue to insist that the -United States Government shall carry out its obligations. The question whether these girls are minors is beside the point, and in any case I am not in a position to give any interesting details about their ages. The human rights convention, with which the honorahle member seems to have a passing acquaintance, is also beside the point. We shall deal with the situation which has arisen as the result of an agreement made with the United States Government and, when that situation has been resolved, we shall take up any other questions which the honourable I see no reason why member might like to ask about human should make it easy for anyrights or anything else. At present, the right of the Australian Government to have an agreement honoured is the only consideration. Immigration regard the repatriation of the five Australian girls now in the United States of America as a matter of national importance to Australia? Will he also state why the alleged sins of the upon the heads of those girls ? matter has been taken far enough in questions. The Standing Orders provide that questions must not be based upon other questions asked in the House on the same day.

Has he seen a report in this morning's issue of the Sydney Daily Telegraph in which it is stated that an official of Australian National Airways had said that the pilot, Captain A. G. Hubbard, had failed to use an automatic fire extinguisher when the port engine of the plane caught fire? Has the Minister also seen the statement of Captain Hubbard, D.S.O., D.F.C, and former wing-commander in the Royal Australian Air Force, that he did not know whether he would have had time to use the extinguisher, as his first consideration had been the safety of the 27 passengers and the three members of the crew? Seeing that the pilot performed a magnificent feat in bringing the aircraft down without loss of life, or injury to the 27 passengers and three members of the crew, does not the Minister think that the published statement in the newspaper is calculated to prejudice the pilot's",16,Recall Of Australian Citizens From Overseas

I have not seen the report referred to by the honourable member in his question, wherein it is alleged that an Australian National Airways spokesman had said that the pilot failed to use a fire extinguisher which was at his disposal. I. gather from what I have read and from information furnished directly to uie that the captain and crew of the aircraft including the hostess, Miss NorthAsh, did a magnificent job in saving the lives of the passengers; but I am reluctant to express any opinion before I have received full information which will be supplied to me by officers who have gone to the scene of the crash to investigate the accident. That entails a thorough technical investigation, and until I receive their report I cannot offer any opinion. It is wrong for any one to speak in advance in any way that might prejudice the members of the crew of the aircraft or any one associated with the accident.

The time allotted for the consideration of the estimated expenditure by these five departments in the financial year 1948-49 is approximately four hours. Under the Standing Orders, an honourable member is allowed to speak for two periods, each not exceeding 30 minutes, on each question before the Chair on the Estimates, and the Minister in charge of a department, the estimates for which are being considered, is allowed to speak for as long as he likes to speak. If what has already occurred is a guide to what will occur, the Ministers who are responsible for these departments will speak for some time. An honourable member opposite interjects to ask why I am wasting time. In the time that is at my disposal, I can only scratch the surface of these estimates, because I desire that other honourable members on this side of the chamber may have an opportunity to express their views. I can only deal collectively with the departments that are now under consideration. The Australian people must be amazed at the increased appropriations which are proposed. The amounts by which the estimated expenditure for the year 1948-49 exceeds the amount that was actually expended in the year 1947-48 in respect of the departments now under consideration are as follows:Department Department Department Department Department culture Taking the five departments together, the aggregate amount that the committee is now asked to vote exceeds by £1,314,840 the amount that was expended in 1947-48.

We have to consider the record of these departments in order to see what they are now doing, what they did last year, and what they intend to do in future with this Mr Turnbull. large amount of the taxpayers' money. The Minister for Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) has told honourable members of the great plans that his department has for the future. It is not necessary to go very far from Parliament House in Canberra to see what is, in fact, being done. I saw a Department of Information film recently which depicted 3ome of the houses that are now being built on the outskirts of this city and which it said could be the slums of the future. Any honourable member who has taken the trouble to inspect them knows that it is not in the best interests of Australia to build houses of that kind. It is not a progressive move, and a Government that talks of improving the conditions of the people and at the same time allows such houses to he erected is, to say the least, inconsistent. These remarks apply to every city or town in Australia in which the Department of Works and Housing is operating. I have seen some houses in which the bedrooms are so small that if a double bed were put into one of them the occupants would find it difficult to get out of the bed. In my opinion, Australian civil aviation undertakings are using too much petrol. The quantities that are now allocated to them should be substantially reduced. I remind the committee that the petrol allocations to primary producers have been reduced considerably.

Has any other Australian industry made such a valuable contribution? On top of that, of course, the income of wheat-growers was taxed. In my electorate some wheat growers were paying 10s. in the £1 income tax. This meant that if they harvested eight bags to the acre at £1 a bag, they paid £4 an acre to the Government exclusive of indirect Ts it any wonder that I had to ask the Minister only yesterday when the price of wheat for home consumption would be increased? The Minister has said definitely that the Government will stand by the index figure that has been fixed. In Australia it would appear that the days of very low prices for wheat are past, although nobody expects overseas prices to remain at their present high level. It is probable, however, that for many years to come the cost of wheat production in Australia will be at least twice as much as it was ten or fifteen years ago although the home consumption price has advanced by only ls. Id. a bushel. Wheat-growers are contributing economy vast amounts of money as I have clearly shown by my reference to No. 10 pool. what the Government is doing for the wheat-growers, and what it should do if it took a long-range view. The Minister for Immigration often tells honourable members that Australia must increase its population and that it must admit millions of migrants to this country. There is only a certain area of Australia that is suitable for wheat growing. It should be our desire to foster the wheat-growing industry and not to take such large sums of money from the wheat-grower. is heavily taxed but obtains very little from the Government in return. The Government's attitude to the wheat grower might he summed up in these words: "" Prices are high overseas. You are receiving some recompense for many years of drought and low world prices. We intend to bleed you white "". Jfr. Turnbull. The Government should do more for the growers of this great product than it. does now. There is too much Australian wlieat being sold at concessional rates. I do not object very strongly to such sales for human consumption but one must consider first, the vast quantity of breakfast foods on the market; secondly, the cost of wheat for human consumption in Australia which is at least 10s. a bushel less than the average export price for No. 10 pool wheat, and thirdly, the fact that every loaf of oread, biscuit and cake bought or made by Australian housewives is made from taxation wheat that was bought at that lower price I think my point has been thoroughly subsantiated. It is only by considering these aspects that honourable members can even start to realize the contribution that the wheat-growers, are making to stabilize the economy of this country. When a drought occurs, similar to that now occurring in north Wimmera in my electorate and, according to the honorahle member for Grey, to the one now occurring in South Australia, what does the Government do for the drought-stricken wheat grower?

The Government is overlooking the real value of the vast wheat industry. Individual wheat-growers come and go, but the Australian people hope that this Commonwealth will become a great nation in the future. For that reason, the very basis of the foodstuffs to be consumed by our increasing population must be fostered and maintained. The wheat industry is not being so fostered and maintained under the Government's present policy. The Government has 20,0.00,000 bushels of wheat at concessional rates for stock feeding. Because of the difference between prices which aro received for wheat sold in Australia and overseas prices, wheat-growers have lost by those sales alone an amount of about £11,000,000. That amount is in effect a contribution to the nation's economy, but it is only a fraction of the real conis 4s. l i d . a bushel at ports. When tribution made by wheat-growers. The Government is selling wheat at concessional rates to raisers of pigs and poultry and to other people. If the Government desires to assist poultry-farmers or pigraisers or farmers with starving sheep, let it do so by all means, but on the same basis as that on which the Government sold wheat to New Zealand. That is to say, let the Government pay from Consolidated Revenue the wheat and the prices received for wheat sold at concessional rates. Why should New Zealand get a separate deal? I should like honourable members opposite to answer that question, but no one seems to be able to answer it ; at least, no lionorable member opposite has ever attempted to do so. If I went into partnership with some one to start a poultry farm, for which I required 1,000 bushels of wheat, why should the wheat-growers have to keep me going? It is time this unfairness was ended. The Australian Country party holds that wheat for human consumption in Australia could be. sold at cost of production plus a margin of profit, but that when wheat is sold at, concessional prices the difference should be paid by the Government and not be wholly bome by thc grower. I see that the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard is .busy at the table and I know what he will say when he rises. He will tell us that the wheat-grower ""can't have it both ways "". He will tell us that prices for wheat were low many years ago and that at that time the wheat-grower was pleased to take advantage of the home-consumption price in Australia, which was then our best market. That debit has been wiped out long ago. It was wiped out on the price rise in the first few months after the recent world war, so that argument is no longer valid. To-day wheat-growers all over Australia, sold more than including those in my electorate whom I represent, are asking how long the present state of affairs is to continue. It is possible, and has been possible in the past, that all the wheat grown in Australia could he used for home comsumption, but prices ruling overseas go as high as £ 1 a bushel whilst the price iri Australia of wheat for stock-feeding there is a drought and the wheat",22,Department Of Commerce And Agriculture

58,Mr Turnbull,"I should not likecrop is poor it is likely that the Governbe taken that wheat-growers are in ment will sell an even greater proportion of the wheat crop for stock feeding than it does now. I represent many wool growers, and I say that when sheep are starving during a drought we can supply wheat to feed them as the 1 Government, on a previous occasion, arranged in regard to Queensland. I believe that the Government should take action to assist stock-owners in emergencies, but it should provide wheat at concessional prices and pay the difference to the growers. As soon as sheep get on their feet again, although there may be a break in the wool, after a bad time they may be shorn and the wool sold for export at world parity prices, which are not restricted hy the Government, but the unfortunate wheat-growers who provide feed for tbe sheep do not receive any corresponding benefit. Wheat sold at concessional rates which is consumed by stock helps to produce meat and wool for sale at high prices overseas. If the Minister can explain such an anomaly then he is a genius. I want him to assure us that a definite limitation will be placed on the sale of wheat as concessional prices. The Minister has dictatorial powers to interfere in the handling of wheat and to order wheat to be sold at concessional prices. We object to the way such power has been used by this Government. advocated stabilizationof the wheat industry, which requires stabilization more than does any other primary industry, but wheat-growers are genuinely apprehensive that the Minister will step in and order more and more wheat to be sold at low prices in Australia. The wheat industry has already done far more than its share to maintain the national economy, and it should not be called xipon to make any further contributions. I should like the Minister to make a definite statement of the Government's intention in regard to the concessional sale of wheat. Is it intended that wheat shall continue to he sold at the present concessional prices, or that the volume sold shall be reduced or increased? Wheat-growers are most anxious that the Minister should furnish a definite answer confined his speech to an attack on the to that question. For the moment it may Government's attitude towards the wheat Mr TurnbuU. accord with the present home-consumption price, plus a margin of profit of wheat for human consumption, but they object most strongly to any increase, or even a continuance, of the present volume of sales at concessional prices for any other purposes. Such sales are harassing wheat-growers and are not in any way assisting the wheat industry, which is of such vital importance to this country. Mr Pollard having been called, deavoured to obtain the call before the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, but he was preferred. For three days I have been seeking to obtain the call in the debate on the Estimates, but on each occasion a Minister -has risen simultaneously. What is happening is quite obvious.

Commerce and Agriculture) [11.45] In making his contribution to the debate the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull) was good I have always enough to refer to me as being one of the most courteous persons honourable members could wish to meet outside the chamber. However, he then suggested that my attitude inside the chamber towards members of the Opposition is discourteous, particularly when replying to their questions. I think that I can fairly say that I endeavour to set an example of courtesy when I answer questions in the chamber. However, the honourable member for Wimmera and other honourable members opposite often ask questions not with a view to soliciting information, but in order to manufacture political propaganda for their use, and whilst I endeavour to answer all questions factually, when tricky questions are asked I treat them as such when replying to them.

60,Mr Pollaed (Ballarat,"Minister forindustry. He said that the great majority of wheat-growers in his constituency, as well as wheat-growers generally, were dissatisfied with the Government's treatment of the industry, hut I am convinced that the honourable member has no justification for making that assertion. The plain fact is that members of the present Government survived the general elections held in 1943 and 1946, .and at each of those elections the Australian Labour party placed before the -electors, and particularly those in wheat growing areas, its plans for the stabilization of the wheat industry. At each ..general election the people, including the wheat-growers, endorsed the statements of policy made by the Australian Labour party, whose candidates received a substantial number of wheat-growers' votes. That, in itself, indicates substantial support by the wheat-growers for the -Government's stabilization plans. know that from time to time various members of the Opposition, including particularly the honourable member for member for Wimmera, who have a special interest in the wheat-growers, have complained that the Government is unsympathetic to the industry. In ventilating their complaints they have stressed the importance to Australia's economy of the industry, but the Government is by no means unaware of that importance When the Vice-President of the Executive Council( Mr Scully), who preceded me in the portfolio of Commerce and Agriculture, introduced a measure in 1946 to provide for the stabilization of the wheat industry, I went to considerable trouble, in the course of my speech, to quote statistics which indicated the vital importance of the industry to the national economy. I think that I adequately illustrated the impact of the industry on railway revenue, on employment generally in primary industries, .and on the future of the agricultural implement manufacturing industry in this country. I also emphasized the importance of wheat to the pastoral and poultry industries and even to the dairying industry. facts to most honorahle members, and no one can deny the impor-.tance to Australia of the wheat industry. The present Government has realized the great importance of the wheat industry, and that is why it has endeavoured for several years past to place the industry upon a proper hasis by providing an adequate scheme of stabilization. In 1946, my predecessor, as Minister for Commerce and Agriculture, the present Vice-President of the Executive Council brought down a wheat stabilization plan to New Zealand. that plan was conditional upon the cooperation of each of the State governments of Australia. Each of them, irrespective of their political complexion, undertook to introduce the necessary complementary legislation to enable the legislation passed by this Parliament to become operative; but unfortunately the I degree of stabilization which the Commonwealth legislation would have ensured did not become an established fact principally because of the antagonism and party political propaganda of the party to which the honourable member for Wimmera belongs. Largely for that reason some of the States failed to enact the requisite complementary legislation. It is true that in some States a ballot of wheat-growers was held, but the proposal was not taken any further. That the wheat-growing industry has been effectively temporarily stabilized since 1946, and that we have been able to operate an effective organized marketing system for wheat has been due not to the legislation brought down by my predecessor but to the fact that we have been able to continue to market wheat under the defence power. In spite of that the Government's wheat stabilization scheme has been opposed throughout the Commonwealth by the friends and allies of the honourable member for Wimmera and the honourable member for Indi. Reference has been made to a challenge in the High Court in the .

Everybody knows that when anti-Labour governments were in office no effective plan was evolved for anything. It is for that reason that honourable members opposite have endeavoured in every way to counter the strenuous efforts made by the Labour Government to alleviate thc difficulties of the unfortunate primary producers of this country who, while governments formed by the Opposition parties were in office, were, in every sense ber and members of the Australian of the. word, in a perilous condition. The"" greatest"" plan that the right honourable member for Cowper ever introduced was the famous debt adjustment scheme. "" great"" but everybody else viewed it with disgust. That plan placed the wheat farmers of this country merely on subsistence, and they were put in the invidious position of being able to meet only part of their commitments. Every plan that this Government has introduced, including this one, has been a plan which goes beyond the provision of a mere subsistence for the farmers, and has committed all the taxpayers of this country to contribute an amount sufficient to ensure that the standard of living of the wheat-farmers and the dairy farmers shall be based on similar calculations as apply to the determination of the standard of living for all other people -in Australia. That has never before been provided for in the history of the Commonwealth of Australia. It matters not whether the price of wheat rises or falls in two years' time because the people of Australia are committed to see that the wheat-farmer gets his cost of production, based on the index figure which indicates variations in the cost of production. cessional sales? concessional sales in the past future? future, tlie plan has been accepted by the Australian Wheat Growers Pederation, with the reservation that they maintain the right to press for more generous treatment in respect of concessional sales. There will be no change in the plan. It provides that each State Government, within the confines of its own State, will fix the price of wheat for internal consumption at 6s. 3d. a bushel, varied from time to time according to fluctuations in the cost of production of that wheat. That will apply whether the wheat he required for human consumption or for stock feed. The honourable memCountry party would be well advised to be very careful in respect of this matter, since it affects, substantially, flour and bread prices within Australia. Does the He thought it was honourable member for Wimmera desire to put the price of bread up considerably ? for human consumption. member want to be responsible for an increase of the cost of living to the railway men and others in his electorate, to a figure substantially above the cost of production to the wheat farmers concerned? Does he wish to be responsible for the adoption of a policy that would substantially inflate the already high prices of eggs, both within Australia, and outside? Does he desire to make the position of the poultry-farmer utterly impossible hy charging 10s., 15s. or 17s. a bushel, or whatever the external parity price of wheat may be? that he did not suggest that. ber suggested that the price in Australia for stock feed should he the external price.

I say to the honourable member for Wimmera and the honourable member for Indi that this matter has been well thrashed out in the electorates of Western Australia and Victoria, and despite all the propaganda and all the propositions submitted, a majority of wheat growers of those States have voted in favour of a plan which gives justice to every section of the community. Let us consider the stock feed proposition. In the last three months the Government has received many telegrams from people in Western Australia, including Mr Wood, the Minister for Agriculture, requesting that thousands of bushels of wheat be made available to save sheep which were starving. Is it suggested that those unfortunate sheep breeders of Western Australia, whose sheep were dying hecause of drought, should pay the overseas parity price of wheat? In many instances they themselves are wheat growers. Let us analyse the politicallyinspired demand by this section of theprimary producers, or any other members of the anti-Labour parties, in respect of this product. Pig iron is the basis of the agricultural implement manufacturing industry, but do honourable members realize that if Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited were allowed to increase the price of pig iron to overseas parity, the price in Australia would rise from approximately £6 a ton to about £12 10s. a ton? The immediate effect would be increased prices for harvesters, ploughs, plough shears, discs, seed As I have previously stated, when the and top-dressing equipment, separators and their parts, milking machines, ancl every other portion of farming equipment which is manufactured in Australia. Whilst some farm machinery, such as tractors, is not manufactured in Australia, considerable quantities of farm machinery are manufactured in this country. Let us consider the situation in regard to the manufacture of galvanized iron which farmers require for their fowl sheds and other buildings, and as protection from damage by rats, weevils, and political propaganda disseminated by members of the AusMr Pollard. tralian Country party. The price of zinc in the markets of the world is £93 a ton, yet the zinc producers of Australia are required to sell zinc within Australia at £22 a ton in order that such products as galvanized iron and wire netting may be' sold to the primary producers at a price in line with the Australian internal economy. It must not beforgotten that in the United States of America the wages paid to the unskilled workers in this industry is at the rate of about £3 a day. The honourable member for Indi has argued that growers should be paid world parity prices for that part of their wheat consumed in Australia. If his argument be sound, the wage earners, without whom the wheat could not be produced or transported, are entitled to overseas wage parity rates, namely, £3 a day. man has a wonderful imagination. never leads me away from facts, but the honourable member for Indi, under the influence of his imagination, wanders far from facts up the curly garden path. Already, he has lifted envious eyes from his own electorate of Indi to the plains of Barkly. Similarly, the distinguished and much decorated honourable member for Bendigo( Mr Eankin), as soon as the boundaries of the new electorates were published, saw that the division of Bendigo was likely to be uncomfortable The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN ( Mr Sheehan) -Order! am not allowed tb tell the whole story. Government was frustrated in its attempt to promote the welfare of the wheat industry-largel y because of the political machinations of the Opposition-it immediately brought in alternative proposals. The Government has stuck to those proposals until at last we have worn down all opposition. Honourable members opposite have at last become convinced that the growers do not believe what they have been saying, as has heen demonstrated in the hallot of wheat-growers in two States. Therefore, honourable members opposite have relinquished the fight. From now on, their attitude towards the Government's wheat plan will be very",27,Department Of Commerce And Agriculture

78,Mr Pollaed,"I am sorry that I-different from what it was in the past. The growers have received much better treatment from this Government than from anti-Labour governments. When the honourable member for In d i was asked, while his party was in power, to arrange for the payment of an additional then would have brought the price to only half the cost of production, he said, "" I refuse to embarrass the Government"". The honourable member for Hume( MrF u l l e r ) , the honourable member for Riverina( Mr Langtry) and the Ministerf o r Works and Housing( Mr Lemmon) have never refused to put the case of the wheat-growers on the ground that it might embarrass the Government. In caucus and at cabinet meetings they have strongly pressed the claims of growers to a price that would at laast meet the cost of production. The Government's plan has now been accepted by practically all the growers, and w ill be in operation before long. It is opposed by a few tories in the Wheat Growers Federation, but most of the leading members of that organization are urging the growers to accept the plan, and there is no doubt that it w ill be accepted in all States. Indeed, so confident is the Government of this, that Commonwealth legislation to implement the plan has already been prepared. Similarly, the State governments, whatever their political complexion, w ill in troduce complementary legislation. Let me read from a document which sets out the Government's stabilization proposals:(.1) The Commonwealth Government shall be made (except for the 1945-46 and 1946-47, guarantee a price of 6s. 3d. a bushel f.o.r. amounts already approved) except after conports bulk basis for wheat grown and delivered sideration at some future date. by wheat-growers. price is 17s. 3d. a bushel. member for In d i opposed to the plan? 1945-46 and 1946-47 seasons.

Further proposals are(2) The guaranteed price shall vary indicates according to an index of production costs for each season starting with the 1948-49 crop. (3) The guarantee shall apply to the wheat crop marketed through approved organizations for the period up to the end of the 1952-53 season. It was stated at a meeting of the Australian Agricultura l Council that some of the States were prepared to 3d. a bushel, which even have the plan administered by the Australian Wheat Board, the States merely appointing superintendents. Other States preferred to appoint boards of their own. I can see no reason why such a matter should not be left to the States to decide f p r themselves. According to a press report, the Victorian Government has decided not to set up a board, but to carry on -through the Australian Wheat Board as hitherto, the board acting through a State superintendent. going to appoint a chairman of the Australian Wheat Board? be a friend of the honourable member, nor any one of whom the honorahle member would approve. The plan also provides(5) The Commonwealth shall ensure the guaranteed price in respect of the export from any one season's crop, provided that this guarantee shall not apply to the quantity of export in excess of 100,000,000 bushels. (6) A stabilization fund shall be established by means of a tax on wheat exported to meet the guaranteed price above mentioned. (7) The tax shall apply when the export price is higher than the guaranteed price, and shall be 50 per cent, of the difference between the two but shall not exceed 2s. 2d. a bushel.

(B) The authorizing of an approved organization to receive from wheatWorks and Housing told the Minister to growers all wheat voluntarily delivered for sale as part of an Auskeep going because he does not want the tralian pool.

(<2) The regulation of wheat-growing on marginal areas which have been reconstructed under the plans approved for the elimination of uneconomic wheat areas, and the establishment of a committee to advise in cases where action to regulate wheat-growing on marginal areas is necessary. Some misunderstanding has arisen with respect to the growing of wheat in marginal areas. It is well known that under the reconstruction plans of some States farmers are allowed to grow wheat in order to enable them to rotate their crops for the more efficient conduct of their farms. Farmers are allowed to market the limited quantity of wheat grown under those conditions, but in the main such wheat is used for stock fodder or to build up fodder reserves. That position will not be substantially altered under this plan. The conference also agreedsubject to acceptance by the respective State governments1. That States, where they desire to do so, will constitute State wheat boards composed of a majority of growers' representatives elected by a ballot conducted by the State. 2. That each State board will nominate growers' representatives who are growers to the central authority in accordance with the present grower representation on the Australian Wheat Board. 3. That it will be optional for any State board to act either in an advisory or an Mr Pollard. administrative capacity as decided by the State concerned. 4. Where a State government does not desire to create a State wheat board, the machinery of the central authority, i.e., the Australian Wheat Board, is to function. 5. Where no State board is created, growers' representatives to the Australian Wheat Board will be elected by a ballot of growers conducted by the State.

At one of those places -onl y one, I admitI saw a substantial dump of wire netting ready for use. It is probably true that the settler had waited a considerable time for it, and it is true that other settlers are still waiting anxiously for supplies, but, overall, as much wire netting and galvanized wire of all sizes is being produced in Australia to-day as was being produced before the war.

Wise governments, both Commonwealth and State and including anti-Labour governments, have wisely decreed that these commodities shall go to those whose needs are of the highest priority, namely, ex-servicemen who are being established on the land. If there were no control, rich men, like the honourable member for New England with his broad acres, would mop up the available supplies and, incidentally, benefit from substantial tax allowances on account of the expenditure thus incurred, whilst unfortunate ex-servicemen starting off on the land would not be able to get even one strand of personal explanation.

I said that stock-feeders and poultry-farmers should receive assistance if the Government conunder customs by-law. Duties have been sidered that it was necessary, hut that the difference, 'between the price which they paid for wheat, and the export price, should be made up to wheat-growers from Consolidated Revenue.

I could also speak at some length on the admittance of goods imposed for protective purposes on the importation of many classes of goods, but many of those articles are not being produced in this country in sufficient quantities to meet the local demand. We urgently require from overseas Oregon and other timber for building purposes, but the Government has refused to permit such timber to be admitted under by-law.

113,Mr White,"Before the suspensionpropose to confine my remarks to that subject, because time is short and other honourable members want to talk on other matters. Yesterday, the Minister for Civil Aviation( Mr Drakeford), presented an illuminating document to the Parliament. It is the report of the Australian National Airlines Commission for 1947-4S, and it is appropriate that we should have it in our hands at this moment. Paragraph 12 of the document reads as follows:Trans-Australia Airlines objective is to proalso prepared to use valuable dollars to vide a service of national importance sustained -buy aircraft for the service, and at by its own earnings That is a little ironic. proceedsThe Commission feels tliat it is well on its way towards the achievement of this purpose. Although Australian National Airlines Commission has had £3,670,000 advanced to it, Trans-Australia Airlines incurred a loss, according to the report to to which I have referred, of £296,801. During die preceding ten months it incurred a loss of £505.927. It is useless to rail against the Government's policy. a Socialist Government and that it is out to nationalize everything. thwarted by the High Court in what it sought to do with regard to civil a viation. If it indulges in socialistic enterprises, it should at least try to ensure that they pay their way. Under private enterprise, which is sometimes sneeringly referred to as capitalism, it is the shareholders in a concern who have to bear the losses, hut if an enterprise run by the Government incurs a loss it has to be made good by the imposition of taxes on the whole of the people. There are hundreds of thousands of people in Australia who do not make use of the services that are provided by Trans-Australia Airlines, but nevertheless that undertaking is financed by money that is taken from the pockets of the people in the form of taxes. The money is squandered in an orgy of socialistic extravagance when it could be used for a better purpose. The Estimates for other departments are how before the committee, and it will not be out of place if I say that restrictions' are imposed upon the importation of many articles into Australia. Jfr. White. Chifley) knows that the deaf people and their associations have been in constant communication with him concerning the provision of efficient deaf aids and articles used in the manufacture of batteries which are on the list of forbidden imports from dollar areas. Because the Government is determined to conduct a nationalized air service, it is not only prepared to lose £700,000 in operating costs during the last two years and advance enormous sums to it, but it is the same time to frustrate private The paragraph companies which also wish to purchase aircraft. By means of questions addressed to the Minister for Air1 extracted the information that approximately 2,500,000 dollars was expended upon the purchase of Convair airliner.' for Trans-Australia Airlines. I do not propose to criticize the Convair aircraft. In these days all aircraft are good, and some are better than others. When an aircraft is said to be designed to carry 40 passengers, I expect to see four engines in it instead of two, but that is a matter of We know that Australia is taste. In addition to buying Convair airliners, the Government has spent, It was approximately 1,000,000 dollars upon the purchase of spare parts and has sent a number of engineers to America in order to learn how to service the aeroplanes. A private business enterprise would have arranged for one or two engineers to come to Australia with the aircraft and to instruci other engineers here. In that prodigal way the Government has played with the money of the taxpayers, and I submit that it has not acted fairly to them. I do not propose to indulge in criticism of the Minister, who resents any criticism of his department, but I do criticize this extravagance and wastefulness. I have no interest in aviation except that I was a pioneer of it and desire to see it prosper in Australia. One's remarks are sometimes twisted by people who wish to misrepresent, but I desire to pay a tribute to the air crews of Trans-Australia Airlines. They are the same kind of men as those who operate the private airlines. They are chosen from the excellent young The Prime Minister( Mr men who were trained under the Empire Air Training Scheme, and by the aero clubs and other organizations. I know many of them personally. I say that the standard of operations in Australia is good, in spite of occasional disasters. This Government, however, in the running of this government enterprise, has resorted to unfair tactics in order to put other operators out of existence. The proposed vote for the Department of Civil Aviation is now £4,568,000, or £719,000 in excess of the department's actual expenditure in 1947-48. This department had II good record in regulating aviation and in helping it in many ways, but it is now being used by the Government as an instrument to harass the private companies. There are some officials who have positions with the National Airlines Commission and also in the regulating department, which sees all the secrets of the private companies. The appointment of the chairman of the commission, Mr Coles, was a political appointment. Mr Coles, the former member for Henty, crossed to the Labour side of the House at a critical time and his services were rewarded by his appointment as chairman of the National Airlines Commission at a salary of £8,500 a year and expenses. The deputy chairman of the commission is also a Labour appointee, representing the Sydney Trades Hall. persons were not concerned with aviation at the time they were appointed to their present positions, although they may have learned a great deal about it by now. [ submit that the Government could have done better than that and prevented the waste of large sums of money. E say deliberately that the Government has been guilty of unfair practices. There are some gems in the report from which I have already quoted that should not be overlooked by honourable members. 1. have already referred to the passage which sets out the objectives of Trans-Australia Airlines and to its losses. Paragraph 19 of the report reads as follows:On the lst November, 1947, T.A.A. made its entry into the Northern Territory when, as successor to Guinea Airways Limited, whose goodwill was purchased, it took over the operation of the thrice-weekly DC3 service from Adelaide to Darwin All the world knows that Trans-Australia Airlines forced Guinea Airways Limited out of existence. Guinea Airways Limited is the company which opened up the New Guinea gold-fields and initiated a service between the north and south coasts of Australia. It has been eliminated by the government airline, which is supported, by all the financial resources of the nation. The company threatened to take some action against the Government. I do not know the details, hut I do know that a sum of money was paid and that Guinea Airways Limited does not now function on this route. The report states that the goodwill of the company was putchased, and I propose to leave it at that, although I point out that that is the way in which a private trust or a monopoly forces the little man out of existence. Do members of the Labour party believe in that policy? They say that they are opposed to monopolies, and so am I . I do not believe in monopolies in private enterprise, but I consider that a government monopoly is worse. Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited is often attacked as being a monopolistic company. It is a large company that has absorbed others, but there are at least seventeen or eighteen other private airways companies operating in Australia to-day. In addition, the Government can exerThose two cise control over private companies through the medium of their charters. I propose to show what the Government is doing in connection with a small airways company that is operating in Queensland. The honourable member for Capricornia ( Mr Davidson) has referred to this case before, and I now propose to give more details about it. There has been criticism in the Queensland press of the fact that, on the service from Townsville to Mount Isa, aircraft operated by Trans-Australia Airlines and Townsville and Oountry Airways Proprietary Limited take off on certain days within five minutes of each other, and that there are no air services between those points for some days afterwards. A correspondent has written to me directing my attention to certain letters that have appeared in the Queensland press. His letter readsI am enclosing for your information two cuttings from the Townsville paper which I think apeak for themselves. In particular, I would say that we entirely agree with the absurdity of these planes Nearly a year ago, when civil aviation going through on the same day, leaving the other days blank of air services. The letter of Mr Montgomery makes it perchamber, I said that I believed that the fectly plain how this has occurred and does Minister had had a conference with the reveal the outrageous tactics adopted by T.A.A. in their attempt to crush this little airline operators on the allocation of organization of returned airmen who competrol with a view to reducing consumpmitted no crime except to use their rehabilition.

On that occasion I said . . when the first warning was issued by tion in service expansions, it was realized stricted to a monthly quota 5 per cent, less at that date; and that contract operators, aero clubs, and similar purposes are to be that some services will be cut altogether, but nearly all will have to be trimmed.

In this particular field was inresponse to earlier appeals, A.N.A. voluntarily Airlines in an introduced cuts in services which yielded an 8 per cent, saving in fuel consumption. Those cuts became operative on June 28-the e days before tiie date set by tlie Government as the basis for a compulsory cut of 5 per cent. As a further conservation move, A.N.A. had run inter-capital freighter services on an unscheduled basis, holding aircraft unti l they were packed with freight, rather than send them oif at a fixed time with a partial load. While dollars remain the yardstick by which development of aviation in the Commonwealth is tn he measured, it is obvious that some peg is necessary, but the pegging must be equitable to all operating companies. According to tbe report of the Australian National Airlines Commission, Trans-Australia Airlines has expanded its services considerably in the last six months; yet that is the period during which the "" stand s t ill "" policy was supposed to operate. I helieve that it was in thatperiod also that Trans-Australia Airlines duplicated the Queensland service to which I have referred. Apparently, although a brake was placed upon private enterprise, Trans-Australia Airlines was permitted to offer full blast competition. I come now to air-mail subsidies. After Trans-Australia Airlines had made the colossal loss of £500,000 in ten months, the method of subsidizing air mails was altered. The subsidy paid to the private companies for the carriage of mails was .025d. per lb. mile, and apparently this was regarded as an adequate remuneration; but when it was found that Trans-Australia Airlines could not pay its way on that basis, it was decided that a payment of approximately £325,000 should be made by tbe Postal Department to Trans-Australia Airlines for the carriage of mails. This information was elicited in answers to questions asked in this chaniber. There is a reference to the matter in the report of the Australian National Airlines Commission. On page 4 of that document the following statement appears:Payment for mail carriage is made in a lump sum fixed annually in the light of the services, frequencies and capacity available. Under tliis arrangement, Trans-Australia Airlines has accepted not only the mails regularly transmitted by air but also special and additional consignments tendered by the Postmaster-General's periods of interruption of normal transport facilities and in other circumstances of special emergency. Apparently Trans-Australia Airlines is sd unsound financially that it cannot continue the practice established hy private [42] enterprise of carrying mails on a poundage basis, and to make its accounts look a little better, the lump sum subsidy system has been reverted to although it is being discarded everywhere. There is much more one could say in connection with the four departments now under discussion, hut the Government is insisting that the votes, totalling more than £10,000,000, shall be approved in a few minutes. The Minister who spoke before me occupied fifty minutes with a rambling speech which could have been -delivered in much less time. I hope that the Minister for Civil Aviation will not speak at length. If Ministers must speak, let them reply tersely and to the point. The Government is pouring out in socialistic ventures money which has been wrung from the taxpayers of this country, and these ventures should all be examined. We realize that that is the Government's policy. It intends to nationalize everything that it can lay its hands On. We know that the Minister for Civil Aviation was a signatory to the infamous 1921 Labour declaration that the party intended to nationalize the means of production, distribution and exchange. That policy was copied from Bussia, and its presence in the Labour party's platform has defamed the Labour movement. I hope that soon it will be excised from Labour's policy, and that the Labour party will, in its objective, come closer to the name by which it is known. Nationalization has been attempted in the aviation industry which is vital to this country's development. The industry has been pioneered by outstanding Australian airmen who have been in no way beholden to the Government for .their success. I remind the Government, too, that had British aircraft of the Viking type been purchased instead of the Convairs now being delivered from America for Trans-Australia Airlines, the saving to this country would have been substantial. Great Britain would have Department during benefited from the purchase, and our dollar shortage would have been eased. The Government was unwisely advised to purchase Convairs and has dissipated the taxpayers' money on this venture. It is not at all surprising that Trans^Australia Airlines is running at a loss. The Government should examine the position again and endeavour to find a better basis so that less public money will be wasted. Minister for Air .and Minister for Civil Aviation) [2.35] -The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) always commences any speech he makes in this chamber by criticizing a Minister. I do not resent constructive criticism from any source, but if the criticism is carping, as was that of the honourable member, I do resent it and obviously must reply to it, probably in the same spirit. When .jriticisms have already .been shown to be on fallacious grounds they must he refuted. The honourable member has said that the Government's policy is to nationalize everything. He ignores entirely what the Prime Minister( Mr tralia Airlines carried all mail to and Chifley) has repeatedly stated in this Parliament, that the programme of the Labour party is to nationalize enterprises essential to the conduct of public utilities. Surely airlines constitute such an enterprise. Honourable members overlook what is happening in many countries of the world. The last time. I addressed the House on this subject. I said that nationalization of airlines was being undertaken in Britain and France, and that Norway, Sweden and Denmark had agreed jointly to operate government airlines. There are many other government airlines operating in other parts of the world, including Trans-Canada Airlines in Canada. That particular airline has been operating for a longer period than Australia's nationalized airline, and with some success. Honourable members opposite have suggested that government airlines are bound to lose and are run in a manner which is not in the best interests of the community while private air-lines invariably make profits. They have failed to inform themselves on how private airlines have been operating since the inception of civil aviation in this country. The honourable member for Balaclava referred to the fact that a mail subsidy of €325,000 was being paid to Trans-Australia Airlines, and appeared to imply that such subsidies were paid to government airlines only. There is a nongovernment airline operating to Australia at the present time which is said to be subsidized by mail payments of more than a dollar a mile for the round, trip at a cost of £6,000 twice weekly while the British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines service to America receives no subsidy other than actual payment on a poundage basis for the mail which it carries. By subsidizing Trans-Australia Airlines for the carriage of mail the Government is placing that airline in a position to carry His Majesty's mails, and 1 believe that that is the proper thing for the Government to do. Trans-Australia Airlines is under contract to carry any mail offered, and during the Queensland rail strike which lasted for a period of nine weeks, it carried all mail to and from that State. Similarly, during a period when the Bass Strait steamship service was not operating, Trans-Ausfrom Tasmania, and not only first-class mail. Its contract provides that it shall do so. To refute the statements by honourable members opposite that government airlines always lose and that private airlines always pay I shall quote the latest figures available for some airlines which operate in the very citadel of private enterprise, the United States of America. operating in Australia? nitely that I believe Trans-Australia Airlines has done a splendid .iob in Australia. It has been operating for only 21 months. For the first nine months of its existence it did. not have a full fleet and had to face heavy establishment costs, as do all airlines in their early days. Notwithstanding those factors it has cut its lasses considerably in the last year compared'with its first nine months of operation. its losses. plenty of railways which the honourable gentleman's party established that have been losing for years. American railways? ways have lost heavily, too. I shall quote figures from an authoritative source, the",33,Tempobab Ychairman Mb T Proposals Is Based Upon The Expec

120,Mr Drakeford,"American railCivil Aeronautics Board of the United States of America, in connection with the operation of United States domestic airlines. These airlines operate within the United States itself, and their operating losses in 1948 compared with 1947 were as follows:-In the year ending the 31st December, 1947, the operating losses for sixteen domestic trunk airlines was 20,900,102 dollars as compared, with a net loss of 5,621,832 dollars for the year ending 31st December, 1946. For the first six months of this year the aggregate loss was 11,866,36S dollars compared with 15,963,301 dollars for the same period last year. Fourteen of these sixteen domestic airlines showed losses in the first six months of this year. with airlines everywhere, it benefited Let the Minister compare like with like. that in the most highly developed private enterprise country in the world privatelyoperated airlines are running at a loss. losing? member for Warringah ( Mr Spender), having a lawyer's mind, will probably twist the figures that I have given, but he will not be able to refute them. I can understand honourable members opposite being disturbed by these figures. Airways Limited? Limited lost about £11,000 on airlines, but recouped itself by its operation of pioneer coaches and hotels, where the tariff is unrestricted. It is not possible for me to say what Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited lost, because that company does not publish any figures, as it is a proprietary company. Honourable members opposite have in the past attempted from time to time to obtain figures relative to the operation of Trans-Australia Airlines. In doing so they are only attempting to gain ammunition to furnish competitors with some ground of criticism against' Trans-Australia Airlines. As Minister for Civil AviationI am thoroughly satisfied with the efforts of Trans-Australia Airlines to operate a good service. There is no better service operating anywhere and I believe even honourable memhers opposite will admit that freely. I shall cite some additional figures in respect of American Airlines, which is probably the biggest domestic airline operator in the United States of America. Between January and June of this year it lost 4,457,287 dollars as against an operating loss of 3,279,822 dollars in the same period last year. line been carrying on at a loss? carrying on at a loss for some years, although during the war, in common from the density of traffic. N'ow that the Government is engaging in competition with the private airlines, it is revealed that fourteen of the sixteen major airlines are losing money year by year. However, I hope that they will not continue to do so. The losses incurred by British Government airlines have also been considerable. However, I want to be quite fair, and I must point out that when Imperial Airways Limited were operating airlines in the United Kingdom, that company incurred heavy losses for the share of the passenger traffic which it carried, and a subsidy had to be paid by the Government. Of course, honourable members opposite do not object to the payment of considerable subsidies to private concerns which incur losses, but when a government-operated concern loses money subsidies are a dreadful thing. The faet that Imperial Airways Limited and British Overseas Airways Corporation lost heavily is undeniable, but the loss is justified because those airlines had to keep the British flag flying over the international air routes. Nevertheless, I hope that before long I shall be able to announce that, the London-Sydney air service is paying its way. But when I am able to make such an announcement no praise will be forthcoming from members of the Opposition because the Government happens to own that service. Eastern Airlines lost 3,749,000 dollars, which was a greater loss proportionately than it incurred during the previous year, hecause whilst the total annual loss decreased from 16,000,000 dollars to",38,Tempobab Ychairman Mb T Proposals Is Based Upon The Expec

128,Mr Drakeford,"It has beenapproximately 12,000,000 dollars, only two. of the large companies which were operating domestic airlines under the aegis of private enterprise made a profit, and the profits earned by those two companies were used to offset the loss of the whole of the United States of America. So much for the argument that private enterprises invariably operate at a profit whilst government concerns must necessarily lose money. Reference was made by the honourable member for Balaclava to the appointment of Mr Coles to the Australian National Airlines Commission -The reference was a most unfair one, and the results of the commission's operations contain ample refutation of the criticism. However, if I did not answer the criticism I would be twitted by the honorahle member for Henty( Mr Gullett), who interjected., with not being able to reply to it. Mr Coles's highly successful commercial career proves that he is a most capable business man, and his appointment to the commission was a wise one. Another member of the board, Mr Taylor, has been criticized on the ground that his appointment was made for political reasons. However, Mr Taylor is a successful practising solicitor and is highly thought of by those who have come in contact with him. Criticism of the appointment of the other members of the board is also unwarranted, because it is obviously desirable that both the Treasury and the Department of Civil Aviation should be represented on the board. A good augury for the future of Trans-Australia Airlines is the increasing number of passengers carried by the airline in the last six months. That increase proves conclusively that there is a growing demand for air travel and that people are realizing the value of the government airline. The honourable member for Balaclava alleged that the Government was crushing a small company in Queensland. The facts are that for a considerable time negotiations were conducted between the Australian National Airlines Commission and the Queensland Government to operate a service in that State. It was never intended that the service should be operated profitably. Intra-state services in Queensland had previously been Mr Drakeford. operated by Qantas Limited, and those services have now been taken over by Trans-Australia Airlines. The act formerly provided that one month's notice had to be given before a new airline could be commenced, and the requisite notice was duly given by the -commission. However, two or three days before Trans-Australia Airlines was about to commence a service to Cloncurry, Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited offered to provide a Douglas aircraft, hecause the small company which was then operating could not do so. The Government has no desire to crush competition or to harm any one engaged in civil aviation. I remind honourable members that many of them have repeatedly approached me with requests that better aerial services be provided for remote parts of the country. It cannot be denied that the Government has always considered such requests sympathetically, and that it has paid to private airlines large sums in subsidies to provide such services. The Government's policy generally.is to promote the development of civil aviation throughout Australia, and in order to do so it is necessary to provide additional facilities, which entail the expenditure of increased amounts of public money. Criticism was directed at the Government recently on the ground that suflicient radar equipment and other navigational aids were not provided hy the Department of Civil Aviation. However, some time ago the -Government formulated a programme to improve facilities and completion of that programme will involve the expenditure of £5,000,000. Completion of the programme will place us in the forefront of international aviation. At present only one country has better safety and navigational devices than Australia, and that country, the United States of America, is, of course, tbe wealthiest in the world. penditure of money to improve flying facilities. borne in mind that most of the increased expenditure provided in the Estimates for the Department of Civil Aviation is for capital expenditure. I did not intend to mention that fact, but since the honourable member for Balaclava raised tiie",39,Tempobab Ychairman Mb T Proposals Is Based Upon The Expec

130,Mr Dbakefobd,"It should bematter I think I should emphasize that. At the end of the recent war the total staff employed in the Department of Civil Aviation was only approximately 700. To-day the number has increased to 2,700. During the war the staff of the department had to be restricted because men were not available. The air force had established navigational aids in various parts of Australia, and those installawhich they directed at the purchase of airtions had to be taken over by the department after the war. Does any honourable member suggest that an increase of the staff of the Department of Civil Aviation for that purpose was not necessary? I am convinced that the staff of that department is doing as good a job as the staff of any similar organization in any other country. One has only to meet people engaged in civil .aviation in other parts of the world to realize that Australia is recognized as a very progressive power in aviation, and as long as I am Minister for Civil AviationI shall endeavour to maintain and to promote ouireputation. The honorahle member for Balaclava was good enough to say that in criticizing the Government's policy he was not criticizing me personally, but he went on to say that I always resent criticism. That is a foolish statement, because I do not resent sound criticism of the department or of the Government's policy in regard to civil aviation. I desire to emphasize that hecause I feel that the remarks of the honourable member might have created in the minds of people who heard them the impression . that the Government is not desirous of obtaining the assistance of those who are qualified to advise and assist us in matters of civil aviation. I propose to say something now with regard to the Convair aircraft which were purchased recently by the Australian National Airlines Commission. For months a campaign of criticism was waged to the effect that the aircraft were not suited to Australian conditions and that tlieir purchase, particularly at the present time, was a waste of money. That criticism has been completely refuted by the performances of the aircraft which has arrived in Australia. The honourable member for Swan( Mr Hamilton) was one of the first to criticize the purchase of Convair aircraft. He accepted an article in Smith's Weekly, which is one of the most unreliable newspapers in this country, as being true, and he based his criticism on it. I know that honourable memhers opposite are disturbed because I have refuted so completely the criticisms which they have been making for so long. They are particularly incensed, of course, at my exposure of the falsity of the criticism craft for Trans-Australia Airlines. Those aircraft were purchased by the Government for the service of the people of Australia. not deny that their purchase entailed the expenditure of a very large sum of dollars ? provided before financial restrictions were imposed in Australia. The contract for the purchase of the aircraft had heen made previously, and, in any event, the present Government does not repudiate its contracts. It might interest honourable members to know that although the Convair aircraft have only two engines, it has been proved again and again that they can fly a full load quite satisfactorily on only one engine. Furthermore, although the critics of the Government alleged that their range was restricted to only 800 miles, it has been demonstrated that the range is as great as 1,300 or 1,400 miles. Indeed, the first hop flown by the Convair aircraft which arrived recently was 1,250 miles. The aircraft was loaded to within 100 lb. of its "" all-up "" weight. Mr ""WHITE -What was the total cost of the purchase of the aircraft? parts and everything thrown in, the five aircraft cost less than £500,000, or approximately £91,000 for each aircraft. A lot of foolish assertions have been made and misleading statistics have been quoted to discredit the performance of the Convair aircraft, but the performance of the first of those aircraft to arrive in Australia has already dispelled much of that criticism. I have no doubt that when the aircraft are taken into operation they will increase the number of passengers carried by Trans-Australia Airlines in a way that will alarm some of the champions of private enterprise.

133,Mr Drakeford,"With sparerevert to the appointments of Mr Coles and Mr Taylor except to say that I am thankful to have the services of such men on the Australian National Airlines Commission. Nothing outrageous was done in connection with the commencement of the Queensland service to which the honourable member for Balaclava referred. It ment with the Queensland Government, which was the only government willing to co-operate with the Australian Government. State governments, not necessarily anti-Labour governments, did not want the Commonwealth to enter the field. We are going on with that contract. We do not expect to make a profit from the service. Indeed, it will have to be subsidized for a while. But had we not commenced to operate it even the small company formerly providing the service-I believe it is called Inland Air Service Proprietary Limited-would the victim of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, just as were each of the eight or nine companies which were swallowed up by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited before this Government decided to commence a government airline. If the honourable member for Balaclava is opposed to monopolies he should be opposed to expansion of that kind by Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited. No one has ever heard me decry the efficiency of Australian National Airways Proprietary Limited, or take advantage of anything that might have happened in its operations. I realize that in air operations anything may happen at any time. People who boast about the safety of this or that airline may find their boasts shattered at a moment's notice. All that we can say is that in Australia generally, air operations have been on a basis that should give the people confidence in air transport. The proportion of air accidentsin Australia is very small indeed, by comparison with air accidents in other countries. I deplore the tendency to give extensive press publicity to air -accidents and to minimize road and railway accidents in which, comparatively, the loss of life over a number of years has been fairly considerable. if r .

Neither have I any desire to do so. The honourable member produced no evidence to sustain his charge. He simply wants it to be thought by the people that the Department of Civil Aviation leans towards Trans-Australia Airlines to the disadvantage of the othei 1 companies. That is completely untrue. The department is being fairly administered and I hope that it will continue to iprobably have been be so administered in the future. So little has been said in this debate regarding the Estimates of the department that I do not think that it is necessary for me to deal further with them. If honourable members will read the third annual report of the Australian National Airlines Commission, they will see that the operations of Trans-Australia Airlines have been fully and fairly covered. Nothing has been hidden, and there is no desire on the part of the commission to hide anything. Eeferring to Guinea Airways Limited the honorahle member stated that I had said that the goodwill of the company had been purchased by the Commonwealth. In its third annua] report, the Australian National Airlines Commission statesOn the lst November, 1947, Trans-Australia Airlines made its entry into the Northern Territory when, as successor to Guinea Airways Limited, whose goodwill was purchased, it took over the operation of the thrice-weekly D.C.3 service from Adelaide to Darwin. It is true that the Government compensated Guinea Airways Limited for its goodwill, notwithstanding that before the service was taken over by Trans-Australia Airlines, Guinea Airways Limited had received a government subsidy to operate the Northern Territory service.

Criticism of that kind is offered solely for the purpose of making political capital out of the alleged intention of the Government to nationalize everything. The Department of Civil Aviation is administered efficiently and its affairs are conducted fairly and with justice to all airline operators. Trans-Australia Airlines has done a splendid job for Australia and I hope that it will continue to do so. I trust that Qantas Empire Airways Limited will, in the near future, be able to break even or perhaps show a little profit. Government airlines, wherever they are operating in Australia, are doing as well as any airline operated hy private enterprise. Furthermore, Government airlines show a great deal more consideration to the public than has everbeen extended by the private operating (jompanies at any time. is obvious that, with the strict limitation of time, and the number of departments grouped together for the purposes of the debate, no continuity of discussion can 1)0 achieved. I wish briefly to bring under the notice of the Government what I regard as a glaring instance of neglect on its part. I refer to the shortage of wire netting in this country and the need for importing wire netting from dollar countries. The importation of wire netting is, [ submit, absolutely necessary as a temporary arrangement in order to bridge the gap between existing requirements and the present output of Australian manufacturers. If this neglect is continued the consequence will be a trail of ruin in this country which may well take generations to repair. The Government seems to be completely oblivious of the position. Landholders have been waiting for years for the fulfilment of orders for only five or six coils of wire, ft is reasonable to expect that many more years will elapse before local producers can hope to meet the demand. In the meantime, irreparable damage is being done to pasture lands all over Australia. It is a well established fact that with all the devices that science can bring to their aid, landholders in hill country, with a reasonable rainfall, are never more than a single step ahead of the rabbit menace. To-day they are fighting a losing battle because of their inability to obtain supplies of wire. Recently the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Duthie), in asking a question on this subject, made the rather novel suggestion that rabbits should be the agents of their own destruction. The honourable member asked the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) whether the proceeds of the sales of rabbit skins in the United States of America could he used for the purchase of wire netting to guard against the rabbit menace in Australia. It was a logical question but because it was logical the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture was stumped for an answer. I have seldom seen the Minister knocked off his perch. He is usually capable of going around, underneath or clean over a question with the greatest facility. In this instance he failed to do any one of those things. The best he could do in a lengthy reply was to say that the high-pressure sales agency, by which term he described the American concern willing to supply wire netting, had failed to mention the price at which it was prepared to sell wire netting to Australia. This high pressure agency, which one can regard only as an enterprising private concern quite legitimately trying to push its wares, immediately remedied the deficiency, and let the Minister, and every member of Parliament, know exactly the price of its goods. Then we get this answer from the Minister, sent by him to a constituent of mine who was anxious to control the rabbit pest on his propertyCertain suggestions have been made that dollars should be provided for the purchase of wire and wire-netting which, it is stated, is available in the United States of America. On subsequent investigation, however, quite apart from the dollar aspect, it has been ascertained that the costs are far in excess of the locally manufactured commodity; for example Xo. 17 gauge 42-in. x l i in. wire netting, landed on wharfs in Australia from America, is priced at £0 per 100-yd. coil. Added to this would be distribution and agents' charges. The local price for the Australian article is approximately £2 12s. per 100 yards for 18-gauge 42 ""in. x 1$ in .",42,Tempobab Ychairman Mb T Proposals Is Based Upon The Expec
136,Mr Bowden (Gippsland) [3.0],"I tThe Minister concluded his letter in this fashionSimilarly, inquiries I have made regarding wire from the Continent show that the price is greatly in excess of locally manufactured goods. Under these circumstances I am sure you will agree that, even if available, the imported article would be uneconomical from the Australian primary producers' point of view. That would he an excellent answer if it were possible to get wire netting in Australia, even within a reasonable of years. that the assets of landholders are usually in the form of property, and not money in the bank. think would be most acceptable to a landholder troubled with rabbits-to .'JlOOin the bank while his property Was deteriorating, purchase of a mile of wire netting which to protect the asset which he had been acquiring There can be only one answer to that question. quest of the honourable member for Wilmot and urge that consideration given that rabbit skins should be used to subsidize the purchase of wire netting in the United States of America. that farmers would prefer to pay £108 a mile for American netting, so that they may protect their properties now, to waiting an indefinite time to buy netting for £46 a mile. menace is allowed to develop at the present rate it will leave a trail of ruin for future governments I propose to quote from some of the highpressure American firm has distributed honourable members. for its interest in Australian and for its business acumen. has been at some pains to find out Australia's requirements in wire netting, and has collected data showing the destruction resulting from neglect on the part of whoever is responsible. analysis, that must be the Government, wire netting from overseas is bound up with the dollar position. Mr Bowden. extract from the company's printed matter is informative:It is reported that the maintenance of more than 500 miles of the 2,049 miles of rabbit fencing erected over 30 years ago, in the north-west pastoral country of Western Australia, at an outlay of over £300,000, to block rabbits travelling from the eastern States, will shortly be abandoned mainly owing to the lack of netting material. It is also reported from the same source, that some of the most settled parts of Western Australia are already overrun with the pest, as they have by-passed the fence in millions. Does that mean anything to the Governnumber ment? The following letter was received However, it is well known from a grazier in New South Wales, which is much nearer homeOur property, which is only 105 miles from ""What does the Minister Sydney, has a present carrying capacity of only 1,500 sheep, as compared with 6,000 have sheep before the property was overrun with rabbits.

138,Australian Mr Bowden,"I am speaking of thehave stated ought to shake the Government out of its complacence. I cannot understand how the Government is able to ignore such representations. Instead of doing anything effective, Ministers point to their budget of over £500,000,000, scratch one another's backs, and then agree to limit the time allotted for consideration of the Estimates. It has even been arranged that Ministers should use most of the broadcasting time so that the people may not hear memhers of the Opposition criticizing the Estimates. Let me quote the following verse from the gospel of St. Matthew:For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soulf I might ask, what is the nation profited if, for the sake of saving a few miserable dollars, we lose a large percentage of the productive capacity of our land? That is a reasonable paraphrase of the question in St. Matthew. Honourable members will be interested to learn about the nature of some of the goods which Australia has imported from the United States of America in recent years. In the period 1945-47, we had a trade deficit of 142,569,000 dollars with the United States of America. Even under normal conditions, we would not regard that deficit with any pleasure. Australia is a land of plenty, and probably has a greater abundance of food than any other country, but we imported foodstuffs of animal origin at a cost of 4,000,000 dollars and foodstuffs of vegetable origin at a cost of 2,751,000 dollars. Did we need to import foodstuffs of animal and vegetable origin? .Are we not exporting goods of that kind in great abundance? We also imported spirituous and alcoholic liquors at a cost of 34,000 dollars, and I notice that items described as "" miscellaneous "" cost 43,430,000 dollars. However, in that period, we did not import one coil of netting. I should like to know what goods are included in the description of ""miscellaneous"", and I suggest that the Government should prohibit the importation of foodstuffs of animal and vegetable origin and spirituous and alcoholic liquors, and expend the dollars so saved on wire netting for the purpose of assisting our graziers. Honourable members opposite should throughout the wheat and grazing areas. never forget that our graziers are responFrom the picture which he painted, onesible, and will continue to he responsible, for the maintenance of our high social services structure. If primary industry were to collapse through any cause at all, such as a decline of prices overseas or a fall in production, the Governments house of cards would collapse overnight. Honourable members know that perfectly well. . The social services fabric, costing £90,000,000 per annum, which exceeds, the total Commonwealth budget in pre-war years, has been made possible by unprecedentedly high revenues, hut that rate of expenditure could not be maintained if the price of wheat fell to 3s. a bushel and the price of butter to ls. 6d. per lb. The primary industries on which the Government must depend for the maintenance of high revenues, are being shamefully neglected. Because honorahle members opposite can see a strip of green grass outside the main door of Parliament House, they believe that everything in the garden is lovely. They do not seem to know or care what is happening in the extensive grazing areas. I urge the Government to look intotbis problem again. It is always looking into this or that problem hut never achieves any result. Ministers do not wear the right coloured spectacles. Is not a dollar loan preferable to the ruin which will follow the continuance of the neglect which I have described? Honourable members opposite have heard the statistical report. They must realize that imports such as those to which I referred are superfluous. But we do require wire and wire netting to assist our graziers to maintain the national revenue at its present high level. The suggestion that the money obtained from the sale of rabbit skins in the United States of America should be used for the purchase of wire netting in America to help to combat the rabbit menace in this country is worthy of examination. I hope that the Government will not ignore it.

The same remarks apply to supplies of wire from Britain.

Honourable members opposite should ascertain the facts before making such statements in this chamber. I matters affecting my own department that were mentioned by the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Turnbull). I did not propose to deal in detail with them, because they are of a very minor nature, but the Acting Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) said that I was encouraging the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture ( Mr Pollard) to continue with his fine speech on the wheat industry, because I feared that my department would be criticized. I am not afraid of any criticism that may be made of my department or of its actions during the last two years. If the honourable member for the Northern Territory ( Mr Blain), who is interjecting wishes to participate in this debate, he is quite welcome to do so. I am prepared to answer any charge against my department that may be made by the honourable gentleman or any other member of the Opposition. The honourable member for Wimmera said that there had been an increase of £252,000 in the administrative costs of the Department of Works and Housing. That is true. The honourable member went on to ask what the department did. I point out that on many occasions he, in common with other honourable members, has written letters to me in which he has asked for certain work to be done. Such requests have have referred to the construction of aerodromes and post offices, and to other maintenance and construction work that is undertaken by the Department of Works and Housing. What is the reason for the increase in the departmental administrative costs to which the honourable member for Wimmera referred? The largest part of the increase is due to the expansion of the staff of the department to deal with constructional work on the guided weapons range. Does the honorcould he undertaken by the normal staff of my department? An extra sum of money is required to pay the technical officers who are engaged in the work on this project that the Department of Works and Housing is undertaking for another department.

It is due to the increased .rates of pay that were granted to all .public servants, and the honourable memoer for Barker( Mr Archie Oameron) knows as much about it as I do. Another reason for the increase is that ; the War Service Homes Commission has heen abolished and its work is being ^undertaken by a section of the Department of Works and Housing. The salaries of certain architects, surveyors, and other officers are now charged against my department. Another factor is the necessity to engage additional staff to carry out the increased maintenance and constructional work that is required to be done by the department. The total value of the work that was done by the Department of Works and Housing last year was approximately £9,000,000, but it is anticipated that in the next twelve months that sum will be exceeded because of the availability of larger supplies of materials and the greater amount of labour that has been made availahle by the action of the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) in bringing Bait migrants to this country. A considerable amount of unskilled labour is being made available to my department and it is expected that much more engineering work which requires such labour will be undertaken.

I shall quote from a newspaper report of a statement about the standard of building in Australia which was made by Mr A. S. P.

Tbat is what the general works manager of one of the largest business firms in Australia which manufactures building components states regarding the type of house being built in Australia, and the rate of construction.

I do not know Mr Sangster or what he is, but I wish to refer to the Commonwealth-State housing agreement and its absolute failure to make available the number and quality of houses that Australia desires. 1 should like to deal with this point at some length, although I realize that I am not likely to be given an opportunity by the Government to do so. I shall give honourable members some statistical information which will prove the point [ wish to make. Honourable members will recall that the 1947 census revealed that the lag in home construction nieant that 1.16,82S families were sharing singlefamily homes. There were 271 instances in which five or more families were sharing a single home; S18 instances in which four families were sharing a single home; 4,446 instances where three families were sharing a single home; and 25,000 instances in whicli two families were sharing a single home. Yet in the light of these damaging statistics the Minister claims that the -Commonwealth State housing agreement has heen successful. He knows full well that circumstances such as I have mentioned, of families being crammed into homes with resulting domestic conflict and of young people sharing homes with their inlaws, are breeding destruction and discontent in the family life of Australia. They are destroying the very hasis of family life in Australia and the Minister is directly responsible. The housing scheme sponsored by the Government is a complete failure. ' Since the commencement -of the scheme until September, 1947, the States have completed only 10,400 of the 19,000 homes that were commenced under the scheme. Let us contrast that with what has happened under the private enterprise that this Government has always decried. Whenever an honorahle member on this side of the chamber speaks of the need for private enterprise to take control of the facilities that are essential for development, Governinent against the suggestion. In the period that the government scheme has been operating, private builders have completed 4S,:i.S5 homes out of 68,661 commenced compared with the 10,400 He completed out of the 19,000 commenced under the government scheme. This means that private builders completed 70 per cent, of the homes which they commenced, compared with 55 per cent, completed under the Commonwealth State. housing scheme. Eor the first two post-war years the houses completed were not even suflicient to provide for the average annual, requirements of 50,000 dwellings laid down by the Commouwealth Housing Commission in 1944, let alone suflicient to overtake any of the back lag created by the demands of young people reaching adult age and desiring to marry and accept family responsibilities or those of new settlers who came to Australia under immigration schemes. The Government has fallen clown on its job. In 1947-48 the total number of houses completed in Australia was 42,867. Even that figure is below the target set by the commission in 1944 as the first post-war year's objective. In New Soutli Wales 14,858 homes were completed in the year ended the 30th June last. Of these, government-sponsored houses numbered 4,093 compared with 10,765 erected by private enterprise. We are constrained to ask what is the chief reason for this failure of the Government to bring forward a scheme of a comprehensive nature to meet the housing requirements of the people. Why has the Government failed to bring harmony and happiness into the home life of the country and why has it refused to give consideration to the unfortunate plight of people who, for too long, have been without homes? Why has it failed the ex-servicemen who, when they were going overseas, were told that they were to fight for the preservation of the ordinary amenities of civilization? What has this Government done to honour these obligations to the people and to our ex-servicemen? One of the chief reasons why the Commonwealth-State housing scheme has been a failure is because the Government",49,Tempobab Ychairman Mb T Proposals Is Based Upon The Expec
183,Mr Harrison (Wentworth,"Actinghas unions to dictate to it how many ex-servicemen may be trained in the building indnstry under the rehabilitation scheme. That in itself is a sad enough story. ""What a shocking state of affairs that men who went overseas to fight for the preservation of democracy and the democratic way of life should be denied training in a vital industry which would enable them to provide for themselves and their fellow Australians one of the principal amenities of life. The Government has allowed the unions to dictate to it in this matter and the results have been appalling. Original plans provided for the training of 32,850 ex-servicemen in the building industry in the two years commencing in May, 1946. [n New Soutli ""Wales the quota was established at 13,850 men; but up till August last, only 7,100 men had been trained.

""Why, otherwise, are these men refused the right to be trained in those industries? refused an opportunity to train in those industries. turned away. I ask the Minister why the target of 32,850 men was not reached ? of reasons. reason is because the Building ""Workers Industrial Union, a Communist-controlled allowed Communist-controlled organization, will have none of the scheme. Let me analyse still further what the Minister has said with regard to the building programme. Mr Sangster, who is associated with the tiling industry, made a statement on the subject, and the Minister, in endeavouring to justify the deficiencies of the Government's home building scheme, quoted what Mr Sangster had said. Let us consider the output of home requirements by industries allied with the building industry in order to assess the opportunities available to the Government for carrying out the home-building programme. If there be a shortage of raw materials, such as bricks, tiles and other materials for home building, the best scheme in the world cannot be brought to fruition. ber is answering his own question why the target for the training of ex-servicemen in the building trades could not be reached. Minister now contends that ex-servicemen were not trained in the building industry in accordance with the target figures, because basic building materials were not being produced in the requisite quantities. The two essentials of a homeThese men could not be building programme are basic material* and building labour. On its own admission, the Government has fallen down on the job of providing the requisite building labour. Excluding working proprietors, the percentage increase, in the number of employees working in Australian factories since 1938-39 is 57.4 for males and 35.6 for females, or a total average increase of 51.6 per cent. These figures cover all employees engaged in factories throughout Australia in the production of all commodities. Instead of the production of bricks being increased in such a way as to enable the home-building problem to be attacked in an effective manner, we find that, compared with pre-war years, brick production has decreased by 17 per cent. Notwithstanding the increase of 57.4 per cent, in the employment of male factory workers, the production of ordinary terra cotta tiles used for the roofing of homes has increased hy only 6 per cent.

191,As An Indication Of The Mr Harrison,"B y inference theapproach to this problem and to reconsider it with a view to producing greater quantities of the basic materials needed for home building so that the people in what we call this democratic country may enjoy decent housing conditions. Let U3 consider the position in relation to the production of fuel, gas and electric stoves, all of which are essential equipment for modern homes. Surely the Minister does not expect people living under overcrowded conditions, such as five families living in one home to do their cooking in the back yard over an aboriginal's twig fire. Yet that is what vve are coming to in this country. As the result of strikes and industrial disturbances the production of fuel stoves has increased hy only 5.4 per cent. In the production of gas stoves there has been a colossal increase of 1.4 per cent. In electric stoves production was higher. In spite of these revealing figures tbe Minister talks about a comprehensive bome-building scheme. ties of electric stoves manufactured in pre-war years? dent of the Executive Council is well aware that, after a householder puts in a requisition for an electric 'stove he has to wait twelve months or more before the order is filled. Representations were recently made to me by a farmer who had been unable to secure a fuel stove. He told me that he hacl been waiting for nine months for a stove. What a shocking state of affairs ! Let us consider other basic materials required for home buildings. Since 198S-39 the production of pig iron, blooms and billets has been increased by only 14.6 per cent, and 12.3 per cent, respectively. Yet the Minister talks about a comprehensive home-building scheme! If the Government really desires to embark upon a practical home-building scheme it should take positive action. First, let it appoint a first-class business executive to scheme requires much more than such airy control the housing scheme, as was done during the war in connection with the production of munitions. Let him he free from parliamentary or governmental interference. Munitions, who. had the right, of access to, the Prime Ministerand could write his own ticket, carried out his task very efficiently. Surely homes are as essential to-day as were munitions during the war. Indeed, nothing touches the well-being of the E eople of Australia more closely than the ousing problem. It is the most human problem that any government has ever had to tackle. If afirst-classbusiness man were appointed to control a practical home-building plan he could break the bottle necks and expedite the supply of materials and the construction of homes. That task cannot be tackled satisfactorily by a junior Minister who has no concept of the problem that confronts him. Secondly, let the Government remove the sales tax from all building materials, including builders' hardware. Thirdly, let it evolve a comprehensive scheme of financial assistance to encourage home ownership. Let it abandon the attitude taken by the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) that if a man leaves the ranks of the rent-payers to become a homeowner he becomes a little capitalist. The greatest security is given not by the home-renter but to the home-owner. The Minister for Postwar Reconstruction's reference to home owners as little capitalists is merely a further instance of how the socialization bug has. penetrated into the ranks of the Government. Fourthly, let the Government increase the output of materials by expanding coal production and by giving a greater incentive to the workers to produce more by providing incentive payments and reducing taxes. Fifthly, let the Government tackle seriously the problem of training, young men in the building trades, particularly ex-servicement, so that larger numbers of young men may be attracted to the industry! Lastly, let the Government adopt a comprehensivescheme for the abolition of slums and providefinancefor home purchase on reasonable terms and conditions. A comprehensive housing persiflage as was indulged in by the Minister for Works and Housing when he told us about the Commonwealth State housing scheme.

Recently, af ter many Lnngtry, J. 1. representations had been made by the honLawson, George orable member for Capricornia ( Mr. Lemmon. If. Davidson) and myself,, the coastal vessel O'Connor, W. P.

194,Mr Bernard Corser (Wide Bay),"up because of labour trouble, besides sixteen British ships which are waiting to load wheat that has not yet arrived at the seabord because the Communist-dominated miners will not hew coal needed by the Bailways Department. Babinda is still in port because the Union demands that an assistant cook be employed on the vessel. The award provides that a cook shall be employed for a crew of twenty, and the crew of Babinda numbers only nineteen, including the cook. However, the shipping agents decided to obey the masters, that is, the Communists, who are also the masters of the Government. They decided that it was better to let the ship sail, and thereThe BrokenH i ll Proprietary Company fore informed the general secretary of the Seamen's Union that they were prepared to employ an assistant cook. However, no union member is prepared to offer for tbe position, and so the ship is still in port. The coke needed by the foundry in Maryborough has not been loaded, and other much-needed cargo remains on the wharfs. The other vessel, Baralaba. is held up in Brisbane with 569 tons of cargo for Maryborough, and 291 tons for Bundaberg, because the Communist controlled Seamen's Union demands the replacement of a cook, who has been on the ship for fourteen months without previous complaint having been made of him. The shipping company has no reason to dismiss him. This is a very 3erious thing for the people of Maryborough and Bundaberg, and the shipping company has just about had enough. In a letter which I received to-day, the Sydney agents point out that the unfavorable voyage results, due to the loss of time and slow working, do not encourage the owners to keep the vessel on the run. Although they are anxious to keep' the ships in the trade, they fear that, unless they have the cooperation of the employees, both ashore and on board, in an endeavour to keep their ships sailing regularly, they will have to consider whether it is worth their while remaining in the river trade. This trade is important to all sections of the community in Maryborough and Bundaberg, and not least important to the workers, whether they be employees of the foundry, tradesmen, businessmen, or Jfr. Bernard Corner. housewives in the homes. The workers are beginning to realize that the Australian Government has failed to govern. The economy of Australia, is being attacked by the agency of a foreign power. Has the Government decided to yield altogether to the pressure of the Communist-controlled Seamen's Communists? Does the Government regard us as a conquered people ? It would appear so. Goods are rapidly accumulating in many Australian ports, and the Communist-controlled unions are determined that they shall not be shipped. Wire and wire netting and iron and steel goods are being held up in this way, and this is seriously inconveniencing the manufacturers and primary producers. Limited is now receiving the same quantity of raw materials as it received twenty years ago. During the war, the manufacture of galvanized iron and wire and wire netting practically ceased for civilian purposes and the output of many iron and steel products was greatly reduced, with the result, that the demand for those goods to-day is greater than it has ever been in our history. Because of Communist-directed strikes the goods are not reaching consumers, and our development is being hampered. We have been importing iron products from the United Kingdom, including 1,000 railway trucks for New South Wales, because Australian workers, who earn higher wages and enjoy better conditions of employment than worker? in the United Kingdom, adopt go-slow tactics and are not permitted to reach maximum output figures. Although the supplies of raw materials which the BrokenH ill Proprietary Company Limited is receiving are restricted, that organization is rendering a great service to Australia. Veritable mountains of manufactured goods are awaiting shipment, but the vessels cannot sail. Iron rods, fabricated iron materials, bridges and parts of bridges, machinery, parts of tractors, galvanized iron, wire and wire netting and fencing poste are accumulating, and the ships can not take them to the users. Although vessels are lying in Sydney. Melbourne and Brisbane, the Government, will not take any action to break the Communist's stranglehold on the shipping industry. When I have referred to this difficulty at question time, the Minister has stated, in reply, that the Opposition urged the people, at a referendum, not to grant to the Commonwealth Parliament authority ro enable the Government to deal with these matters. It is just as well that the Opposition did adopt Although the Government has power to rleal with the Communists, it refuses to aut. Why} then, should the people entrust the Government with additional powers? The request which I mate to the Minister to-day is that he exercise his authority r,o direct these ships to sail. I have referred to two specific vessels, Baralaba unci Babinda. An industrial dispute has not occurred over rates of pay or conditions of employment, but, the ships simply are not to sail. I urge the Minister to take action to ensure that the Communists shall not control the whole of industry and create unemployment, as is their intention. They have inflicted hardships on the community and inconvenience on manufacturers and primary producers and have caused people innorthern Queensland to suffer privation. When asked what he proposes to do to remedy the position, the responsible Minister merely replies to the effect that the Opposition urged the people not to grant to the Commonwealth Parliament additional power to deal with such matters. Of course, he controls rhe Commonwealth-owned ships, but still the mountains of materials in the southern ports are growing. Wliat is the reason? The Communists are particularly interested in our great iron and steel industry. Honourable members will be alarmed to know how long it takes to unload and load ships. I r o n Master arrived in port with 2,871 tons of steel products and remained there for twelve days. Ellaroo had 5,569 tons of steel products, and remained in port for 24 days. I r o n Warrior arrived with 5,39S tons of pig iron and was eighteen days discharging it . Biver Fitzroy had 6,047 tons of steel products on board and was nineteen days unloading. River Murrumbidgee was eighteen charging 4,495 tons of cargo. The slow turn-round of ships the flow of raw materials to the BrokenH ill Limited and to the iron and steel industry generally in Australia. We must realize that Australia is menaced by Communists. My special object in speaking this afternoon is to urge the Minister to ensure that the unlawful hold-ups of Baralaba and Babinda shall not be that policy. tolerated any longer. The controllers of the ships have done everything in their power to overcome the deadlock, and it now behoves the Minister to break the Communists' control. I leave that responsibility with him.

213,Mr Dedman,"Naturally , it takesport for a longer time to-day than they were before the war. When we take into account the fact that vessels are larger than they were before the war, and that the equipment available in the ports is not of a modern kind to enable cargoes to be handled quickly, we must admit that the waterside workers throughout Australia are not doing a bad job. It is true, of course, that here and there, individual troubles do arise. Insofar as these troubles arise hecause of the tactics will, therefore, be seen that the Minisof the Communist party, I condemn them. However, because I condemn the activities of the Communist party in relation to the waterside workers and the trade union movement generally, that does not mean that I agree with the honourable member for Wide Bay. When the honourable gentleman was supporting an anti-Labour government, he took no 3teps to see that the waterside workers and other workers were dealt with fairly. He was not concerned at all with the welfare of the workers. We are now living in conditions of full employment, and it is only natural that tbe workers should use their strength to secure what was denied to them in the past. They sometimes resort tc tactics that do not meet with my approval, but one can understand that, because they nre in a stronger position to-day than they ever have been and they are tempted, to some degree, to overemphasize what they consider to be their rights. As to the disputes on the two vessels, to which I have now specifically referred, one has already been settled and it is hoped that the other will be settled to-morrow. I am sure that in connection with these and other disputes that may arise, the Minister for Shipping and Fuel (Senator Ashley) will do his utmost to ensure that shipping facilities are made available as soon as possible and that the industry runs as smoothly as it can do. excuses that were made by the Minister for Dedman), in reply to the honourable member for Wide Bay( Mr Bernard Corser) do not hold water. I have not the time to deal with all the statements that were made by the honourable gentleman, but I wish to comment upon his remark that the delay in loading and unloading ships to-day is due to the fact that the shipowners and wharf-owners have failed to install modern machinery. It is true that the old machinery is still installed on the wharfs, hut the fact remains that in 1939 the wharf labourers, using that machinery, loaded cargo at the rate of approximately 25 tons an hour, working' in gangs of twenty men, whereas to-day, using the same machinery, but working in larger gangs, they are loading cargo at the rate of only 15 tons an hour. It ter's excuse is not worth much. My main purpose in rising was to refer to the activities of the Department of Immigration. My first point refers to the scheme for bringing migrants to Australia from abroad. It is fair to say, and I think most honourable memhers on this side of the chamber will agree with me, that the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell) is doing all that he can do to bring migrants here. The honorahle gentleman realizes, as we all do, the importance of considerably increasing our population in the years that lie immediately ahead of us hecause of the present world unrest and our defence problems. In my opinion, he is doing with great enthusiasm all that he can do. The point I want to make is that the results that are heing obtained are not commensurate with our requirements. We are told that at some date in the future, though not this year, migrants will arrive at the rate of 70,000 a year and that the figure will probably be increased to 100,000 a year. be brought to Australia this year. ended. months of it left. It is possible even for the Minister to learn from the experience of the past. If we look back at the results of past immigration schemes, we cannot look forward to the future with Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr any degree of optimism. Between 1921 and 1925 an average of 36,500 migrants a year arrived in this country. Between 1926 and 1930 the average yearly rate dropped to 26,000. It is noticeable that, as the unrest abroad after World WarI . grew less and conditions became more normal, the number of people who wanted to migrate to Australia diminished.

Migrants are dropped. leaving more behind them now than migrants did previously, and as a which the present Immigration Act is result the newcomers in these days being administered by the Government expect to find more here than their and the Minister for Immigration. That predecessors did when they arrived in seems to me to be very important from Australia. They are not prepared to go tht point of view of increasing our into the bush and build log houses in population and also from the point of which to live. If possible, they want to view of our relations with the outside be provided with houses and the normal world. The Minister's actions are largely amenities of modern civilized life.

There were also the Government's actions in relation to the deportation of Malays and of an unfortunate negro boxer who had been ten years in Australia.

We are living in an era which is' 50 years ahead of that in which honorahle members opposite seem to be living. Our environment is changing and we must adapt ourselves to new circumstances. One can be a firm believer in the White Australia policy without believing that if is necessary to keep every single coloured foreigner out of Australia. which an Asiatic could gain entry to Australia was fo marry an Australian citizen, surely there could he no danger to our standards of either racial purity or of living. The Minister has told the world that hisactions are designed to protect, those two> standards, but no sensible man,, particularly in any of the couattxies in which his policy is arousing resentment, could possibly believe that the residence in this country of 10' or 50 foreign coloured wives could affect either of those standards: I turn now to> another action to which many people, including honourable members on this side of the chamber, object very strongly. I referto the action taken by the Minister in regard to the persons now generally termed the "" Manila girls "". I shall not go into the details of that particular matter, because the Minister knows fhem only too well. The Minister' has stated that the Government intends to have these girl's returned fo Australia, not because fhey have transgressed or broken any promises, but because the American authorities with whom they are serving have not done what they said they would do. The Minister, because he is unable to act against the American authorities, is wreaking his vengeance on these unfortunate women. laugh.. insf an'ce, brat is surely a matter of prinup by the Netherlands^ Malaya or Chinaciple-.

I wish to make one further suggestion. As mentioned earlier in the debate by the honourable member for New England( Mr Abbott), the Government has subscribed towhat might be termed the bill of human rights, drawn up by the United Nations. In doing so it has agreed' in commonwith tbe other nations concerned , 1 to allow freeingress and egress of citizensbetween this and other countries and has agreed to observe and promote family life. By its> recent actions the Government has very grievously transgressed against both undertakings.

The Minister mentioned the quota system. The Government has decided to lay down a rigid bar against any coloured person entering Australia to become a resident. As that bar stands at present it is offensive to all the nations affected by it.

I hope the Government will .give serious consideration to my suggestion because I believe such a policy would mean .a great deal to Australia in its relations with the Asiatic peoples who are OUT near neighbours. I am convinced that at present Australia is on the wrong track. did not intend to enter the debate, but some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Flinders( Mr Eyan) have induced me to participate in it . The honourable member is usually considered to be -a good sort of a fellow who can always be relied upon to take part in 'debates and to resume his seat without having said anything of any moment. His performance to-day was no exception to the general rule. I know that in the opinion of a majority of the Australian people the Minister for Immigration ( Mr! Calwell) is doing a very good job indeed. Such The honorable member for Flinders spoke about the White Australia policy. He rambled on and said something about Japanese wives. If the Minister for Immigration does nothing other than preserve the White Australia policy he most certainly -will justify his administration as far as I am concerned. The Minister has no need to apologize to anybody for preserving the White Australia policy. I know there are many members on the Opposition benches and many people in business whom those honorahle members represent, who would he glad to see Australia return to the old Kanaka days. It is of no use for the Opposition to say that that is not true.

Even though industries were removed from Britain to Australia, Britain would still require the man-power employed in those industries r.o make up other shortages. There is also the shipping ohstacle.

Every honourable member who is honest with himself will admit that the Minister for Immigration has done"" everything possible to expedite the transport to Ausconditions for which their fathers and tralia of people from other countries who wish to settle here. It is remarkable that an honourable member opposite should criticize the Minister when he knows very well that a previous government formed by his own party did nothing about the migration problem.

It is true that the miners' federation recently objected to the employment of some Poles in the coal mines. Any one who knows anything of the industrial history of the Poles would know that there is reason tb be careful about the employment of Polish labour in any Australian industry. J. do not suggest that the coal-miners or any other groups of workers should ban the employment of Polish labour in their industry; but I do not blame them for expressing some concern ahout the employment of Polish labour, especially when they know the circumstances associated with Polish lahour as well as I do. All that the coal-miners did was to take steps to ensure that the working forefathers had fought over the years would not be destroyed by the introduction of some additional labour to the industry, whether it be migrant lahour or otherwise. This is the only instance of which I know of any industrial union in this country taking exception to the employment of migrant labour. overlooked that instance.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Watkins) -The honourable member for Herbert is discussing the subject .of migration and is referring to the employment of migrants in this country. He is in order in so doing. provoked by the criticism of trade unions by the honourable member for Flinders for taking exception to the employment of certain migrant labour in Australian industries. I have replied to the honourable member by saying that there have been only two instances in which such exception has been taken. ones. > attempt to prevent a hold-up in industry, the secretary of the Federated IronWorkers Association came to Canberra and discussed with the Minister for Immigration a matter bearing upon a possible industrial dispute, both he and the Minister are maligned hy members of the Opposition. Consider the other industries in which migrant labour is employed ? Consider, for instance, the sugar industry. From my standpoint the sugar industry comes very close to home. I believe that this year the Minister for Immigration saved the Queensland sugar industry, if not from destruction, at least from a considerable disaster. Because of the shortage of labour, the industry was faced with the position of having to leave hundreds of thousands of tons of this year's crop either to rot or to stand over for an indefinite period. The Minister thereupon decided to provide Baits to work in the sugar industry and, as the result of his efforts, although the sugar crop in Queensland is probably bigger this year than it has ever been at any time in the history of the State, it is being harvested and no hold-up of any kind is occurring. The Baits in the Ingham, Herbert Biver, Innisfail and far northern districts of Queensland are doing a very good job. Every one engaged iji the industry with whom I have discussed this matter has spoken in the highest possible terms of the assistance given to the industry by the Minister and his departmental officers in providing this additional migrant labour. If in his capacity as Minister for Immigration the honourable gentleman does nothing more than to bring in labour to assist important Australian primary industries, such as the sugar industry, he will have admirably fulfilled his ministerial duties. Honourable members opposite are continually blaring about industrial disputes, and complaining about what some industrial unionists or leaders of industrial organizations have done. Utterances such as those of the honourable member for Elinders do more to provoke industrial disputes than anything trade union officials or members of trade unions can ever do. leaders are concerned about preserving industrial conditions in the industries with which they are associated, as they are perfectly entitled to do. If there were a threat of industrial trouble on the coal fields or in the heavy industries as the result of the attitude adopted by Mr Thornton there might be some justification for the remarks of the honourable member for Flinders; but no threat exists. In his extraordinarily able way the Minister for Immigration is handling this matter in a manner which will prevent an industrial dispute from taking place. If by his provocative remarks, the honourable member for Flinders wishes to precipitate an industrial dispute, he must take full responsibility for his action. By misconstruing the happenings in trade union circles the honourable member merely provokes unionists and he must accept responsibility for his actions. Instead of being maligned by honourable members opposite and by certain people outside this chamber, the Minister for Immigration should be congratulated and lauded for the excellent work he is doing.

264,Mr Edmonds,"Trade unionin a favourite pastime of honourable members opposite of making certain statements, pretending that they came from the mouths of honourable members on this side of the chamber, and then proceeding to attack them vigorously. The honourable member for Flinders( Mr Ryan) began his speech by paying a tribute to the Minister for Immigration ( MrI propose now to say a few words about Calwell). He said that for the most part honourable members on this side of the chamber applauded the policy adopted hy the Minister, and immediately the honourable member for Herbert made a vitriolic attack upon him. admitted that in two instances representations had been made by trade union leaders regarding the employment of migrants in certain industries. As we are discussing the Estimates of the departments concerned all these matters are fair subjects for criticism. No one can accuse the honourable member for Flinders of making unfair statements. I am horrified, however, that the honourable member for Herbert should have taken this occasion to make such an unwarranted attack upon the honourable member for Flinders. Another thing that annoyed me-and it has many times annoyed me in this statement that honourable members on this side of the chamber favour a return to the Kanaka days. I have said many times on public platforms all over Australia, and I repeat again here to-day, that in uiy view the general line of demarcation between the two main political schools of thought in this country is in their approach to the problem of securing a decent deal for all our people. I hope that I am not giving the Australian Labour party any more credit for its intention than it deserves. that it. is the. general notion of all Auspension. Therefore, members bf the tralians that there should be a fair deal to all. In order to achieve their objectives about present pension rates. Those whohonorable members opposite believe in concentration on government ownership; we believe in the dispersal of ownership throughout the community. the real difference between the policies of the two principal parties represented in this chamber, and bitter debates from time to time are generally the result of the imaginings and unfair accusations of strongly 'partisan speakers. For my Dame Enid part I bitterly resent the attack made by the honourable member for Herbert on honourable members on this side of the chamber on his allegation that we stand for a return to the Kanaka days and the impoverishment of the general standards of the people of Australia. social services; but because a bill will soon be introduced for the purpose among other things of consolidating all the legislation dealing with social services, I shall not deal fully with the subject. There He subsequently are, however, one or two matters which I believe should be discussed at this stage and there are one or two amendments which the Government might in justice incorporate in the consolidated legislation to be brought before us. Members of the Government are disposed to congratulate themselves unduly upon the"" increases which have been granted to age and invalid pensioners. As a matter of fact, the present rate of pension bears about the same relation to the basic wage as the rate in 1920 bore to the basic wage of that time. In 1920, the old-age pension was 15s. a week and the Harvester award, providing a basic wage of Parliament-was the £2 2s. a week, was still in operation. Thus, the basic wage was two and four-fifths times as much as the old-age pension. The new age pension is to be 42s. 6d. a week, and the average basic wage for Australia is £5 15s. a week. Dame ENID LYONS -According to the figures supplied to me, the average basic wage over the six States is £5 16s. a week, which is a little less than two and I believe four-fifths times as much as the ageGovernment need not be too complacent have to live on the age pension, without any other income, and without possessing any property, have, as honourable membersThere lies know, a yery difficult time, indeed. I have here a newspaper extract which refers to the way in which an old man of 80manages to support himself on a pension of 37s: 6d. a week. I quoteas follows:Lyons. He doesn'tr drink.

To the best of his ability he works out his weekly budget like this The TEMPOEAEY CHAIBM AN ( Mr Watkins) -The honourable meniber must confine her remarks to the administration of the department. She is not in order in discussing the department generally. Dame ENIDLYONS I submit that everything I have been saying has to do with the administration of the Department of Social Services. I can see no difference between the kind of argument that I have been adducing and the kind of argument that has been permitted in the case of other honourable members during this debate. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN The honourable member may make her remarks when the Social Services Consolidation Bill is under consideration. Dame ENID LYONS -In deference to your ruling, I shall not continue with what I was saying. Although an increase of 5s. a week has been granted to age and invalid pensioners, pensions are still barely enough to live on. I now come to the widow's pension, which it is proposed tc increase from 42s. 6d. to 47s. 6d. a week. This is 5s. a week more than the age pension, the extra amount being intended, I presume, for the support of a child under sixteen years of age who does not qualify for endowment under the child endowment scheme. I believe I am right in saying that it is not proposed to increase this amount of 5s., and this is the only instance in the entire range of pensions payments in which no increase has been granted. This may be an oversight. Probably, the authorities believe that, in granting an A class widow a 5s. increase, they had covered her case. However, an increase of 2s. 6d. a week has been granted in the case of all children other than the first child, so there seems to be no reason why a similar increase should not be granted in respect of the first child, also. I mention the matter now in the hope that, when the consolidating measure is brought down, the position will be remedied. I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister a matter touching upon the amount of income which may be earned by a pensioner without its affecting the amount of his pension. If a pensioner is able actively to engage in some work, he is permitted to earn up to £1 a week without loss of pension, and it is proposed now to increase this amount to 30s. a week. Eecently, I received a letter from a woman pensioner who owned her ownhome, and had let two of her rooms, with gas and electricity supplied, for 25s. a week. She estimated that gas and electricity cost 5s. a week, so that her return from the letting of her rooms was £1 a week. That view, however, was contested by the department, and she was credited with an income of 25s. a week. That is an obvious injustice. If a pensioner were boarding somebody else for 30s. a week, it could not be claimed that the extra income thus earned was 30s. a week, because the cost of feeding a boarder would probably be not less than 25s. I ask the Minister to look into this matter. I come now to child endowment: I am disappointed that the Government has not yet seen fit to make the child endowment scheme cover all children in all families. I am also disappointed that the Government has adhered to the old flat rate of endowment. A graduated scheme would be better. Let the payment for the first child be smaller than for the others, hut let it increase for each succeeding child. That would come nearer to achieving essential justice, and should tend to increase the birth-rate. However, the point I wish particularly to stress is that provision should be made for thc child under sixteen who is not a first child. ""When the scheme was first introduced, this aspect was not, I believe, suffifess that while he was speaking, the ciently considered. The first child receives no endowment. As soon as the second child reaches sixteen it, too, ceases to qualify for endowment. Thus, there is always one child under sixteen not receiving endowment. In a family of six or seven, there could be one child under sixteen for which nothing was being received, although some of the older children might still be dependent upon the parents. In the case of large families, this constitutes a hardship. The parents have usually readied a stage in life when they are no longer able to put forward extra effort to increase their earnings. seventh child reaches the age of sixteen, the others will be in employment. Dame ENID LYONS -Some will probably be married, while, others may not even have left, scliool. It is a fine thing that many parents make sacrifices to keep their children at school beyond sixteen years of age so that they may qualify for a chosen occupation. I know of many instances of the kind, and I can supply the Minister with particulars if he wishes. If the Governinent persists, as no doubt it will, in refusing endowment to the first child, let it consider the proposition that other children of a family should be endowed, even though they may become, technically, first children, provided that older children remain dependent upon their parents after the age of sixteen while receiving higher education. Alternatively, let such a provision apply to families of more than four or five children. This would be a step in the right direction, and would convince parents that the Government was interested in the welfare of families. This morning, I asked a question of girls, as individuals, have some rights. the Minister for Immigration ( Mr We are not dealing with cattle.

But I must conthought occurred to me that the hope for agreement among all the peoples of the world was very slender when it was so easy for a disagreement to arise between friends, as it bas on this occasion. When the Minister spoke, apparently with some perturbation, about the desire of the United Kingdom and American Governments to obtain typing assistance from Australia after the cessation of hostilities, I could not help feeling that we were probably in a better position than any other belligerent to supply it. We could very well have done so without any great detriment to ourselves, and by so doing, we would have fostered the development of even more friendly relations with the United Kingdom and the United States of America. I fully appreciate the paramount thought in the Minister's mind, that the American Government should be prepared to honour an agreement into which it entered with the Australian Government. The Minister said that the United States Government is morally bound to send the girls hack to Australia. I put it to him that the whole basis of the agreement was governed by the fact that, in war-time, every person in Australia was subject to the man-power regulations. entered into in 1946, after the war had ended. Dame ENID LYONS -That being so, I cannot see any reason for the Minister's action in insisting that the girls should return to Australia. If they were entitled to enter the service of the American Government and were of age, or if their parents consented to their going abroad, the Minister had no moral right to impose any conditions regarding their return to Australia.

I say to the Minister, in all friendliness, that he is making a grave mistake, which is not in keeping with the measure that he has taken to make the status of married women in regard to nationality much clearer and fairer than it has been. In this instance, he is completely reversing his attitude and is doing so merely in the interests of the dignity, if it may be so termed, of the Department of Immigration and the Australian Government. This agreement between the United States of America and Australia in no way sets aside the rights of those girls as human beings and Australian citizens. I hope that even now, the Minister will reconsider his decision in the matter. for Informatio n and Ministerf or I m m i gration) [5.35] -The honourable member for Flinders( MrB y a n ) , speaking on the proposed vote for the Department of I m migration, paid a tribute to my omcers and myself. My officers must be included in any compliments that are paid in respect of the development of our immigration policy. We have every prospect of receiving 70,000 migrants this year. We should have to go back more than 30 years in our history to find a time He only when 70,000 migrants came here in one year. We shall achieve our objective of 70,000 persons a year in a little more than three years after my appointment as Minister for Immigration. A t the time of my appointment, the war was still in progress. The honourable member for Flinders, having complimented us, said that we should have to do better than 70,000 m i grants a year, and that we should he inaugurating a scheme of mass migration. He almost claimed the copyright of the idea. He did not say that I had was a third put that scheme forward many months ago. He expressed the opinion that I should pursue our immigration policy T h c Minister made it with greater vigour. I do not know that I can pursue it with any more vigour than I . have done. The difficulty in this finally matter lies, not in Australia, but in the United Kingdom. Not one of the three great political parties in Great Britain, the Labour party, the Liberal party or the Conservative party, is prepared to endorse the principle of mass migration. That subjectis a matter of domestic politics in Great Britain. Any political party that approves the principle of mass migration will be accused by its opponents of desiring to scuttle the Empire, or of letting Great Britain's prestige down. Any political party which endorsed the principle of mass migration would immediately give an electoral advantage to its opponents. That is the truth of the situation. Not one leading personality in Great Britain, with the exception of Dr. Dalton, who is the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, w ill say that there should be a dispersion of people and industries throughout the whole of the British Commonwealth. He alone considers the needs of the British Commonwealth to be above the needs of any particular part of it . Our inability to inaugurate mass migration is also due to shipping problems.

My departmental oflScers and my ministerial colleagues have spent many anxious hours in trying to work out schemes for bringing people to Australia. When we found that we could not get sufficient ships, we tried to find ways and means of bringing people by air for a part of the way and by sea for the remainder of the journey. Last week, I told honourable members of consultations which I had had in Canberra with representatives of the International Refugee Organization at Geneva. them that Australia had despatched Brigadier White to Cairo, London and Geneva for the purpose of discussing the matter with various authorities. He will present a report to the Government within a few weeks. We secured the appointment of Major-General Lloyd as the representative in Australia of the International Refugee Organization. He has been in Geneva, and knows our problems. He has also visited London and knows the British view. When he returns, we shall have consultations with him for the purpose of deciding whether we can take any additional measures to accelerate the flow of people to Australia. to people who have been so labelled. It In all the circumstances we are doing reasonably well. San Francisco will leave Genoa on the 15th of this month with 1,330 displaced persons for Australia. Asturias will leave a port in the United Kingdom on the 20th of this month with 1,440 persons under the free and assisted passages scheme, and with 126 former Polish soldiers.

He also attacked the trade unions. It is true that some unions, under Communist control, have heen averse to the employment of Baits, but it is also true that we have many occupations in Australia into which we can place all the people who are likely to arrive in this country in the proximate future, without allocating them to those particular industries. However, I am not satisfied with that. I have had conversations with the trade union leaders who have criticized our policy. I have ascertained their views, and have expressed my own opinions on the subject, and I have not the slightest doubt that, I informed within a few months, Baits, Poles. Ukranians, Czechs and Yugoslavs will be working in the iron and steel industry and in the coal-mines. A great deal of patience must he exercised in a matter of this kind. Australians have been notoriously insular, and inclined to view a stranger with a great deal of suspicion. They have even regarded a person from Great Britain as an object, both of scorn, and of criticism of an unfortunate kind. That spirit has had to be broken down. The term "" Pommy"", applied as an opprobrious epithet, has caused considerable suffering takes a good deal of effort to make Australians realize that they must be tolerant of all those who had not the great good fortune to be born under the Southern Cross. What is true in respect of Englishborn people is even more true of those who were born of parents who could not speak the English language. Speaking generally, I can say that Australians are becoming more tolerant. They realize that if they do not become tolerant, the future of their children and their children's children in this part of the world will be most difficult.

274,Mr Calwell,"Had the honourable tion to the admission of Asiatics to Auscarry out the precedents which have been established during 48 years of federation. But tliose precedents go back much further because 90 years ago, on the goldfields in eastern Victoria, at Lambing Flat, now known as Young, in New South Wales, and at Gympie, in Queensland, clashes occurred between Chinese and persons of European origin, and in consequence the colonial parliaments imposed a poll tax on the admission of Chinese Kanakas were brought into Australia for the purpose of developing the sugar-cane industry in hut about that kind of labour. With federation, a device was found to restrict the entry of unsuitable migrants. I think that it was the late Mr Joseph Chamberlain who suggested it to our delegates when they were in GreatB r it a in in connection with the establishment of federation. The suggestion was that our immigration laws might be so drafted as to enable a dictation test, to be given to immigrants. That test would not give offence to the people of other countries on racial grounds. Our dictation test is applied to certain Europeans whom we do not desire to admit to this country, and almost invariably to Asiatics. honourable member for Flinders said that if we applied a quota system to the admission of the Asiatic people who applied for permanent residence it would give less offence than the present system and abate the tide of criticism that is rising in the continent of Asia because of our immigration laws. I do not believe that nny thing of the kind would happen. I do not think that an occidental mind can follow the niental processes of an oriental in ind. I have talked to Asiatic diplomats, who have told ine that a quota system would be grossly offensive to their peoples. They certainly have no desire themselves ever to be satisfied with such a system. When Australia was approached by an Asiatic power with regard to a treaty, the Asiatic power stipulated that it wanted for its nationals the same right of entry into this country as is accorded by it to the nationals of any European country. It is idle to assume that, if we establish a quota system we shall appease the Asiatic peoples. A [43] policy of appeasement never pays, irrespective of whether it is applied internationally, nationally or in any other way. An appeasement system is a bad one. It arises from an inferiority complex and is governed by fear. Any suggestion of a quota system is a suggestion of a policy of appeasement. The policy that has been in vogue in Australia for the last 48 years can continue for the next 4S years, and I see no reason citizens to this country. why it should not continue for another 148 years.

I have no racial animosity, but wben I made that remark about pollution I think that I was expressing the opinion that thc Australian people have formed owing to the brutalities of the Japanese Army and the attitude, of the Japanese people in World War II . I could let the Japanese wives of Australian soldiers come to Australia, but 1 have more concern for the mothers and wives of Australian servicemen who were so brutally treated by the Japanese than to do that. If the honourable gentleman thinks that he is expressing Australian opinion when he talks as he does, he is making a fatal mistake. I have in my hand letters that were sent to me by the mothers and wives of Australian servicemen after 1 made the statement to which the honourable member has referred. They are very feeling letters, and they express strong sentiments about those who did such awful things to Australian seiwicemen.

The people outside of this country who are attempting to force us to change our immigration policy are a mixed grill. Tbey include members of the Communist party, who wish to break down our immigration laws and our established policy becanse of their distorted views about, the brotherhood of man; and certain church leaders of every denomination who want a quota system also because of their particular ideas about the brotherhood of man.

278,Mr Calwell,"The honorableproposed. It is amazing how some persons who are violently anti-Communist in their outlook accept resolutions that are suggested to them by men whom they know to be iraembers of the Communist party. The honourable member for Darwin (Dame Enid Lyons) said, and I accept her assurance, that she does not want to destroy our present immigration laws and practices. I do not believe that any honourable member opposite, whether he bc a member of the Liberal party or of the Australian Country party, wants to make any fundamental change in these laws. Those who talk of quotas, of letting some people in, and of administering our laws in a less clumsy and less arrogant fashion, as the honourable member for Fawkner( MrH o l t ) once referred to it , do not with and tliey made sure that the standards of living that they brought with them from older countries would not be destroyed by large numbers of Asiatics. They established exclusive laws. We should be failing in our duty to our children and to their children if we were to create in our time and generation a problem that could grow to the extent that the Harlem problem has grown in the United States of America. We are bound not to allow that to happen. We are bound to maintain such institutions and laws as will ensure that, our present standard of living is maintained. If we desire to help people who do not enjoy the same high standard of living as we do, we shall achieve success not by bringing them to this country, but by helping them to raise the standards of living in their own countries. If we were to bring them to Australia and intermingle their blood with ours we should only create an unfortunate class of halfbreeds. ostracized by their brothers and lead miserable lives. Having said that to honourable members opposite, I remind them that the sentiments that they express are not always those which are expressed by members of the Liberal party and the Australian Country party outside this Parliament. bers of the Labour party. matter on which there is no doubt in the minds of members of the Labour party it is the maintenance of the present immigration laws and practices of Australia. That is the number one plank of our political religion. We have always maintained that, and always will do so.

I believe that that sentiment is not in accord with the view of a great majority of the Australian people. If we were to permit that policy to obtain, we should have within a few decades an influx of Asiatic people who had married Australians permanently or temporarily and had thus gained entry to this country that, tliey would not be entitled to gain under ordinary conditions. It would be possible for any Asiatic person coming ashore from a visiting ship to go through a ceremony of marriage in a registry oflice or church and by the mere fact of having gone through that ceremony become entitled to remain here for life.

It concerns the shipping services to various Queensland ports particularly Maryborough, Bundaberg and Gladstone.

However, honourable members are becoming accustomed to hearing that kind of reply in this chambei , and it seems to me that these tactics are used by the Government to cover incompetence ancl an inability to answer the case made out against it. I haA'e applied myself to the matter of improved shipping in these areas hy means of personal representations to the Minister concerned, by questions in the House, and by references in various speeches. As a result of my efforts, some temporary relief has been obtained from time to time. I say it is high time that the people struction of a type of small ship, the ir. these areas were given some form of .security regarding the export of their products and the import of the material so essential to the development of their districts. member desire shipping controls to be restored ? that point later. Maryborough and Gladstone are both river ports which must be served by small coastal ships. The districts of which they are the centres are largely concerned with the production of sugar and the requirements of imported materials are the same in both ports. Both ports are also unfortunately in a similar condition regarding shipping services. An example of the inadequacy of the present service may be gained from the fact that since the beginning of July the port of Bundaberg has had five trips from Baralaba and one from Babinda, both of which are small coastal vessels. The large districts they serve have to rely on that meagre service for the importation of all goods from the south, and for the transport of sugar to southern States. That condition existed at a period when these districts must be well serviced to enable the shipping of sugar production to the south. Erom time to time when the Government has been approached for assistance, Ministers have been prone to jibe at private enterprise. The honourable member for Herbert( Mr Edmonds), who interjected a few minutes ago, was following that lead. I admit that private enterprise has to be looked to to give as great a measure of relief as possible, but private shipping companies have not yet recovered from the effects of the war when they suffered from government acquisitions of their vessels and other losses. As yet they have had very little opportunity to replace these losses. In addition to submitting representations to the Government, I have conferred with representatives of the shipping companies, and I know that the companies are doing their utmost to relieve the position in Queensland. The Government can help, because, under its ship-building programme it is proceeding with the con"" E "" class. For the time being at any rate it would considerably relieve the position if one of these vessels were made available. In that regard I desire, in conjunction with the honorablo member for Wide Bay, to submit a request that the Minister for Shipping and Fuel pay a visit to those areas in order to see for himself exactly what the position is and to meet the representatives of the Maryborough and Bundaberg Chambers of Commerce in order to discuss how to find some way out of the difficulty. An invitation has already heen issued to the Minister and I ask that lie accept it as quickly as possible, because no time should be lost in coming to a decision on this important matter. I ask that a visit be paid to the city of Maryborough. Interested parties at Bundaberg will go to Maryborough to interview the Minister there. That is one way in which the Government can assist in relieving the position, but there are other ways. Another reason for the serious shipping position in Queensland is the slow turn-round of ships which I have, mentioned before in this chamber. One instance was the recent loss hy Baralaba of three valuable days at Bundaberg as a result of a dispute on the waterfront. This dispute, which has existed for a considerable time, arose over a request by the watersiders for a reclassification of the port for the purpose of attendance money payments. I know that that matter has been discussed and that it was the subject of an application to the Stevedoring Industry Commission som . v considerable time ago.

Only after the indicated that they are prepared to cut claim has been dealt with by the comand load on Saturdays, and the millers mission will the Government be in a have agreed to pay overtime rates at position to demand that a proper service week-ends if necessary in order to enable lie provided for the port by those whose them to handle the crop.

Other factor;: which have contributed to the state of stage to the, general position regarding affairs that exists at the port have already the lifting of sugar in Queensland, parbeen referred to by the honourable memticularly in view of the somewhat comber for Wide Bay. The honourable ""memplacent remarks made by Ministers. ber stated that the coastal vessel Ministers have said several times in the Baralaba has been held up in Brisbane last few weeks that the position in and that Babinda, another small, boat regard servicing these ports, has been held up north Queensland is reasonably satisin Sydney as the result of a dispute over factory. I admitted a week or two the employment of a cook. In replying ago that, as the result of the visit to the lionorable member for Wide Bay. of Judge Kirby, a considerable quantity the Minister for Post-war Beconstruction of last season's stored sugar had been ( Mr Dedman) stated that Baralaba had lifted; but it cannot be said that the sailed this morning and that it was hoped position is satisfactory. It has now be that Babinda woulcl be free to sail to come evident that unless the general posimorrow. That is good news, but it does tion improves, there is a grave dangei not get over the fact that much time that at least 10 per cent, of this year's which has already been wasted cannot be crop will have to be left standing in the picked up. As the result of these delays fields and become a total loss. That perthere is stacked in millers' sheds and on centage of the total crop represents the wharfs in the Bundaberg area S0,000 tons of sugar, or, in other words, 28,000 tons of manufactured sugar. In order to give an indication of the serioussugar of a gross value of £2,000,000. The ness of the situation I inform honourable Minister for Post-war Beconstruction members that that represents 65 per cent, stated that part of the difficulty was of the total quantity of sugar manudue to the fact that the loading equipfactured during this season to date in the ment installed at most of the ports in Bundaberg area. Only 35 per cent, of north Queensland was not modern or thc sugar already manufactured has been efficient. I say from my own knowledge shipped. The continuance of that state that that statement is not correct. In of affairs can lead to only one result. practically all the ports, certainly in all This year the total crop in the Bundaberg the major ports handling sugar in district is expected to yield approximately Queensland, efficient conveyor equipment 80,000 tons of sugar and growers and the. has been installed in recent years whicli millers alike are particularly concerned will stand comparison with that inwith the position that has developed. The stalled anywhere in the world. The mills may be forced to close down because handling equipment at Mackay was they have not sufficient storage space to erected only a few years before the war store additional quantities of manuand I do not know of any more modern factured sugar. Millers and farmers handling installation anywhere. CerI t may be well for me to refer at this to sugar shipments from tainly in one or two of the smaller ports the handling equipment is not so good. In making his statement the Minister was probably thinking of the port of Lucinda Point, where only a small jetty serves the two mills established there. It is fortunate that those mills can gain relief by transporting their sugar by rail to Townsville. Although the equipment at Lucinda Point may not be as good as it might be there are working there extremely good gangs of watersiders, and the loading position is not serious. At Cairns, Townsville, Mackay and Bundaberg there is available effective and modern loading equipment of the conveyor type which, if properly used, could adequately handle a greater volume of tonnage than is likely to be available this year. Let us remember that only a few years ago, in 1939, the Queensland sugar shipped within a reasonable, time after the commencement of the new year no less than 891,000 tons of sugar. Tbis year we expect to ship only 800,000 tons. In view of what has been done in the past, the contention that the handling equipment is inefficient will not stand the test of reason. My remarks on the port position in North Queensland would not be complete without a further reference to the position of Gladstone, a very fine port, which for some reason seems to have become the Cinderella port of central Queensland. at the port of Gladstone last, notwithstanding, it serves a large farming toral area extending range and embracing as Monto ing areas and portion of the Callide Valley, where considerable coal deposits have recently been developed. tion has arisen because that district has no shipping service from Sydney, Kembla centres almost all of the essential material for its development tained. various firms indicating time again their quotas of supplies from firms such as Lysaght's have heen cancolled Mr Davidson. suppliers to obtain shipping space. These quotas have been lost to the district. A t public meetings of those interested the requirements of the area were stressed. It was pointed out that there is an extreme shortage of materials necessary for home building in that area. The position there is infinitely more acute than that created by the general shortages which exist all over Australia. Even the small quota made availahle to that area cannot be shipped there. In addition, it has been practically impossible for the farmers to obtain supplies of iron, fencing materials, and the like, and accordingly those engaged in this rich producing area are in grave difficulties. Only last week I asked for some action to be taken to ensure that the coastal vessel Delamere, which was loading in Sydney, would include Gladstone on industry manufactured and its next northern trip. The Minister promised to do everything possible, but I have not yet received a reply indicating whether my request has been granted. Another alarming feature which is developing in Gladstone as a result of the absence of an adequate shipping service in that a large meat works there is considering transferring a good deal of its activities to Sydney or Brisbane, because it cannot adequately house its present employees let alone provide for the extension of its activities. These facts, which have been submitted to the Minister concerned by the honourable member for Wide Bay and myself, defiNo ships have called nitely confirm our contention that it since May is vitally necessary that everything that the fact that can be done to increase the shipping serand pasvice to North Queensland ports should over the coastal be done. There should be no more fobsuch districts bing off by statements that the matter and the adjoining farmwill be looked into. A visit to the area should be made by a responsible Minister so that he may see for himself at first A serious posihand what needs to be done. Action should be taken by the Government to provide, Port one new small vessel for the handling and Newcastle, from which of that trade. A suitable vessel should be allotted from the Government's shiphas to be obbuilding programme. Such a visit would I have received letters from clear the atmosphere and would, that time and I believe, achieve some results which would relieve the grave situation that exists there. because of the inability of Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Ministeri n charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [8.28] I have-just been informed that arrangements have been, made for the coastal vessel Delamere to leave Sydney with, 600tons of cargo for Gladstone..

Recently, in order to bolster up a very weak, personal attack upon me, the Minister used a quotation concerning something that took place in New South Wales in 1928. Then, in an attempt to make it appear that T was responsible for what had happened, he said that 1 was Premier of New South Wales at that time. He knew, of course, that I was not Premier of New South Wales in 1928. He knew that I was the Leader of the Opposition in the Parliament of New South Wales in 1928, and that I did not become Premier until two years later. I cite that instance in order to show how dangerous it is to have in the Government a Minister who distorts facts in order to suit his quotations. Then, applying the principle laid down by Goebbels, the Minister accused me of lying. He said that I was not prepared to make a statement about the Communists outside the Parliament where I did not enjoy parliamentary privilege. He knew, of course, that I had published a book in which I named the leaders of the Communist party in Australia, and made charges against them. He also knew that Thornton had taken out a writ for £10.000 against me, but I do not run for cover as did the Minister fnr Information when he took out a writ against the Sydney Daily Telegraph. I did not "" squib "" the issue with the Communists, as he "" squibbed"" the issue with the Daily Telegraph. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMANWill thc honourable gentleman tell me to which department he is referring? Information. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN Will the honourable gentleman say what Communist secretary of the Waterside the action of the Minister in regard to the Workers Federation, whom the GovernDaily Telegraph has to do with the ment appointed to the Stevedoring department under discussion? 1 did not "" squib "" the issue as the Minisshould like to know whether it is in order ter did. In my case, it was Thornton, the Communist leader, who ran away. The Minister for Information accused me of lying when I said that Communists On recent perhad been appointed by this Government to key positions. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN but the Order! The honourable member is not permitted to make the discussion of the proposed vote for the Department of Information an excuse for an irrelevant attack upon the Minister for Information in regard to a matter which has nothing to do with the administration of the Department of Information. Information who attacked me, and 1 am replying to what the Minister said. It is not surprising to see the Minister for Information, in this Parliament and elsewhere, defending the Communists, but I have named the Communists which this Government appointed to key positions. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! Tho honourable member is trying to discuss a subject which the committee has already discussed and disposed of. The subject of communism was discussed when it was relevant to the department then before the committee. It is not relevant to any of the departments now before the committee. the Minister for Information appointed Communists to his department. I desire to show the cumulative and injurious effect of that action on this country. The Minister for Information said that I had not named those men. I had done so. I named Atcherley and Pomeroy. SoI hurl that lie back into the Minister's teeth. He also stated that I had lied when I said that Communiste had been appointed to boards that control transport in this country.

He stepped into the shoes of that very good Labour man, the late Dr. Maloney, and many honourable members will recall how bitter he was when he was not elected to the first Curtin Ministry, and how he attacked the Government, which he was pledged to support, at everyopportunity on the adjournment of the House. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN' Order! I ask the honourable member to resume his seat. The actions of the Minister when he was a privatemember have nothing to do with the proposed vote for the Department of Information. If the honourable gentleman desires to go back as far as 1941, he will have to wait for a suitable occasion. He is not in order in doing so now. with all due respect because you have been in the Chair for long periods, that throughout the sittings of the committee on Priday, yesterday and to-day, I took advantage of every opportunity to obtain the call in order to discuss the Estimates of every department. I was not called. It was just bad luck, I admit. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN. Order! The Chair has nothing to do with the good luck or bad luck of the honourable member. Eveni f he failed to catch the eye of the Chair and did not get the call for the purpose of discussing the Estimates of other departments, he is not in order now in discussing the votes of earlier departments, to which the committee has now agreed. That must he quite clear. the Estimates of any other department. The. Minister to whom I am referring is in charge of one of the departments that are now under discussion, and it is the only one on which I candiscuss and criticize him. Is the ruling of the Chair that the Minister in charge of a department and the estimates for that department are above criticism? The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN That is not correct. The honourable member for Reid can say what he likes to say in fair criticism of the Department of Information and its administration. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN Of its administration. What the honourable member for Melbourne did as a private member, or what any other honourable member said or did in this chamber as a private member, is not relevant to the question that is now before the Chair. Information did twelve months ago cannot be discussed now, I say that no one has the right to discuss what happened twenty years ago. If I have to sit here and listen to the Minister make statements that are false, and which I am proving to be untrue, and if , on the only occasion on which I can reply to those statements, I am to be debarred from doing so, then the King's justice and the King's Parliament aro not what I thought them to be. I am desirous of rebutting what the Minister said about me. If I cannot do so, that is too had. If I cannot do it in the discussion of tbese Estimates, there is no other way in which I can do it. If I am not to be allowed to speak, I shall have to put up with it; However, I shall endeavour to answer the Minister's charges and will go as far as I am permitted to go by the Chair. Honorahle members will remember how on that occasion the Minister ranted and raved all over the Commonwealth against his then leader, and how he insulted him both in private and public. They will recall the second conscription fight order for an honourable member to read a speech that has been prepared for him by some one outside of the Parliament who is biased against the Minister for Information?

I point out to the honorahle member that I am not trying to stifle him, but the general political career of the Minister for Information is not under discussion at the present moment. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIBMAN L do not know what the Minister said about the honorahle member for Eeid. I was not in the chair at that time. I am pointing out to the honourable gentleman that he has all the freedom in the world to say what he likes, in parliamentary language, about what the Minister has done or failed to do in administering the Department of Information. He cannot, however, roam around the world, attacking the Minister for Information or any other member of the committee under the guise of discussing the Estimates. What the committee is now. discussing, among other things, is the Department of Information and the Estimates in relation to it. The honourable gentleman is entitled to give his reasons for saying why he thinks that the administration of the department is faulty and why the Estimates should not -be approved. He can attack the administration of the department and suggest that it has been right or wrong, but he cannot rove around the world in order to follow the political history of the Minof Information. I have no intention of ister for Information or any other Minister. beyond New South Wales. I was stating what the Minister did, and showing that he is unfit to be a Minister of the Crown. I am trying to show the committee what kind of an administrator he is. I was telling honourable members of how thc honourable gentleman acted in the second conscription fight, how he vilified his then leader, and how he circulated copies of manifestos that were issued and signed by his leader in the first conscription fight. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN Was that done through the Department of Information. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN The honourable gentleman was nbt a Minister then. and I am attempting to reply to the attack. I have listened to Ministers talking about the brothers-in-law, sistersin-law and other relatives of members of the Opposition. I have heard remarks about men marrying for money. None of those comments had anything to do with the Estimates of any department. SurelyI have the right to say something. I point out how the Minister for Information dug back into the files of the Melbourne Herald for 1906 to discredit his then leader, and how he dug up an anti-conscription speech that was delivered by his leader in the Melbourne Trades Hall as a young man and circulated it privately throughout the length and breadth of Australia. Even then the honourable gentleman was training, and that was his training ground, to become the "" Minister for Quotations "".

I ask you, sir, to say whether it is not correct to address a member of this honourable House in the same way as a member of the House of Commons, which is the Mother of Parliaments, is addressed, namely, as the honourable and gallant gentleman. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN The honourable member has raised no point of order. Whatever may be the practice of the House of Commons, the rules of this Parliament require an honourable member, when speaking in this chamber, to address another honourable member by the electorate that he represents. That is all that is required. this committee and, through it, the people of Australia of what is being done under the Parliament's authority to publicize Australia abroad. I am the better able to do this because during my overseas tour last year I was able to examine on the spot our publicity activities in the countries that I visited. Erom being principally the servant, and by no means always an honest one, of sectional interests, publicity has grown to national stature in the use to which it is being .put by the Commonwealth Department of [nformation. We are not unique in this, because in recent years, organized national publicity has become increasingly a principal means of national expression; but we are to-day in the vanguard of those progressive nations which have realized the necessity and the possibilities of publicity and we are already harvesting its results. out that the Minister for Information is reading every word of his speech, and I understand that that constitutes a breach of our ' Standing Orders. I direct your attention, sir, to a ruling by the Temporary Chairman of Committees, the honourable member for Werriwa( Mr Lazzarini), that a member must not read his speech in this chamber.

The Standing Orders do not apply in this case. The principal aims of our national publicity are to help the other peoples of the world to understand us, our aims and endeavours, and to foster good relationships in all our dealings with them. In a sentence, the Department of Information exists to make Australia better and more favourably known to the rest of the world. Our national publicity is also a powerful aid to our immigration plans. It is a means of letting people know, factually and faithfully, the sort of people we are, the conditions which immigrants will encounter here, and the opportunities which this country offers them. With this knowledge, those who elect to make their future in Australia are far more likely to make successful citizens than many who in the past have come here, ill informed, and perhaps misled by sanguine slogans and glib generalities. The officers of the Department of Information abroad have gained a fine reputation",82,Department Of Post War Reconstruction

They are information 'officers and not propagandists, and as such have the confidence of the press, writers, lecturers and others with whom they deal as being a source from which accurate information on Australia can be obtained. Broadly, in the organizational structures of the Department of Information, which performs these publicity tasks, Australia is the main production base, the Australian Government's overseas offices are its principal outlets, and its media are every means of presenting Australia to the peoples of the worldprincipally in print, over the air, and on the screen. activities in this country are, consequently, the production of letterpress, photographs, radio scripts, and films. The product goes chiefly to the Australian News and Information Bureau at Australia House, London, to a similar bureau in New York, and to Australian diplomatic and trade establishments overseas. Omcers of the department are attached to such establishments in America, Canada, France, India, Egypt and Malaya. . Because publicity for Australia in other countries is the department's principal activity, I shall try to give the committee some idea of its extent and of the success it has attained. I feel sure the facts will surprise many people, especially those whose impressions of the department hav.e been gained mainly from criticism by newspapers which have not bothered to inform themselves or their readers of the extent of its services to this country. With dollar spending limited, we have had to make each dollar do the work of two or more in dollar currency countries. Mr E. G. Bonney, formerly Director-General of the Department of Information in Australia, assumed the post of Director-General of the Australian News and Information Bureau in New York last April. He took over at a time when Australia's dollar position was becoming extremely acute. honourable member suggested a short while ago that the Minister was reading his speech. You, sir, ruled that the lionorable gentleman was merely consulting his notes. I now ask you, Mr Temporary Chairman, if you are still of the opinion that the Minister is merely consulting notes, and I draw attention to Standing Order 256, which states, without any possibility of its being misunderstood, that a member shall not read his speech. I suggest that the Minister is merely taking the opportunity to make a press statement through the medium of the Parliament. He is not making a speech, but is merely reading notes passed to him, and I contend that he has no right to continue. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN The department's main ( Mr Sheehan) -It is the practice to allow Ministers to refer to prepared statements.

We continue to secure excellent placements of Australian articles and pictures in the American press. Throughout the country these are so numerous that the mere task of keeping a record of them has become too. costly and cumbersome to be justified, but during the last month for which there are records, some 12,000 clippings wero sent in by a press-cutting agency which operates only in the. eastern States of America. Full-length magazine articles, mainly illustrated and of the type which appear in the department's publication South-West Pacific, are placed in the United States of America at the rate of about one a day, and these are of great importance a3 they give a balanced picture of the Australian way of life.

Daily and weekly news summaries go to all leading American editors and commentators. News bulletins are issued regularly in such specialized fields as agriculture, finance, aviation and women's interests. Large quantities of descriptive booklets and maps are sent to school teachers, children, universities, colleges and libraries. In many American schools, classes are doing regular studies on Australia. Requests from American schools often total 500 a month, and requests of a. general nature about Australia's arts, sciences, industries, sports and other activities run at the same high rate. The department's documentary films for publicizing Australia abroad are popular in America. The cost of production is now being offset by increasing revenues from rentals. Television has opened up new avenues for publicizing Australia. Programme organizers have already featured much Australian material from films made by the department. We expect more placements in this direction as television expands. Extra revenue from this field will help considerably in meeting the costs of producing films. The' New York bureau has had an outstanding success in arranging with 160 radio stations throughout the United States for a weekly broadcast of an Australian programme, "" A Look at Australia "". Outstanding Australians visiting the United States are featured in these broadcasts and in radio and television interviews over the major networks. Most of these broadcasts are given in the evening, when the potential listening audience is highest. It is impossible to measure the results of activities such as these; but a valuable indication of the acceptahility of the department's material and the work of the bureau was given when the bureau asked people on its mailing lists to fill in cards indicating the subjects relating to Australia in which they were interested. More than 60 per cent, of It is accepted the cards were filled in and returned, although experience by much larger organizations had shown a 25 per cent, response to be a maximum result. As a result of the demand indicated on the cards, the number of items of mail despatched from ' the bureau rose to 2,000 each working day. Reporting on its work among edhicational institutions, the West Coast officeof the bureau, at San EranciscOj saysthat some American university studentshave written their theses on Australian subjects, mainly from material prepared and supplied by the office, and this is a common occurrence in the other areas where our services are available. The work of the bureau, in association with that of the Department of Immigration's representatives in America, is reflected in the fact that up to the 30th June last, despite the very limited passengershipping available, nearly 1,000 immigrants had reached Australia from the United States. request, Mr Temporary Chairman, that you rule under what circumstances Standing Order 256 may be invoked. You have stated in a previous ruling that a Minister is entitled to read a ministerial statement or a prepared speech on the second reading of a bill. I point out, however, that a ministerial statement has to be made by leave of the House' and that this debate is in committee. I also point out at this stage what the highest authority on Britisli parliamentary procedure, May, says on this particular subject. He says that the purpose of Standing Order 256, which provides that speeches shall not be read, is primarily to maintain the cut and thrust of debate, and goes on to sayThe reading of speeches is even more improper in committee than in the House itself. This chamber is at present in committee.

348,Mr Calwell,"The activities of thein or visiting the United Kingdom. It revises and checks encyclopaedia material. It assists in the representation of Australia at international conferences. It also deals with hundreds of inquiries each day on all aspects of life in Australia. By placing the department's films for theatrical distribution, the bureau not only ensures wide publicity, but also obtains approximately 70 per cent, of the net receipts from exhibitors. The bureau's biggest exhibition during the year ended on the 30th June last, was the "" British Enterprise in Australia"" display at Australia House. The exhibition was opened by tbe Chancellor of tbe Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps, and drew an average attendance of 1,000 people a day for a month. The bureau co-operates with the Senior Australian Trade Commissioner in trade publicity throughout Europe. The activities of the department's officers at other overseas posts resemble those I have outlined, although smaller financial resources a^e available to them. Whether in Canada, Europe, Egypt, India or Malaya, these officers have succeeded to an astonishing extent, as the department's records and my observations fully confirm, in reaching the eyes and ears of the world with Australia's national publicity. Much attention has been given to educational work by our officer at the office of the High Commissioner for Australia in Canada. He reports that from the 1st July, 1947, to the .31st May, 1948, he distributed 2,551 special packages of Australian educational material to schools. Canadian schools have special study projects on Australia. He statesCanadian scientists and others are realizing industry, and economics. Austral News, more and more the fact that Australia, and Canada have many problems in common, and arc keen on exchanging information. Many journals in France have given pride of place to articles on Australia supplied through the press attache at the Australian Embassy, Paris. Not long ago, an important French commercial review devoted an entire issue to an economic study of Australia prepared by the department's writers. Material is supplied from this centre to other European countries, and the attache maintains a reference system which is frequently used by journalists, authors and students. In the Middle East and the arc of Asiatic countries which stretches across Australia's near north, pictorial publicity material is of special importance, because pictures speak all languages. Thus, our information officer in Cairo reports that the greatest success is being achieved by means of our films. These are fed into circuits which extend from Egypt as far afield as Tripolitania, Kenya and Iran. Despite newsprint shortage, and heavy demands upon their space by a long succession of dramatic events in their own country, Indian newspapers have given generous space to Australian publicity material supplied through the department's officer at New Delhi. He reports that when Indian editors have occasion to deal with Australian news and affairs they mostly tend to approach them in a friendly frame of mind, because they are accustomed to receiving from the Australian office, not propaganda material on contentious subjects, but material which has been prepared in an effort to supply the sort of information which will interest their readers. Having recently emerged as a dominion, India has shown particular interest in the Australian Constitution, and in our methods of administration. Departments of the Government of India have drawn heavily upon material supplied to our officer for information on these subjects, and there seems little doubt that this has influenced, for instance, the draft Indian constitution. The Trade Information Officer at the Many office of the Senior Australian Trade Commissioner for the Indian Ocean zone is concerned with publicity relating to Australian trade, primary and secondary an eight-page monthly newspaper produced from his office, has been widely acclaimed as the most useful publication of the kind in the area. An economic survey, agricultural newsletter, and techdepartment's nical newsletter are among the features regularly distributed from the office to the press and interested authorities. Month after month, Australian publicity material distributed by the Trade Information Officer at the office of the Australian Commissioner, Singapore, has occupied hundreds of column-inches of space in Malayan newspapers. Working under difficulties, this office has succeeded on several occasions in placing such conclusive facts before editors that they have withheld, or re-ca9t, items which, by misrepresentation or bias, would have been harmful to Australia. Use of films as a vehicle for Australian publicity in Malaya is illustrated by the record of an open-air screening at Penang of some of the department's colour films to about 3,000 Malayans. Although rain was drizzling upon the audience, they sat throughout the programme. At its conclusion, five village head-men approached ithe officer in charge of the screening, and ibegged that such films be sent to --their villages. The duties of our 'Trade Information officers include ^answering press comment where necessary, publicising visits of Australian business, men, assisting in promoting exhilhiiti©n« aand displays and selling campaigns, and directing the flow of trade publicity material to oversea media from the Department of Information and the Department of Commerce and Agriculture. The material provided by these departments is made available also to a number of trade commissioners at points where there is no information or publicity officer.. distribute 35-mm. or 16-mm. films for ordinary screenings ? honourable member who asks intelligent and important questions, both 35-mm. and 16-mm. films are used in a number of ways. With the consent of honourable members. I shall incorporate the remainder of my prepared statement in Hansard without reading it. A great deal of the work of all our overseas officers, hureau staffs and press attaches, as well as trade information officers, is associated with trade promotion. A very high percentage of the articles prepared in Australia and published in the overseas press deals with trade subjects, new Australian inventions and new processes, and there has been a very heartening response in inciuiries from overseas business men and importers following the publication qf these'articles. Our overseas officers, too apart from the trade information officers, work closely with the trade commissioners, particularly in bringing their specialized knowledge to bear on the preparation of exhibitions and other graphic displays designed to promote trade and closer understanding. AlthoughI have referred at length to the activities of the department's overseas officers, I have provided no more than glimpses of their work, which involves the use of practically all forms of publicity media. Results of their activities are readily apparent in those countries in which they are engaged, but are little known in Australia. Where experience shows that in any particular country circumstances do not justify continued maintenance of an officer, we do not hesitate to withdraw our representative. This, was the case in Nanking, China, and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, where press attaches were initially posted. It is a principle underlying the department's work that the national interest is served best by factual, informative material, provided this' can he made sufficiently attractive tor the reader, the listener, and the film audience to gain attention and hold interest. The radio time alone gained by Australian Department of Information activities in other countries is literally invaluable. I feel safe in saying that even if it were bought at the rates usually charged for time on the air, the value of such publicity would amount to a very substantial part indeed of the £324,448 which the entire activities of the department, at home and abroad, cost last year. It is because of the interest-content and integrity of the department's material that the question of payment does not arise. The radio and press overseas are glad to accept and use it on. itsmerits alone. Another important part of my department's work is the winning of recognition abroad for Australian eulture. Australian literature has come of age but this is not generally realized abroad and my department has attempted to overcome this lag. It does this in a number of ways. One is the distribution, in co-operation with Australian publishers, of review copies of Australian books to overseas editors, and publishers. Another >",86,Paibs

The Shortwave Division of the Department of Information, which made a significant contribution to the waging of the war against Japan, has been serving an important peace-time purpose as Eadio Australia. nation is using shortwave as an instrument of goodwill and publicity. Although the cost of Eadio Australia is small compared w i th that of comparable services in other countries, it has a worldwide reputation. A recent survey made in Sweden, a country noted for its avid interest in shortwave broadcasting, rated Eadio Australia w it h the British Broadcasting Corporation and the shortwave services of Canada and the United States of America, as the four leading services of their kind in the world. Eadio Australia operates from the most extensive and powerful station in the Southern Hemisphere, and is on the air for 22 hours of programme time a day. Broadcasting in five languages, it transmits seventeen news bulletins daily. In these bulletins and in its talks features, it presents Australian events and their background clearly and impartially to the world. letters received by Eadio Australia has been steadily mounting over the past three years. They come in now at the rate of 25,000 a yeara clear indication of its popularity, for only a minute proportion of radio listeners bother to write to their stations. Eadio Australia uses talks, features and music to tell Australia's story, to develop trade, to encourage migrants, investors and tourists, and to publicize the achievements of Australians in music, art, science, industry, sport and other spheres. news is quoted and requoted hy radio stations, newspapers and throughout the world.

Among these was a letter from the secretary of Dalgety and Companyi n Londoni n the course of which he saidThia publication is of vital importance to this coniipany, and owing to the large number of directors and executives who are concerned with the information contained therein, it is necessary for them to have copies of the daily bulletin in tlieir hands at early as possible. Hence we are unable to reduce the number of copies we require. The manager of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in London wroteAs the Central Bank, we are daily called upon to answer numerous inquiries on Australian affairs, and to provide up-to-date statistics, many of which we can find only in the bulletin. Mr W. S. Eobinson, of Austral Developments Limited, replied to the bureau's circular as follows:The number of Your bulletin has a wide circulation in our office, and we find it always of great interest. More than 70 films have heen produced by the Film Division of the Department of Information. These have been of all types, from instructional films for technical training to general interest films on subjects as diverse as Antarctica, ballet, arid aviation. Many have heen designed for theatrical release, to stimulate interest in Australian achievement. One of them, titled School in the Mailbox, achieved the rare honour of nomination Its for an academy award. In Australia, there has been a great increase in the periodicals theatrical distribution of my department's films. As many as four have been runAustralia ning at one time in capital cities, where it is estimated they have been seen by more than a million people. Thousands more will see them on suburban and Broadcasting Sercountry circuits. Press critics have been African warm in their praise of such films as Corporations, and the Spotlight on Australian Ballet, School ir> Corporation. Its the MaUbox. Namatjira the Painter and Antarctic Adventure. In tbe present year, distribution will be expanded and more films released theatrically. Besides bringing Australian activity to the attention of the Australian public, distribution represents a source of revenue to the Government. The department's policy is to contract with commercial distributors for straight-out fees or for a percentage of returns. As the number of films grows, returns will increase. Preparation of the stream of material necessary to maintain the department's world-wide press publicity services naturally is a big task. It is exacting especially because of the high standard of accuracy needed in acting as an official mouthpiece of Australia. Yet it is performed by 28 writers, and a photographic section which supplies the necessary illusState departments, and schools. Know trations. The size of the literary staff employed is less than is required by a daily newspaper in one of our big cities. So well and favourably have the department's services become known, that a large proportion of the material is supplied in response to requests by various publications. Feature articles produced by the department cover almost every aspect of Australian affairs. In addition, tlie department supplies a vast amount of information in the form of newsletters for use by newspapers, periodicals, lecturers, radio commentators and others. A feature known as Talikabout, relating to unusual and interesting aspects of Australia, has for two years been supplied to tbe great Associated Press newsagency, which circulates it, with illustrations by the agency's artists, to 1,500 newspapers in the United States of America, and to newspapers in 21 other countries. We face constantly increasing demands for pictures of Australian life-ou r sports, tourist attractions, industrial activities and so on. Investors, working men, tourists and immigrants want to know what Australia has to offer, and pictures help to tell them the story. Each week approximately 1,500 prints are distributed through our overseas representatives to newspapers, magazines, libraries, schools and other organiing from tourism. With this example in zations interested in. Australia. Honourable memhers have received from time to time copies of the Department of Information overseas publicity magazine, South-West Pacific, and I feel confident that they have been impressed by the high quality of its contents and the craftmanship evident in its appearance. Practically every article and many of the illustrations have been reproduced in important overscfi.s publications. Australia in Facts and Figures, also prepared and produced by the department, is widely used as a source of reference and reading, both in Australia and overseas; and its circulation continues to grow as demand for the booklet increases. It is included in reading material placed by the department on outgoing aircraft and ships. Most of the copies made available in Australia go to newspaper and broadcasting offices, literary institutes, local governing bodies, Commonwealth and Australia, a pithy, factual booklet, has run to its seventh edition, and a total distribution of approximately 1,000,000 copies. Like all these publications, it is in constant demand, particularly among prospective immigrants and tourists. Other publications are produced a9 occasion requires. With the concurrence of the State tourist authorities, tourist publicity on behalf of Australia in other countries has -been included in the responsibilities of the Department of Information. Shortage of shinning and accommodation, and the continuance of unsettled world conditions, have been a setback to hopes of earlv resumption of tourist traffic to Australia, although a boom is being experienced in Australia's domestic tourist trade. It is noteworthy, however, that Great Britain, despite its acute food shortage and housing problem, has established a national tourist authority and is taking very active and successful steps to attract tourists, particularly in relation to its dollar currency requirements. The British Travel Association reports that Britain's post-war tourist traffic is now its greatest single earner of dollars.

I asked if delivery could be expected within twelve months and was informed that they could not even promise that. Local governing authorities prefer tractors of the caterpillar type, the framework of which is manufactured in Australia. Last year the issue of licences for the importation of tractors of that type was suspended and this year only seven of those tractors are to be imported for the whole of Queensland. That indicates how serious the situation has become. Earlier, when I asked that the number of permits be at least doubled so that the most urgent and pressing requirements could he met, I was informed that the number of machines imported had reached the capacity of the Australian manufacturers in providing the requisite framework. I also asked what road making machinery was being exported from Australia and I was informed that no machinery was being exported, other than to New Guinea and other territories under the control of the Commonwealth. Mr GeorgeE . Bryant, of the Tutt-Bryant organization in Australia, is reported as follows in the Industrial News Service which, I presume, is a publication produced by the organization :Australian factories were producing more Queensland Government. construction .machinery than any otlier country statesin the world, except USA., claimed Mr George 13. Bryant, a loading Australian chartered helped engineer, upon his return from America.

I want the matter But tliere have been very few farms. cleared up. The Government should make it possible to import more tractors so that local bodies in Queensland may keep roads in repair. If only double the number were imported, they would meet the most urgent requirements, and the number of dollars involved would not he great. The agents of machinery firms say they cannot promise delivery witliin five years, and a road grader is practically worn out after five years' use. The need for machinery of this kind is urgent, and I ask whether the Government is going to allow the export of such machinery as is made in Australia. The supply of tyres for road making machinery is another problem. Rubber is available, but it is hard to get the tyres made. On more than one occasion I have heard the Ministerf or Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) eulogize the Government's land settlement programme for ex-servicemen. I have also heard him criticize the Victorian Government for its handling of this matter, but the Queensland Government has not done so well as the Victorian Government, although there is more suitable land available for settlement in Queensland than in Victoria. I have here a copy of the most recent issue of the Legionnaire, the official organ of the Australian Legion of Ex-service Men and Women, in which there appears an article headed, "" What about Soldiers' LandMr Eoley?

353,"Mr Adebmann ""","In March, 1946, two and a half years ago, the then Minister for Lands( Mr Jones) gave a glowing statenient to Legionnaire about the prospects for soldier settlement. These were some of the assurances Mr the Government boasts every day that in Jones gave:Seven and a half million acres, spread over many parts of the State were involved in land settlement proposals; Inspection and subdivision of 5,700,000 acres of pastoral land throughout Queensland's sheep districts was progressing. Half of the land selected would be available for ex-servicemen. Agricultural and dairy farm land totalling ucarly 1,000,000 acres were under expert scrutiny for submission for approval and inclusion in the Commonwealth State Settlement Sclieme. In Canberra a few weeks ago, the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) revealed how little had really been achieved. His statement exposed, beyond doubt, the abject failure of the Queensland Government to settle ex-servicemen on the land. Mr Dedman disclosed that, of 1,427 ex-servicemen given farms throughout Australia under the War Serviee Land Settlement Scheme only (54 had been helped hy the Queensland Government. How can the Government be satisfied with the progress of its land settlement 'schemes for ex-servicemen? Government supporters have criticized what was done for ex-servicemen after the first world war, but the record of this Government is an outstanding failure, in spite of the fact that, in Queensland at any rate, much suitable land is available, and a Labour government is in oflice in that State. I have not heard any Queensland Ministers in this Parliament eulogizing the land settlement scheme for ex-servicemen in Queensland. The Ministerf o r Postwar Reconstruction should take the matter up with the Queensland Government, instead of criticizing the governments in other States where a f a r better job has been done than the Government of Queensland has been able to do. I raise this question in the interests of ex-servicemen who are looking for land, and who have been waiting for two and a half years for the farms that were promised them. I want to hear what the Ministerf or Post-war Reconstruction intends to do about it . is shown at page 81 of the Estimates that expenditure by the Department of Labour and National Service was £1,178,300 in 1947-4'S. whereas estimated expenditure for 1948-49 is £1,345,000, an increase of £166,444. This department was set up to find jobs.for those seeking them, yel Australia practically no one is oui of work, and that is true. The department has a pay-roll of more thaD £1,000,000. In the summary of expenditure shown at page 81 of the Estimates, salaries and payments in the nature of . salaries are estimated to amount to £1,123,900 for the present financial year. What do the officers employed in this -department do? For instance, there are 26 research officers, besides a chief research oflicer, and five senior officers. The salary of the chief research officer is more than £1,000 a year. There are also ten assistant research officers, nineteen ' psychologists and vocational guide officers, seventeen inspectors, twenty architects and 21 engineers. What are they doing in the department? In Victoria, alone, there are 40,000 jobs waiting to be filled, according to figures issued by the State Statistician. From the reply to a question which I asked some monthsago to ascertain how many jobs the department had filled, I learned that if the number of jobs was divided into the amount paid in salaries to officers of the department, it would be found that the filling of each joh cost the taxpayers between £2 and £3, even though some of the jobs lasted only for a day or two. In his reply to me, the Ministerf or Labour and National Service wrote many pages pointing out what a useful work the department did in advising employers. That may be so, but I have never heard of any employer going to the department for advice. Every suburb of every city is dotted with branch offices of the department, although many ex-servicemen are unable to obtain oflice accommodation. Tbe department also employs survey officers, executive officers, senior clerks and a production illustrator. I do not want to disparage the work of these officers. If there was unemployment they could, no doubt, do useful work, but under present conditions I believe that the activities of the department could be centralized.

I have ao -wish to see the officers employed by this department thrown out of work, but t am sure that many of them would be glad to go into productive employment if the opportunity to do so were offered to them. Therefore, I should like the Minister to make a short statement explaining what the officers are doing, and why, when manufacturers, importers and commercial houses urgently require employees, it should be necessary to retain the services of scoras of people in this department. They canaot have much work to do. They are occupying office space which could be better utilized for other purposes. They should be engaged in more productive nmployment.

Honourable members may nothe aware that radio engineers andother technicians are. still being, trained for tbe Royal Australian Navy, the Army and the. Royal Australian Air Force. The number is not large. Uisabled persons, ex-servicemen and civilians are being trained so that, instead of being invalid' pensioners, they may do usdSuT work in the community. Persons are also heing trained in industry. Employers have agreed to train men on the job in an endeavour to overcome the shortage of experienced tradesmen. In addition, workers, who have been rendered redundant by technological) changes, are. being, retrained. That arrangement is described in the: White Paper on EulL Employment. Standards o£ industrial! training, are. being raised in conjunction with the Universities Comniission. Leader ofi the Opposition ( Mr Harrison) said "" tliat the. Government had fallen down on the job of training ex-service personnel. But the factis that according to figures, compiled, last week in connection with the full-time vocational training sheme, 82,079 persons had been, accepted, 56,042 were in training and 38,612 had completed training: In connection with part-time classes and technical training at night, 167,000 had heen accepted, 149,000 were in training and 13,229 had completed their training. tion to do with the question that I asked f the criticism that the Department of Labour and National Service has fallen down on the job of training ex-service personnel.

I emphasize that the industrial, sectionof the department has no relation to the employment section. The welfare section has almost revolutionized working conditions in factories. For example, in these days nearly every large factory has a modern cafeteria or dining-room, and amenities. amenities long before the Department of Labour and National Service was established. honourable member for Balaclava does not liketo see improvements occurring under the administration of a Labour government.

370,Mr Holloway,"Of course, thedebate. If I do not explain the true position Australian industry will be placed in a bad light in the eyes of the people of other countries. That will be unfortunate at a time when we are trying to encourage overseas industrialists to -establish factories in this country. The Acting Leader of the Opposition read figures which were perfectly true, but he left the wrong, impression. I propose to explain exactly how the Commonwealth Statistician collects data in relation to industrial disputes, including time Lost as the result of industrial disputes. The Commonwealth Statistician states that the equivalent of ten working days lost has been adopted as' a minimum. That may mean one man idle for ten days or ten men idle for one day. The returns would include one-hour stop-work meetings if the attendances :at them, were lar.ge enough. That -explanation shows the detail into which the CommonweaUh Statistician goes in compiling, information. Even when-only a few hours are lost at a stopwork meeting, they may be reckoned as days lost in an industrialdispute. The Acting Leader of the Opposition has sufficient knowledge of industrial problems not to place a wrong' interpretation on those figures, unless he desired purposely to create a wrong; impression'. Surely he did not want to do that. JW irrelevant. ""One of the principal functions of the Department for Labour and National Service is the handling of industrial matters. The statement which, the Acting Leader of thei Opposition made was true as far as it went, but I desire to correct another wrong impression that may have been, created. The honourable .gentleman said,in effect, that in. 1938 there were 375 industrial disputesrecorded, by the. Com-.monwealth Statistician, but that in 1947 there were 982 disputes recorded The honourable gentleman stopped at that point. The impression which he left upon his listeners was that there -were nearly three times as many industrial disputes last year as there were in 1938. He selected the year 1938 because-he was then a.member of the ..Menzies Government. I have .selected the same years, and asked the Commonwealth Statistician for the true story, because I do not want the honourable gentleman to leave a wrong impression that might possibly ruin the economic reputation of this country. In 193S the total number of days lost through industrial disputes was 1,337,994. In 1947, when there were nearly three times as many disputes, the number of man-days lost was 1,33S,728. That works out at 0.5S5 of a day per capita per annum in 1938, and 0.511 of a da.y in 1947, or a fraction over half a day per capita per annum, or less than one minute a day. I am not saying that that is not too much time lost. I do not mean that, j agree that there are too many disputes and too many days lost. I should like workers not to lose even one shilling in wages through industrial disputes, and employers not to lose one fraction of production as the result of stoppages. I am trying to achieve that objective. However,' the Acting Leader of the Opposition' made' it appear that as three timesasmany industrial disputes occurred last year compared with 1938, three times as much productionwas lost last year comgared with 1938. suggest that men resume production immediately they finish' a stop-work meeting. the speecn of the honourable gentleman could have created in other countries a wrong impression about the industrial situation in Australia. The position was not nearly three times as had in 1947 as it was in 1938. In fact, it had not grown worse. In 1947, there were 331,600 more people employed in factories and work1 shops than in 1938. The honourable gentlemandid not make that position clear. He stopped, short, and did not tell the whole story. It is impossible to say what is lost in production by merely quoting the number of disputes. That information does not give the real, picture. The only real way to find out whether more production is lost in one period compared with another as the result of industrial disputes is to take the number of manhours lost in one period .ant , compare it 1 with the relevant figures for another period.",96,Paibs

389,Mr Holloway,"I have not gotwhere the matchmakers are on strike. They are all piece-workers, and have the incentives to production which honourable gentlemen opposite advocate. On one type of machine the employees produced 1,350 gross of matches a day when they were working a 44-hour week. Their hours were then reduced to 40 a week. The conciliation commissioner, Mr Morrison, who is a very experienced officer, fixed the output at 1,400 gross instead of 1,350, although the employees were working four hours a week loss than said much, and ceased work. It is hoped that the case w ill be re-heard by the .conciliation commissioner next week and that the dispute w ill then be settled. I point out that the conciliation commissioner asked them to do more in a 40-hour week than they were doing in a 44-hour week. basis of the claim for a 40-hour week was that employees could produce more in 40 hours than in 44 hours, but nobody outside the Labour party believed that it would be so. in some instances that the output for a 40hour week is greater than that for a 44hour week. In the case to which I have referred, the employees were asked to produce more in a shorter working week. missioner said that the output should be greater, and the employees said that they were being asked to do too much. Rickettson, the chairman of the Capel Court Investment Company, an organization with investments in no less than 217 -companies, mostly in Australia and New Zealand, does not think that the economic position of Australia-is as bad as honourable gentlemen opposite say it is. On the 22nd March, 194S, speaking at the annual meeting of his company, he saidSome Australians may perhaps overemphasize their own political ,and industrial troubles, but careful examination of political, financial and economic conditions in all countries will disclose, I feel, that Australia now is predominantly the best practicable field, and the one offering the most attractions, for the investment of British capital. Obviously that gentleman does not think that Australia is such a dismal place as Opposition members say that it is. The honourable member for Parramatta ( Mr Beale) has probably seen Mr Carter appearing in court many times. When Mr Carter was representing the Western Australian Employers Federation in proceedings in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration before Judge DrakeBrockman, the judge asked him why the organization for which he was appearingdid not combine with employers organizations in other States so that one Commonbefore. The employees wealth award could be made to cover all that the increase was too of them. Mr Carter said that there was nothing to prevent that being done except the natural fear of his clients that they would be "" brought out from their little industrial backwater of comparative peace into the turmoil of the Eastern situation "". The judge then remarkedMore recently, that turmoil in the east has the least disturbed of any industrial country ir. the world with the exception of one for a long period. It can be proved was made by Judge Drake-Brockman. Mr Carter then saidYes, and I think I oan justly say that they claim that Western Australia has been the most peaceful of all the States. He admitted that industrial conditions in the other States of Australia were more settled than those in other countries, but suggested that Western Australia was the most peaceful of the Australian States. It will be seen that a business man and a Mr Staniforth judge both deny the implied suggestion of the Acting Leader of the Opposition that this country is in a state of turmoil and industrial chaos, and is a bad place in which to invest money.

396,"Sir Earle Page (Cowper) [10.25],","I. appeal to the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) to utilize the services of this expert to examine the timber resources of Australia in order to see whether it is possible comprehensively to develop our secondary industries that are associated with timber. I saw the Comptroller-General of Customs in order to discover the quantities of articles manufactured from timber that bave been imported into Australia during the last few years. I propose to deal with two items-newsprin t and rayon yarn. The value of the imports of those articles increased by £6,000,000 between 1946-47 and 1947-48, despite the fact that they have been subjected to severe rationing. In 1946-47 the total value of imports of these two items was £7,760,000 Australian and in 1947-48 it was £13,525,000 Australian. If , by utilizing our timber recellulose it would he possible to use 60 per sources, we could avoid the expenditure of over £13,000,000 on the importation of these goods, dollars to that value would be made availahle for the purchase of tractors, motor cars, lorries, petrol and machinery that would enable us -materiaUy to increase our total production and to make long-term plans for the continued employment of our people as well as of many migrants. £13,525,000 worth of imports is made up of 117,000 tons of newsprint, valued at £3,561,000; 35,000 tons of the better class of printing paper, valued at £3,635,000; 46,000 tons of various forms of wood pulp, wbich is not at present made in Australia, for the manufacture of paper, valued at £2,000,000; and 12,000,000 lb. of rayon yams, which are made from wood fibres, valued at £4,327,000. In 1947-48, 53,000 tons of paper was made in Australia, and 152,000 tons was imported. We need 2S0,000 tons of paper a year to meet our normal consumption. So, in 1947-48 we were short by 75,000 tons of what we required to carry on. Australian capacity to absorb locally manufactured paper, would he roughly 227,000 tons above whatever quantity was necessary to supply rayon, cellulose, celluloid, paint and lacquers in addition to what was already produced in Australia. The establishment of works to deal with wood fibres and the conversion of timber into the products I have mentioned would lead Sir Earle Page. to the establishment of industries which would have to be near the sites from which they drew their raw materials and would require a substantia] amount of water to enable them to operate. These developments would necessarily lead to decentralized industries, the operation of which would require the development of « considerable .amount of power, which would in turn enable other industries to be set up in the same region. At the present time in Australia, timber is converted mainly to building materials or firewood. Only about 10 per cent, of forest timbers are actually utilized. Only one in three of the trees of any .good forest can' be used because of the fact that many trees are not straight, but if there were a combination of saw-milling associated with the manufacture of paper pulp and cent, or 70 per cent of Australia's total bulk of timber. That would eliminate tremendous waste. If & system of reafforestation were carried into effect as well as a system of -rotation in the use of timbers it would be found that, as a result of extra care and improved technique, it would be possible to treble the total production of timber in The this country and so estahlish permanent industries associated with country districts. There are only a limited number of valuable timbers in Australia and of timber belts of such magnitude as -would permit the establishment of any big undertaking in the manufacture of paper pulp and rayon, both of which require at least 100,000 tons of wood a year at the outset. Of the f OUT most valuable sites one is in Tasmania, where by reason of heavy rainfall and humid conditions the growth of timber is exceptionel and the re-growth of timber already cut down is relatively fast. Two of the other districts are on the north coast of New South Wales, particularly on the Clarence River and the Clarence-Macleay plateau, and the fourth is in northern Queensland. In each of these places there is Toughly available in one location about 1,000,000 acres of heavily timbered country that would be of extraordinary value in establishing undertakings. The position on the Clarence River ha6 been examined by the Forestry Department of New South Wales, which has found that if a 60-year rotation scheme were adopted it would be possible to cut no less than 1,600,000 tons of timber every year and that that amount would be increased with the progress of reafforestation and as a result of proper -care being taken of the plantation. A similar programme would also be of -extraordinary value in Papua and New Guinea, where there are not only very dense forests but also extraordinary opportunities for the development of water power. Australia would be able to establish big industries there and would not have to sell timber concessions. It could put those natural assets, into use and -create: permanent employment. The development of these industries on a comprehensive ' scale sufficient to supply the: ever-growing' needs of Australia, would ensure tbe proper care and protection of OUT forests. If a very definite policy of forest conservation weTe adopted it would be found, as it has been found in other countries, that conservation and development of forests-would not only preserve the' timber supply but would alsoprevent soil erosion and limit flood 1 damage as well as the silting up -of streams and dams. also undoubtedly retard the progress of heavy floods to the lower reaches of the various rivers. During the last few years we have seen terrific floods in the northern rivers of New. South Wales, particularly the Richmond and the Clarence, and there is no doubt that the denudation of the hill country in the' upper reaches of these rivers has been largely responsible for the severity 1 and rapidity of these repeated inundations. There are several outstanding types of timber on the sites where this development could take place and the needs of Australia iri wood pulp for the manufacture of paper, rayon and plastics are sufficiently great to necessitate that development. In Tasmania, for instance, there are at least 1,000,000 acres of first-class forest land available foithese purposes' out of the 1,853,000 acres of forest reserves in that State. Three hundred thousand acrea have been leased to the Australian Paper Mills and 500,000 acres to the Burnie interests. In 1944-45 the Australian Paper Mills made 30,000 tons of newsprint and that company hopes by 1952 to develop its plant so that it will he able to manufacture about 80,000 tons of newsprint annually. The Burnie project is producing at present 30j000 tons of better class paper but even for the production of that paper it is necessary to import £2,000,000 worth of long-fibred pulp. In the north coast of New South Wales, in northern Queensland and New Guinea, the juxtaposition of soft woods or scrub timbers and eucalypts makes' possible the development not merely of a shortfibred but. also of a l'ong-fibred paper pulp industry. An examination has been made of the scrub timbers of those areas. Some 30 years ago I submitted 17 tons of these timbers to the distinguished scientists Messrs. Baker and Smith of 1 the Sydney Technological Museum, both of whom have international reputations. They found that no less than thirteen of the most common scrub timbers, which probably constitute about 60 per cent, of the total volume' of the timber, had a long microscopic fibre length almost identical with the spruce' and hemlock from' which mechanical pulp is manufactured in Canada, the United States and Sweden, It would and that the other timbers in the area have also very valuable qualities for' the manufacture of chemical pulp. Both kind's of timbers were found to have extraordinarily good felting properties'. I desire to put on record the names of some of the timbers to which I refer because I hope that the Minister himself will realize the importance of this matter and ensure that before the distinguished scientist whom I have mentioned leaves the country arrangements will be made to enable him to make a thorough examination of the whole subject. The thirteen scrub timbers which are the most promising are: Beech, blackjack, colonial pine, silky oak, butter wood, cherry wood, sassafras, rosewood, melion wood, maple, coach wood, crow's foot elm and watergum. As well as those there are other timbers suitable for the production of either chemical or mechanical paper pulp. It is satisfactory to know that the two scientists whose namesI have just mentioned stated that the fibres of numerous North American paper pulp manufacture lar to Australian other mention in that respect are: Cork wood, cudgerie, blue fig, kurrajong, iron wood, scrub ash, chinaman's cedar, white cedar, brown cedar, brown beech, poplar, scrub stringy bark, nettle tree and black apple. The cellulose content of these timbers is also very high and beside them there is a very big stand of eucalypts, especially of flooded gum and blackbutt which stand in an almost solid forest. Those are, in their physical and microscopic characters and paper pulping qualities, almost identical with the big trees in Tasmania from which such good paper has been made. If the development of the Clarence River which [ have been urging for many years and whicli is now being examined by the Australian Government and the Governments of New South Wales and Queensland were carried into effect, there would be some 300 miles of navigable water into the heart of those timber areas, which would give us exactly similar conditions for the establishment of the paper pulp industry as obtain in Canada and the United States of America. There are two things that the Government can do which would enable Australia to make, enormous savings in the huge dollar imports represented by paper. The first is to make certain that the distinguished cellulose expert who has been brought to Australia for a special commercial purpose shall report on these timbers in northern New South Wales and northern Queensland, and the second is to do everything the completion of the experts' report on the Clarence River scheme and establish the undertaking itself. Such actions would ensure that the timber industry opinion, at least the third industry in order of national importance. establishment would help materially in our international position at all times, but especially during the next few years when it is expected that the dollar position of the whole of the British Empire will remain acute. The establishment of this industry would enable Australia Sir Earle Page. to secure the essential imports which timbers used for would make it possible to provide avocaare simitions to absorb thousands of migrants. I timbers. The again emphasize the point that thetimbers which I wish to physical conditions associated with this industry are such that it must be established on the site of the raw materials and must therefore cause a concentration of population away from the big cities, and will thereby lead to the establishment throughout various parts of Australia of huge new centres of population and of manufacturing enterprises which will energize life, production and culture and l if t the standard of living in those areas. Defence, Minister for Post-war Reconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) [10.45] I am always interested when the right honourable member for Cowper( Sir Earle Page) deals with problems relating to thedevelopment of water schemes in that part of northern New South Wales which he represents. I do not know for how long the right honourable gentleman has been a member of the Australian Parliament, but I do know that he has been a member of it for many years. For a long period, he was Treasurer of the Commonwealth. I do not think that he was successful in that office, and, in fact, I understand that one of his own colleagues dubbed him the "" tragicTreasurer "". It seems curious that the right honourable gentleman, who has had innumerable opportunities Earlier, the Chair insisted that the possible to hasten honourable member for Reid should confine his remarks to the Estimates of the departments before the committee. I submit that the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction ( Mr Dedman) has made would become, in my no pretence of relating his remarks to the Estimates now under consideration, and Its that, accordingly, his speech is out of order.

398,Mr Mcewen,"I rise to order..Mr DE .MAS -The right honourable member for Cowper referred to the development of the Clarence Eiver project. Development in my department has made and is still pursuing investigations into that scheme. Because of that, I submit that my remarks are related to the departments now under discussion. During all the time that the right honourable member for Cowper has been a member or a Minister in the Parliament, he has not taken any steps to develop the water resources of Sew South Wales. Sir order, I submit that the Minister's statement is deliberately untrue. I established the Nymboida hydro-electric scheme, which served an area of some 1,500 square miles. The TEMPOEAEY CHAIEMAN Order! That is not a point of order. It is more like a personal explanation. gentleman is now excusing himself. What he is saying now is that there has been a certain development in the use of the waters of the Clarence Eiver. That may be true, but the right honourable gentleman should have developed the use of those waters to a much greater degree than he did when he had the opportunity to do so. so, because the Scullin Government would not allow me to do so. New South Wales, up to 1941 if I remember aright, a government of the same political complexion as the right honourable gentleman was in office in New South Wales. Therefore, if the neglect of the Clarence Eiver waters scheme was the fault of the New South Wales Government, it was the fault of a government formed by the political party to which the right honourable gentleman belongs. He talks about the development of these schemes now that he is a back-bencher, but when he had an opportunity to do something about it, he failed to take advantage of it. The right honourable member for Cowper also said that there is in this country a Scandinavian timber expert. I am not certain whether the right honourable gentleman is confusing him with a German scientist, who was sent The Division of Industrial to Australia by the technical mission in Germany, which functions under the Division of Industrial Development. gentleman concerned was a Scandinavian. dinavian timber expert in Australia. I know nothing about him. I do know, however, that there is in Australia a German scientist who was brought here under the auspices of the technical misthe Division of Industrial Development in my department. This person is an expert in timber generally and particularly in the use of timber for paper pulp purposes. He is one of a number of German scientists brought here by the Government. I wish to draw attention to the great service rendered to industry generally in this country by this Government in establishing the technical mission in Germany and in obtaining the services of some 50 German scientists. The visits of these German scientists were assisted very materially by my colleague, the Minister for Immigration ( Mr Calwell), because it is his department which screens these men to ensure that they shall not be of a type we would like to prevent from entering Australia because of their political ideals. The Government is to be congratulated oh the steps it has taken to obtain the services of these scientists. The technical mission in Germany was also responsible for obtaining as reparations valuable capital and tooling equipment. A good deal of this equipment has already been brought to Australia. Some of it has been sold by auction to certain companies, and some has been leased under certain conditions. One of the items of equipment obtained through the technical mission in Germany, which is of great importance to Australian industry, is a big press which has been set up in the electorate so ably represented by yourself, Mr Temporary Chairman, in Newcastle. . Arrangements have been made for the press to be available for the purposes of industry generally.

I propose now to deal with the matter raised by the honourable member for Maranoa( Mr Adermann). examine the representations I have made. gentleman may rest assured that while the German timber expert remains in Australia he will do everything the Government wishes him to do to assist in the development of our timber resources. If tbe Government desires him to go to Queensland, northern New South Wales, Tasmania, or anywhere else in Australia, to undertake investigations, it will good chance of success, it is well see that those investigations are undertaken. I may mention at this stage that two of the German scientists brought here are experts in the brown coal industry. They have visited four of the States and have made very valuable reports on the hrown coal deposits there. These reports are now under consideration by the various State governments aaid as a result I believe that valuable developments will take place in the brown coal industry in the States concerned. I turn now to the question raised hy the honourable member for Maranoa. The honourable gentleman, complained about what he termed the slowness of the application of the scheme for the land settlement >of ex-servicemen in Queensland. I have no very detailed figures in relation to .Queensland, but I .shall quote some as I proceed. I have quite a lot of information about the .settlement of ex-servicemen throughout Australia, which I shall be pleased to make available ,to the committee. At the present time the number of holdings approved by the Commonwealth throughout the whole of Australia is 2,760. Up .to the end of August last, approved holdings that have been allocated by the various States total 1,706. There is a considerable margin between the number of holdings that have been approved by the Commonwealth and the number that have been allocated by the respective States. that to be regarded as a criticism of the State governments, which are doing a very excellent job in the field of land settlement of ex-servicemen generally, although there has been some criticism of what are alleged to be delays in the land settlement of ex-servicemen generally. My own point of view in the matter is that it is very much better to go slowly and make sure of what is being done rather than to proceed too fast and havo all the confusion and chaos that resulted from soldier settlement proposals put forward after the first war. The soldier settlement schemes which were introduced by anti-Labour governments when they were in office in this country after the first world war were a ghastly failure. Eveni f it takes a little longer to make sure that the ex-serviceman on this occasion will nave a worthwhile oui taking the extra time. 1 To make certain that ex-servicemen will have a reasonably good chance of success on this occasion, the Commonwealth has undertaken schemes of rural training in different States throughout the Commonwealth and the number of ex-servicemen who have .applied for those courses, or who are undergoing rural training under this scheme, is 3,127. settle ex-servicemen in the Northern Territory ? Commonwealth of the land settlement of ex-servicemen, up to the end of August this year, has been £12,281,000. Two forms of assistance to such settlers are provided hy the Australian Government. One is the general scheme. The honorable member for Indi( Mr McEwen) would not himself like to settle in the Northern Territory, but he may at some time or otlier inform the committee how he acquired the right of possession of a soldier settlement proposition after the first war. about that. teresting to hear how he was able to obtain land for the purpose of soldier settlement after the .first world war, and how I do not want the honourable member manages to get irrigation channels on his property.",103,Eable Page O N A Point Of Sion In Germany Which Is Sponsored By

411,Mr Htjt'chiwsow (Deakin) [11.5],"but, of course, arrived too late, and all the records were destroyed. there any reason to wonder that the government of a friendly nation such as the United States of America should hesitate to entrust secrets authorities, when a laboratory, in which important defence investigations were being conducted, was left unguarded? Any doubts which have been entertained about the Council for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch might well be entertained also about the Government itself, because the Council for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch is, after all, merely a government instrumentality and is under government control. At the present time, we are engaged in a cold war with Eussia. It is needless to point out that there is in every democratic country a fifth column at work which, as the Premier of Belgium, Mr Spaak, said, makes Hitler's fifth columns look like an organization of boy scouts. The Communists' fifth columns work in two ways. First, they work through the big industrial unions, particularly those which are engaged in heavy and transport activities; and secondly, as was demonstrated and the United States of America, they research activities being carried on in the interests of defence. The fire at the Melbourne University occurred this morning, but no reference has been made to it in the Parliament until now. Has the Government instituted an inquiry into the fire? The Chief Fire Officer said that he was certain that there was no sinister significance about the fire, although it is the third which has occurred recently at the Melbourne University. ground did he make that statement? Such an accident could occur only because the building was not, so far as we are aware, guarded at the time. There have been too many similar incidents recently. Only a little while ago, a theft occurred from a defence establishment at Mangalore, in my electorate. I have no doubt that that establishment, also, was not sufficiently guarded. A quantity of small arms ammunition was taken, and on another occasion some grenades disappeared from Mr Hutchinson. -a defence establishment. ""What sort of Is Government is this defence Government, which is betraying the trust to Australian government of the people. If the laboratory at the University of Melbourne could be burnl down because no one was on guard, it was equally possible for the records to have been stolen from the building. Apparently, the work which was being done at the laboratory was part of an Empire research programme, and it' is possible that the destruction of the records mighi delay the work at other Empire research establishments for years. Defence, Minister for Post-war Beconstruction and Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Eesearch) [11.13] I did see the reporl in this evening's press about the fire in the grounds of the University .of Melbourne. Of course, it was an unfortunate incident in that a valuable building and valuable equipment were destroyed. However, if industries the honourable member had been listening when I was speaking two nights ago, he in Canada would have heard me say that the experiments being conducted at this laboratory endeavour to infiltrate into had no connection whatever with defence. This is merely another example of how the press endeavours to create the impression that all scientific research in Australia, is connected with defence. 1 do not know what Professor Martin if alleged to have said; but I do know that those experiment's were undertaken at the University of Melbourne, because they are of no defence significance al all. I have said that defence scientific research is a matter for the Defence On what Department; and there were sufficient defence projects being undertaken in this country. The set of experiments at the University of Melbourne was not one of the projects sponsored by the Defence Department. Those experiments were part of a series of experiments undertaken in fundamental research into nuclear energy generally with the objecl of training sufficient men to develop an atomic or nuclear energy stock-pile in this country should we at any time require it.

However, the Government believed that it should finance those experiments for the purpose I have indicated. I am not aware whether the buildings were guarded. If that was necessary, that was the responsibility of the university authorities. There was no necessity to place any guard on the buildings from a security point of view. ""What is involved in these experiments is well known to physicists throughout the world. They involve nothing that is secret. Therefore, there was no necessity to make any security arrangements at the buildings or in connection with the experiments. Furthermore,' in relation to the experiments undertaken no information of a secret nature was sought, or received, from the United States of America or from E say that the responsibility for guarding the buildings was the responsibility of the university authorities, [ am not in any way criticizing those authorities. No doubt, they took what they deemed to he reasonable precautions against fire h azard. Buti n spite of all precautions, unfortunately, fires do sometimes break out. This fire was most unfortunate.

House adjourned at 11.24 p.m. The followmg answers to questions were circulated:the honourable member for Bourke( Mrs. Blackburn) asked me the following questions:(a) Whether Australia was one of the four nations which voted against equality of opportunity for women at a recent meeting .of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations ?",106,Adjouenment
415,Motion (By Mr Scully ) Agreed To,,107,Status Of Women
416,Mr Chifley,"On the 15th September,(6) If a. report, to tliis: effect is true, what explanation is givenfor this action on the part of Australia? (c) What other nations took similar action? (d) What Australian women or what organizations of women were, consulted on this most important subject? (e) Was an Australian woman appointed to attend this meeting of the Human Rights -Commission and didany Australian woman have an opportunity to speak, on. this matter? I now advise the honourable member as follows:(a) No. Australia was one of the four nations which abstained on a resolution concerning equal economic rights for men and women discussed by the Human Rights Committee of the Economic and Social Council in -Geneva last June. (6) The Australian attitude was mis>reported by tlie press. The Australian representative on. the committee considered that the -resolution, which had been submitted for approval to the Economic and Social Council by the Commission, on the Status of Women, was vague and likely to be ineffectual. He; therefore, proposed Uiatit be referred back to the -commission for moreprecise definition. This proposal was put in tlie form of a resolution!, but was defeated by nine votes to five(Australia, tlie Netherlands, New Zealand', the United Kingdom aind the United States-)-. Presumably this vote waa confused by the. press with the original resolution, which was carried with nine votes in favour. 1 (o) New Zealand', the United Kingdom and the United States, as. well as Australia, recorded abstemious, on. this resolution. (</) Mrs. Jessie Street was the Australian -delegate to tlic Second Session of the' Commission on the Status of Women which met at New York last January and a t whicli the resolution under discussion was iramed'. The resolutionwas referred by the Commission on the Status of Women to tlie Economic and Social Council. (e) Therewas. no, Australian woman member in the Australian delegation to the Seventh 'Session of the Economic and Social Council which met recently at Geneva. UNBRA: DISTRIBUTION OF SUPPLIES; -the honourable member for Beid( Mr to their disposal. These surplus vessels were Lang) asked me whether I would(a) Disclose the source, of the information on which the Prime Minister based a letter to him last December, arising from questions regarding the fishing vessels suppliedto China from Australia, in which he stated, ""Those vessels which have been engaged in off-shore fishing operations have; for 'the most part, given a fair account of themselves""? (ii) Inform the House whether Australia was. represented on theControl Committee administering -these supplies, and,, if so, by whom ? (c) Obtain from the Leader of the Parliamentary Delegation a detailed report on his investigations' into Unrra while inChina amd table it in the House? I now advise the honourable member as fblTows:(a) Information regarding the disposal in China of fishing vessels given by Australia through Unrra, supplied to Mr Lang in a letter dated the 14th November,, 1947, was based on reports from Australian officials in Nanking and Shanghai and also on a letter d'a-ted the 29th September, 1947, to the Australian. Commercial Counsellor, Shanghai, from M x Harlan Cleveland, Directorof Unrra's office, in China. The report that "" those vessels which have been engaged in off-shore fishing operations have for the most part given a fair account of themselves "" was quoted from Mr Clevel'andfs'letter: Reports received recentlyhave not been, favorable. Thefact that dismantling and conversion! of the boats,, referred to in my previous letter,, had to be undertaken on their arrival in China, is in itsel'f evidence ofinsufficient, preparation! for thefisheries project. Apart from this, reports have been received from tlie Australian Commercial Counsellor, Mr A. N . Wootton, that resistance by the' Shanghai Fish Marketing Guild' has prevented) f u l l utilization, of the vessels. The guild has. resisted! marketing of fish by the Fisheries Rehabilitation Administration, because of the effect of marketing on prices and it is understood that the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has found it 1 difficult to resist effectively guild pressure. The result has been, that large catches of fish have apparently been left to deteriorate, and criticism has been levelled at both the guild and the Ministry of the Unrra Director General. TheCommercial Counsellor has at all times, firstly, as Australian representative on the Committee of the Unrra Council for the Far East and then as a member of the Board1 : of Trustees of the Chinese Rehabilitation Administration., pressed for theeffective utilization of the vessels and the proper disposal of Fisheries Rehabilitation Administration assets. Fir this, lie has, of course, recognized the close Australian! interest in the fisheries' project deriving from our large contribution. It now appears clear that approximately 40 Australian vessels and twenty American vessels are surplus to the needs of tlie Fisheries Administration, and' consideration has been given 1 put up for sale in July, but could not be sold at reasonable prices. There is some possibility of leasing the vessels to oriental fisheries interests as an alternative to outright sale but the chances of reaching an effective solution along these lines do not at this stage appear to be good. A possible further alternative is to sell the vessels outside China, although the legality of such a move is doubtful and",107,Status Of Women
417,Mr Chifley,"On the 9thSeptember,most be carefully examined before any action taken. So long as the surplus vessels remain idle, deterioration roust be considerable and the Board of Trustees, with the strong and active support o i the Australian member, iB exerting every effort, to ensure that the period ol idleness iB reduced to a minimum. (6) Mr Wootton represented Australia in aa official capacity, on the Unrra Council's Committee for the Far East. W it h the termination of Unrra thia committee ceased to exist, and tlie distribution of remaining Unrra. supplies is now being handled by the Chinese Rehabilitation Committee The work of this committee is supervised by an International Board of Trustees -of the Administration and Mr Wootton is serving in a. personal capacity on this board. <o) Tbe Shanghai and the Embassy in Nanking are keeping thc government informed of the manner in which relief supplies are being distributed in China and an up-to-date report on the use to be made of the fishing vessels from Australia is expected shortly j r o m the Commercial Counsellor, .Shanghai. Commerce and Agriculture, . upon notiee.1. Is there in operation an equalization fund for hides and/or tallow into which is paid by exporters the difference between local and export prices; if -so, what amounts' are held by tihe -Government in this fund? 2. 'Have any amounts been -distributed to exporters from this f u n d ; -rf so, how much was distributed and when wae the distribution made, in each case? honourable member's questions are as follows:1. The Australian Hide and Leather Industries 'Board administers a marketing scheme for hides and -leather which -involves a form of equalization, ..while a voluntary-equalization arrangement .is operated by the tallow trade in respect of tallow. No moneys .arc .held by the Government or paid into government revenue in respect of 'these schemes. The Hide and Leather Boards funds at present show a net credit o i approximately £71,000. 1 am informed that the amount standing to the credit of No. 4 Tallow Pool is approximately £696,000. '2. Distributions are not made to exporters. En fact the moneys in both funds are obtained by icollectiuns from exporters., In the case of hides payments are made .from tbe fund to the persons from whom hides are acquired by ffcc hoard and, in fhe case of tallow, manufacturers only are -entitled to receive distributions fro m the pool.
