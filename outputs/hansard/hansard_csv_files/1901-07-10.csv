20,Mr Speaker.,"I would direct the atthink tliat if the amendment had been moved without debate no objection could have been reasonably taken to it . The honourable member for Bland was right in calling attention to the fact that unopposed business must be taken without debate, because otherwise much time might be expended on private members' business contrary to the intention of the standing orders. difficulty may arise from this practice, inasthrough the business paper and through the much as the House may be precluded by some arrangement to which it is no party from discussing certain motions. that if any honourable member desires to debate an unopposed motion it must at once stand over until private members' business is called on. that there shall be no debate does not necessarilyexclude amendments. If amendments are proposed, they cannot be considered without explanation and debate. That is the very thing to be avoided, because it involves the delay of business which is on the business paper. this point. The understanding on which the Government consents not to oppose a motion is that the motion remains in the same form. If the motion is amended, or a proposition of amendment is made, it becomes then a question whether the Government can, on its own motion, maintain the question in that form. We should let in debate on amendments if that understanding were once departed from. That would be a veiy serious question-it is one that was raised earlier in the session-because it might lead to the consumption of a great deal of valuable time on Government days, although the matter could be properly dealt with on private members' days. In order to save any trouble, I will say that if the honourable member who raised the question about new paragraph (4 a) will withdraw his motion and hand it to me in writing, I will have the return prepared so as to include the particulars he wishes. plain whether there is any standing order which governs questions unopposed 1 the only one. posed by the Government, or unopposed by the House? Mr, BARTON I think the standing orders refer to motions unopposed by the Government. There is, in tlie State from which Iand the right honourable ancl learned member for East Sydney come, a preceding form of ascertaining whether a motion is opposed-it is just as well to mention the matter now-unde r which the Speaker goes list of notices of motions, no matter how many notices there may be, and ascertains whether any are . objected to. Those not objected to are passed without debate, and the others remain for discussion. well to settle the matter now. W it h the approval of the House, in the future, whenever an honourable member rises to debate or amend a motion on the unopposed list, the debate will at once stand adjourned. petent for any honourable member to object to a motion 1 if a member rises to debate or amend a motion, that motion will at once stand over and lose its position as unopposed business. The standing orders do not define what is "" unopposed business,"" and there is some difficulty in exactly interpreting this particular standing order. But for the future it will be interpreted in the way I have indicated. Question resolved in the affirmative. Mr G. B. EDWARDS (South Sydney).

I wish to congratulate my right viduals. Some persons carry tlieir fiscal honourable and learned friend the Minister views so far that a Customs badge is held for Trade and Customs on the generous to be sufficient proof of a right to clomanner in which he acknowledged the things which no other person in the King's, labours, of the officers of his department. dominions is allowed to do. That is an acknowledgment whicli is feel that in this discussion we ought tosometimes omitted in cases in which it eliminate altogether the fiscal question ought to be made, and I rather admire we ought to deal with this Bill entirely the attitude of the Minister, who is not apart from any view of fiscal policy; weashamed to acknowledge his indebtedness ought to aim at a Bill which will be abto the officers of his department. A t fche solutely fair both to the Crown on the one same time, with characteristic humility, my hand, and to individuals who may happenright honourable and learned friend omitted all to come in conflict with the Crown on the reference to himself.

But making that fair adoccasion to administer Customs Acts, and I mission, I am bound to say, as the result of must say .1 have never hacl the good fortune, the inspection which I have been able toin Australia, at any rate, to see Customs make of this Bill, that it seems to nie to go provisions expressed in such direct language. very much further than any law tliat I am One of the results, of course, of a Bill aware of in connection with the administraframed by Collectors of Custonis is that sort tion of Custonis.

I wish now only offence, this Bill with very rare tenderness fco select one or two of the most important admits that it will not be the duty of the clauses, because we ought to recognise that person accused to establish his innocence, our useful labours will probably begin when But I In fact, in this department we Persons who have to deal with which a man may be charged some of what seem to be the too drastic proi we are in committee. which 'raises any very great principle in itself. Whatever aiiay, be -the fiscal policy of ithe Commonwealth, a -Bill of this -sort -will -be necessary. will be inoperative, ibut the Bill will ,be -equally necessary whatever the Tariff of the Commonwealth may .be,-so* that there is no large principle involved in the second reading of 'the measure. T-here is nothing in this Bill which I think ^is . not in our Customs Regulation Bills, or .which would callon the House to seriously consider the question -of negativing .the motion for the second residing. Consequently I do not intend to. 'take up the time .of the House by any reference to matters of i detail which oan 'be .fairly dealt with in committee. But in ,the first place I do hope 'that we shall have -theassistance in committee of -some honourable members who are familiar -with the -workingof such Acts, not only as they affect ithe Customs authorities, but as they affect the trading .interests 'of the <ports -of Australia. certain extent the remark will mot be accepted universally, -with certain qualifications .it may -be so -accepted, that 'beyond the -requirements -of the fiscal -policy of the no Jionorable'member, either of the Eederal Government .or :of this House, desires :to throw .unnecessary obstacles'in' the way -of the transactions »of commerce. know, tlie-more .difficult the operations of ; --commerce are -the miore expensive -the -results ure likely-to be to the-<great mass of the .people of the -community. putting -aside all .fiscal differences for a time, I suppose we all desire to unite -in. an endeavour to -make this law as just and .as little of a-meddlesome character as we possibly can. I wish to refer first to what I conceive to be the clause which will raise the most difficult and important question-in connection with the Bill, namely, clause 257. When the .Minister for Trade and Customs was in .his most able -and lucid manner giving this House a bird's-eye view of the scope and character of the measure I ventured to interject a 'remark of which he apparently .approved, that instead of a resolution of the House the collection .of Customs duties when the Budget speech had been delivered in this House, 'perhaps an amendment might .be made to the effect that upon the delivery of the Budget speech, without any resolution Mi: Seid. This, is not a Bill the duties might be collected -Obviously, that, seemed to .be at first sight the most .convenient course. ThisBill -first came into my hands at the time tlie right JionorSome of the ;clauses, perhaps, able-gentleman was delivering his speech, and I bad not-Jiad .time for ireflection. But after an interval for reflection, I-began to perceive -that there are some very serious difficulties in connection with thematterthat -it is not so easy of solution as it appeared -to me to be. In the first place the difficulty arises whether thei duties-embodied in a Budget speech, -.and which might be collected -next tmorning, -would in their collection amount to the imposition of uniform-duties -within the meaning of the Constitution Act. If bhey would-and indeed Lam afraid if they would not -ther e would .still remain some veiy -serious questions to consider. As we know, the right of imposing duties is not a right which can-be exercised -on the statement -of a Minister delivered in this House. The proper basis for collection-of -such duties is Of course, 'to a the-authorization of law. Eirst, as to any difficulties-whicli may arise as .to-the time though I tliink at which the Tariff was submitted, I-ought to point out what perhaps is perfectly familiar already to the Government, namely, that Commonwealth if this Tariff statement -is .not -made at a very,early.periodj-weishalLbedriven.on to a time about Christmas,-when it will -be-simply impossible, if there ibe..airy -difficulties at As .we -all, to arrive .at. a -legal settlement-of those .difficulties-that is to .say arrive at a Tariff Act-'befor e the Christmas-pro rogation. If the-duties are to becollected for an inTherefore, definite periodj-under a mere statement of the finance Minister,-honorablermembers will see that, from the veiy'pressure of circumstances and'Owing to.the expiration-of the time, the free .discretion of tliis House and the proper constitutional rights -ofanother Chamber .may absolutely go by default. They will see that a situation might arise-of imere delay, which -would make it impossible to exercise in a full and fair waythe judgment either of this'Or of any other House -upon the Tariff. I begiiv-to see, therefore, that the suggestion which I threw out is one -to which 1 am not prepared to. adhere at present. I see the very-serious difficulty of the matter, because, authorizing assuming that the Tariff proposed by the Treasurer were not ultimately successful, all the powers of the States-to cany on Tariff legislation, or even the State Tariffs which were in force at the time the Budget speech was delivered would, on a certain interpretation of the effect of a Budget statement, have disappeared. Thus-, we should neither have a Commonwealth Customs Tariff nor a State Customs Tariff. Honourable members will see that if on the statement of the Treasurer the duties are collected next morning, and if tliat is taken to be the imposition-withi n the meaning of the Constitution Act-of uniform duties, the State Tariffs and the State powers over such matters have gone, and gone for ever. -member think tliat that would be the interpretation ? portance that we cannot very well leave it in doubt. There are a great many matters which we can leave in doubt, but tliis seems to be one which is too serious altogether to be left in that condition. It suggests -itself to me as a very serious difficulty which consider. I will not say any .more in reference to it , but I thought -it necessary to say what I think, in order to qualify the interjection which I made. There is another matter which is perhaps not of very great importance in the view of this House, but which I think will acquire considerable importance in view of the interests and convenience of the steamship companies who do business upon the Australian coastI allude of course to the provisions of clause 121. I believe that at first there was considerable consternation aroused owing to a misapprehension as to the f u l l scope of this clause. 'The first passengers who embark ;at Inter-State impression amongst some of the shipping authorities was -that under this Billi t was proposed ipractically to seal up the ships' stores when vessels were trading between Inter-State ports, but as any one who studies the clause can perceive, that is not the proposal of the Bill. the Bill is that a certain allowance should be made out of the ships' stores for what may be considered the fair requirements both of the crew .and passengers between Inter-State ports. I suppose that the authority who prescribed the allowance would be at .liberty to prescribe an allowance which would cover the whole movements of the ship from tlie time it arrived at the first Australian port until the time when it reached its port of destination within the Commonwealth. I suppose that could be done. There was mo intention on the part of the Minister to deprive ships of their usual or proper allowance of ships' stores for crews and passengers on the coast. means "" prescribed by the Act."" able member look, atfcheinterpretation ?

REID -Consequentl y the action of the Minister must be :taken to. .mean that in this particular case the word "" prescribed "" means ""prescribed by regulation."" I do not suppose that the Minister would undertake to prescribe in tlie Act for a matter of this sort. I suppose there -are two things aimed.at in this clause : one is ;to levy duties upon ships' stores which are consumed by ports. for charging duties on stores which are consumed in Australian waters or between Australian ports. The proposal of consumed by the sliips' crews 1 further than I anticipated. to treat those who trade only within the States differently.

I am not speaking of a harbour when I talk about a ship that is within the three miles' limit of our coast.

Newcastle. if the ship is within the three miles' limit. Sir not sell liquor within a harbour now. think tliat the twelve policemen .who have drawn this Bill-the Customs ofncialshave been annoyed-ver y properly annoyed to a certain extent-by an abuse of the consumption of ships' stores while vessels are at anchor, particularly upon Sundays. The mail steamers anchor at the Williamstown Pier, and I believe that upon Sundays particularly there has been a great deal of evasion of the proper intention of the law with reference to ships' stores, and that a considerable trade is being done in intoxicating liquors, not with the passengers, but with people who are merely visitors to the ships. This is a matter which has troubled the minds of the Customs people a great deal. It is to meet abuses of that sort that this clause is principally directed. But I think that there is nothing which I do not know that the we can do that can take away the rights of the oflieers, crew, or passengers of a ship coming from some place beyond the Commonwealtli, to their freedom as to ships' stores, as well as to navigation when I contend that when a man they are beyond the limits of our jurisdiction. The Imperial Government were carefulI think I am right in saying so-to alter a clause which we put in the forefront of our Constitution so as to make it perfectly clear that the Commonwealth should have no jurisdiction over ships whose first port of clearance was not within the Commonwealth. They did not insist on the alteration. They tried to get the alteration, but abandoned it. tains the words which I have mentioned. posed alteration. My right honourable friend their abandoning any objection which they might have had, because the clause itself seems fairly to protect the interests of Imperial shipping. Section5 of the Constitution provides that the laws of the Commonwealth shall be in force only on British ships whose first port of clearance and whose port of destination are in the Commonwealth. Now the first port of clearance of, say, foreign-going steamers from the old countiy is certainly not within the Commonwealth. The word "" first"" is put in with some meaning. The"" whose first port of clearance and whose I understood so ; still I port of destination are within the Commonwealth.""

113,,"Mr Reid -No doubt; -but still Iand this clause contains a provision which is necessary to check that practice. I observe, however, that it differs from other legislation of the kind with which I am acquainted, inasmuch as the matter is put entirely into the hands of the Minister. In Other Customs Acts, this power is given to the Collector of Customs, to be exercised subject to the approval of the Governor in Council, and personally I prefer that in this case the power should be given to the Collector of Customs rather than to the Minister. exercised by the collector, but the act would be a Ministerial act. Mx. REID worth considering, and that it would be more satisfactory to every one concerned if the power were exercised by the Governor General in Council, which means by the Ministry acting upon the report or advice of the Collector of Customs. The matter, however, is not of^much importance. There is, however, a matter of considerable importance to which I shall now refer. As I understand the Bill, the Minister may in some matters determine finally questions in dispute between the Customs department and any person having business with that department; while, in other cases, if the person who has the dispute with the department does not bring an action against it within four months, he is to be taken to have admitted that the Minister's decision was right. method of procedure, if any other is feasible. In some of the States, they have had boards of commissioners, and the person at difference with the Customs has had the option, instead of going to an expensive tribunal such as a court of law, of going before seems so much in the-minds of those who these boards, which are generally composer] of three business men, who make inquiries and arrive at a decision without the usual legal formalities. Although1 admit that these boards have not been used very much in the past, I suggest to my right honourable friend that it would be a better provision to give the option of something short of litigation in a court of law to persons who have had a dispute with the department. Speaking generally, there is no appeal against adecigentlemen who suffer considerably from sion except by a resort to litigation, and even that appeal is denied in many cases. The Minister spoke the other night about the forfeitures which are provided in the Bill being usual; but some of them are very startling. For instance, here is a condition under which a ship worth, perhaps, £50,000 or £60,000, shall become forfeit to the Governmen tAny ship found within 1 league of the coast failing to bring to for boarding upon being lawfully required to do so shall be forfeited to His Majesty. That is to say, that if the 'captain of a ship which is within 3 miles of the coast does not bring his vessel to when the Customs flag is hoisted, it sliall be forfeited. There is no option. Mr O'MALLEY -That is tyranny. we are not mucli accustomed as applied to I think the provision is our own people. We do not apply that sort of law to Australians, but I suppose that any sort of law is good enough for any one who is not an Australian. Clause 214 also provides that a ship shall be forfeited to His Majesty forHovering within .1 league of the coast and not departing within twelve hours after being ""required to depart by an officer. That provision reminds one of the old stirring times when lawful authority was armed at every point. A vessel is not to hover in a light breeze within 3 miles of the coast for twelve hours after being required to depart, without being compulsorily forfeited to His Majesty. This is rather a startling way of introducing the favourite idea of some people that ships which come from abroad are a curse. They are a great ThatI think is an objectionable blessing if they .come from abroad empty, to carry onr goods away at double freights, but they are a great curse if they come from abroad full, so that they can charge only single freights for the Australian products which they take away. That view drafted the Bill that a ship which hovers within a league of the coast for twelve hours, after being required to depart hy an officer, is to be forfeited. Then there are a number of cases in which goods shall be forfeited to His Majesty. All goods in respect to which bulk is unlawfully broken shall be so forfeited. We know that bulk is often unlawfully broken on a voyage, not by the consignees ,or consignors, but by thirst, and have a tendency for getting into the holds of the vessels they are on. That is an unlawful breaking of bulk.which amounts to a criminal offeneo, inasmuch as it is a robbery. But under clause 215, the goods",23,Malcolm Mceacharn The Y Can Section Clearly Puts The Position Iri The Words
114,Mr Kingston,The power would be,24,Malcolm Mceacharn The Y Can Section Clearly Puts The Position Iri The Words
115,Mr Reid,"It is something to whichin respect to which bulk is so broken could be forfeited. The clause also provides thatAll goods whicli being subject to the control of the Customs shall be moved, altered, or interfered witli except by authority and in accordance with this Actshall be forfeited. The removal may not be authorized by the person to whom they belong, but no provision is made for a circumstance of that kind. The clause says that goods so moved shall be forfeited. Then there is another provision which suggests some difficulty. The Minister proposes, ancl very properly, to use the courts of the States for the administration of this measure; but I do not think that we are in a positiou to make use of those courts in this way without some corresponding legislation on the part of the States. The Bill assumes that we can use the State courts as if they were Commonwealth courts, and that we have the same authority to legislate for the bringing of matters before those courts as the State Legislatures have. That is a matter which I think my right honourable friends will have to look into. I doubt if we have any such power. given to us by the Constitution. the land under the section which the right honourable and learned member quoted as to the operation of the laws of the Commonwealth. have to take notice of this measure, just as much as if it were an Imperial Act. have that sort of power over the State courts. This Act, and all laws made by the Parliament of the Commonwealth under the Constitution, shall be binding on the courts, Judges, and people of every State. are binding upon the States; but there are certain things which have to be defined by court regulations, and I question whether the State courts will not resent some of the assumptions of authority made by tlie Bill in regard to these matters. There are several other clauses to which I shall refer in committee. I thoroughly sympathize with the desire of the Customs department to put down frauds. The danger of frauds in a highly protected community, is very great and very notorious. A protective policy requires a sort of code of its own, inasmuch as it breeds immorality and fraud in business communities; ancl I am prepared to make allowance for that state of things. But clause 240 provides that a person charged with fraud shall have a more lenient trial than a person against whom no imputation of fraud has been made. Where an attempt to defraud is an element in a charge, the onus of proof is upon tlie Crown; or, if an indictable offence is charged, the guilt of the defendant must be established by evidence; but, in reference to the whole range of innocent offences-innocen t in the sense that there, is no element of fraud in them jurious to the revenue. -persons not charged with fraud, or with an attempt to defraud, may be liable to penalties which, if they cannot pay them', may bring upon them a year's imprisonment, upon the mere allegation of a Customs officer that tliey have been guilty of offences under certain sections of this Act, unless they can disprove the charges made against them There may be some extraordinary necessity which requires this, but if there is any extraordinary necessity to except the ordinary rules of justice in British communities, one woulcl think it would be levelled more against those who are suspected of fraud than against those who are charged with other offences, which may be more or less innocent, against the provisions of this Bill. It seems to me an anomaly that there should be a presumption of guilt against a man, which immediately becomes a presumption of innocence, if there be an allegation that he has been guilty of fraud. That seems rather an anomalous position, having regard to the effect of the imposition of a penalty up to £200. According to clause 245 a person who is unable to pay a penalty of £200 cannot be disI understand that our laws charged until he has served an imprisonment of one year. Here is a case which may involve a year's imprisonment, and yet the man is supposed to be guilty on the mere statement in the charge made against him. That charge is proof of his guilt, and he has to set to work to disprove his own guilt. That seems to me an extraordinary way of legislating. As I say, if there is a sort of person to whom it should be applied it should be the' man who intended to defraud,",24,Malcolm Mceacharn The Y Can Section Clearly Puts The Position Iri The Words

The whole object, as I understand, is that-we may say to a court of law where the action of the department may be challenged"" We have legal warrant for doing this."" This question is not a new one. Asfar back a? the ship money case, when the king tried to collect money under the name of ""ship money,"" it was held he hacl no right to impose-those duties.

137,Mr Isaacs,"Yes; at an increased rate.one and tlie same time two customs laws, but that it was intended that the Commonwealth should make up its mind what the duties of customs should be. Until the Commonwealth has made up its mind what the uniform customs duties shall be, it is not to impose any; but the moment uniform duties of customs are imposed, then all State laws relating to this matter are to cease to have effect. If the Bill stands as ifc is, it will have a twofold effect. First of all, under section 90 of the Constitution Act, the State laws will die, and, therefore, the only duties we can collect will be collected under this Bill. But, secondly, under this Bill power will only be given, as far as the words are concerned, to collect a limited amount of duty, viz., ""duties on goods afc an increased rate ""-whatever that means-or , "" duties upon goods previously free."" So that there will be some margin left, or intended to be left untouched by this clause, an'd yet that margin will have no operation in consequence of the destruction of fche State laws by virtue of the Constitution Now, unless it can be shown that the legislative authority to collect duties is different from the legislative authority which was called the ""imposition of taxation."" provides for the imposition of duties, that must be the result. I hardly thought that the position would be contested. I have here the Library edition of Broom's Constitutional Law, and under the report of the well-known case of Bates in regard to ship-moneyHampden's case-w e find very learned notes by the author, andfchewords used from time to time are distinct about the collection and imposition of taxes. It is pointed out that whatever language is used by the King, whether it be JamesI . or CharlesI . , or any other King who tries to collect moneys from his subjects, whether he does it under the guise of loans or benevolences of ship-money or any other nomenclature, the courts liave saidfchafcfchatis an imposition of taxation which is not warranted unless sanctioned by law. Wheni t is sanctioned by law it is then the taxation of the subject with liis own consent. I find on page 371 of this work the learned note by Mr Hargrave, the editor of State Trials, who saysJamesI . claimed the right of imposing recovered the money on the ground that the duties that? first edition. the Library, bufc ifc is the same as far as I have seen. Mr Hargrave writesJamesI . claimed the righfc of imposingduties on imported and exported merchandise by prerogative. His son and immediate successor, the unfortunate Charles, nofc only persisted in tlie claim, but added fco it fche equally formidable pretension of ship-money. Realized, these claims, wifch loans, benevolences, monopolies, &c, would have comprised nearly a complete system of extraparliamentary taxation; for imposition at the ports was calculated to serve the purpose externally, ship-money to operate internally. I cite that merely to"" show that the language is exactly the same. In these old works the expressions, "" imposed taxes"" and "" imposition of taxes,"" are constantly used, and from these old works they passed into the American Constitution and into American decisions, and they have also passed into our Constitution. Then we find, on page 406Of the prerogatives respectively asserted by JamesI . and his son to impose and to levy shipmoney, each was in turn successfully resisted and annulled. There the word ""impose"" is used in the constitutional sense, and wherever Kings tried to get money out of their subjects it In their case, not having the warrant of Parliament, it was an illegal imposition. Here, under the authority of Parliament, it will be a legal imposition. Then again the word "" collection"" is well known, and on pages 39S, 399, and 401 there are considerable notes about the compulsory collection of benevolences and loans. It is ' there stated thatThe compulsory collecting of money hy the Crown, whether as a loan or a benevolence, was thus explicitly declared to be illegal. In fact, there is no distinction between the compulsory collection of money from the subject and the imposition of a tax. In the well-known case of Stevenson and the Queen, which was decided in the Victorian courts, and which is reported in 2 Wyafc, Webb, and a'Beckett, in 1865, Stevenson and Co. and a number of other firms sued the Crown to get back money that had been collected under a resolution of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria. As the session had expired without the Act being passed, they Legislative Assembly had not the power to ment had come in, and said"" It shall be The second edition is not in have been legislative authority behind the",27,Malcolm Mceacharn The Y Can Section Clearly Puts The Position Iri The Words
138,Mr Baetojt,AVhat part of tlie book is impose taxation; but if an Act of Parlia,28,Malcolm Mceacharn The Y Can Section Clearly Puts The Position Iri The Words
139,Mr Isaacs,"It is on page 371 of the lawful to collect these moneys,"" there wouldmatter, and the court would then have decided the other way. In the other case to which reference has been made-and it is the one, I think, which ray honourable friend had in his mind-the case ex parte Wallace and Co., which is reported in 13 New South Wales Law .Reports, the New South Wales Legislative Assembly, in 1891, passed the ordinary resolution. The money was collected, the firm refused to pay, the Collector of Customs refused to sign the entry and pass the goods, and the firm applied to the court for a mandamus to compel the Collector to pass the entry. The court said"" This is the constitutional practice of Parliament. You apply to us for a writ of mandamus, and as the issue of that writ is in our discretion we refuse to issue it . "" But if it had been 1 a question of legal right, there is not the slightest doubt that the Supreme Court of New South Wales would have decided precisely as did the Supreme Court of Victoria, and would have held that there was no legal power, simply because Pai-lianient did not give its sanction to'the collection of the moneys. But I should like honourable members to look at the wording of this clause and see what is going to happen. Power is given here to collect these dutiesAt any increased rate or on any goods previously free, but so that any excess collected above any possibility of dispute or doubt. I do not amount imposed by Parliament during the session want despite my personal attachment to shall be refunded. Let us suppose the Parliament passes to arise, because it would be a very serious an Act, and under it are lower than the amounts colwhether these State laws were in operation lected under the State laws, ai-e those or not. It would be a very serious thing if amounts to be refunded ? The Minister for the merchants were in doubt as to whether Trade and Customs will say "" n o "" ; and the State laws were in existence or yet the imposition of the rates under the not-it would be a very serious thing if new Commonwealth Act does not appear to these duties were to be collected, and if be retrospective. Therefore, the collection merchants had also to pay under tlie State will take place under this Act, will rest for laws. Now, I may say that the clause, its validity on this Act, and yet it will be whatever view may be ultimately taken of said that the duty is not imposed. Surely it, is eminently in need of further considerawe impose the duty, even if it be only temtion. I believe the Minister, desiring to do porarily ; and if there should happen to be what is best in the interests of the countiy, no A ct of Parliament passed, those who will give it that further consideration. There have paid duty will get their money back ; is one additional reason why it seems to me while if there should be an Act of Parliaimperatively necessary to legalize the resolument passed, and if tlie rate should be tion. Under ordinary circumstances, as we lower, they would get the difference back. have known them both in the mother countiy But in the meantime we impose this duty, and in the various Australian States, existand compel persons to pay it . Does the ing Tariffs have been in operation, and the Minister say thafc if anybody refused to pay resolution constitutionally giving powerthis money he could successfully resist? though not legally giving power to Supposing he were sued in a courfc of law, the authorities to collect the increased [146] whafc would be his answer ? Wouldi t be"" Oh, you had power to collect money, but not fco sue for it . You had power to collect it if you' were able to, but you must nofc -touch the goods. You may collect money from me, but you must not avail yourself of the other provisions of the Act, and sell those goods or sue me. You can collect the duty, whatever is meant by that."" Surely the Minister would say at once"" That is not the meaning of the Act ; you owe the money at law. Parliament has imposed that duty upon you, and you must pay it . You are entitled to a refund only in the cases mentioned in the section."" Therefore, beyond all question, as far as I can see, there is an imposition of uniform duties. I want to see the imposition of uniform duties. I wish that clearly understood. I believe .that the people have closed their eyes fco many things in our Constitution, and rightly so, for the purpose of getting Inter-State free-trade at the earliest possible moment. It would be a very serious thing to delay the inauguration of InterState free-trade one moment longer than we can possibly avoid, and therefore I should like to see this Bill so framed as to give legal force and effect to the first schedule brought down by the Ministry. But I want to see that done in a way that is beyond all the traditions of my profession-an y doubts the amounts imposed thing if merchants were in doubt as fco duties effected no inconsistent results. But here if we were to rely merely on the resolution of the House of Bepresentatives we should have a very serious state of things arise. Eor instance, I will just give one example to illustrate what I mean. We will say that goods are brought into Sydney under the Commonwealth Tariff' under thisBill, assuming it to be one which allows a State Tariff also to operate."" The Commonwealth Tariff would impose, say, 20 per cent, duty on these goods, and they would tlierefore pay 20 per cent, on entering tlie port of Sydney. If the goods were to be brought over to Melbourne, and if the Victorian Tariff so prescribed, they would have to pay 25per cent., making in all 45 per cent. If these same goods were taken to Melbourne first, they would pay 25 .per cent., and they would afterwards go over to New South Wales free ; thus they ""would only pay 25 per cent, duty in all. Consequently, having regard to the varying State Tariffs, we must not hesitate to bring into legal operation at the earliest possible moment the Commonwealth proposal for a uniform Tariff; but in doing that I want to see its complete adoption, so that oiir Tariff shall be absolutely uniform. The trade difliculties and the uncertainties are great enough without having matters complicated by legal difficulties. The leader of the Opposition referred to clause 121 in connection with the matter of ships' stores. I should just like to point out, what I tried to make clear by means of an interjection. Whatever ships' stores may be included, it seems to me at all events clear that the clause relates only to such goods as are taken on board a ship from the particular port in Australia where she may be lying. 1 tliat is so. the prescribed allowance of stores for the use of the passengers and crew and for the service of the ship may be shipped free of duty on board any ship of not less than 50 tons gross registered tonnage entered outwards for parts beyond the seas. ""Parts beyond the seas"" under this Bill would mean paiiis beyond Australia. Mr B.ETD -Surely tliey could take any quantity of ships' stores for parts beyond the seas. The Commonwealth cannot limit the quantity of stores a ship shall take for to anything a man is accused of, such as use beyond the 3-mile limit. can say how much of the stores shall be free of duty. destination 10,000 miles-off. The-Commonwealth has nothing to do with the goods used outside the limit. outside the limit she is subject to our jurisdiction. sume the case of a ship Avithin our ports, and therefore within our jurisdiction, quite independent of the 5th covering clause of the Constitution Act. If a ship in port wants, to put stores on board, and if they are bought in the ordinary way from a merchant, duty has to be paid; whereas if the goods are taken out of bond, they may be taken oufc free of duty. What would there be to in terfere with our limiting the amount to be talcen out free of duty ? I do not see any difficulty at all. The next clauses show that that is reasonable. It is provided thab ships' stores sball be used only by tbe passengers and crew, and for the service of tlie ship, and that no stores, after being shipped, shall be unshipped, except by permission of the collector. That means, of course, thafc when a ship has got the stores on board, she is not to take advantage of the permission of the collector, and put them on shore, thus evading the duty. I do not see that, there is any difficulty about that. Then there is another clause, 240, which has been referred to. It relates to tlie averment of the prosecution being sufficient. This clause is one of the very few clauses, in the B ill that fall away from the high standard of clearness which we have all been glad It is all right no doubt, if to observe in this measure-. Asf a r as I can judge, fchat clause relates to two classes of proceedings, fche one civil and the other criminal, because it refers to both prosecutor and plaintiff--althoug h the marginal note is a little misleading. In the case of a civil action, I can quite see the very great advantage of providing-it exists in our Victorian law relating to Customs to a great extent-that the matter complained of, which in nine cases out of ten is. peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, should be dealt with in the way proposed. going into a house for an unlawful purpose ?",28,Malcolm Mceacharn The Y Can Section Clearly Puts The Position Iri The Words

W it h regard to civil matters, if the authorities have fair reasons for proceeding-and I cannot conceive that they would proceed without reasonI see no great hardship in placing the onus of proof asfco the value of the goods or the payment of' duty oa the defendant. Assuming tliat the Customs have reasonable grounds for supposing that the duty has nofc been paid on certain gold watches, how could they exhaust the whole range of gold watches on the Continent in order to prove that certain watches are uncustomed goods? Therefore it is right to put the onus of showing that the duty has been paid upon the defendant, because he knows where he got the watches, and he ought to be ablefcobring proof as to the payment of duty. W it h regard to criminal proceedings I am reluctant to go to anything like fchat distance, and I tliink tlie clause goes a little too far on tlie criminal side. It certainly states that in no case will the intent to defraud the revenue be presumed ; that has to be proved. And in no case of an indictable offence would the prosecution be relieved of the duty of proving the whole guilt of the defendant. Therefore it is not quite as drastic as may appear at first sight : although at the same time. I think the Minister might see his way to make it a little more clear and follow the course he has adopted in the otlier clauses of separating the criminal from the civil jurisdiction. A question was asked by the right honourable member for East Sydney as to what power we had fco impose on a State court the duty of trying offences. I conceive that under section 71 of fche Constitution that power exists. Section 71 providesThe judicial power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in a Eederal Supreme Court, to be called the High Courfc of Australia, and in such other federal courts as the Parliament creates, and in such other courts as it invests wifch federal jurisdiction. Under these circumstances it seems to be perfectly competent for this Parliament to invest any State court whatever with power to try.offences and to t r y causes within the federal jurisdiction. A great many of these clauses are, I cordially agree with other honourable members, rather mattersfor consideration in the committeestage ; but the 257th clause seems to me to loom very large, and to be very much more thana matter of detail, and I cannot help saying that I attach the greatest importance to that clause. I trustthat the Minister, will give it his most careful consideration. bourne) --I desire, like the two previous, speakers, to congratulate the Minister on having; produced a bill so free from verbiage.. I feel that this will leadto-our being able,, as laymen, to read fche Bill and understand' it a great deal better than would otherwisebe the case. I bave also to congratulate the Minister on having, chosen Dr. Wollaston as Comptroller of Customs. I feel that in him we have a man who has the esteem and regard of the commercial community -a man who is firm and yet courteous on all occasions, and I am quite sure that the Minister has secured in him amosfcadmirable public servant. I should have been better pleased if we had had before us the regulations undei' this Bill. I find tliat there are 17 clauses in which regulations are referred to, and that under those regulations the Minister will have great powers, whicli I consider should be introduced into the Bill itself. I would like to ask the Minister whether it is his intention, assuming that a. steamer such as an Orient or P. and O. liner arrives at Fremantle, tocharge duty on the stores that are used between Fremantle, and, say, Sydney1 is what I understood the leader of the Opposition to be desirous of arriving at.

An y other point which I may wish to speak upon I shall leave until the Bill gets into committee, but I desire again to heartily congratulate the Minister upon the nieasure. I can see that the Bil l will necessarilv, from its substance, raise some difficult constitutional points, which I think we had better face at once, ancl, as soon as we can, allay any fears with regard to its consequences. (Mouse eouiited.) I have looked at clause 257, ancl it does not contain the solution of the constitutional difficulty which the Minister has to face. I believe in a good deal tliat has been said by the honourable and learned member for Indi. If his view is right-and I think it is-claus e 257 will have to be put into a separate Bill, because it is a law imposing a duty. If it is retained in the Bill, tlie measure will be utterly invalid, even though it is passed by both Houses. Section 55 of the Constitution says thatThe laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation, anrl any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect. The Constitution contains several sections which make the imposition of uniform taxation the crucial moment from which certain events are to date, anrl it is to be the beginning of free-trade between the States. I am not, however, dealing with the question of uniform taxation, which my honourable and learned friend has dealt with more elaborately. imposing taxation, because if it means anything, it means tliat from the time this House passes a resolution in ordinary form, instructing the Minister to collect revenue, there is a tax imposed upon a great number of articles which did not exist before. Therefore, unless the clause is put into a separate Bill, all the othei elaborate, and in tlie main 1 excellent, provisions in the Bill will become nugatory and futile, ancl cannot be enforced. Buti f we read section 55 of the Constitution Act further, it will be seen that the provisions of clause 257 must be put into two Bills, one relating to the imposition of customs duties ancl the other relating to the imposition of excise duties, because that section says thatLaws imposing taxation, except laws imposing duties of customs or of excise, shall deal with one if the permanent Tariif does. aot.alter:them -. subject of taxation only; but laws imposingduties of customs shall deal with duties of customs only,-and laws imposing duties of excise shall deal with duties of excise only. Clause 257 says that from the date of the* passing of the resolution by this House both, excise and custonis duties are to be collected. , which contravenes the provision which I "" have just read. The Bill also' infringesanother section of the Constitution. Under sub-section (2) of section 51, we have n o power in imposing taxation to discriminate between States or parts of States; but the effect of clause 257 is to make such a discrimination, because tlie tariff proposed under its . provisions may leave as they stand the duties now existing in some of the States and."" impose higher or lower duties in other States. There is probably no duty on , woollens in New Soutli Wales at the presenttime, whereas in Victoria there is a duty of ' 30 per eent. per cent. Budget speech proposed a duty of 20 per cent, on woollens, the effect of clause 257 ."" would be that from the date of the passing of a resolution by the House approving of "" the collection of that duty, a duty of 20 p e r cent, woulcl be collected on woollens goinginto New South Wales, while the duty on woollens going into Victoria would be 25 per cent., and the duty on woollens going into Tasmania still heavier, because there is usually a heavier duty in force in Tasmania,, than in any other State. woollens in Tasmania is only 20 per cent. Budget speech is delivered on the 1stAugust, the Victorian shopkeeper will behandicapped from that date in his competition with tlie New South Wales shopkeeper, while, the New South Wales manufacturer will have 5 per cent, less protection than: the Victorian nianufucturer. C f course the Minister may say that clause 257 is not a. law imposing taxation. I have been trying; to bring myself to that belief, but I cannot-, clo so.

171,Mr Higgins,"Imposed or collected'..If we say that from the l st January, 1902, duties shall tae imposed at a certain rate, that is a law imposing taxation. If we say that duties shall tae collected at a certain rate from tlie 1st August, 1901, that is a law imposing taxation ; and if we say that duties shall tae collected from the date of the passing of a resolution by this House, that is a law imposing taxation. If we say that -duties shall be collected at a certain rate from the date of a proclamation by the Governor General in Council, it is not the proclamation whicli imposes the duties, but the Act which gives.power for the collection of duties under that proclamation. Therefore, I cannot seca way out of the position that this is a law-imposing taxation, although the taxation is not to be collected until a date to be fixed by after events. May I here give some instances with regard to the effect of clause 257 ? I have given instances as to woollens, and I should now like to refer to kerosene. There is no duty -on kerosene in Victoria. It is not an article which can tae manufactured or produced in tliis State, taut kerosene has been treated as tlie poor man's light, used in all houses in the bush, and so forth, and as an article which ought, therefore, not to be taxed. But there is a tax on kerosene in Tasmania. An Honorable MEMBER -And in : Soutli Wales. on kerosene in New South Wales, but it has been taken off, and I believe there is also a tax in South Australia. Now, supposing the Ministry came down witli a proposal in the Budget statement for a 15 per cent, duty on kerosene, either ad valorem or at so much per gallon. Eor the sake of argument, we will say a duty of threepence per gallon is proposed. Erom the time of the resolution a duty of threepence per gallon, which is not collected now, would be collected in Victoria. Assume now that this proposed tax on kerosene is not adopted in the permanent Tariff. What is tlie result? Under clause 257 the threepence per gallon duty which had been paid would be returned to the Victorian, but it would not be returned to the Tasmanian. That, I say, is a discrimination between Victorians and Tasmanians, and as such is -against the provisions of section 51, sub-section (2 ), of the Constitution Act, which sets forth that any taxation is to avoid discrimination between State and State. learned meinber contemplates no Tariff being adopted. followed the Tasmanians are responsible. that but to tlie Constitution Act, which says that any taxation we impose must make no discrimination between State and State. By this legislation we are imposing a tax, and are saying in effect tliat the tax shall remain on the Tasmanians but not 'on the Victorians. conditions. uniform, and there must be no discrimination. If there be taxation in the Commonwealth it must be uniform throughout the States. There cannot be a duty on kerosene in Tasmania during a time when there is no duty on kerosene in.Victoria. I hope I have made the point clear. ' monwealth Tariff. Commonwealth Tariff, and, therefore, I think my honourable friend was fully justified in calling attention to the danger of passing this particular clause in this particular Bill. I suggest to the Minister that the clause New should be reconsidered, and if he then still thinks that it is a solution of the nut which tlie Constitution creates for us he should bring the clause in as a separate Bill, or rather as two separate Billsone for custonis and one for excise. I now want to pass on to one or two other matters dealt within the Bill. The honourable and learned leader of the Opposition, has referred to the particular stringency of what may be called the "" hovering "" clause. Of course that clause 214 looks very stringent, providing as it does that certain ships shall be forfeited to His Majesty, among others-; (1) Any ship used in smuggling, or in the unlawful importation, exportation, or conveyance of any.goods. (2) Any ship found within one league of the coast failing to bring to, for boarding upon, being lawfully required to do so. (3) Any ship hovering within one league of the coast, and not departing within twelve hours after being required to depart by an officer. That looks a very big thing, but the word ""hovering"" has a peculiar technical sense of which we need not, I think be afraid. I take it that this ""hovering"" clause is like",33,Malcolm Mceacharn The Y Can Section Clearly Puts The Position Iri The Words

A ship might be outside the 3 miles limit, but still within the headlands. have to be taken by any Government with regard to sliips hovering and hanging about on the coast. This reminds me of one thing, in regard to whicli I would with all respect make a suggestion. I think it would facilitate the passing of these clauses through committee if the marginal notes showed the sources of the clauses. Most of these clauses are a condensed drafting of old regulations. The clauses are very well drafted, but at the same time, I say that tlie experience which I have had in this House-and I am sure other honourable members will confirm me-is , that a clause can always be got through more easily if honourable members see that it is not altogether new-that is, if honourable members see that it is based on experience, and is from some other Act. I quite recognise that the Minister is justified in thinking that his clauses are very much better than are any sections in existence; for the last two I take that for granted, and I tliink he deserves all the commendation given to liim in this respect. But what I want is that there should be something to show the House that a clause is not completely novel -that it has not originated in the last six months in Melbourne or Adelaide-and that almost-all these provisions are tlie result mantle. of centuries of experience. With regard to clause 121, dealing with ships' stores, what understand from that, combined witli the relating clauses, is that an ordinary ship of more than 50 tons burden has to pay Australian duties on Australian goods shipped in Australian ports-that a ship, whether it comes from England or Kamschatka, is to pay the Australian duty on goods which are shipped on board in Australia. learned member refer to goods or stores ? ception here is stores. The duties are not on stores as such, but on goods-tli e stores are a more limited portion of that referred to in the bigger term ""goods."" I . have had my understanding of this clause twisted about in tlie dialogue which has gone on over the table. On the one hand, I thought I understood the clause, until I heard an interjection, and then my understanding of the provision became very different, until I heard another interjection. Of course, clause 121 merely applies to Very strong powers ships' stores, and to ships' stores when the ship is under a certain tonnage, but what I understand-anc l I should like to be corrected if I am wrong-is that if goods are shipped in Australia, those goods should bear tlie Australian duty with the small exception which is put here. On the other hand, there is another view which may be taken-and I should like to know if this is the Minister's view-that there is to be a duty charged on all goods whicli are taken between port and port in Australia, and by, say, a P. ancl O. vessel. go out of tlie warehouse f ree, because they are going to be exported beyond the seas. Goodsi n other cases are to be consumed in Australia, and a certain charge is made in regard to tliem. These charges apply in all cases. provides for drawbacks. or three centuries in England. the drawbacks. Then clause 121 merely amounts to this, that if a ship, say a P. and O.

200,Mr Kingston,I do not think the word that his sole intention ? In suggesting this,36,Malcolm Mceacharn The Y Can Section Clearly Puts The Position Iri The Words
201,Mr Higgins,"section 92 of the Constitution it is provided that on the imposition of uniform duties of customs, trade, commerce, and intercourse among the States shall be absolutely free. That is one of the fundamental principles of our Constitution charter, and what merchants want to know is the time when trade will become absolutely free. We want that moment fixed legally beyond all doubt. I believe there are very few in this House or in this country who are not of that opinion. The opinion is that a certain period of time should be fixed when there shall be absolute freedom of trade, and they want that period to depend, not upon a mere departmental order, but upon a sound, legal, and unchallengeable basis. I ask the Mmister to consider whether freedom of trade ought not to begin from tlie moment when the resolution embodying the new Tariff is brought into this House? Can any one deny that that ought to be done. Ancl for this reason-that from that moment, according to the constitutional practice in all British countries, the duties are collected in accordthe ordinary form. ance with the terms of the resolution. The Tariff then becomes a uniform one, we will say, by convention. Supposing tliat the duties were collected according to the terms of the resolution and were not challenged, we should have a uniform Tariff by convention, although not legally; but what we want is something more than the acceptance of a uniform Tariff by convention or acquiesence. We want it established on a legal, basis. that from the moment when the Minister proposes his resolution in Committee.of Ways and Means, the revenue shall be protected. I apprehend that the Minister does not bring clown this proposal merely for the purpose of validating the resolution, but for a more important object, namely, the establishment of Inter-State free-trade. If he does mean that, then he ought to take steps to give legal effect to what are his intentions. Let us examine this clause and see whether that is intended. It is said that when the Tariff alteration is proposed to the Housewhen the Minister proposes the adoption of a resolution authorizing the taking of steps for the, protection of the revenue-dutie s may thereupon be collected as projrosed. If the clause ended there everything would be absolutely clear. tended legislation is concerned, everything would be perfectly clear, because it ! would be embodied in an Act of Parliament that the officers of Customs should next morning proceed to collect duties in accordance with the terms of the resolution sanctioning such collection submitted to this House on the previous evening. That would be quite suiiicient. When once this clause in that form finds its way into an Act of Parliament, tliat would be sufficient not only to validate the collection of duties as an interim proposal, but also to mark an event which is referred to in section 92 of the Constitution-namely , the establishment of Inter-State free-trade. Bill were defeated ? contemplate anything of the kind. When once the House goes into Committee of Ways ancl Means to deal with the Tariff, it must proceed until the battle is fought out. Even if certain disturbances and difficulties occur, this could be regarded as the interim Tariff, which was to remain in legal operation until it was superseded by an Act in honourable member proposes it, make the Tariff an interim one 1 an interim Tariff; a provisional Tariff, so as to mark what we are all aiming at-namelv , the establishment of Inter-State free-trade.

I tliink there ought to be no doubt about this.

219,,"I would like to Sir JOHN QUICK -This clause is athan 50 tons gross registered tonnage entered outward for parts beyond the seas. That clause would certainly not apply to a ship leaving Melbourne for Sydney, nor could it apply to a ship leaving Fremantle for Melbourne, or to any vessel leaving one State port for another State port. 'It would only apply to a ship leaving Melbourne for New Zealand or Eiji, or for some other part of the outside world, and it could not apply therefore to a ship trading from port to port within the Commonwealth. The clause has a very limited effect, and it does not purport to deal witli sliips arriving at Fremantle from London in the way that it was put by the honourable and learned member for East Sydney. A t tlie same time, as I read this clause, a P. and G. steamer arriving at Fremantle from London immediately it came within the tliree-mile territorial limit would, in just the same way as an Inter-State boat, be within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. Immediately upon arrival in a Commonwealth port, the vessel would become liable to two sets of laws-the State laws as far as tliey would be applicable, and bhe federal laws ;as far as they would be in operation within the three-mile limit of the Commonwealth. Consequently these P. and O. boabs, or any other foreign boat, would, within the territorial waters, be liable to the revenue laws, and would mot be allowed to consume goods brought from foreign parts without paying duty. I know of nothing in this Bill that would allow them to do so. On the other hand, tliey would have to seal up their .goods under tlie supervision of the Customs officer, who would take care that all the stores imported from abroad were placed under lock and key. For the purposes of the Act, the imported stores would become bonded stores. A P. and O. boat would not be able to bring stores within the waters of the Commonwealbh, and allow passengers and the crew to consume them, without paying duty on such goods as were dutiable. ' State laws. Sir JOHN QUICK that. State waters she would be liable to State revenue laws, just in the same way as an ordinary local ship would be, and she could not consume dutiable goods without paying now. the duty payable within the State limits. Then she would be abl to buy local the view that a P. and O. liner coming to stores, or to ship stores free of duty if bhey were' intended bo be usod beyond bhe seas. Buti t seems to me that as regards goods, wares, and merchandise consumed on board a foreign ship within territorial waters, duties will have to be paid. Supposing a foreign ship started on a voyage for parts beyond the seas outside Australia, then she -would be able, under clause 121, to take .any stores free of duty so long as they were to be consumed on board on the high seas beyond territorial waters. So far as section 5 of the Constibubion is concerned, I do not think that it throws very much light on the question. Clause5 is only intended to give extra territorial effecb bo the laws of bhe Commonwealth with regard bo British ships trading between various -ports of the 'Commonwealth -on 'One continuous voyage.' It is true that -even if Australian ships go a thousand miles beyond bhe Commonwealbh, bhe laws of bhe Commonwealth will still be-enforced regarding them, so long as the voyage begins and ends within the Commonwealth. Section5 will not applyto a P. and 0..or an Orient liner coining from London. They -will only be liable to the laws of 'the Commonwealbh so long as they are actually within the threemile limit, and while they are beyond the three-mile limit, and therefore on bhe high seas, bhey again become liable only to the laws of the country from which they come. seals placed on their stores then. they get beyond the three-mile limit bhey can remove bhe seals placed on their sbores, and begin to consume such stores without the payment of any duty.

I have the misfortune to differ to a"" large extent in my interpretation some of the honourable gentlemen who have already spoken. The attack made upon clause 257 may or may not be justified, and it is with the greatest diffipays dence-in view of fche undoubted skill and knowledge of the gentlemen who have attacked it-that I venture to think that the attitude they have taken is an incorrect oue. it seems to me that there is no imposition of duties by clause 257, because that clause says that on the House of Representatives adopting the resolution, the Minister may take any necessary steps for the protection of the revenue, and that revenue duties may thereupon be collected as proposed, at any increased rate, or on any goods previously free, but so that any excess collected above"" any amount imposed by Parliament during the session shall be refunded. To my mind, the concluding words of the clause offer ground for what seems to me a very strong argument against the interpretation placed upon the clause during the debate. Though1 admit that the arguments of the honourable and learned member for Indi are strong, yet fchey do not conclude the question, as the honourable meinber himself will doubtless be prepared to grant. admit frankly that my arguments do not establish the question one way or fche other. not in excess of the previous rate, and would not be refunded, would the honourable member say that that duty had not been imposed ? MrM c CAY I will put it in t h i : way. A duty-puttin g ifc in ordinary English-is the payment by a subject to the Crown for the carrying on of the management of the country, and in its I do not think this clause essence it means that fche subject pays something that he does not get back again. do under this clause. tlie subject pays and does not get back again, and which he has no claim to get back again. Now, in these cases, these sums fchat are collectedI do not know that the word "" duties "" is a fortunate word to useare paid tentatively by the importer in order that he may be allowedI am referring chieflj to Customs, as the 7 Excise question is of minor importance in any case-to bring in his goods. If at the of these clauses from end of the session Parliament has not passed a law imposing these duties the nioney will be returned, but it seems to me thafc tlie person when he the money only pays it as a sort of security for being allowed to bring goods in a security thafc when the law is passed-and in that respect it will be a retrospective law duty will be paid on all goods he has imported. This would have the same effect as if the importers entered into a bargain thafc duty would be paid on all goods imported from the moment of the passing of the resolution by the House of Representatives up to the time of the imposition of the uniform duties by a law passed in both Houses, and 1 retrospective in its operation. for an uncertain return. MrM c CAY It seems to me that the clause really means that. It is-simply a. convenient way of securingthatthelaw, which will be retrospective in its operation by dating back to tlie passing of a resolution by the House of Representatives, will be obeyed in its retrospective as well as its prospective effect. I do not think the fact of some duties not being returned affects the quesAndI tion. It means that the contract is carried out pending the imposition of uniform duties -no t under the authority of the resolution, not under the action of the Minister in protecting the revenue, but undei the opera1 tion of the Act. It is by tlie authority of this nieasure that the duties will be retained after a uniform Tariff has been imposed.

228,Mr Isaacs,"Making a certain payment,Chinaman should enter the Commonwealth without depositing the sum of £ 1 0 0 with the Collector of Customs, unless within the same session, or by the end of the session, following his arrival it enacted that the nioney should be returned to him, would that be the imposition of a duty ? I do not think that it woulcl. the duties coUected under resolution will be in exactly the same position. in the instance which I have given, although the deposit of £ 1 0 0 by the Chinaman might be a condition precedent to his entering the Commonwealth, it would not be a duty, so the moneys collected under the authority of a resolution passed in pursuance of the provisions of this clause would not be a duty, although to their payment would be attached the condition precedent that when Parliament had passed a uniform Tariff, they woulcl, if the duties in the Tariff were tlie same as the duties charged under the resolution, be appropriated to the revenue of the Commonwealth. Whether that view be right or wrong, it is certainly a tenable one. have we, under the Constitution, power to impose them ? MrM c CAY duty at all, it does not matter whether'it is uniform or not. In my reading of the clause, the duties levied under the resolution would not be duties within tlie meaning of the Constitution. but I do not think they are duties within the meaning of the Constitution Act, ancl w ill not become duties until the uniform Tariff is actually passed. That, it seems to me, must have been the view taken by the Cabinet, because, so far as I can see, it is only upon that ground that the clause is tenable. am fortified in my opinion by the views of the notable lawyers who are members of the Cabinet. learned member's own showing, would not the measure, being retrospective effect, make these charges become duties 1 MrM c CAY money is to be held by the Customs department, pending the imposition of a uniform Tariff. When a uniform Tariff is imposed it is to be retrospective in its effects, but the charges become duties only on the passing of the Tariff. A t tbe same time, it is questionable whether it is wise -to pass the clause as it stands in the Bill. It is perfectly clear that there is great difference of opinion as to its meaning. If the clause means what the honourable and learned members for Indi, Northern Melbourne, It seems to me that and Bendigo consider it to mean, it will be a most unfortunate thing to retain it in the Just as Bill. Therefore, if tliere is a course as to the constitutionality of which both laymen ancl lawyers can agree, that is the course which we should follow. We are on the horns of this dilemma : either we must accept the construction of the clause which I have just given, and take the risk of the Cabinet being wrong, and the honourable ancl learned member for Indi and the other honourable ancl learned members who have taken the same view being right, or we must adopt a course which some of the members of. the Opposition appear to be unwilling to adopt. We must either take the course proposed in this clause, or we must allow the proposals of the Governinent to be the Tariff until Parliament has determined what the Tariff shall be. It is of no use to say, "" We will not have the Bill as it stands, and we will not take the other If a charge is not a course."" Those are the only courses open to us to take. Mr M.cCAY -There is a third course. The Tariff proposals might be brought down to this House and debated here for months, so that every one would know exactly what duties were to be imposed long before they were collected. to which I refer. right honourable and learned member refer 1 now in some of tlie States. learned member suggests that the proposed duties should be collected without statutory authority 1 courts would not interfere. sible to adopt that course, seeing fchat we I do not think so.

The safety of tlie course proposed in the Bill is disputed, though, when all is said and done, df we want to be quite sure, we must trust the Ministry to piay fair. We should not expect them to bring down a uniform Tariff, ancl then immediately induce the Governor General to prorogue Parliament.

Once we have decided upon the method of procedure, we can easily adapt tlie clause to it . before a uniform Tariff had been passed, would the old State duties revive ? revive. Mi-. M c CAY If the collection of these duties is an imposition of. duties the State duties could not revive. I do not feel that there is much force in tlie point tliat has been raised by the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne as to the course proposed by this clause being the imposition of duties which are not uniform. If tliat is done, the MinistryI doubt in any case whether a continuance of State duties could be held to be the hnposition of duties by the Commonwealtli. However, tlie question stands or falls with the main issue whether tlie proposed collections-under the clause are-duties, and in any case whether we ought to allow the clause to stand as it is. I suggest to the Minister and to the leader of the Opposition that it is urgently desirable that we should pass a clause as to whose constitutional effect there will be no serious difference of opinion. If , with the adoption of a clause in that form, we can secure immediately Inter-State free-trade, we sliall earn tlie gratitude of the people of the Commonwealtli. for so promptly enabling them to get what tliey regard as the chief benefit of tlie union.

I doubt the wisdom of the proposal of the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne thafc a schedule of the State Acts repealed by this measure should be embodied in it . We can repeal no State laws, except such as the Constitution gives us power to repeal, and a schedule of repealed Acts would bemerely an expression of our opinion tliat the Acts therein mentioned were repealed"" byfchepassing of the measure. It would be merely an expression of opinion, and would not bind any court, any body, or party to a suit. It would be merely an expression of opinion likely enough to be wrong in some respects. It would be necessary to look into all the Acts and study them carefully in order to seewhat Acts and sections of Acts were really repealed; and the information supplied would be more likely to be a misleading than a safe guide.

We have been putting placards in our Bills-sometime s in a clause and sometimes in a schedule. I disapprove of the practice of putting placards in laws passed by this Parliament taking from the Constitution or from implications of the Constitution. It is much safer to leave tlie Constitution asfar as possible to operate according to its own words, instead of endeavouring to interpret those words in our laws, seeing that our interpretation cannot affect the fact, whatever it may be, of what the Constitution really means. understand the honourable and learned member for Bendigo arightI had not the pleasure of hearing the speeches of other lionorable and learned members who preceded him-h e stated that if clause 257 ended at the word ""proposed "" it would be That is a matter of policy well worth cona sufficient clause, which would enable the Ministry to collect duties without any necessity to refund subsequently, if tlie Tariff Bill were not carried into law. But I put this question to the honourable and learned member-wha t would happen if: the Tariff Bill did not become law? I was under-the impression from his speech that the adoption of the resolution would impose a Tariff, and that consequently InterState free-trade would begin with that imposition. The difficulty I see in connection with the matter, presuming tlie TariffB ill is not carried, is the condition of affairs after its rejection.

The honourable and learned member for Bendigo said we should not contemplate that the Tariff Bill might be defeated. But we ought to contemplate that which is -within tlie range of possibility, and I ask whether, if the B ill were thrown out, we should be without customs duties altogether ? If any customs duties were collected after the Bill was thrown out, tlie Ministry afc any rate would have sacrificed the Inter-State duties, and' would never get back the revenue lost by those duties not being enforced. If I understand the honourable and learned member corI t is quite true that this rectly, I do not think his proposal would at all meet the circumstances.

I am sure that the Minister has tried to look at the matter not merely from the view of the Custom-house officials, but also from the view of the general public. I compliment him upon having taken steps to get the opinions .of those who have constant connection with the o Customhouse, but who are not Custom-house officials. Still there are some provisions which I think are dangerous and severe. One of these has reference to the penalties which may be imposed. In clause 220 tliere are various offences set out. Some of those offences have no relation whatever to the value of the goods in connection' with which"" they may occur. For instance the clause says thatNo person shall make in any declaration or document produced to any officer any statement which is untrue in any particular, or produce or deliver to any officer any declaration or document containing any such statement. That has no relationship whatever to the value of the goods. nexion with goods which are worth £ 1 , or in connection with goods which are worth £50,000. Yet the penalty is stated at the foot of the clause to be £ 1 0 0 . fectly right if the penalty might be £ 5 , but undei* some circumstances it could not possibly be £ 5 , it could not be £100, but would : have to be a much higher amount. That is. not a desirable power to give. In fact the Bill enforces immense penalties where there may be no need for them. In proof of that I woulcl refer the Minister to clause 229. mum penalty. The minimum penalty for any offence against tin's Act shall be one-twentieth of the prescribed maximum. If we refer to clause 226 we shall get the maximum. That clause readstoo If any penalty hereby provided shall be lessthan three times the value of any goods in respect of which the offence has been committed, themaximum penalty shall be thrice the value of thegoods. I quite admit that it is high]}' desirable to have such a maximum, ancl if there is any offence, that is, an admitted evasion of the I give the MinisCustoms,, that there should be power to imJ. must add to the pose a very high maximum penalty, but theminimum can only be one-twentieth bf themaximum penalty. What does that mean 1 An entry may be passed for goods which are worth, say £10,000a not infrequent occurrence power of the Executive, though. penalties into an Act we never know whether they will be imposed or not. If we aregoing to leave it to the Executive we can omit a great portion of this. Bill, or indeed: of any other Bill. We know that errors, will occur. They are bound to occur in theenormous number of transactions which mercantile houses have in connection with the Customs department. They will occur sometimes without the least guilty intention. I quite agree that it is desirable to provide some punishment even for error,, but if the department is satisfied that any breach of the Act has been committed in error, surely that fact should be considered! in relation to the penalty to be imposed. Why, we constantly find even Ministers It might occur in concoming down to the House with errors in their Bills. They tell honourable members that these errors are oversights of thedraftsman.

351,Mr Conroy,"I hope that the day forhas incurred through his wrong-doing, but we should nofc force a man to commit perjury. Under clause 240 it is provided that the averment of the prosecutor or plaintiff contained in the information shall be deemed to be proved-n o matter what fche defendant may say-in fche absence of proof fco the contrary. So thafc while in the one case the statement of a Customs officer is fco be regarded as legal proof, the defendant may be compelled fco go to England or elsewhere before he can find any answer ceptable. such a position that his evidence would not lie legal evidence, and could not be recorded, and under these circumstances what would a man's statement be worth ? He would be met by proof on the one side, and he might not be able to bring anything to controvert what was stated against him, without, perhaps, sending a commission to England. He would be able to make a statement, but that would not be regarded as proof. evidence. evidence for the Government. that the averment of fche prosecution shall lie deemed to be proof in fche absence of proof to the contrary, and I would ask fche Minister if he seriously means that. he really seriously mean tliat an)' statement of the prosecutor whatever shall be deemed to be proved; that because something is handed over to a clerk, who draws up a declaration in any form he pleases, every word is to be accepted as true 'i indictable offences. when fche offence is an indictable one it is not included in this clause, but in the hundred and one matters that come up before the Customs officers it is veiy clear that a power of this kind is far too drastic to give. It is a power that would be more in keeping wifch fche old times under the old mercantile system, when it was thought very wrong for men to trade at all. We cannot be said to be living in those days now, liecause there are men sitting ou the benches in the House who glory in the fact that they are engaged in trade, and who rejoice at the prospect of a uniform Tariff being brought into operation, because ifc will remove the restrictions between the States. Under section 121 i mightpoint out what the effect will be in connection with ships if the Commonwealth collects duties on stores consumed by ships which trade between the various ports of the Commonwealth, and yet go outside territorial waters. The effect might be very serious indeed, because if the provisions of the clause can be applied to ocean-going steamersI am not quite sure that they can-fch e result will be that all the ports afc "" fche far end that will bo acof this continent such as Perth ancl Albany He would be placed in will not be called at at all, because the extra cost of the goods to be consumed on these boats might be so great that they would pass those ports, and come straight on fco Sydney. As far as Queensland is concerned, it might be that the ocean-going steam-ships trading from eastern ports and now touching at Cairns, and having their head-quarters in Sydney or Melbourne, woulcl not touch at the northern ports at all. I think that under this section a very much greater power is being given to Ministers for the time being than they ought to have, and as it is believed that this is a matter of regulation, and that clause simply states the powers of Ministers could be enforced under regulation, they might be exercised in such a drastic manner as to seriously affect the smaller ports. It is very Does clear that the influence woulcl be in fche larger ports, ancl they would not mind stamping out the people in the smaller ports, but that is not the intention or the spirit with -which this Act ought to have been framed. We are here to frame legislation for the whole of Australia, and if a proposal is likely to injuriously affect any small corner of the continent it ought not to be adopted. I hope tliat the Government will take into consideration the drastic nature of the two clauses to which I have referred, ancl see if fcheir provisions cannot be modified thafc, owing to niy absence in the early part of this sitting I lost the opportunity of hearing the remarks which have been made about clause 257.

357,Mr Harper (Mernda),"I am sorryclearness and conciseness. If it is passed, it will be a great improvement upon many of the Customs Acts with which I am acquainted, though, of course, it contains provisions which we shall have to alter in committee. North Sydney made a point in regard to the clause which provides for the infliction of penalties. the penalties imposed by the Bill consistent and automatic in operation-a able thing to do-has no doubt overlooked the fact that in every case the penalty should be proportioned to the offence. There are hosts of small infractions of the Customs law which, though the autliorities cannot pass by, and it would be well for the Minister, before we come to dealing with the penalty clause, to consider that class of offences, with a view to providing lesser penalties for minor inaccuracies and mistakes, which will inevitably ""occur and which are not intentional, though the result of carelessness, ancl, it may be, of culpable carelessness.

The first difficulty which has to be met is that which -has had to be met by the State Parliaments in the past, in fixing a new Tariff, or imposing additional duties-the of protecting the revenue by collecting the duties from the moment of their announcement by the Government. the revenue has generally been protected by a resolution of the Lower House, but the collection of duties under such a resolution has been admittedly rate, has gone pretty far in the direction of illegality, and the method is a cumbrous one.

If the clause in the Bill is carried, the Government will be authorized, upon the passing of a resolution by this House, to protect the revenue by collecting proposed duties immediately tliey announce Tariff.

Such attempts in any-case could succeed only if the discussion upon the proposed Tariff were The honourable member for a very long one, and they could not succeed at ali under the provisions in the clause to which I refer. is likely to be a long one. visions to which I refer may be desirable. Having thought tlie matter over, I see in all directions difficulties connected with this clause. Prom what I have heard of the unintentional, suggestions made by some of the' legal members of the House, I am inclined to think that if those suggestions were adopted, we should find ourselves in a sea of unknown difficulties. It seems to me clear that we are shut up to one of two courses; of which one is a course which I think is almost tod much to hope forthat the Tariff should be determined upon almost immediately, to enable the new order of things to begin, and to give time. I have given clause 257 eon-' for the formulation of a permanent ancl I have for some stable Tariff. If it were possible to adopt that course, all the difliculties which otherwise appear likely to ensue would be avoided, ancl trade woulcl be free from the hindrances in which it will be involved if any other course is adopted. I fear from what I have heard and what I know, that it is too much to expect that that course will be adopted, and I have come to the conclusion that the only other course to adopt is difficulty the old method of protecting the revenue by a resolution of this House, passed in accordance with the provisions of this clause, elIn the States even independently of the clause. It will then be absolutely necessary, in my opinion, to continue to collect the State Tariff's in all cases where the State duties are in excess of illegal, or at any those proposed to be imposed by the Federal Tariff. In all cases where articles are subject to higher duties under the State Tariffs than it is proposed to impose upon them by the Federal Tariff, we must collect the State duties in addition to the federal duties, some extent meets the until the uniform Tariff is settled upon.

I think we must face the difficulty in this way: we must collect the federal duties, and we must allow the various States' duties also to be collected on deposit-tlia t is, in all cases in which the duties exceed those sought to be imposed by the Federal Government. We cannot have intercolonial Inter-State free-trade until the Bill is finally passed and adopted. I tliink that by the time we come to deal with the clauses in committee, it is possible that the Government may see their way out of this labyrinth. So far as I am individually concerned, I have been puzzled as to the exact meaning of the word "" imposition of a Tariff"" from the very inception of the Bill. Although ,1 have given very great attention to the matter, I do not see my way through the difficulties without very grave trouble indeed ; but I believe the simplest way, short of doing what I believe to 'be the impossible, . would be to get both sides of the House and the Senate to agree to -pass a Bill forthwith, which might be held to be an interim Bill. If that could be done it would be the simplest way out of the difficulty, but I regard it as impracticable. Tlie only other way is to face the difficulties of the position, and collect both the Federal Tariff and the States' Tariffsi n all cases where the latter exceed the Federal Tariff, and to postpone Inter-State free-trade until such time as a Tariff BiU has been finally adopted by Parliament. that we have had any more important question before this House than the one that has been discussed this afternoon. It is a discussion to which I am sure we all looked, to learn what views those who have been appointed to represent the electors of Australia held, on this very important question as to when the Tariff should be considered to be imposed. I think some of the honourable members who have addressed the House more recently in the discussion would have been helped considerably if they had heard the speeches delivered early in the afternoon, when some of the legal difficulties of the case were put very clearly, especially by the honourable and learned not agree ? member for Indi. There would have been a. greater hesitation in the expressions of opinion in some directions if honourable members had 1 heard also the honourable and learned member for Northern Melbourne on the subject. That leads me to tlie point, first of all, that if there be opportunities under this clause,, as now proposed, to assail the Bill, as honourable members have shown it may be assailed, I think we shall be led to consider whether we should not take a course whicli willprevent any law which we may pass as now proposed being assailed, thus tending to great confusion in all commercial relations. There was a suggestion made which the honourable member for North Sydney, to some extent, dealt with in his address in the latter part of this afternoon. When I refer to him, I am sure he will quite understand that no one who listened to him, at any rate on this side of the House, considered' that he was attacking in any hostile spirit a proposal made from this side. I do not know whether the honourable member has yet given the Minister the benefit of his suggestion of a way out of the difficulty, but I think we might appeal to that honourable member, and to all honourable members, wherever they may sit, and point out that this is a question on which we ought to sink all party feeling, and to endeavour to bringour best judgments to bear on the settlement of the difficulty. One solution which was suggested was tliat the resolution which would be validated by the provision under discussion would, when brought in , itself specify that the Tariff would extend to the end of the existing session of Parliament. What would be the position 1 That would at once put all the Tariff laws of the various States out of existence, and we should have only the customs law upon the resolution validated by the B ill we are now considering. It would place Parliament in the position that it would either have to sit until it had passed another. Tariff, or to put itself in the position of having no custonis law at all, and, therefore, no custom's taxation to be collected. Althoughi t may be a difficult position, and although it is a solution which we should not, perhaps, choose if there were any otlier, still, I think it would 'place Parliament in the position of being compelled to deal with the Tariff before it finally closed its labours of this session.",51,Honourable Member Would The Lished As Early As Possible

What is the other horn of the dilemma on which he places himself ? Although this may not be the best solution, unless there is another one offered it seems to me the only practicable solution of the position in which we find ourselves. A t any rate, whatever may be said as to the proposal to table a resolution and collect the duties, and afterwards return those duties, I should like to point out that that is a very bad course if we can possibly avoid it. It means putting the profits to a very considerable extent into the traders' pocketsthe profits on the duties paid by the consumers during the period of collection. I would rather face the question, and let those duties be absolute duties until the time comes when Parliament ultimately agrees to the Tariff that is to be the permanent Tariff. The honourable and learned member for Indi has given us very strong reasons for taking this point into consideration, namely, that the collection of the duties as proposed would be equivalent to the imposition of duties. If that be so, it then becomes a question whether under the Constitution we can impose a Tariff which is in a sense only a part of what will be collected, and which will, to some extent, be differential. tion by one House, and would it be legal ? ber's pardon. The clause we are considering validates beforehand, and in anticipation of the passing of a resolution. It gives the sanction of Parliament to a resolution which may be afterwards carried, in the same way as other Acts of Parliament validate in anticipation a proclamation which is made to bring the Act into effect. I was just on the point of dealing with the differential aspect of this subject. I think the very words which are used in the clause might give rise to an argument that this was a differential rate. The words are, "" and any increased rate or on goods previously free."" Those words take into contemplation an existing rate, and to some extent legalize the continuance of that rate. The w hole r Tariff will have to be dealt with as a Tariff, and the duties which will be brought in under the resolution will be part of the Tariff. By implication, we are referring to another portion of the Tariff, namely, the existing rates, which are not increased, and I think it might be said we are thereby bringing ourselves into conflict with the provision of the Constitution which says there shall be no difference made in taxation as between State and State. Whether such can be said or not, I think it is such a serious matter that we would do well to see whether we can solve the question. I think the least objectionable mode of solving it would be to agree to a Tariff tentatively, but a permanent Tariff so long as it lasted, and a Tariff which should last only until*the end of the session, Parliament of course dealing with the question effectively before it ceased its' labours. Minister for Trade and Customs), in reply. I am sure the Government have every reason to be pleased with the reception with which the Bill has met at the hands of honourable members. For my own part, I desire to acknowledge most gratefully tlie veiy kind remarks which were made as to the mode of its preparation. It is our desire to make the Bill a credit to tlie Legislature, and we have already welcomed assistance from various quarters. Now we come to the chief source of wise legislation, Parliament, and we are much indebted to the keen criticism to which this measure has been subjected. I would like to take the opportunity of saying that when 1 was mentioning those who had had much concern in the preparation of this nieasure, I forgot to mention the name of the draftsman, who chiefly gave the benefit of his services to the Collector of Customs, .namely, Mr Cassell, the assistant Parliamentary draftsman of the Commonwealth. That there are difficulties in connection with some of these clauses it would be idle for us to deny. The chief criticism has been levelled against clause 257, and it seems to the Government that it ought to be our chief duty to make the position as plain as it can be made at the earliest possible moment.

373,Mr Kingsto N (South A US T R A L I A,"which I venture to consider has been adopted for many-well , almost as long as we can recollect, and which is taken from the British practice obtaining in the United lowed us here to Australia. It is absolutely necessary for the protection of the revenue, and in tlie interests of the community, that when a new Tariff is proposed, ns soon as it is announced there shall be power to collect the increased duties, lest the object of the legislation should be defeated by the introduction of goods before the collection commenced. Is there any reason why we .should . not adopt a practice of that sort here? Surely not. What was -necessary in one State will be all the more necessary in six States. It seems to me that there is additional necessity for providing for this in the clearest possible terms. to whether or not a practice which could be applied with simplicity in the affairs of one State could be equally applied -to the affairs of the Commonwealtli, dealing with the fiscal systems of six States. Further, when our legislation as regards the relations of the States and the Commonwealth is so much the creature of special enactment and particular provision, .1. think that if we can, with similar clearness, provide what shall be the course under the circumstances which will shortly arise, it will be better if we can legally make a provision of the character referred to. The constitutional jiractice, of course, has a great deal to recommend it, but constitutional practice, when clothed with parliamentary recognition within the four corners of a statute, is even better, and -provides at least for the removal of doubts that otherwise might be found to exist. SoI think that honourable members will probably agree with me when I say that there is no reason, if we can avoid departing from the constitutional practice, why we should depart from it ; and if it is possible to declare it, and provide for its enforcement within the four corners of the Act itself, all the better. What reason is given why we should not do what is suggested ? bers, looking at the clause itself, will have no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that all that is sought to be there provided for 'is the collection of the higher duty temporarily, pending the permanent imposition of a Customs Mr Kingston Tariff-the collection of the liigher duty, whether it is found in one State or in the other, or whether it is found in the State Tariff or in the Tariff which is proposed on Kingdom, and has folbehalf of the Federation. It is simply a declaration removing beyond the possibility of challenge the right of the Government to follow the course which has been established, I might say, from all time to do what is necessary to prevent the revenue from being robbed. Are we going to do it ? Are we going to make provision as best we can, or are we going to throw the doors open ? learned member for In d i says that no one suggests that. Well, as long as we can get what we require by any better means shall only be too glad to adopt those means. There* might be doubts raised as But what I say is this : we are proposing what is usual, and I have listened with the greatest'amount of attention and respect British communities-to collect the higher duties when an alteration in the Tariff is proposed. I have listened to the various suggestions, and really there is not one of them which is seriously put forward as a substitute which is likely to be adopted. Someone has said that we ought to agree to a Tariff. It has fallen from a variety of quarters-and a delightful arrangement it would be. But here we are contemplating a Tariff, about which we are threatened with all sorts of differences; although I hope those differences will not be found to exist. Reallyi t would be a most pleasant thing if any Tariff whicli the Governnient introduced could be accepted holus-bolus by this House even for one session. I should be delighted. Nothing would please me better. believe really that the result will be that the Tariff which we bring down will be accepted. Stilli t may take a little time and a little argument to persuade its acceptance by some honourable members on the other I think lionorable memside of the House.

I think that on questions affecting the revenue we should be prepared to sink any party feeling, because we must do something ih this direction for the benefit of the Commonwealth as a whole. We are asking only that we may be able to do what others have done while I am thus discussing some of the positions that have been put before me-and I recognise that the point is of such importance that it is not going to be decided on second reading . speeches I deprecate the duplication of the discussion.

I do not mind telling honourable members, what probably they knew before, that my professional education did not include any very great learning on the subject of ships' stores.

W it h regard to this question of ships' stores, it seems to me that the position is perfectlyplain, and that the leader of the Opposition stumbled somewhat over clause 121. That clause is simply intended to provide that stores can be cleared out of bond for the use of ships, without the payment of duty according to prescribed rates, when a ship is entered outwards for ports beyond the seas. The position .to-day is that as regards ships trading within the limits of a State, they can get no stores without the payment of duty because they We are entered within the State, and the reason for that is that the stores are intended",55,Honourable Member Would The Lished As Early As Possible

Suppose a court came to the conclusion, after a prolonged argument, that tlie intention of the Act is in a certain direction, but that it is not clear, what would be the result ? According to tlie interpretation clause, the words are not to have the meaning unless the meaning is "" clear,"" and to my mind the Bill introduces a form of I expression which is open to doubt, and with which I am not familiar. some such language in some Act in South Australia, but 1 doubt whether my friend can show the same language in any other Act in any other part of the British dominions. A question might easily arise in legal proceedings, because the interpreta-* tion clause forms what may be called the vertebra of the whole Act, and a court would be put in this extraordinary position that the meaning attached to the words in this clause was the clearly intended meaning it would be compelled to hold that no such meaning could possibly be attached to such words, and that is limiting the value of the interpretation clause. Perhaps the Minister has some marvellous way of showing that this is a revelation of Divine-wisdom, and I am quite agreeable to know that it is. These particular words have the sacredness of South Australian precedent, but, apart from that, honourable members are putting the position that unless words are clear, someother question of the desirability or meaning must be intended. It is nothing of the sort; it is absolutely the reverse, as the leader of the Opposition and the honourable and learned member for Indi will say.

Therefore, if we strike out the harsher provisions altogether, we still leave any man open to a penalty under that clause.

Therefore the statement of the Attorney-General is scarcely an answer to the remarks I made. Parliament never objects to giving, power to the Executive to frame regulations to carry out an.

487,Sir John Quick,"To my mind theoften happens that goods are landed in regard to which it is impossible to pass a proper entry. a matter which does not strike many honourable members as at all serious. They do not own ships, and I do not either, and, therefore, it may seem to some of us to be of no consequence. Still we are legislating in regard to the rightful interests of people who have millions of money invested in ships, and surely this interpretation, which does not make it a mere matter of discretion for the Executive, but by law compels them in certain cases to forfeit a ship-worth , perhaps, £200,000--to the Crown, is a most important one. Surely there must be some intent to evade or defraud the revenue before such a monstrous penalty should be exacted ? The element of fraud should come in in some way. This interpretation, however, places an innocent act, where there is no attempt to defraud the revenue, on exactly the same plane of punishment as a wilful act. Is tliere any sense in such a proposal ? to clause 214, and not an objection to this clause ? the interpretation clause should stand over until the Bill has been finished, and then we should know whether it was necessary to talk on ' it. My right honourable friend prefers, however, the less convenient procedure, and instead of our dealing with tlie clause now, we must deal with it as it interprets the Bill as it stands. That is the inconvenience of taking an interpretation clause before our work is over. words first, and find tlie meaning afterwards. an interpretation clause first. I tliink it would have been more sensible to have taken this clause after we had finally settled the scope of the Bill. We have to deal with the matter in the light of the subsequent provisions of the Bill as they stand now. I would point out to the committee that the smuggling in respect to which tlie owners and captain of a ship may be made liable may be absolutely hi reference to some two or tliree articles belonging to some unknown person in a cargo of 5,000 tons, yet in such a case the whole ship is to be forfeited. No one supposes that the Executive would give effect to such a provision, but this i provides the round-about course of forfeiting the ship, and then the Governor General in Council steps in, and, contrary to the law, avoids the forfeiture, after it has taken effect by operation of law. The very idea of smuggling is to get goods passed in without paying the proper revenue. We cannot divorce that meaning from the word ""smuggling."" A person may, by inadvertence, take delivery of 50 cases as containing some article which is on the free list, when, in point of fact, those cases contain something else which is not on the free list, but which is subject to a high rate of duty. The London shipper may ship them fraudulently, but the owners of the ship might be absolutely ignorant of the contents. They take the description of the contents of packages as the shipper describes them. A shipper in London could ship 50 cases said to contain drapery when, in point of fact, they might contain whisky, or any other highly dutiable article. responsible in that case. as the clause stands. I could quite understand a man beUeving that such a thing is not intended, but clause 214 provides that any ship used in smuggling shall be forfeited to His Majesty. In this case, the ship would be so used by this person in London. wish to insert. If my honourable friend's suggestion were put in, and the intent to cheat the Customs were an element are to use the in the forfeiture, tliat would meet the case. I am sure my right honourable friend would not say that where there was no intent to defraud, a ship should be forfeited, but the words used are so wide tliat that could happen. a mistake in the Bill. or a deliberately intended proposal. In either case, it is onr duty to look into it . the whole definition. my honourable and learned friend says that.

I think that is too severe. I will go with the Minister as far as he wishes in repressinganything intentionally wrong, and in inflicting a penalty even for technical errors where it is necessary to protect the revenue. however, in designating with a criminal name something which is not a criminal act. J would suggest to the Minister, if he desires, to pass tliis clause first, and as I agree that we should settle our terminology before we deal with the Bill, that he should undertake to recommit it . furtlier consideration of the clause will undoubtedly be given. recornmitted, we can proceed to deal with subsequent clauses, and if they are found to contain penalties too severe for the definition of ""smuggling"" as set out in this drastic interpretation clause, we shall have an opportunity of altering, its terminology. simply wish to add a word or two in relation to what has been said since I last spoke. One of my objections is to the term ""smuggling,"" which describes an admitted crime, being, applied to what may not be a crime at all. The Minister in charge of the Bill can easily arrive at all he wants by, at the most, putting in another interpretation for the passing of entries by mistake or for improper importation. If he desires, he may put in something describing tliat offence, bub to apply the term "" smuggling"" to an unintentional offence is like applying the term "" murder"" to the act of a man who has caused the death of another without any such intention. smuggling in a variety of ways. I think it is ahighly reprehensible thing, but there are many outside tlie House who hardly feel so strongly about it , to defraud the Customs, in relation to small matters. If they are made bo recognise that this is a very serious offence, it will be all the bebber. As regards bhe clause dealing wibh bhe forfeibure of shipSjI should mention bhat after I moved the second reading of this Bill aremark was made by an honourable member as to the limitation of the powers of forfeiture contained in recent Imperial legislation. I have been able to trace that provision, and I find that a limitation is placed on the value of ships which can be forfeited. I am inclined to think we shall do well to engraft the same principle on the legislation which is contained here. I regreb that I did not refer to tlie matter on the second I do not believe, reading, but I may say now that it is our intention to deal with it . sire to call the attention of bhe Minisber to clause 242. look for bhe probecbion of bhe Chair, and bhat I brusb will be given bo me.

This is a very useful covering clause which applies to all penalties, and I should like to ask the Minister in charge of the Bill to take a note of a suggestion which I desire to make. I do not propose to move an amendment, but it is at this point that we could provide a useful clause enacting what are tlie State Acts that no longer apply to the Custonis of Australia. In the Defence Act which was introduced the other evening tliere is a clause which provides thatThe State Acts specified in the 1st schedule to this Act shall not apply to the defence force. In the schedule a list is given of almost all the Acts of the different States which relate to the defence forces, and it is very useful to know tliat these Acts no longer are in operation. simplify this Act, so that a man may know that the whole of tlie law so far as the Customs are concerned, is contained within its ambit, the better it will be. I would therefore ask the Minister for Customs to consider whether he should not introduce in this B ill a clause similar to that which appears in the Defence Bill. I have had in the course of my experience to study not only the Customs Acts of the various States, but also the Acts relating to Customs indirectly, and I have found them a very confused and chaotic mass. It would be very distressing to a man who was looking for a plain sailing chart in the Commonwealth Customs Act to find that he must also read the Customs Acts of the various States. I have no doubt that under sections 108 and 109 of the Constitution Acti t is competent for the Commonwealth to enact, as it is going to enact in the Defence Bill, that such portions of existing State Acts as refer to the same subject as the Commonwealth Act shall cease to operate. Sir JOHNQUI CK (Bendigo) -In reference to the last suggestion, if my honourable and learned friend's ideas could be carried out, it would be very convenient indeed, but I would suggest for consideration the question as to how we could, in dealing with these Acts, decide that certain State laws are to be repealed. AVe have no power of repeal. the word used; but we might say tliat certain apply. action whicli would be open to criticism.

Clause agreed to. Clause8 (State Collector). very properly provided in this clause that there shall still be a Collector of Customsi n each of the different States, but I wish to point out the enormous difficulties that will surround the Minister, who I see takes power to determine all questions tliat may arise. There are other clauses which will enable him to relieve himself of the necessity of directly determining these matters, but still the Minister makes himself the sole authority within his own discretion to determine all questions that may arise in the differclass of persons on whom this delegation ent Custom-houses of Australia, even though he be established in the permanent capital of the Eederation. I hope that the Minister will keep in view the advantage of leaving the determination in the first instance in the hands of the State Collectors of Customs. It would relieve the Minister of an enormous amount of personal trouble if he gave the collectors the power of determination, subject to his review. It would bring the cases before him in a much more manageable shape if some subordinate authority were first to go over them and come to a conclusion upon them. which is being adopted now. the determination in the hands of the Minister. gentleman will find very few cases in which the Minister is compelled to act. be impossible for tlie responsible Minister to do other than look over the determinations of the inferior authority. I have no doubt there are clauses whicli give the Minister the power of delegation to the collectors, but he wants something more than tliat, because if the Minister delegates his power of determination, the power exercised by the delegate will be exercised finally. I do not want to go as far as that. I think it is right that the Minister should delegate his power, biit that it should be done under conditions that would retain to him the controlling power. [REPRESENTATIVES.] BUl. is provided that the delegation shall not affect the power of the Minister to review any decision afterwards.

A t present there is absolutely no limit, and it may be given to any person in tlie service or out of the service, to a Minister of the Crown, or a person in Parliament or out of Parliament. Further, this delegation may include the power to make regulations. That is a tremendous power, and I would like to know if there is any precedent for it anywhere. a despotism for himself. creating our own precedents, but, so far, we have not had much opportunity of doing so. This clause gives power to the Minister to delegate his authority to other persons, but although the power is a wide one, he is not likely to exercise it recklessly, as he wil l be held responsible to Parliament for anything he may do. Sir MALCOLMM c EACHARN (Melbourne) I think this is a matter that the Minister should give consideration to, but I do not think it is right that these enormous powers should be given to any one, irrespective of who he may be. the Ministeri n its hands.

If the revocation were by mere word of moutli some question might arise as to when it was done or as to whether it was done at all, and considering the important matters that are involved, I think that we should provide that the revocation should be done in writing, and that it should be precise both as to the fact and the time of revocation. SupiDosing that it came to the knowledge of the Minister that a certain officer at Perth had been acting improperly, and it became necessary to revoke his delegation at once, the giving of instructions for sending a telegram would be equivalent to a revocation in writing. I moveTliat the words "" in writing"" be inserted after the word ""revocable,""line2. Amendment agreed to. another point which seems important. There is a provision tliat no delegation can prevent the exercise of any power by the Minister or comptroller. I must come back to the point I raised at first, because I see there mav be a great deal of dissatisfaction «'ind trouble unless the Bill clearly shows a power on the part of the Minister to review the exercise of the power he has delegated to a local collector. The delegation practically makes the local collector the Minister. The local collector may arrive at a determination which the Minister is dissatisfied with, and the latter may re-open the matter and arrive at a contrary decision. Minister should not have the power to do that, because his responsibility always remains, but the fact that there is a power of reversing the determination of the delegate should appear on the face of the Bill. language, but if the local collector is to act for the Minister as a judge to find and determine, it is very much better that the Minister's power to upset his determination should be in the nature of an appeal. Supposing there is a general authority given by the Minister, making the collector at Melbourne or Sydney the determining power for a certain class of business, there to show a method of appeal. Any review should be more in the nature of an appeal than in the nature of an arbitrary act on the part of a Minister. The Minister's finding is final, so that the Crown really has two strings to its bow. A person may succeed before the delegate, but the Minister may not like the decision, and may set it aside, so that the person who gets the benefit of the determination in the first instance is left at the mercy of the Minister, without any appeal or rehearing. I admit this is a difficult matter, but there will be great dissatisfaction if these powers are to be exercised by a State collector, and are exei-cised in such a way that the Minister can set them aside without any method of rehearing. However, I do not wish to place any trouble in the way of the progress of the Bill. Clause agreed to.

The section goes on to provide for officers who are not retained in the service of the Commonwealth, and there is a further provision as to pensions, gratuities, and so on, but under the Public Service Bill all officers are to have their existing and accruing rights. That being the case, I think the clause is unnecessary. observations on this clause are wide of tlie mark, because the expression "" this Act "" does not mean this Act.

I can understand the necessity for fixing the limits of ports, but to establish ports may be to name certain places and not to name others. For example, the Governor General may name Warrnambool as a port, and exclude Port Fairy. That wonld lead to a very great injustice being done to a large number of people who had been in the habit of using the latter port.

Clause 27If tlie Governor General shall so direct .by proof ascertaining the value of goods, packages clamation any State Act relating to the inspection or testing of imported goods may be executed and enforced by the Customs. Sir JOHN QUICK (Bendigo) I draw attention to this clause with a view to getting some idea as to its exact significance. In the first place, I would ask if it is advisable to legislate by reference in this matter 1 I think that a law so important, as that of inspection ought to be a law passed by the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and not one about which the Parliament at present knows nothing, namely, a law which may be in force in any particular State, l t is giving t'he Governor-Generali n Council power to legislate to legislate. It is a valuable check in the interests of the Commonwealtli that such inspection laws should be carried out subject to the control of the Commonwealth ancl of its officers, so as not to interfere in any way with freedom of trade. Sir JOHN QUICK States retain as a right, under section 112 of the Commonwealtli Act, the power to make and enforce tlieir own inspection laws, but these inspection laws must bc peculiarly applicable to the States in reference to sanitary considerations, and so on ; tliey will not be laws in reference to trade and commerce. The States have no power to pass laws even of an inspectional character in regard to trade and commerce. clause to allow the machinery Customs office to be lent to the Statest Sir JOHN QUICK I am objecting to this form of legislation. I consider that inspectional laws of a federal character ought to be passed by the Federal Parliament. This clause, however, proposes to utilize State inspection laws for federal purposes. federal servants to discharge State duties if a State wishes it. meaning. The clause provides thatIf the Governor General shall so direct by proclamation any State Act relating to the inspection or testing of imported goods may be executed and enforced by the Customs. That is to say, the work is to be done by a federal officer. Is it to be clone for federal purposes 1 may. be broken open if necessary by the federal omcers. Wide powers of that land ought to be taken by federal law. power. A State passes certain laws, which it is authorized to pass for the purpose of inspection which will be principally in regard to sanitary matters. Instead of casting upon it the obligation of appointing a staff of officers to do the work, which might be accomplished daily in a few minutes, the clause enables federal officers to undertake it . The State asks that the work may be done, and we do it . The clause is not intended to have the effect which the honourable and learned meinber attaches to it. observation that it means tliat we are to utilize State laws for federal purposes. Are we to have different inspection laws in different States% uniform ; federal laws must be uniform. Sir JOHN QUICK I object to the clause altogether. object of the clause as explained by the Attorney-General is a very useful one, and if it can be done with harmonious relations between the Commonwealth and the States, it ought to be very welcome. It will sure enormous expense, and it will avoid double not the object of the trouble and annoyance to the trading of the public.

The Customs have a Commonwealth range, so that these words are just a little vague. AlthoughI like the brevity of the clause, I would suggest that, in order to-secure greater clearness, we should add tlie words "" in tliat State."" The effect of that would be to make it perfectly clear that we are not taking a general power to use, for example, a Victorian law in Western Australia. -sufficient doubt to render the addition of those words necessary.

One veiy large sailing ship recently had a company of men to adjust her compasses on a Sunday, and I am told that there was really no occasion for the work to be done on that day. men would get double pay for it . unnecessary Sunday work should not be encouraged.

625,Mr Mccay (Corinella),"The debatelimit, or when the ship comes to the wharf, or when the goods are landed. There are difficulties in the way, but great trouble will arise if we do not define the exact time of importation. The clause provides that goods shall be subject to the control of Customs,as to all goods imported, from the time of actual importation. portation ? able and learned member suggest? anything; I am. not responsible for the interpretation clause. draw the attention of the Minister in charge of the Bil l to the fact that in paragraph (a), the words ""exportation to parts be3'ond the seas"" are used, while in paragraph (b) the words "" exportation into parts beyond the seas"" occur. Isi t meant by that that goods on. foreign-going ships are subject to the control of fche Customs from, the moment theyleave an Australian port until they reach their destination at some other port ? The exportation is apparently not completed until the vessel arrives at her port of destination. That is an assumption of authority on the high seas that I very much question our power to take is tliat the moment a ship leaves Australia for a foreign port the exportation is complete. This clause seems to me for all practical purposes to define correctly enough the jurisdiction of the Customs authorities over the goods, but the definition which the Governinent themselves have put on the clause seems to entirely conflict with any jurisdiction on their part over any goods which are not imported, which are not landed, and are not on the ship's manifest as goods to be landed. Goods are subject to our control only when ""they are in a ship and intended to be landed within the Commonwealth. The stores which ships bring with them from ports beyond the Commonwealth are not brought here to be landed. They are not on the manifest of the cargo, and as tlie clause very properly provides, they are not subject to the control of the Customs. sistent witli any notion of liaving control over goods in foreign ships, which are not to be landed within the Commonwealtli, because of course if there were any attempt to land goods not on the manifest, that would be what we call smuggling, and would be subject to the very severe penalties which are prescribed. Therefore, although I am thoroughly in accord witli the policy of the Government in connection with these ships' stores, I feel that there is a question involved which may become one affecting the position of the Bil l altogether, What is the time of actual imif what seems to me to be the proper view of the matter isnotrecognised. It -may be a very proper thing that we should have power given to us by the Commonwealth Act to deal with goods on foreign ships that are not to be landed in AustraUa, but I also desire to I think our powers do not extend as far as the Government would have us suppose. If the goodsare not intended to be landed here, they are not under the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, except for the purposes of preventing them from being surreptitiously landed. If goods are shipped not to be landed, and are honestly kept on the ship, they are-absolutely beyond the power of the Commonwealth. Our power of levying duty on goods only arises when those goods are landed or consumed within the limits of the Commonwealth. gentleman's definition of actual importation. finition "" where it is not otherwise clearly intended""; but I wish this point to be taken notice of* because it is a very serious matter. The Minister knows how jealous the high authorities of the Empire are of any attempt to exercise control over matters that'are not within our jurisdiction, and affecting the great shipping companies of the world, who have opportunities of representing their views in a very influential manner. My desire is not to quarrel with the policy or the intentions of the Government, but I think it would be a misfortune if in omendeavour to carry out desirable legislation we went beyond our authority, and brought about delay in the passing of the Bil l or litigation such as might be involved later on. I have had some little experience in the administration of Customs laws, and I hope I have made my views quite clear. My point is, that when a vessel brings ships' stores into That is entirely inconthe Commonwealth from ports beyond the seas, so long as those stores remain on the ship, and are not intended to be landed, and are not included in any manifest as goods to be landed in the Commonwealth, but are goods to be consumed at sea, or to be consumed",72,Honourable Members Oh

630,Mr Reid,"I do not attempt a deafter the vessel has left the Commonwealth, such goods are absolutely beyond our jurisdiction, and, therefore, we cannot put our seal on them, say, at Perth, with a power to keep that seal on them all the time the ship is out at sea. gentleman admits that we can seal them 1 solute power within its jurisdiction to protect the Customs revenue. No one will grudge them that power, and as far as harbour excesses are concerned, I would be very sorry to doubt the power of tlie Government. I say that when ships are lying in our harbors, the consumption of dutiable goods is a matter that the Commonwealth can deal with, but if any attempt is made to go beyond that, and seal down goods when they are outside the limits of-the Commonwealth, and prevent their consumption there, we shall be going beyond our power. There is full power to prevent the abuse of our Customs laws, but no power to interfere with the goods I have described when a vessel is outside tlie limits of the Commonwealtli. If the Minister will consent to consider this question, I am perfectly satisfied tliat we shall come to a conclusion that will enable us to avoid one of the dangers that might otherwise threaten the Bill. If we show any disposition to go beyond our powers, there are a number of influential people who will be only too ready to pull us up. the difference between "" importation "" and "" actual importation,"" and 1 do not think there is any necessity for the word "" actual."" deal in favour of striking that word out. toThat the word ""actual,"" line 4, be omitted.

Clause 32 (Custom control of goods). another of the clauses that will have to be considered in connection with the matter that we have been speaking of, because it raises the question of ships' stores again. Supposing stores such as I have referred to were sealed on a vessel leaving Eremantle and bound for Sydney, this clause would raise the point as to whether the ship's officers would have tlie power to take away the seal in order to enable them to use the goods during the time they were beyond the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth. fixed at £100, and I would like to know right honourable what would be the lowest penalty 1 £5. think that woulcl be rather high 1 for North Sydney has a proposal to make later on which will meet the case. Clause agreed to. Clause 33The Customs shall not be liable for any loss or damage, occasioned to any goods subject to the control of the Customs, except by the wilful neglect or wanton act of some officer. to draw the attention of the committee to the marvellous transformation that occurs wh6n a private individual has suffered through some neglect of a public officer. We have had a number of allusions to what will happen to a private individual if he comes within the reach of a person in authority; but here is a clause under which the authorities are not satisfied to compel an individual, whose, goods have been lost or damaged through the neglect of a public officer, to prove the neglect of the officer, but require him to go further and prove that tlie neglect was wilful. That is how a tribunal of Customs officials protect themselves and the Crown. If a man's goods have been damaged or lost through the neglect of a public oflicer in whose custody they are, surely that man ought to recover compensation without having to prove something more than mere neglect. If mere neglect is all that is wanted, the word "" w i l f u l "" is unnecessary, and so is the word "" wanton."" Of course I admit that an officer, in destroying a man's goods, might be carrying out the policy of the country for the time being, and in that is sense he might require protection ; but apart from that, I think it is beneath the dignity of a high State, when a poor wretch has lost his property through some neglect or act of a responsible officer, to place unnecessary obstacles in the way of recovering redress. I commend this to the generous feelings of the Minister, and suggest the omission of the words "" w i l f u l "" and ""wanton,"" leaving the clause to read "" by the neglect or act.""",73,Honourable Members Oh
