There can be not doubt whatever that the only effective means which has been proposed of helping the farmers is that suggested by the Government. imposition of a sales tax on flour. tax on bread. I ask the honourable member for Gippsland whether, as the responsible member of a government, he would say that it is a fair proposition to put a tax on bread for the purpose of relieving the wheat-growers, and to leave it to the unemployed to pay the tax ? We have endeavoured to assist both the unemployed and the wheat-growers, and have shown a broader sympathy than honourable members opposite, who can see only the wheat-growers. We can see both. That is the difference between us. The two sections of the community which need immediate relief are the wheat-growers and the unemployed, and we made provision in the Fiduciary Notes Bill and this bill, which is complementary to it, to help them, but the other place has rejected the Fiduciary Notes Bill. I notice that the Leader of the Opposition in the other place (Senator Pearce) has thrown out a challenge to the Government to take its courage in both hands, and go to the country in July on a single dissolulution. I am filled with admiration at the courage the right honourable gentleman himself shows. He knows perfectly well that the honourable senators who would face the electors in July under those conditions would have to face them before very long in any case. But even if they were defeated in July they would still retain their seats until the end of the following June. The right honourable gentleman must know that if an election were held within the next month or two on a single dissolution, the position might be left exactly as it is, yet he talks about the Government taking its courage in its hands. The Labour party is the only party with a policy for giving immediate relief to the wheat-growers and the unemployed; but that policy has been ignominiously rejected by the other place. I say definitely that the bill which the Senate has rejected will be sent back to it at the earliest possible moment that it can be sent under the Constitution, and if it is then rejected we shall go to the country, not on a single dissolution the result of which could prove nothing, for it would leave the representation in another place practically as it is.

That is the policy which this Government will pursue; but the gentlemen who sit in party meetings with the Opposition, members in the . other chamber will have to take their responsibility for the suffering that will be caused in the meantime. The Government cannot perform miracles. It can but submit its legislative proposals as earnestly and forcefully as its limited powers permit. It can pass those measures in this House, and send them to the other branch of the legislature, but the responsibility for the suffering of the wheat-growers and the unemployed in the meantime lies at the door of the friends of honourable senators in all the parties opposite. I regret that this position has arisen.

If there had still been any lingering uncertainty, the letter which the Treasurer has addressed to the Chairman of the Commonwealth Bank Board, which was read in the House this morning, would have removed the last lingering remnants of doubt.

It is true that if an election were held next July, eighteen senators who, incidentally, with the exception of one, are opposed to the Government, would face t i e electors, and, if not re-elected, taken action on this occasion? would still retain their seats until the 30th of June of next year. This Commonwealth of ours should not be regarded as a geographical area, but as a community of men, women and children. The position is so critical that the only way to deal with it adequately is by an appeal to the people themselves. If the people gave a definite verdict upon the issues that would be submitted to them at an early election, a solution would be found, notwithstanding the difficulty to which the Prime Minister referred, and irrespective of the composition of the Senate. Something would have to be done. As an alternative, because of the preliminaries necessary to a double dissolution, there must necessarily be a delay of some four to five months. solution, and this Government were returned on its policy, would the Senate then turn upon its vote and carry the Fiduciary Notes Bill? position to give guarantees on behalf of individual senators is not head of the Opposition. cannot speak for the Opposition. name the honourable member for EdenMonaroi f he does not obey the Chair. national crisis of a most extreme character, which demands our serious consideration. If there were an election and the will of the people were unmistakably declared, the members of another chamber would have to pay very real deference to that verdict. The position of the nation is more acute and critical than it has ever been before, and while I do not suggest for a moment that the Senate would accept uncritically any proposals that a victorious government, fresh from an election, might choose to put forward, I contend that there would be every inclination to deal in the fairest possible manner with those proposals, and to recognize that something would have to be done. member suggest that the people have at any time had submitted to them proposals for a fiduciary note issue, except on one occasion, the Parkes by-election? The honourable member may remember that on that occasion a Labour majority of about 10,000 was changed into a Nationalist majority of approximately 10,000. No mention of a controlled inflation of currency and credits was made in the policy speech of the present Prime Minister at the last election, nor was it ventilated by any other honourable member on a single platform. The Labour party had not then discovered that along the lines of inflation all our difficulties could be made to disappear. I put it to the Prime Minister that the country cannot wait for the long delay indicated by him, and that the best course to adopt is to have an election early in July. I do not couple with that any statement that the Senate in its survivI am not in a ing condition until the following July would uncritically accept every proposal that the new Government might advance, but I do say that, if the people unmistakably declared their will at that election, Parliament would be in a much better position to deal with the financial and other problems that confront the nation than it is at present.

Not only are some 60,000 wheat-growers and 300,000 workers, with their many dependants, immediately affected; the prevailing distress extends over a still wider returned to us? How, also, did another area, and how does the Nationalist party propose to deal with the problem with which we are confronted? In another place the pivotal measure of the legislative programme constituting the policy of the Government has been rejected. What do honourable members opposite offer as a substitute for what we have proposed ? It is conceivable that a policy better than that formulated by the Government might emanate from the parties on the other side of the chamber, but at least the chamber. In the light of this experience, Government and the people have the right to expect that the Opposition shall enunciate their programme, so that all may understand what is involved in it. The Leader of the Opposition said that the Government has an alternative to a double dissolution, that it should send this House to the country in July. He claims that if that were done one-half of the members of another place would also have to face their constituents, that if a No solution, therefore, lies in that verdict were given in favour of the Government, our policy could be implemented in the following session. But is that so? How can the honourable gentleman, or any one else in this House, give such an assurance? If , as a consequence of such an appeal to the country, the policy of the Labour party were emphatically endorsed, we should have no change in the personnel of another place-wit h the exception of one representatives-unti l twelve months from the 1st July next. That is what the Leader of the Onnosition is apparently ignoring. The honourable gentleman say3 that the members of another place would have to recognize and give effect to the verdict of the people. But can any one deny that this Government obtained an emphatic verdict from the people in October, 1929? the Opposition ( Mr Latham) suggests that the Fiduciary Notes Bill was not then part of the Labour party's programme. Of course, it was not. But arbitration was part of its policy. How did another place treat the amending Arbitration Bill sent up to it from this House? Did it not so mangle it that it was almost unrecognizable when it was place treat the Central Reserve Bank Bill, which certainly was part of the declared policy of this party during the 1929 election campaign? In their treatment of legislation introduced by this Government, and passed by this House, the members bf another place have ignored entirely the definite mandate which we received from the people. In connection with the Central Reserve Bank Bill, the Senate flagrantly flouted this House, and to this day it has not returned the bill to this are we justified in assuming that, if there were another appeal to the people in the near future, the members of another place would take any notice of the verdict, given at the polls?

Tuesday last, only an hour after the meeting of the House, the Leader of the Opposition, in quite a dramatic manner, formally moved the adjournment ostensibly to direct attention to the state of the public finances, but intended, I suggest, to re-assert his claims, slender as they may be, to the leadership of a great party, or to bring about a division upon which the Government would be defeated. Well, the division took place, and what a sorry spectacle we had! members "" gagged "" themselves, with the unanimous approval of the House, the members of which were only too glad that the tide of their oratory should be stemmed, and insisted on a division upon what, in other circumstances, would have been a purely formal motion. The Leader of the Oppositon has told us that one thing that can l if t this country out of its present difficulties is a sound policy of finance.

And this, I remind the House, is the immediate Honourable problem that should engage the attention of this Parliament.

He has been going round the country indulging in humorous speeches, and making strange statements about the alleged magic of changing a £10 note into a £5 note, or vice versa, and leading the people to believe that real money cannot be made available by the means of the fiduciary issue, or the adoption, by the banks, of the policy put forward by this Government. He implies that a fiduciary £1 note would not be real money, whereas an ordinary £1 note is real money. Possibly we may understand the honourable member's difficulty in this matter if we take has emanated from the Nationalist party. cognizance of his frequent assertions that he knows nothing about finance. And yet, by certain sections he is put forward as the saviour of the country, largely because of his financial policy! He declares himself to be innocent of all knowfrom the remarks that have been ledge of finance, and yet ridicules this Government's attempt, by means of its financial policy, to solve Australia's problems. The Leader of the Opposition ( Mr if the potential credit of the country is Latham), a couple of weeks ago, advanced a proposal that he claimed would furnish a means of providing immediate assistance for the wheat-growers. With a great flourish of trumpets, and with announcements in the press throughout Australia, the "" Latham private loan"" was launched. Since then, no one has heard anything about it. well indeed. bility of raising a loan of such dimensions as would be of real assistance to the limited. But so also was the fiduciary wheat-growers, except it be handled and backed by the Government. A loan issued by private individuals, unsupported by the credit of the Commonwealth or of governments, has no hope'of success, because the farmers cannot give any security to cover' such advances. need it most. need financial assistance most cannot give when he describes that class of money any security to cover such advances. That was fully recognized at the Premiers' Conference held in February last, when it was decided to make available to the wheat-growers the sum of £6,000,000-£3,500,00 0 through the Commonwealth by way of a bounty, and £2,500,000 through the States by way of advances to individual farmers. It was realized that those advances would have to be made to the farmers without any security, because whatever security they may have is already pledged up to the hilt. The suggestion that a proposal of that nature can be set aside, and yet that a private loan can be placed on the market to raise a sufficient amount to render the same measure of assistance, is preposterous. Such a proposal was doomed to failure from the outset. Yet that is the only concrete proposal that We have to depend upon the resources of the Commonwealth, whatever those resources may be, to assist farmers and others who are in distressed circumstances. The inference to be drawn made by the honourable member for Wilmot( Mr Lyons) is that there are no resources in Australia. He argues that, if resources are created, or utilized by means of a fiduciary currency, or 3ome similar government measure, this must be denounced as fictitious money; that it is not real money. Apparently, the honourable member does not realize that what gives a value to the Australian pound note in circulation to-day is, not any intrinsic worth that it possesses, but the fact that it must be recognized and accepted as legal tender.

Eveni f those notes were issued to the f u l l extent of the authority given under the Fiduciary Notes Bill, every one of them would have the same backing as an Australian note, and each would be legal tender for the payment of any kind of debt or monetary obligation in the Commonwealth. I invite the honourable member for Wilmot to explain what he means as unreal money, and to show in what way that which he can magically produce is real money.

That is not the way to test this question, and to provide a solution of the grave problems that so urgently need solving. The efforts of the Government have been frustrated in another place. The Nationalists are now, and have been for some time, in an exceedingly happy position. From 1922 to 1929 they had a majority in both houses of the Commonwealth Parliament, and in addition had their appointees iu the best strategical places in the administrative field. They were defeated overwhermiiigly in this House in 1929, the aggregate number of votes cast for this Government being 1,750,000, while those secured by all the parties that sit opposite totalled only 1,200,000. Yet the Nationalists have continued to rule in another place. They still control the legislation of this parliament, and their policies are still being administered by their adherents in certain administrative and strategical positions in the Public Service of the Commonwealth. it should be so. The honourable member for Henty( Mr Gullett), and the honourable member for Warringah ( Mr should wait for three, four or five months, Parkhill), when particularly provocative, have challenged the Government to show what it has been able to do since it was entrusted with the control of the affairs of this country. been "" You have been eighteen months in office; what have you done?"" They have deliberately ignored the fact that another place has rejected our legislation; that this Government is in oflice, but not in power. The legislature is still under the control of the Nationalists or of those who have prejudices in that direction. If any parliamentary body is responsible for the economic difficulties, the distress and the starvation that are being experienced in Australia to-day, it is not the Labour party, but the Nationalists, who have the dominance of Parliament, still enjoying a majority in another place. The Leader of the Government' ( Mr Scullin) has put the case cogently and forcibly, and in a way that cannot be ignored. While Ministers have the support of the 40 members who sit on this side -it cannot be expected, weakly and meekly, to hand over the government to the 35 members of the multifarious and heterogeneous parties that occupy the benches opposite. tionists to support you. cannot be expected to surrender simply because of a clamour raised by the Opposition, or because of the attitude of the reactionary interests that are entrenched in another place.

The Prime Minister( Mr Scullin) and the Treasurer ( Mr Theodore), by their fervid speeches, have evidently tried to hide the fact that they have cold feet on the question of an appeal to the people.

The Government said a year ago that it could finance the wheat farmers to the extent of 4s. a bushel by a system which would allow the farmers themselves to raise the price of bread in this country. Why does not the Government adopt that system now? The Government's policy, although it has been long camouflaged, is now patent. Its scheme is to smash the Gommonwealth Bank, an institution which a former Labour government established, and to destroy the monetary system of this councredit at home and abroad. It must be try. I am glad indeed, that another place has taken a definite stand against that. The Government is trying to terrorize the Oommonwealth Bank Board to adopt a policy, which that body knows to be inherently unsound, and, if adopted, must bring ruin to Australia. Every country that has tried that policy has encountered disaster. The Government's policy is to abandon the gold stanfinancial statement that appears in the dard, although the Treasvirer has denied that. I ask the honourable member for Adelaide to withdraw the statement that the right honourable member for Cowper is telling a lie. ment has been in oflice for eighteen months. When the Labour party was in opposition, it attacked the Bruqe-Page Government for not taking immediate action to relieve unemployment. Yet, at the present time, the figures in respect letter that was read by the Treasurer this of unemployment are rapidly growing. One out of every four unionists in this country is out of work. The Government's policy has failed. The Treasurer says that it has not been able to do anything because of the holding up of the Central Reserve BankB ill ; but what difference would that make, if all the protestations that he has made on the floor ber is not in order in saying that anything that has taken place in this House is not honest and sincere. I ask him to withdraw those words. them. A year ago the Treasurer said that the passage of the Central Reserve Bank Bill would not be followed by an inflation of the currency of this country. Since then the Commonwealth Bank Bill, the Fiduciary Notes Bill and other measures have been introduced. The policy of the Government is now revealed, because all these measures are based upon naked inflation, and everything that the Treasurer stated last year to illustrate the soundness of his policy has gone by the board. This Government has lost its removed from office to enable confidence to be restored, not only to the people of this country, but also to people outside who wish us well. The only way to meet this national crisis is to obtain financial assistance from outside, and while this Government remains in office there is not the slightest chance of obtaining that assistance. That is obvious from every London newspapers. The people will not stand for the policy of the Government, and they should be given an opportunity to express their will. Why should this Government allow the unemployed to starve for another four or five months until it can do something to bring about a double dissolution? Its policy has failed, so why not go to the country and let us know exactly where we stand? Since we re-assembled at the beginning of March, every speech from the Government side has been of a purely electioneering character, and absolutely without substance. An instance of that is the long morning. The reading of that letter was certainly one of the grossest abuses of privilege ever committed in this House.

99,Mr Parker Moloney,"Th echusiasms that arise in a night and are gone which is not concerned strivings of those who hope, by means of a suddenly achieved unity of parties i u Opposition, to place back in power a government which was responsible so largely for the troubles under which Axistralia labours to-day. Dealing w i th the record of the right honourable member for Cowper( D r . Earle Page), the Melbourne Age, of the 28th of May, 1930, saidThe Leader of tlie Federal Country party haa taken it upon himself to diagnose Australia's ills und prescribe remedies. Few people are better qualified to speak of the nation's financial troubles, for none will deny Mr Pago the distinction of having made a notable contribution to their creation. But, to the surprise of the community, the erstwhile Treasurer does not apologize for the appalling muddle he left to his successor; he does not lament his countless neglected opportunities of avoiding some of the stressful difficulties with which others must grapple. At his inglorious going Mr Page left the national finances iu a condition so chaotic that the incoming Government was obliged to take unprecedented action in a desperate attempt to avert disaster. The limit of extravagauce and ineptitude had been readied. The ex-Treasurer, with a record of that kind, described in terms which fit him perfectly, has the temerity to try to place on this Government the responsibility for conditions for which he himself is so largely responsible. Ninety per cent, of the troubles from which Australia is suffering to-day have their origin in the mal-administration of the Government with which the right honourable member for Cowper was associated, and no chain of platitudes can shift the responsibility from him, and those associated with him. I do not wish to prolong this post-mortem on the WheatB ill , but I feel compelled to say that, whatever may be the cause of its defeat, or whoever may be responsible, the fact emerges that the wheat farmers of Australia are to obtain no relief, and must carry on as best they can. The Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), and the Ministerf o r Markets( Mr Parker Moloney), referring to the attitude of members of the Country party to the Fiduciary NotesB ill , stated that no alternative to that measure had been advanced by them. They would be more correct had they said that an alternative was put forward, but was not acceptthe next"" daya newspaper able to the Government -Whetheri t was with the wise or unwise, an alternative certainly was advanced. An amendment was proposed that money for financing the wheat scheme be raised by imposing a sales tax on flour. It is true that the Minister, in answering that proposal, outlined contemplated legislation for the creation of a compulsory wheat pool. That was . previously unknown to this party, and raised a complication. Most of the difficulties, however, could probably have been overcome had the Government taken advantage of the opportunity of appointing a committee of honourable members representing wheat-growing areas, under the presidency either of the Treasurer ( Mr. Theodore), or the Ministerf o r Markets( Mr Parker Moloney), to see whether it was not possible to devise ways and means of helping the farmers.

I believe that we are involved in difficulties which are world-wide in their incidence. I do not think that any government in Australia ever faced greater difficulties than the present Government is facing. It is only f a ir to say that, and the people, I believe, recognize it . Whatever one may think of the remedies which the Government has tried to apply, the clear fact stands out that the situation confronting it is one of extraordinary difficulty.

There is such a thing as a dignified withdrawal.

The temper of the farmersleaving the unemployed out of the question, although they are in an ugly moodis such that some time ago there was talk of 50,000 of them marching to Canberra. It is a good thing for this Parliament that they did not carry out that intention, because if they had been in tlw gallery last night and had listened to what was going on here, with the thrust and parry of party debate, and members, as it were, fiddling while Rome burns, they would have driven us out of the chamber like Christ drove the money-changers out of the Temple. marched to Canberra and heard the April the honourable member for the debate in the Senate, would they have enNorthern Territory ( Mr Nelson) asked dorsed the attitude of that chamber? [35] back to the issue of the Wheat Bill, in relation to the Fiduciary Notes Bill. When the promise was made by the Government that certain assistance would be given to the wheat-growers, not one word was said to the effect that such assistance would be contingent on the establishment of a fiduciary currency. Progressively, the amount of the offer has declined from 4s. to 4-Jd. a 'bushel and the last-named offer was tacked on to a most contentious financial measure. The loss of the Wheat Bill is not due to opposition to the principle of assistance to the farmers. Had the measure reached another place and failed to pass, it would have been only because of objection to the method of finance. That is the objection that was raised by members of the Country party in this chamber. So desperate is the position of the wheat growers that the country cannot be rehabilitated until this Parliament tackles the problem of removing the depression in the primary industries. Until that is done men cannot be set to work in the factories, and the implement and superphosphate works. At present many of the wheat-growers are hamstrung; they can do nothing. Consequently, the reduction of the area under cultivation this year will be enormous, and the standard of farming will be lowered by the use of unsuitable implements and the lack of superphosphates. Until the farmers are set to work at production upon normal lines, prosperity will not be restored to Australia. I am profoundly disappointed with the announcement of the Prime Minister that the Wheat Bill is to be abandoned. I admit the difficulties of the Government, and do not doubt its sincere desire to help the farmers; but it is not yet too late for Ministers to show their sympathy in deeds as well as in words, by accepting the proposal for a roundrtable conference to discuss the possibility even now of affording relief.

In submitting to this House a measure which provided for a reduction of £2,000,000 per annum in our sinking fund contributions, the honourable gentleman reminded the House that the previous Government had during the seven years it was in office contributed £2,000,000 annually towards the extinction of the national debt more than it need have done in order to conform to what might be regarded as reasonably good sinking fund provisions. Those five facts are in no sense platithat at present the two measures may be tudes, and they, without anything else, are a sufficient answer to the extraordinary assertions made by the Minister for Markets in regard to the administration of the Treasury by the right honourable member for Cowper, who may justly claim to have been responsible to some considerable extent for these things. I wish to add my protest against the action of the Government in withdrawing what I said the night before last, that there is nothing in the bill which connects it with the Fiduciary Notes Bill, notwithstanding that the Prime Minister( Mr Scullin), the Treasurer ( Mr of last night. Theodore), and the Minister for Markets( Mr Parker Moloney) have that that measure was the basis upon which the Government intended to finance it. this chamber we should take notice, not of what Ministers or honourable members may say about bills submitted to us, but of what the bills themselves actually contain. no reference to the Fiduciary Notes Bill. vides the financial machinery for its administration, is in exactly the sameterms as the machinery clause which appears in all loan bills. There is not even the minutest difference. The Prime Minister said last night that the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Latham) was perfectly correct in stating that this measure could not be disconnected from the Fiduciary Notes Bill. I challenge the accuracy of that statement, and in support of my opinion direct attention to the amendment which the Leader of the Opposition intended to move to this bill, with the object of making it impossible for fiduciary notes to be used to finance this scheme. I submit that the Leader of the Opposition has himself disproved his own contention by giving notice of his intention to move that amendment, which would have had the unanimous support of the party to which 1 belong. The amendment would have entirely divorced the bill from the Fiduciary Notes Bill. How, in the face of this, it can be said that the measure is necessarily dependent upon the Fiduciary Notes BillI cannot understand, for the honourable gentleman himself has shown entirely disconnected. In further support of my view of the situation I point out that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Gullett) had given notice of his intention to move an amendment exactly opposite to that foreshadowed by the Leader of the Opposition. Had his amendment been carried it would have connected this bill with the Fiduciary Notes Bill. If they were already conthe Wheat Bill.

I wish to refer, also, to the statement of the Minister for Markets and TransThe Wheat Bill contains port ( Mr Parker Moloney) that no definite alternative to the scheme of the Clause7 of it, which proWheat Bill for assisting the farmers has been proposed. I say definitely that a practical alternative was proposed. The Minister for Markets and Transport has challenged my statement, and said that I intended to move an amendment which stipulated that the proposed sales tax on flour should be continued for a period of five years. The fact is that the amendment which I circulated was in the following terms:Money borrowed under this a f t shall be redeemed within a period of five years by means of the proceeds of a sales tux fin Hour. I emphasize the words "" within a period of five years."" I realized that a private member might not be permitted to move",54,Moloney Th E Was The Attitude That One Would Expect

130,Mr Patebson,"It is extraordinarythis amendment; but I intended to appeal to the Minister to move it himself. The amendment left it open for the Minister «o fix any period he desired, up to five years, for the imposition of the proposed tax. sion to concentrate my argument upon the possibility of redeeming within twelve months the necessary loan to provide a bounty of £3,500,000 for the farmers. I know that the Minister has said that it would not be reasonable for the Government to impose a sales tax on flour because of the difficult times through which the country is passing. I admit that it would not be an ideal solution of our problem, but it would be practicable; and I impress upon the Minister that the adoption of my proposal would not place upon the people any greater burden in the shape of a higher price for bread than, will be placed upon them if the State Governments take the course, which the Minister has said he hopes they will take, of fixing the price of wheat for home consumption at 4s. a bushel. The imposition of a sales tax on flour under the conditions which I advocate would not raise the price of flour to any greater extent than it will be raised if the State Governments act as they have intimated they intend to act. Either of these courses will have exactly the same effect upon the consumers of Australia. Therefore, if the Minister for Markets agrees that this is. the sane thing to do-h e welcomes such action by State Governments-h e cannot logically say that it would be an unreasonable thing for this Parliament to do. must not be duplicated. duplication, because the State Governments have this action in mind. The farmers of New South Wales are not receiving a fixed price for wheat as the result of what is being done in that State. Eveni f this course were to be taken in the future by State Governments, it would have no immediate effect in assisting the farmers. -An honourable member may not anticipate the debate in committee. The bill is still before the House, and, irrespective of what the Prime Minister has said, it is possible for the House to proceed with it. myself merely to replying to statements made by the Minister for Markets. He agrees that it would be desirable to have action taken by State Governments with It was my intenthe object of raising the local price of wheat to 4s. a bushel. That would have the effect of raising the price of flour to exactly the same extent as if the maximum sales tax on flour were imposed by this Parliament with the object of wiping off the loan of £3,500,000 within twelve months. That is the best answer to the criticism of the. Minister for Markets. I say that it is a practical proposal, and it would afford immediate relief. It would be possible by this means to assist the wheat growers within a month, which could not be done if dependence were placed on a fiduciary issue. them in a week, if our fiduciary currency measure had been passed in another place. the position as we find it, and I appeal to the Prime Minister to use what appears to be the only practicable means of now giving immediate assistance to the farmers. This would involve no greater degree of hardship than would be imposed on the consumers if the State Governments took the action which the Minister for Markets desires them to take. The £3,500,000 which it is proposed under this bill to grant as a bounty could be paid off within twelve months, including 6 per cent, interest for action half of that period. I say one-half, because the amount would be steadily reduced, week by week, and it could be paid off in twelve months by a sales tax of £5 l is . per ton. honourable member considerable latitude, and I urge him not to take undue advantage of it. ing that since the Fiduciary Notes Bill has been defeated in another place, and that means of financing the Wheat Bill has gone, the responsibility of adopting some alternative method of giving immediate relief rests upon the Government. If the Government fails to adopt the practical suggestion that has been made, on it alone will fall the responsibility for",55,Moloney Th E Was The Attitude That One Would Expect

138,Mr Paterson,"I conclude by sayfailure to give immediate relief to the wheut-growers of this country. not propose to join in the political discussion that has arisen to-day. Ample opportunity will be afforded later to deal with the statements made by the Prime Minister this afternoon. I endorse all that has been said by the honourable member for Gippsland ( Mr Paterson) in regard to alternative measures, and I am speaking not so much on behalf of the farmers, great as their interests are, as for tbe people generally. It must be recognized that, owing to the heavy fall in the price of wheat, the position of the farmers is desperate. They are producing the wealth of this country, and if something is not done at once to enable tbem to continue the production of that wealth, the losses and unemployment that have already occurred must be increased. I suggest that before the Government definitclv decides to abandon this measure it should take notice of the request of the honourable member for Wimmera( Mr Stewart) that an effort be made to finance some other measure of relief that would be acceptable to the Parliament. If we allow the farmer to go down now, the distress next year will be worse than that being experienced at the present time. We must continue to produce wealth, if we are to obtain the outside assistance required to enable us to improve the conditions of our people. If all else fails, wo should try a compulsory loan. I would even go that far, rather than see Australia fall into the slough of despond. Question resolved in the affirmative.
