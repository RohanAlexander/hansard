He is reported to have saidI know that when the division came onThe division upon the tea dutythe honourable member for Eden-Monaro was looking for the Attorney-General, because that Minister had left the House in the face of an important division without pairing. Jt is possible that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was looking for me, and that I was not in the chamber, but I have reason to remember, because of the surprise which occurred in connection with the division, and because I have since consulted my diary, that I was within the precincts of the chamber from the commencement to the close of the sitting. I have not the least doubt that the honourable member for North Sydney made the statement in good faith in consequence of something which he heard. I am concerned only with the fact that I was in the building during the whole evening, and did not leave until after the division, was taken. I was paired for the division to oblige a member of the Opposition. sonal explanation, and in repty to the that the Commonwealth Constitution is Attorney-General, I wish to say that it is a similar to that of the United States of duty and a pleasure to accept his statement America, and that the American Congress unreservedly. WhatI said was in reply to voted £200,000 for the relief of the victims an unexpected interjection, and it might be of the Mount Pelee disaster, and that now excusable if, under such circumstances, at Crotty, in Tasmania, over 1,000 people I did not speak with the close accuracy are almost destitute because of the amalgawhich might have been expected had I mation of two mines there, will the Prime made a deliberate statement. I do not put Minister place upon the Estimates the sum my explanation upon that ground, however. of £10,000 to assist those pioneers ? I had ample justification for the statement, for on the night of. the division the distinct impression that it is not within -upon the tea duty, and shortly before the the power of the Commonwealth Parliament division took place, the Government Whipthe honourable member for Eden-Monarostated that the Attorney-General had left and I shall give the matter further considerthe House and had not paired. He then ation ; but I hope that what I say now endeavoured to obtain a pair for him, and put down the name of a representative of New South Wales, who at the time was absent from Victoria. I objected to the name being used, because the honourable member to whom it belonged had told me in a recent conversation that he was in favour of the duty upon tea, and another pair was found. The Government Whip was certainly seeking a pair for theAttorneyT o make a personal exGeneral, although, I accept the statement of the latter, and that he was within the precincts of the House. I could support my statement as to the seeking for a pair by the testimony of other honourable members if I chose to bring them into the question, but I do not feel justified in doing so. I am quite satisfied to leave the matter where it is, and stop at the statement of facts within my own knowledge. ence to the statements made by the A t torney-General and the honourable member for North Sydnej, the fact that the division T alluded to was takennearly twelve months ago makes it impossible for anyone to be very clear as to what members were or were not within the precincts of the House at the time. allow a debate to take place upon a personal explanation. The Attorney-General was within his rights in making such an explanation, but I am not sure that the honourable member for North Sydney was in order in following him, and I am certain that the honourable member for Eden Monaro will not be in order in proceeding to discuss the matter further. MrO ' MALLEY , In view of the fact Sir EDMUNDBARTON I am under to vote money for such a purpose. The honourable member speaks in a good cause,",12,Setup

15,Mr Brucesmith (Parkes),"I should miration for the Prime Minister, andto take part in the great and responsible work of carrying on the business of the Commonwealth. wanted of the impression that was created by the Prime Minister's speech, is it not contained in the memorable event which took place in this Chamber when the honourable member for Kooyong, the honourable member for the Grampians, and the honourable member for Flinders, who were intimate friends of the Government and sab on the Government benches, speaking in pathetic terms, told us that they had been deceived by the Prime Minister and bhe Governmenb, and bhab, in order bo pub bheir protest into the most definite form, they would cross the Houseand sit in opposition ? Does it need any torrent of language to bring the position home to the minds of the public?

I shall continue bo lose confidence in him. have wabched bo see how far he has realized his own high sbanclard of political idealism. The Prime Minister proceeded to Great Bribain as a kind of emissary from the Australian people, to represent them at what may be looked upon as an initial form of Imperial Council, which may in future years determine bhe destinies of the Empire, of which we are a part. I watched to see how far he would show himself fit to occupy that high position. We all rememberand it has a bearing upon our present day politics-readinghis the English newspapers from time to time. It litis been claimed as a subject for credit that he spoke frequently at great functions, and that he never in the whole course of his circuit of representation committed tralia to a single opinion. I submit thab bhis reflecbs no greab credib upon him, because, albhough he was nob authorized to commit this Parliament to any particular measure touching the interests of the Empire or the Commonwealth, he had full authority to express his own opinion as to what ought bo be done. We find, however, bhab from firsb to last there was a series of swollen speeches, ascertained bhab he is required for bhe Mr Bruce Smith. speeches f u l l of swollen Imperialism, regarding what ought to.be done in the interests of If further proof were the Empire, in absolute forgetfulness of bhe fact bhab the policy of his own Government was calculated bo completely undermine theunion of the Empire. What could one think ?' I was reminded of the process adopted by some enterprising butchers when they wantto sell veal. They blow it out for exhibition in their shop windows. That seems to me to afford a forcible illustration of bhe kind of ubberance we had from the right honourable gentleman.

The Empire was bo beeverybhing, and yeb bhe righb honourable genbieman had broughb forward a programme under which bhe subjects of his own King were absolutely barred from passing from one part of the Empire to another.

17,Utterances As Reported In Mr Bruc Esmith,"No ; bub I haveI have paraphrased the section of the Act, of it : It was aimed at keeping out large bodies of men, who might be contracted for in other countries, and brought Out under engagement against the interests of the working classes already here. It was quite open to the Government to say that they would be no party to such a provision. They might have said that they were entirely at one with the socialistic party in preventing men from being brought here under contract at rates of pay below those current here, and ib would have been an easy matter for them to hold as null and void every contract which had been entered into in other parts of the world. Taking bhe section as ib sbands, however, the Prime Minister is made the arbitrator as to whether men, who are broughb out here under engagemeufe, are required in the country. Anderson, or by the workmen? Wasi t ever intended by Parliament that the Prime Minister should, on every occasion that a man or a number of men happened to be landed here under contract, be constituted a kind of Royal commission to make an inquiry into the economic circumstances of the trade affected? what I have said I do so unreservedly. That is .what the Prime Minister undertook to accomplish. He undertook to solve the problem without making any inquiry of a widespread character. Thus these English artisans were detained for six days in a sorb are bo be found-probabl y abroad. of moral quarantine whilst bhe Prime Minister formed an opinion as to whether half-a-dozen additional hatters were required amongst 4,000.000 of people.

27,Mr Bruce Smith,"I have seen the local partnership, are permitted to enter the Commonwealth only upon condition they do not permanently remain here. my early days I may have formed altogether too high ideals of public life and public men. I may have built up expectations in regard to State and Commonwealth politics that the big men of Australia gradually come to the front, and that the leaders of the people would endeavour to conduct the affairs of this great country upon lines which reflected credit upon us as a State, and upon the Empire to which we belong. But can decadence, can personal declension, have a finer illustration than is afforded by the spectacle of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth preaching this Empire ideal in England, and returning to Australia to carry out a policy of wretched, miserable parochialism that would be unworthy of the smallest South American republic ? I admit that I have formed too high ideals, and that, after twenty years of political experience, I shall have to lower tlie standard which I had set up. When I see important questions treated in this way-when members of our own nationality, treated in this fashion, how, I ask, can a man like Mr defraud the revenue. I do not object to Chamberlain, if he knew the facts, hope that we shall sacrifice our miserable local ambitions to fall in with his great Imperial scheme? Crown colony, and he does not appreciate the character of the public men with whom we have to deal when lie imagines that we aie ready to cast aside our local affairs and rise to the level of the Imperial policy which he pictured in his recent speech. So much for the general administration of this country. I come now to the question of the Customs administration. years experience in different phases of commerce, I do not intend to enumerate all the cases of Customs persecution-I hesitate to describe them as such-which have taken place under the regime of the present Government. instances of hardship some of which are stronger than those which have been placed before the House. When the Customs Bill was under consideration I remember that I was one of the first to. draw attention to. the clause in it which reversed the old time honoured provision that a British citizen was presumed to be innocent of any crime until he was proved guilty. strongly and frequently upon that principle, Mr Bruce Smith. and received satisfaction only when the that House was assured by the Minister for In Trade and Customs, in the most measured language, that although this arbitrary vjower was being placed in his hands it would be exercised with discretion, and that justice would be tempered with mercy. What has been would the result? The right honourable gentleman is reported in the British AnstroJasmn-as was stated by the honourable member for Wentworth in the speech which he made last night to have admitted his belief that the great bulk of the merchants of Australia are honourable men who are a credit to Australia and to the British Empire. Yet, although a similar provision was contained in the Victorian Tariff Act, no one in the history of that State, since 1866, when its Customs laws were changed, ever heard of any series of persecutions which approached in hardship those which have occurred under the Commonwealth administration during the last two years ? I do not object to any provision for the detection and punishment of dishonest men. I have no sympathy-and. I know someI see our fellow beingsthing about the work of the Customs department-wit h merchants who attempt to offenders in cases in which blank invoices are brought to this country for fraudulent purposes being punished, not by fine, but by So far, he has only visited a absolute imprisonment. WhatI do protest against is the fact, which was commented upon with so much eloquence by .the honourable member for Wentworth last evening, that hundreds of highly reputable merchants have been hauled before the police court with drunkards and criminals, compelled to remain there-sometime s hours-unti l they could be charged, and fined £ 5 for having committed AlthoughI have had many a miserable error which the prosecutor fertile Government has admitted did not contain an element of fraud. What is the do not effect of such administration ? Its effect is to put the rogue upon an equality with the honest man. Not merely is a member of I have heard of many this great and honourable class'of the community treated as a rogue, but the real rogue, who ought to be punished by imprisonment, is practically consoled by being reminded that hundreds of reputable merchants are upon an equality with him. Thus, in addition to the insult which has been offered to the mercantile classes of Australia, the Government have offered an inI commented centive to crime in that they have made it less heinous and objectionable. It is a very regrettable circumstance that there has been introduced into the Customs administration o i this country a man admittedly of very .great ability in his own walk of life, but with no knowledge of commercial practices. For aught I know to the contrary, the Minister may be a very excellent advocate -and lawyer in his own State, but I say un-. hesitatingly that it was a mistake to introduce a gentleman of his calibre and training into the mercantile operations of Australia, .seeing that he could not possibly have acquired any knowledge of value concerning -commercial practices. To me it is perfectly -clear, as a man who has had years of commercial and legal experience, that the right honourable gentleman entered upon the work of his department in the full conviction that the mercantile classes of Australia were a parclearly errors that the Crown Prosecutor cel of unprincipled individuals who were attempting to rob the poor man by evading the payment of duty upon their goods.

I have other occupations besides politics, AndI am pleased that I have; I should be sorry to depend on the latter. WhatI say is that this is not the attitude in which to approach the mercantile classes of this country. What has been the result of all this administration 1 Honourable members ought, in all fairness, to ask themselves whether 2 F in the whole of the two years during which the right honourable gentleman has been at the head of the Customs administration of Australia one substantial case of fraud has ever been brought against any member of the mercantile community. I know that the Minister will mention the Queensland case, and, no doubt, that is a case for which he may take some credit. It was a very complicated case, and whether or not the offence was driven home to the head of the firm I am not prepared to say. But if we compare the administration during the last two years and a half with £32,000,000 of imports per annum, what have we as the result of this wild and savage administration ? People have been prosecuted for a series of pettifogging errors, so has over and over again had to admit in court that there was no charge of fraud. Yet, in these cases, it was asked that a fine of £ 5 should be imposed, and, without it being realized what it meant to the heads of great firms who have en joyed an unblemished reputation for perhaps half a century-fro m a time when the Minister.himself was in knickerbockers-thes e firms have been brought into police courts and subjected to this humiliation. The Minister may depend that the people of the Commonwealth will not forget his administration. There is no doubt The honourable that when the Government next appeal to the people for an endorsement of their administration, the effect will be felt-per haps silently-bu t it will astonish Ministers as showing how what may appear to be little things lead to great results. I now pass to one other matter under the head of If that is the administration. We all remember that when the Customs Bill was under discussion, we understood that a distinction was to be made between sugar grown by black labour and sugar grown by white labour. It was perfectly clear to me-thoug h there may have been some subtle language used-that the intention was that every ton of sugar should pay an excise duty of £ 3 , but that where it was grown by English or white labour there should be a rebate of £ 2 . We find, however, that thousands of tons of sujrar which have not been grown by white labour but by black labour-the mere harvesting being done by white labour-hav e earned this rebate over and over again. AlthoughI do not like the law, when a law is once made. I like to see it honestly administered. But we find that in the case of hundreds of",16,Governor General S Speech Address In reply

If we make a law, no matter how objectionable, it should be carried out; but I say that in this relation the law has not been carried out, because side by side with the drastic provisions on which I have commented, we had an undertaking from the Minister that this enactment would be used only in case of actual fraud. learned member never had anything of the sort, and I defy him to point it out. the Government programme contained in the speech of His Excellency. My first observation is that the speech, in its very opening,, contains a remark of a very prominent character, which I say is unjust towards the free-traders of Australia. The paragraph of His Excellency's speech to which I refer begins thusIt was found impossible, by reason of the exvernmenb was pub forward, the people of. haustive discussion of the Federal Tariff, to deal Australia were bold bhab bhere was bo be am with any but the most urgent of the proposals then brought before you, and renewed demands must now be made on your industry and patriotism before the Commonwealth machinery can be deemed complete. I ask any members on this or any side of the House to put fairly to themselves the question-What was the cause of nearly two-thirds of last session being occupied over the Tariff? We have had a boast in the interval, by the Prime Minister and by the Minister for Home Affairs, that bhe present Tariff is a fair compromise. But where does that lead us ? Doesi t not lead to the conclusion that it took twelve months of probest and debate on the part of the Opposition in order to produce a fair compromise ? was a fair compromise. ing of what the honourable member for Melbourne Ports may think. I am talking of what the Prime Minister has said.. I am further talking of what the Minister for Home Affairs has said, and the claim made by these right honourable gentlemen is that the present Tariff is a fair compromise. Why did it take twelve months of hard fighting on the part of the free-traders to I say that thereproduce a fair compromise? Wasi t not because of the notable breach of faith by the Prime Minister a ' breach of faith which the members of the Opposition and the people of the country who support bhem protested against?

But the question was not dropped until it was pointed out to the members of the Government that such pensions were impossible, for the reason that it would benecessary to raise £ 2 in taxation for every 10s. required.

We see here pursued the same old practice of I am now talking of State politics, and of practices which I thought would be abandoned in the federal atmosphere-proposin g everything it is possible to conceive, in the hope that some day the opponents of the Government may adopt the programme, and lay themselves open to the charge of stealing their proposals.* No one who knows the Constitution, and who lead the original programme of the Government with care, can liave failed to see that every conceivable legislative measure was crammed into it, whether or not there was the means of carrying it out, in the hope that the Government might hereafter bo able to accuse the Opposition of taking part of that programme. That is a very old trick in State politics -a n old trick in the lower grade of politics-bu t it was adopted at the beginning by the Federal Government, and is repeated now. Who can say, for instance, that the Inter-State railway to Western Australia is likely to be carried out during the reign of this Government or of this .Parliament? like to go to heaven, but whether or not we shall all get there is another matter.

49,Mr Bruce Smith,"Then the dihis intention to introduce the matter to the notice of the Commonwealth may have given Mr Chamberlain some hope that he would meet with that reciprocity which we are told to-day he looks upon as indispensable to his scheme; but he has now learned through the press that in the speech of the which contains the Government policy, the matter is one which has been left to the sweet by-and-by. nouncement made by this man, who now stands at the very apex of the British Government, that he cannot go on with the .scheme unless he has the sympathy and .reciprocity of the British colonies. But he has not got it. He finds that the Australian statesman who faithfully promised to recommend the scheme to his Parliament, and who inspired the telegram which went to tlie English people to show that he is in ""favour of it, has not the political courage to introduce it in this Chamber. We are coming to a pretty state of things in Australian politics, when the head and front of our political life goes to England like a great ambassador, and leads the people aud statesmen there to believe that we are prepared to join in this great Imperial policy, to rise to this great Imperial height, and, when he comes back, is afraid to introduce the subject to Parliament. I have mentioned are mere padding, not in the sense that there is no merit in them, but because they have been crammed into the Government programme with no possibility of realization. tradesman will dress his shop window with empty biscuit tins, or cigar boxes, to make a show to impress his customers, the Government, to impress the public, not. to impress the members of this House, place a number of empty promises in their programme, merely to be able to point to the large stock of legislative measures of a practical character they say they are going to pass. In addition to those I have mentioned, we have the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company's agreement, upon the banking laws, and legislation in regard to preferential trade aud the conversion of State debts. Out of twenty proposals which are solemnly put forward as if they were really part of a practical scheme of legislation which the Ministry to introduce, ten are palpably impossible of realization this session. The Government, however, think that in this way they can Mr Bruce Smith. mislead the people of the country. I should Parliament like now to say a word or two in regard to measures which I think are of a practical character. I take first that which, to my mind, is of the most importance. I regard the mere choice of a capital site as unimportant, but I consider it of the most proGovernor-General, found importance to the whole Commonwealth that its Parliament should not sit in any one of the State capitals. If we were So we have the anmeeting in Sydney, I would be as averse to the arrangement as I am to our meeting in Melbourne. As the representative of another State, I have seen the great injury which is done to the interests of the Commonwealth by having its politics immediately under the criticism of the local press. I have seen, too, the effect of the present arrangement upon the attendance of honourable members. While the State from which I come is entitled to a representation of something like one-seventh more than that of Victoria, the actual attendance of honourable members last session gave Victoria a representation of something like one-seventh more than that of New South Wales. Why is the capital kept in Melbourne t It is not because of the action of Victorian members that nothing has been done. But do not the Minister for Home Affairs and his colleagues know that within half-an-hour every The measures which Victorian supporter can be rung up by telephone and brought here to vote in a division, while it takes the representatives of some of the other States, such as Western Australia, who have to come thousands of miles to Just as a miserable reach Melbourne, days .and weeks to get here. It is a crying disgrace to the honourable member's department that the federal capital question has not been pushed further. building a capital to come from ? statements which have been made as to the expenditure of millions of money being necessary to create a federal capital, legislation because I believe that £50,000 would do all that will be required for years to come; but I am averse to the meeting of the Parliament of Australia in one of the State capitals, where it can be largely influenced by the local press, and intend where its members are placed in such a position that one State gets a larger proportional representation than it should get, while another State is proportionately unrepresented.

51,Mr Bruce Smith,"I deprecate thethe last two years to justify the delay in settling the question ? What has been done within that time to settle it ? Two and a half years ago the Government were in possession of a full and most able report upon all the sites in New South Wales which had been submitted for consideration ; but all that has happened since is that there have been two excursions to those sites, in which a limited number of members of botli Houses took part. I said, two years ago, that the visits of honourable members to the sites would be useless, and I will give an illustration to show why they have been useless. One cannot by a mere cursory view of any site judge as to its fitness. Take the matter of climate alone. A party of members visited Albury on a very bad day, and the people of Albury were so struck with the unfairness of' a mere cursory judgment upon the suitability of that site that they have since protested that the day upon which honourable members visited it was not af air day by which to judge it. Now, if the weather, which we breathe and live in, ctinnot be judged by a visit extending over one, two, or half-adozen days, how can an opinion worthy of the name be formed of the water supply of a site, its accessibility, or the character of its soil-whic h is a matter for chemical analysis-o n the cursory visit of a few people who go there with every comfort provided for them ? The arrangement was a farce from beginning to end. Put that farce aside, and what has been done in the last two and a half years ? A commission has been appointed of gentlemen taken from four of the States, whose president, although a very capable architect, when looked at from the point of view of the people of his own State, and in comparison with a man like Mr Oliver, is not a fit person to lead the Government of the Commonwealth to a conclusion on the matter. So that, practically, absolutely nothing has been done for a period of two and a half years. No one can help drawing but one conclusion from this delay, and that is, 'that as the policy of the Government is a protective one, it is to their interest to set their face against a move from undoubtedly the most protectionist corner of Australia, and to stay there until they are forced out of their position by a charge of dynamite. This great question, which affects the whole body politic of the Commonwealth, has been allowed to go on from week to week, from month to month, and from year to year, without any attempt on the part of the Government to settle it. Then the question of conciliation and arbitration is mentioned in the speech. As a free-trader, I do' not want to be suspected of taking a bigoted, individualistic view of that question. Personally I expect no good from it ultimately ; but it is a question which involves so many aspects that I have always been prepared to hear all that could be said on its behalf, to consider the opinions of all outside authorities upon it , and even to go the length of watching with great care its actual operation in countries like New Zealand and New South Wales. These reasons carry great weight with me, quite apart from the actual merits of the question looked at economically. The working classes of the United States and the British workmen will have none of it . not like it. AVe are now ascertaining what certain large nations of workmen think of these questions, and it is a suggestive, if not a conclusive, fact that in a country which is essentially a commercial and industrial community, having a population of 80,000,000 people, the workmen will have none of it . for not accepting it . few months, a very valuable commission, composed of 23 trades unionists, was sent from England to the United States to ascertain how far and in what respects the conditions of the workmen of the United States differed from those of the workmen of Great Britain. In an edition of the Times issued a few weeks ago, there is a most interesting summary of the evidence taken, and of the report of the commission, under the heading "" Relations between Employer and EmployeBoards of Conciliation."" A Mr Mosely was charged with the conduct of the commission. Mr O'MALLEY -He paid its expenses. regarded by the Times as a most able and competent guide for the 23 trades unionists, who were selected as representatives of the more important industries of Great Britain.

56,Mr Bruc E Smith,"Yes, and he is to see for themselves something of American industrial methods, and of the relations between capital and labour in America. In a two-page summary of the result of that commission, published by the London Times, I do not find a word about compulsory arbitration. There are, however, some very significant remarks, which show that the' United States workmen assume towards employers of labour an attitude entirely different from that taken by the working classes of Australia. One of the delegates saysThere was a time in our trades union movement when a jingo spirit was dominant. Saner methods now prevail. I would commend that to the working men of this country. The 23 trade unionists who formed the commission must have had a distinct bias in favour of the working classes, but we find this very significant In many trades a joint committee of employers and employees meet periodically to settle rates for piece-work by mutual consent, and if such an arrangement were adopted all round I am sure it would be found beneficial: and tliis is * what is practically done in all American industries. Mr Cox, one of the members of the commission, remarksIn wages disputes and the relations between employers and workmen's organizations they have much to learn from us. It would be helpful if a committee of the leading trades' union leaders were to come over and make a personal investigation into our trade union methods and their relationship with the employer sections. There was a time in our own trade union movements when the jingo spirit was dominant. Saner methods now prevail, and a strike over a wage question is the exception rather than the rule. I do not make my observations upon this question without having great experience to guide me. I was one of the two originators in Victoria of the Employers' Union of Australia. ployers' Union of Australia during the whole of the time. I lived in Victoria. was one of a body, composed of representatives of the Trades Hall of Melbourne and of the Employers' Union, who drafted a constitution for a voluntary board of conciliation between employers and workmen. I have sat in the Trades Hall, Melbourne, . as president of the Employers' Union ciliation Board, and I have, with the workmen of Melbourne, settled on the most amicable lines quarrel after Mr Bruce Smith. quarrel between employers and employed. Without any legislation whatever, and with only the exhibition of a fair and honourable spirit between employer and employed, I have witnessed the. amicable settlement of what promised to be some of the biggest industrial struggles in Victoria. During my experience I have gained a great deal of knowledge of unionists and of employers, which is not altogether useless to me when I am endeavouring to think out this question, and with such experience, backed by 35 years of economical reading, I assert that the same thing that I have described could be' done to-day if only the jingo spirit were not so dominant in this young country. It has disappeared from the United States and from Great Britain, and when it ' disappears from this country, and the workers recognise that capital is, after all, in the same relation to the workman as is the plough to the farmer-the means by which he carries on his work--the y will see that instead of treating capital as an antagonistic element which should be driven out of the country, it should be looked upon as a friend to be courted, to be invited to stay and try its hand in furthering the interests of the community. Then tlie days for compulsion in anything will disappear. It must be taken as an axiom of political economy that capital is as timid as the shyest of game. It can fly away, not upon wings, but upon cable wires. It may also be laid down with 'equal emphasis that capital will never stay where it does not receive the best treatment. The best treatment is the most conciliatory spirit and the fairest attitude towards it . If this is the fact why should this jingo spirit be displayed ? Cannot our working men see that in showing this spirit they are merely discouraging tlie advent of new capital, and encouraging the departure of old capital from the country, I was president of the Emand so forcing themselves to return to first principles and elementary forms of work. I The capitalist puts his money into a venture admittedly in order that he may secure a reward for the use of it in the form of profit. The workmen of Australia say to the capitalist;"" It is your capital and you put it into this business, but we are not going to allow you to manage it . AVe are going to appoint a board-it does not and as president of the Conmatter whether it is called a AVages Board together or Arbitration Court-to determine the wages which you shall pay to your employees.",22,Governor General S Speech Address In reply
57,Statement By Mr Mosely,"We know that you can go to other countries, such as the United States and Canada, jind there find employment for your capital, but you happen to be in Australia and your draft for £1,000 is here. therefore ask you to put that money into an industrial undertaking, and we shall manage it for you. We shall decide the rates of pay to be given to your workmen, the number of apprentices which you shall have, and the number of hours which your workmen shall be called upon to work. All these things will be decided by three men."" great industrial masters who have had years -of experience. In New South Wales one of them is a Judge of the Supreme Courta lawyer-possibly , a man who has no more notion of practical commerce thanhasaclergy-jnan. I am not referring to the sitting President of the Arbitration Court in New South Wales, because it so happens that that .gentleman had some storekeeping experience before he went to the bar. I am speaking of what may happen. ration Court manages the business ? Isi t not true that it simply decides questions of justice between the two parties ? termines the rates of wages to be paid, and the honourable member will admit that this -must prove a very important factor in determining the prosperity of a business. The Arbitration Court also determines how -many apprentices the employer shall be allowed to train for carrying on the industry, and also the number of hours for which the workmen shall be employed. In fact, it would be difficult to name a single feature in the conduct of a business which does not come within the province of the court, Let me give an instance. In the southern, coal mining districts of New South Wales, only within the last six months, a mine manager found himself called upon to dismiss a certain number of hands. The question then arose whether he was the proper person to determine which of his hands were of least use to him, and which ib was most desirable to retain. The question was brought before the Arbitration Court of New South Wales, which solemnly declared that the manager -of the mine must, perforce, discharge the men last employed. tom. come of our general commerce under such conditions ? Who is to have the management of our businesses ? I am pointing We oub whab will be bhe effecb upon the management of business when capital is supplied by an experienced individual, and when the management is taken out of his hands, and left to a body of men who may have no knowledge of business. I am giving instances of the comprehensive way in which the management of a concern is taken out of the hands of the owner of the Now, who are these men? Not capital, hy the decision of the Arbitration Courb, bhab, although an employer may consider that A and B are the least competent men in his employment, he must nob discharge bhem, bub musb choose from obhers, because bhey were bhe lasb taken on. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN E v e n though matters of life and death may be involved, as in the case referred to. an employer may consider that certain men have been careless, and are not as competent as others to conduct their work with safety to their fellow employees, the court has said bhab the men who were last employed musb be firsb discharged. Would any honourable member who is nob steeped I say that it dein bias say that bhab is nob practically managing the whole business of the capitalist for him, whilst requiring him to supply the wherewithal to carry ib on. I ask honourable members who are very much abbraoted by bhe compulsory arbitration scheme to first of all admit, that capital cannot be controlled, thab ib can coine or go ab will. Unless we are going bo pass a law laying an embargo upon all capital bhab comes into the country, the capitalist is free to take away his capital or leave it with us. We want it here. We cannot carry on our mines, or our shipping trade, or our manufactories without it . We can do nothing bub scrape bhe earth wibh our fingers unless we have capital, because even a spade or a plough represents capital. Wibh a full experience of trades unions and their methods, and of employers generally, I assert most positively that it is suicidal for bhe working classes of any country to take up an at.titude of antagonism towards capital, it is calculated to cause those who have money to invest it in other parts of the world where they are treated more fairly and more in accordance with the traditions of British commerce.",23,Governor General S Speech Address In reply

62,Mr Bruce Smith,"Yes. Althoughspirit of reciprocity between the two parties ? there should be. We cannot look to the experience in Great Britain or the United States without finding that where employers have accumulated great wealth, they have displayed the utmost magnanimity, and the same spirit will be evinced all over the world under similar conditions. The moment, however, that the working classes adopt a jingo attitude towards their employers, the. breeches pockets of the latter are buttoned up, and they say"" You shall have your pound of flesh, but no more."" I have watched the progress of industrial movements very carefully, and I can see the jingo spirit everywhere in Australia. We saw it displayed during the last great strike in Victoria. The jingo spirit will never generate in the employer those kindly feelings which lead to the expenditure of money in providing for the comfort and happiness of employees. When, however, that spirit disappears from Australia, as it has done from England and the United States, and we have a voluntary system of conciliation, such as has been adopted elsewhere, there will be a sort of millennium in industrial Manufactures. matters. It seems to me a very feasible and practicable millennium, in which theemployer and emploj c will shake hands, as I have seen 7 them do in the Melbourne Trades Hall, and become the best of friends. But I have also observed-and this is part of Victorian history-that as soon as the president or secretary of a union abandoned their jingoistic attitude, and adopted a more moderate tone towards their employers than did their predecessors, they ceased to satisfy the younger jingo spirits of the next generation, and their places were filled by some much more intractable individuals. Thus this feeling of antagonism was perpetuated. the case when the officers of the unions change everv twelve months. that I have mentioned the most harmonious relations existed, and even the Melbourne Age declared that I had been the greatest menace to the working classes of this country. But so far did I engender a feeling of good-will in this State that upon leaving it I carried with me one of the most complimentary letters from the president and secretary of the Trades Hall that a man could carrya letter stating that I had brought about a better feeling between the two classes than had ever existed before. Although Arbitration Acts are in existence in New Zealand, -New South Wales, and Western Australia, honourable members are aware that quite recently, at a large meeting of trades unionists held in the firstnamed State, the Act was denounced as the greatest legislative curse which they had ever known. Those very words appear in the report of the proceedings published by the daily newspapers ; and so strong was the feeling of trades unionists in regard to several decisions, that Mr Seddon informed them that unless they exercised greater care they would break up the whole institution. We have the further testimony that quite recently in AVestern Australia the Chamber of Commerce passed a resolution, the effect of which was that as. its members were compelled to tolerate an arbitration board for a certain period, and to pay the artificially high wages which it produced, they did not see why the whole of the Commonwealth should not submit to the same ordeal. wished the system to be extended to other States, not because of its beneficence, but because they had to tolerate its effects in artificially raising wages. If the result of such legislation in AVestern Australia is to artificially raise wages, thereby placing the employers of that State in an unfair position, what would be the effect of similar legislation upon Australia in its relations with the outside world 1 progress in AA estern Australia. 7 problematical whether that State will retain the capital which has hitherto been invested there. When we remember that this question is undoubtedly in its experimental stage, we ought to pause. I find that the New. Zealand correspondent of The Times, in a letter whiqh is referred to in a leading article, saysMeantime it is patent to any impnrtinl observer that there is a considerable amount of dissatisfaction with the working of the Arbitration Act, and once more the question may bj asked-""If these things'are done in the green tree, what maybe expected in the dry ?"" -",24,Governor General S Speech Address In reply

I heard of a little incident the other day in regard to Victoria which is worth repeating, especially as I can vouch for its truth. A representative of the company which manufactures such splendid woollen goods in New Zealand visited bhis State soon after the Tariff was passed. He had authority to look around Victoria, and ascertain if it were possible to embark -£100,000 in a similar industry here. Whilst here his attention was directed to the existence of wages boards, which are equivalent bo the Arbitration Court of New Zealand. A fortnight after commencing hi-s inquiries, in reply to a question pub by a friend, he used bhis impolite language-""Nob one damned copper will be sunk in bhe industry in this State."" Sir. STAUOHR -Yet he has to submit to an Arbitration Court in New Zealand. Sir. BRUCE SMITH -That is so ; but whethei: the £.100,000 will be invested in New ZealandI do not know. I repeat that honourable members oughb bo pause before attempting to extend bhis system bo bhe whole of Australia. I know bhat the intention is to make it applicable only to industrial disputes extending beyond the limits of any one State : but I hold that we might well defer the consideration of it until we ascertain whether the operation of similar measures in New Zealand, New South Wales, and Western Australia can be regarded as a success. Passing from thab question, I come to that of the Inber-Sbabe Commission Bill. Most honourable members must be surprised to learn bhab, notwithstanding all the protests made by the Government regarding bhe sufficiency of bhe Bill submitted to Parliament last session, they have tai-dily admitted thab ib was wrongly conceived in bhat ibs provisions were made applicable bo ocean-going steamers. They now confess that it was wrongtoattempt a sort of inquisition inbo bhe financial arrangements of the different companies whose steamers ply between other countries and Australia. The objectionable provisions referred to have now been eliminated from the Bill. In this connection I feel somewhat complimented bhab a libtle production of my own, which was republished by bhe Shipping Federation of Australia, pointed oub bhe enormity of those proposals. The* idea bhat, in order bo guarantee the equitableadjustment of freights between the differentStates, we should havearrogated to ourselvestherightbo control such greab companies as the SI essageries Maritimes, the P. and O., and Orient, and to pry into the whole of their financial conditions, was a preposterous one. Those provisions have now been» abolished, and the measure, I apprehend, will come forward in a somewhat similar form to that adopted in the United States. No one can question bhe wisdom of seeing bhab no means, of carriage between one State and another is allowed to exisb which would have bhe eileob of neutralizing thab absolute free trade which we wish bo establish. If the Bill, when it is submitted, is true bo bhe principles which I have indicated, instead of opposing ib, I shall do my besb to assisb bhe Governmenb in passing ib into law. A b this stage I do nob wish to deal with the question of preferential trade. 1 have commented upon the facb bhab the Prime Minisber had promised bo submit some proposals to us in bhis connection. I think bhab they oughbtohave been submitted. The Ministry,, however, having resolved to keep them back, I should have been very' glad indeed to have heard a speech upon bhe subject from the Prime Minister. Sly opinion is. thab by adopting preferential trade relations with the mother country, instead of binding ourselves to ib by means of stronger cords, we should have made use of a. mechanical contrivance which would have been irksome. The bies which bind us bobhe mother counbry are those of blood, affection, and common interests, and theseconsiderations are more elastic than would be any written agreement at which we could arrive. Sir. Chamberlain's attempt to introduce this sysbem, however wise ib may be upon high Imperial grounds, was quibe premature as regards these States. AVe must remember that, so far, the Secretary of State has visited only what are practically Crown colonies, namely, bhe South African States. He has nob had any experience of Sbates like our own, where we have fiscal Arrangements peculiar to ourselves, and which Are not alterable at a moment's notice. I suppose that he was not aware that under -our Constitution we were bound during the next seven and a-half years to carry on all the his Government think so. I am willing to work of the Commonwealth Government and to provide the States with sufficient revenue for the maintenance of many of their institutions through the Customs Had he realized that twelve months or more were occupied in enabling members of this Parliament to agree to a so-called fair fiscal compromise, he would have understood the practical impossibility of the people of the Commonwealth -question at a moment's notice with the idea of settling it in two different columns-one for the British people, and one for foreign -countries. I hold that the electors of Australia aie too busy to rise to these great Imperial considerations at the present day. The change must come in a settled community, where there is a large majority of people of leisure. for a moment be put aside, and great Imperial aspirations can be looked into And considered. To suppose that we can shut our eyes to the necessities Arise out of the Braddon clause ; that we can sit down at a moment's notice and .settle our Tariff in a double column to suit the British Empire on the one hand and foreign countries on the other : to assume that we expect Great Britain to change her fiscal policy and tax the whole of her foods to realize this aspiration, is ridiculous. they, without that knowledge, and after I formed the opinion days and weeks ago, and I hold that opinion to-day, that the primary purpose of this proposal was that Mr Chamberlain might offer a menace to the people of countries like Germany,, who are trifling with the British people in regard to their Tariffo, and, secondly, that there should be a political move in .anticipation of the next general election. When we see the lande.l classes of England -offered a sop in the shape of protective duties on foods, which means an enhanced, value to their lands, and the working' classes offered an unconditional pensions scheme, we can readily believe that Mr Chamberlain considers he has laid the bait for the two great extremes of British society, and that he deems them sufficient to secure the success of the present Government at the next general election, which we may depend would have come much sooner if the bait had been taken, Mr Bruce Smith. and if the people had responded to the call ' made on them. The scheme of Mr Chamberlain is impracticable, and the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth and endorse that view of the Government, but at the same time. I think ib is a great pity for Australia that the Prime Minister department. should have inspired a cablegram which seems to confirm the assurance he previously gave to Mr Chamberlain lhat the people were with him, and thab a sympabhebic response mighb be relied on if the proposal were adopted by other parts of the British re-opening the Tariff Empire.

But hitherto we have contributed only £120,000 -a year, and it is now proposed that we .shall contribute £200,000 a year, which is, roughly speaking, only one-fifteenth of what -our contribution should be according to population. -determining questions of peace or war. tended that there should be no contribution without representation, or that the contribution must be in proportion to representation, I ask what would be our proportion of representation according to contribution? On our present contribution we should have only one representative in the House of Commons. the representatives of Australia at the great Imperial consultations which are held from time to time, and at which both the head of the Government and the leader of the Opposition have within the last few years been present, exercise a far greater influence in the councils of the Empire than would be exercised by our proportional representation in the House of Commons. Why, then, should we quibble upon the question of representation? If we contributed in proportion to population, we might ask for an Imperial Parliament in which Australia should be represented : but if we were so represented we should be absolutely bound by the decisions of that body. Now, however, we are in the happy position of being able to offer advice and counsel to the Ministers of the Empire without responsibility. We have only recently had an instance of such action. The head of the Government promised the Secretary of State for the Colonies that ho would submit his preferential scheme of duties to this Parliament, but he has not clone so, and who can make him do so? But if an Imperial Parliament in which Australia was represented had taken the matter in hand, its decision would have to be complied with, and who can picture the friction which would have occurred here when it was found that we were bound at its dictation to consider the matter of preferential trade. The natural sympathy between Australia, and the mother country will be a sufficient bond between them for many years to come. AVe are not concerned with the desire of a great statesman to consummate his magnificent career by some large scheme if it does not coincide with our interests. I join heartily with the Government in their desire to increase the naval subsidy, and I -hope that the time will not be long before we shall offer, according to our means, a much larger sum than we are offering now. AVho can doubt that the people, of Australia, taking into consideration the condition of the daily lives of our population, If it is conare better able to contribute to a fund of this sort, man for man, than are the people of England, with their carping poverty and distress? ' That being so, are we not wanting in that great Imperial spirit of which we so often boast, when we fail to come forward and say"" AVe will contribute our proportion to this great fund from which we deBut the views expressed by rive so much comfort in the protection of our personal interests 1"" I shall be very happy to support also any Defence Bill which is founded upon the recommendation of the most skilled men the Government can find, and to vote for the establishment of a High Commissioner in London. I favour, too, the adoption of uniform patent laws. AVe are apt to under-estimate the importance of uniform patent laws to the whole of Australia ; but the difficulties which, personally and professionally, I have known men to suffer in connection with the registration of patents in Australia show me that much dishearten ment and disappointment occur under the present system. A very simple Bill, to which no opposition-could be urged, might be passed, and its effect should be to encourage the inventive genius of the people of Australia, and to give us a better chance of industrial Success in the future. W it h these comments I conclude myremarks.

Minister for Trade and Customs.)-With regard to the concluding sentence of the honourable and learned member for Parkes, I should like to say that I have never, when on the platform, made any references to his absence from this House, though in an exchange of courtesies now and again in this chamber I have called attention to the fact that he is not here so often as we should like to see him. I do not think that he need take exception to that statement. honourable member regrets the fact. Mr KI NGST ON I do. When he rose he indulged in remarks of a character which induced ine to think that they called for some retort, but his subsequent observations were much more pleasant, so that I do not now think it necessary to reply to him in kind. The criticisms in which he indulged at the expense of the Government were of a very general character. ranged from the actions of the Imperial Government, and of one of the most distinguished statesmen of modern times-the Secretary of State for the Colonies-to those of our humble selves, and perhaps we should be pleased to be grouped with the Imperial Government, even in depreciatory criticism. In my opinion we have reason to beproud that lain has addressed himself to the question of preferential trade between the various parts of the Empire. The criticisms of gentlemen who have accepted the theory that in trade nothing but cheapness is to be valued, and who decline to give the slightest consideration to questions of Empire and kinship, are not likely to induce Australians to come to a wrong conclusion as to the value of the action which is evidently now contemplated by the British Government. Sentiment, they say, rules the world, and sentiment, practically expressed, appeals to all j but sentiment which finds no expression in action is worthless. . What is the value of the talk about Imperial sentiment and of the ties which constitute the Empire in for her own mother country resulted which we all believe in our hearts, if we are to know no citizenship so far as trade is concerned, and to recognize no distinction between those whose hands may be, and have been, raised in our defence in times of distress and difficulty, and those who at the earliest opportunity would drag the national, honour in the mud, and destroy our traditions and reputation ? May the time speedily come .in which, as regards trade affairs, we shall be found willing to make some littlesacrifice for those who rightly claim to beour kith and kin, who subscribe to the sameconditions of commerce and labour as we do, and with whom practical expressions of friendship should exist. It is a source of great disappointment to many that hithertono preference has been shown by Great Britain to her colonies, or by her colonies to G reatBritain; but may the time speediIy come when some arrangement in that direction may be made which will be satisfactory to both thecontracting parties. I do not forget our difficulties in the way of revenue, but ib is patent that we might give the United Kingdom preference over foreign countrieswithout any inexpedient loss of revenueby keeping our duties as they are, so far asEngland is concerned, and raising them against others whom we have no reason tosimilarly favour. What is the value of His remarks our patriotism-and imperialism if we do not differentiate between our brothers and thecitizens of the mother country, and those who would willingly bring about our downfall at the earliest opportunity ? Those whobrag about the connection, with the Empire, and refuse to give her peoplethe slightest consideration, are undoubtedly open to blame. Consideration of the present position is being forced upon Britain by the action of Canada, and I venture to think that British statesmen will rise to the occasion. What is the position ? Canada gave a preference to Great Britain without receivinganything in exchange. open ports. thing in a protectionist or reciprocally preferential commercial sense. What was. the further result? The benefits which Canada had previously enjoyed in relation to foreign trade, and which Great Britain had also enjoyed and continued to enjoy, were taken from her by German retaliation. Thus Canada's preferencein her being deprived of privileges whichshe had formerly enjoyed, and being subjected to disadvantages to which she had' not previously been called upon to submit.

The time has come of which we have every reason to be proud. We have also reason to regard with pride that statesman who has taken such a prominent part in this movement. The honourable member for Parramatta referred to Mr Chamberlain as having resorted to a political dodge. The honourable member may know all about dodges, but he does not know very much about Mr Chamberlain. I hope that there ""will be no uncertain sound in this connection, and that it will be made known, despite the outcry of free-trade faddists, that Australia appreciates what is proposed by Great Britain, and that she will welcome the day when the details can be worked out, and some satisfactory arrangement arrived at. A t present the Government are subject to adverse criticism, because they have not proposed this, that, and the other ; but our present duty is to wait. The British Government intend to appeal to the country, and I venture to think that our duty is to wait, and to wish, and to hope, and to hold ourselves in readiness to support the mother country in every possible way. We should make it known at the earliest possible moment that Australia will be only too glad to take advantage of the opportunity which Britain proposes to give us. The Empire which does not recognise, in matters of this kind anything in the shape of citizenship, but treats the enemy of to-morrow in the same way as its friends and citizens of today, which does not concede the right of mutual consideration between citizens and mother country, which does not mark the distinction between foreigners and bhose who belong bo ib, cannob stand.

"" Hypocrisy!"" -""Swollen!"" Do honourable members think that these are proper words to use in that connection ? as the' right honourable gentleman's reference to a poisoned pup. doubt, the honourable member may be an able judge. The arguments of the honourable and learned member for Parkes were most inconsistent. First he found fault with the Prime Minister for administering the law, and afterwards rated him from a different point of view altogether for not administering it . The arguments of the honourable and learned member were mutually destructive. I contend that if a law is proposed in this House, those who are opposed to it should get up and fight against it. Do not let one honourable member s a y "" I was asleep,"" or another say "" I was not here."" It is the duty of all honourable members to be awake. It is their duty to be here. And if, as the result of their somnolence or absence, legislation is passed with which they cannot agree, or which, from their point of view, is injurious to the Commonwealth, they are all the more to blame. It does not become them to attend here at rare intervals, and then rate their fellow members who have been applying themselves to their work and who agree with the law. The honourable member for Parkes said that the law provided that immigrants were not allowed to come in here under contract unless the Prime Minister had ascertained that they were required. That is the law. Anybody who finds an expression of the popular will embodied in a Bill, and who disagrees with it , should strike at it immediately. If , however, the measure becomes an Act, no Minister can hold his seat and refuse to execute it without being a traitor to his country and the law. That law was intended to be executed. out now. say that the law is being as thoroughly and faithfully executed as any Act ever was. Has the Government failed in its duty 1 We have the law for our direction, and it is interpreted by the honourable and learned member for Parkes as requiring the Prime Minister to do what he actually did. My right honourable colleague would have been a coward and a traitor if he had not done what he did. There was no dispute as to his duty. Are we to pass Acts simply to tickle the public ear, to offer the people something, and then snatch ib from their grasp ? I say "" No."" I am proud bo ser.ve under the Prime Minisber, who is determined bo keep bhe word of promise bo the hope as well as to the ear. I desire to make some reference to the remarks which have fallen from honourable members as to certain Maoris having been prevented from entering the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister had nothing br> do wibh bhe action bhab was baken in regard bo bhem. He did nob know anybhing aboub ib until ib was all over, because bhe stoppage which wassuggesbed was of the purest bechnical characber, and all bhose concerned were more than pleased wibh whab was done. These Maoris were members of Fibzgerald's circus broupe. On their arrival at night they were refused admission by the Customs officer, bub when bhe matter was referred bo bhe Collecbor of Customs nexb morning an exemption cerbificabe for three months was issued immediately. What more do honourable members want ? The Customs officer executed bhe law, and bhe nexb morning an exemption was granbed by the collector. A telegram which was received on the subject goes further, and states-"" Fitzgerald Bros, express 'bhemselves as perfecbly satisfied, bub wish extension for twelve months."" The extension was given immediately, and a further notification was conveyed to Messrs. Fitzgerald bhab if bhey wanted anything else in that connection it would be done. There is no doubt aboutour sentiments in connection with the admission of immigrants. Of course,. Maoris are treated in a manner entirely different from aboriginals of Australia. We have specially exempted bhem, and very properly, from the prohibition which abtaches to aboricinals in connection with the franchise.

Are they merely Crown colonies ? suspended so that the honourable and learned member was perfectly correct. honourable member for Coolgardie will find that his statement is incorrect, and that both colonies possess constitutional government. suspended during the recent war. sess responsible government?

Open confession is good for the soul, and I believe that the withdrawal of the stigma cast upon Natal and Cape Colony by the suggestion of the honourable and learned member for Parkes that they' are Crown colonies, will be performed by him with all possible despatch. A t different times various hard things have been said about myself. I have listened with interest to a number of them, and I should like to say a word or two in regard to those criticisms. I confess that I was fairly pleased to find that, though the language used by some of my critics was intended to be severe, the reception given to ib by the House showed unmistakably that honourable members were not disposed to believe that I would wittingly treat one man differently from another. and I wonder, bherefore, why one or bwo honourable members did nob say a libble less bhan bhey did. The principal suggestion which has been made is founded upon a petition presented by the Colonial Sugar Company. The effect of that suggestion -undoubtedly is that in the collection of excise upon sugar I have treated one company' differently from another. All I can say is that I have never done anything of the sort. that I did not know the facts. ing of the observations of the honourable member for North Sydney.

The allegations conbained in the petition from the Colonial Sugar Company isThat' whilst stocks of purchased sugiir held by the company iu their free stores were seized and levied on, no excise or other duty was levied on stocks in other factories, expressly"" referred to as coming under the operation of the Excise Acts, breweries were under Customs supervision, and were subsequently used in the production of beer, under Customs authority. Ib then proceeds bo particularize as followsThat although the company s stock of refined sugiir in their free store was seized and excise levied thereon, a larger quantity, the property of the Millaquin and Yengarie Sugar Company, and other white sugars, made and owned by .Gibson and Howes, H. E. and A. Young, the Nerang Central Sugar Mills, and Wood Brothers and Boyd, all at the time in the stock, custodj' and possession of the said manufacturers respectively, were not seized, but were permitted to be delivered free of of excise, such sugar amounting in all to over 9,000 tons, and'liable thereforeif your petitioners' stocks were rightly seizedto duty in the amount of £27,000 was allowed by an officer of Customs to be sold and distributed in the State of Queensland without the payment of excise which was levied on the stocks of your petitioners, and without, so far as .your petitioners can ascertain, any inquiry by' the Customs department as to the quantity of ""sugar thus held, or the places in which such sugar was stored.

I say, further, that if I thought any section of the House worthy of the name, believed that I could be guilty of such conduct I should be sorry indeed, and glad enough to justify myself at any time or place. This matter has been repeatedly explained. It was the subject of discussion time and again last year in the Senate. tion of it ? of the Executive Council. It was on the Sth of October, 1901, that we imposed the sugar excise. That was the date upon which the Tariff was introduced. Part of the 1901 season, therefore, which commenced in June or Jul} , had expired. There was 7 bound to be some sugar which had passed into consumption, and which it was impossible to pursue into the teacup, or even into the private store. What we decided to do was to seize all that was in the factories or in stores belonging to them. "" stock, custody, or possession."" ber will recollect that on the Sth of October, 1901, there was no law in existence. We did not enact legislation upon this subject t ill some months after. The Tariff Excise Bill was not drafted until some time earl} in 1902. Therefore, we had to. consider what we should do. It was a moot question whether or not we should collect duty upon sugar which had been manufactured prior to the introduction of the Tariff. We therefore decided advisedly to seize all the sugar in the excise factories and refineries, and in the mills belonging to them, and resolved, as regards the other, to await the authority of Parliament, which we hoped to receive in due course Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN to the other companies ? pursue sugar which had gone into consumption before the Sth of October. We could deal only with that which remained for consumption. Sir WILLIAM ' McMILLAN has given his whole case away. Mr .KINGSTON -The honourable member for Wentworth will allow me to finish my remarks before he comes to such a delightful conclusion upon the whole subject. I was"" informed that the Colonial Sugar Company complained of some action of mines in this connection. was so early as that. What was done ? The Comptroller-General, who heard of the matter in Sydney, telegraphed at once that no difference was to be made between the treatment accorded to the Colonial Sugar Company and that meted out to any ether company. Wheni t got to my ears know of it before 1 reached my ears I spoke to my officer in warm terms, which are not likely to beforgotten. I issued instructions that the same treatment was to be accorded to all, and that course has been adopted from beginning to end. Sir WILLIAM McMILLAN It is questionable whether that instruction was carried outwas forwarded in September last, Mr. says in the Lockj er was Acting Comptroller-Geiieral,. 7 and he telegraphed communications had been made upon the matter. honourable members that several attacks have7 been made on the Minister during the course, of this debate, and, for example, no later than last evening, there was not a whisper heard when the honourable member for Wentworth was speaking. In common fairness I ask that tlie Minister shall be allowed to proceed without interruption. and low for all the communications that ibis possible to obtain in this connection. I have a number of them here, and I think I shall be able to show enough of them toW as that fair satisfy honourable members generally. Thesbing of the petition is bo be found in bheallegation bhab certain men have been singled oub for special treatment. Nothing of bhesorb. All have .been treated alike.

It was not found practicable to do this as regards sugar which had left the factory, and which uppeared to have gone into consumption except on InterState transfer. not got into consumption. able member for North Sydney is a reasonable man, and I know lie will follow me when I say that there was a risk of losing our proposal for the duty on the stuff which had been passed into consumption before the Sth of October; and we were perfectly justified in doing what we did in regard to the sugar in stock. To follow the sugar into the merchants' stores is a step which I am sure the honourable member would not have cared to take unless fortified by legislative authority. me? We are not concerned with sugar which had gone into merchants'"" stores, but with sugar which was in the refiners' possession. Company admits that they had 50 tons of sugar which we did not touch, because it was not our policy to interfere with what had gone from the mills or their stores. tioners give evidence ? any sugar which, under the larger powers given by the Act, we can take, and which has not been taken, it shall be taken. It is absurdto suggest that I exercised a preference for somebody of whom I had never heard : indeed, had I heard of him, it would only have made the matter worse. My desire, as every one knows, is to get the revenue due to the Commonwealth, and it seems so preposterous to haul me over the coals for acting upon that desire, that I might almost apologize for lingering longer on the subject. My policy is to get revenue any where I possibly and rightly can, and the man who can justly lay a charge against me of any laxity or want of vigilance must have found me in a mood altogether unusual. Tliis matter has been discussed almost to nauseousness elsewhere, and I think I have a right to complain of the suggestions which undoubtedly have been conveyed to the House. the presentation of the petition. one, but I feel sure that no member who was a party to the presentation of the petition knew that the matter had been threshed out. the threshing out? and I should like to show the malign it} , 7 with which this complaint has been pursued. Any honourable member, I do not care'on which side of the House, would resent an accusation of the character which has been made against my administration. On the loth of May last year an honourable member of another place asked why one particular company should be singled out, while every other company and importer escaped. Is that allegation borne out by the facts and figures I have to-night laid before honourable members 1 The Collector of Customs in Queensland was brought down to Melbourne, in order that this matter might be fully explained. Senator Millen in his place saidDuty was not collected on similar sugar which was held in Queensland by the Millaquin and Yengarie Company which, I understand, is really the Queensland National Bank-H . E. and A. Young, Gibson and Howes, and by Woods Bros, and Boyd. These people I understand held between them 8,000 tons, and while that quantity was allowed to go free of excise duty, a quantity of 2,584 tons, held by the Colonial Sugar Company, was charged duty. Further on, Senatpr Millen saidIn the absence of a specific denial of my statement, I venture to say that even Senator O'Connor will not attempt to defend an act of administration which shows snch partiality or discrimination, Senator O'COSXOK -There was no duty levied on sugar in stores, but the sugar in all factories and refineries were levied on. Senator MILLEN -Of course a great deal depends on what is the definition of a store. In this particular case, a duty was levied on goods which were in a store, and not in a bond at all. Senator O'COKXOR I draw no distinction between stores and factories. Sugar iu stores not connected with factories or refineries was allowed to go free. What more explanation is wanted than that -give n a year ago ? Senator O'Connor also saidBut at the same time the Sugar Company are not entitled to be placed in a different position from any other body, or corporation, or individuals, and I propose to deal with the subject simply as if it were an individual who thought he B y whom ? had a right to some redress for some injury.",36,Honourable Members No No

Therefore, subject to this law, and according to the exact letter of the law, sugar, wherever it was, and could have been followed, no matter whether it was in private houses, or warehouses, or stores. That, in the first place, was unnecessary. It was also unworkable and impracticable to cany it out with any sort of fairness. A line, therefore, had to be drawn for the protection of the revenue.

To continue the quotation from MrI r v in g ' s letter from which I was reading These sugars were all' placed under Customs control on tlie morning of the Ofch October, and on being delivered for home consumption, were charged excise duty.

MrI r v in g proceedsWith regard to stocks of sugar in breweries and distilleries on Sth October, these wore not taken, as no intimation had been received to that effect, and no copy of the Excise Tariff Act was received here until 1st July, 1902, which was wired for to Melbourne by tlie Comptroller-General when here. I took the opinion of the Attorney-General as to the true interpretation of the ExciseA c t in regard to the d u r a b i l it y of sugar in a brewery, because I wanted to know tlie best way to recover any amount for which it was liable. TheA c t imposes duties of excise uponAll goods dutiable under the schedule . . . in the stock, custody, or possession of, or belonging to, any brewer, distiller, manufacturer, or refiner thereof. If the word "" t h e r e of "" were not in the section, I take it t h a t sugar in possession of a brewer would be dutiable, b u t it apparentl y refers to the whole group of excisable articles, so t h at t h e section seems to speak of beer in the possession of a brewer, tobacco in the possession of a manufacturer, spirits in the possession of a distiller y and sugar in the possession of a factory or refinery. T h a t is the way in which we have administered it . MrI r v in g goes o n In my wire to you of 24th July, 1902, it was stated that the breweries held 219 tons 16 cwt.

If the sugar crop in Queensland in that year was 120,000 tons-thoug h I do not think it was so much-woul d it not have been only natural that at least 20,000 tons would have got into consumption by the Sth October. My officials have gone thoroughly into the matter, and we cannot find that more than 15,000 tons had got into consumption by that time, though we can account for pretty well the whole of the crop for that year. Mr Irving continuesWith regard to the quantity of over 9,000 tons of sugar said to be in the possession of the persons named on tlie introduction of the Tariff, and Sth October., 1901, notwithstanding it may not delivered.free of doty, a large quantity of sugar, estimated to be 10,000 tons (see my wire of 17th instant), had been removed from the factories, and was stored in merchants premises and other 1 places, not being factory premises, throughout the State; but the department has no knowledge to whom it belonged. This sugar was not taken possession of on the flth October, and in connection therewith I beg to refer you to the following wires between the Comptroller-General and myself:Of course, directly I heard the suggestion that there had been discrimination, I gave instructions that a ful l inquiry should be made. This is the first telegram, which was sent by the Comptroller-General from Sydney, on 28th October, 1901 :Stated that some persons have large stocks of sugar which are escaping Excise whereas Colonial Sugar Company are charged. Is this so ? There ought to be no distinction. Reply to Melbourne. To thab telegram Mr Irving sent bhe following reply :lie sugar stocks removed from mills prior to 9th instant, and stored warehouses, wharfs, &c, have not been treated as liable to Excise. See your wires of 9th and 10th instant. Colonial Sugar Company had large stocks in their refinery, which have been detained in common with stocks in other factories. See also my letter 22nd October, 1901, re Gibson's applications. the refinery, but in the premises adjoining. bhis very wide definition of a factory :"" Factory"" means the premises on which any person is licensed to manufacture excisable goods, and includes all adjoining premises used in connection therewith or with the business of the manufacturer. I think that thab definition abundantly justifies all bhab wo have done. taken out of the refinery before the duty was imposed, and brought back afterwards ? honourable member for reminding 'me of that fact. It got out before the Sth October, 1901, but when I saw Mr Gibson and Mr Young during my Queensland trip, I was not aware that I had impounded their sugar. However, here is my ruling on the subject, in my own handwriting, which he who runs may readIf, as I understand, this sugar was manufactured by Messrs. Young Bros, before the Sth October, 1901, and that on the Sth October, 1901, it still belonged to them, it is undoubtedly dutiable under paragraph (ft) of section 5 of the Excise Act 1902. Thisapplies to all sugar belonging to the manufacturer thereof on the be in his possession on that date or afterwards returned to his possession. Mr Young promptly paid the duty, and we are doing, our best to find out any other sugar that was removed while it -still belonged to the manufacturer. to do this, but I am afraid we shall not find very much the Sydney Chamber of Commerce are willing to assist the Minister by giving evidence on oath at any inquiry he may hold. glad if they will give us any information that may be in their power. It would be idle for us to appoint a Royal commission to hold an inquiry. If we have a willing horse we do not need to flog him, and those who are willing to give information can supply it by making a statutory declaration. Do honourable members suppose thab I do nob wish to catch those, if any, wbo are escaping the payment of duty ? My desire, is to make the Customs revenue look as well as I can, and I venture to apply to my right honourable colleague the Treasurer for a certificate on that point. able gentleman has been so vigilant bhab he has quite upset my estimates. brought in more revenue bhan wasexpecbed.

This is the letter of the Crown SolicitorI have the honour, with reference to your letter of the following letter, which is signed by F. the22nd inst., relating to two prosecutions against Farmer and Co. on the 24th September last, to inform you that, although my papers do not disclose the subject-matter of the charge upon which the conviction was obtained, the prosecutingofficer distinctly recollects that the plea of guilty was accepted in respect of the charge concerning twelve csises of furniture. He informs me that, the day before the cases came on for hearing, Mr Shorter, solicitor for the defendant company, saw him in reference to such cases, and asked if the department would be prepared to withdraw one of the charges in the event of his pleading guilty to tlie other. Mr Shorter was told that a definite reply would be given at 10 o'clock next morning, and at that time he expressed a desire to have the plea recorded in respect of the charge relating to one bale of rugs. The prosecuting officer declined to accede to this course, and eventually Mr Shorter pleaded guilty to the other charge. I made that statement, or one to the same effect, at the Town Hall. Mr Pulsford heard what I said, and went to the court. He then proceeded to write that he visited the court, and that the docket showed that the conviction was upon the smaller charge. That statement is a half truth, the sort of fib which is the hardest of all to fight. He makes no mention of the fact that the clerk told him that there was a confusion in the papers, and that in all probability the plea of guilty was entered in the larger case. In ignoring that information he, it seems to ine, has wilfully misled the public. This case shows the sort of treatment to which I am subjected. If I make a mistake, I am not above owning it, and I think that others might do the same. Senator Pulsford will reply to the Minister's statements. and that at length the truth will be made plain. a more accurate man than the right honourable gentleman ever was. accurate. gest that hedoes not; all I desire to say is that he did not treat this case with the candour he has too much' good sense to object to which is probably his characteristic, but from what has been done to him on the ground which on this occasion he suffered himself to lapse. what the clerk said ? P. Minns, P.M., acting C.P.S., and Chamber Magistrate :With reference to the communication between Senator Pulsford and the deposition clerk, it appears that the latter saw Mr Pulsford inspecting the papers, and explained to him that ""although the ' furniture' summons attached to the ' ruginformation was marked 'withdrawn,'""' it was almost a certainty that the word ' withdrawn ' referred to the information to which the summons was attached. All that we have heard about the cruelty of charging fraud against this, that, and the other man is so much fudge. The charge of fraud is preferred only when there i's ground for it . In all other cases the statement is made by the prosecuting counsel that we do not charge fraud, as a concession to the wish of many, that where we do not charge fraud, we shall declare we do not. W it h regard to the statement that persons charged with Customs offences have to herd with the ""drunks,"" I would point out that in South Australia a man who neglected to register his dog would have to rub up in the court against a ""drunk,"" just as he might do in the street ThoughI am not an advocate of intemperance, however much the consumption of spirits may benefit the revenue which I cherish so dearly, I say that, in the sight of Heaven, for a man upon a jovial occasion to exceed, so that in rolling home afterwards he is run in and fined, is a venial sin compared with that of the man who robs me of my duties. We are all liable to make errors, and if we do, it is suggested that we should appear in the courts to receive punishment without being contaminated by the presence of "" drunks"" there. There is too much nicety in these complaints. If a man in Victoria does not vaccinate his Pulsford is child he is taken to the police court, and I believe that a member of this Parliament has been so treated.

The members of that deputation reminded me of what I had said, but they did not assert that 1 ever declared I would uot institute prosecutions except in cases of fraud. They agreed that I was right in what I wanted. In the House of Representatives, said Mr Barre Johnston, Sir William McMillan had asked the following question:Would not the Minister permit a Customs official to allow the rectification of a clerical error""! to which the Minister had repliedWe arc not laying down the rule that persons must be prosecuted and penalized for the smallest clerical error, such as might take place in an arithmetical calculation ; but in collecting duties, as I have stated in communication with chambers of commerce and other bodies interested, we have a right to know from the importers what is the nature of the goods they are importing, and what is the value of those goods. When they put it that they wanted me to abstain from prosecutions where questions of duty were involved, I told them that I had been adopting that practice throughout. The report proceedsOn the point that Mr Wall and other gentlemen have raised, as to men being prosecuted for making wrong statements of duty chargeable, I that such was not 1113' wish, and I gave instructions to the contrary months ago. I hold in my hand the instructions signed by me 011 1st September. I look to my officers regarding tlie question of rates-(Hear, hear)-and Mr Lockyer tefls me he believes the fullest effect has been given to these instructions. In the second clause of those instructions I specially desire that no error of classification by the importer in the entry shall alone render him liable to penal consequences, if he has iu the entry disclosed the true nature of the goods so that they can be identified for Tariff purposes. All the members of the deputation smiled their benedictions, the clouds which had previously overhung the meeting were dissipated, and joy and happiness reigned supreme. Upon that occasion I also emphasized a declaration which I made in June last, to the effect that the importers need not trouble themselves about the duty which is to be paid. They have only to speak the truth about matters within their knowledge, namely, the nature of the goods, their value, and the invoices. I will undertake to look after the duty. Every member of that deputation left the room perfectly satisfied. the other night, when I was quoting an extract from that very newspaper, that the deputation had misunderstood him ? had not the report in my hand when the honourable member was reading it . There is no doubt, however, as to the position which I took up, and there I . am content to allow the matter to rest. Since that deputation waited upon me the Tariff guide has been completed. That work I think supplies a wealth of information not only to the commercial public, but to the Customs officials. It will enable them to avoid that reference to headquarters which has necessarily been associated with its absence.

It is infinitely better I should acknowledge that a lot of work has been forced upon me which I have not shirked. Unless 48 hours could have been compressed into each day, I could not possibly avoid the delays which have occurred. I have not spared myself, and I have no intention of doing so. But I shall be glad indeed to get rid of the drudgery associated with the initial stages of Federal Tariff administration. It is an experience which I should wish no honourable member, but which I am glad to have gone through, because I believe it will further qualify me for the performance of my duties, and give me a better appreciation of the work, thus tending to the credit of my office, and, I hope, to the good of Australia. storm there generally comes a calm; and now that the hurricane which has recently blown in this House has subsided, the debate should flow along with its usual placidity to the end. I sincerely hope that we have heard the last of grievances concerning Customs prosecutions. For the past two weeks in this House, and in the press for months, utterances would lead one to think that no interests in the country were suffering except those of unfortunate importers, who are represented as being continually harassed and persecuted by a fiend in the shape of the Minister for Trade and Customs. Surely there are other people besides importers in Australia. When the Tariff was before the House, I fought in the interests of free-trade ; but now that we have a Tariff there should be no loophole left for dishonest traders. is the meaning of all this talk about the indignity of men appearing along with drunkards in a police court? Are not innocent men often arrested, and not merely asked to appear with "" drunks,"" but deprived of their liberty ? Yet we never hear a protest in such cases from those honourable members who are so eloquent in their defence of the importers. In my judgment the statement of the Minister for Trade and Customs is perfectly fair. If the importers will tell him the value of the goods, and their nature, and produce proper invoices, he will fix the duty. That seems a proposition with which I do not see anybody can 2u fairly find fault. But there are other departments of the State quite as important, if not more so, to the people than that of the Customs. There is the Postal department, which touches people more intimately than the Customs. I tell the Government in all friendliness that if they are to continue in office it will be necessary for them to' look closely into the administration of the Postal' department. As one from a distant State, I know that most aggravating delays occur before the Department can be induced to carry out the slightest work. Some 'of these works were projected before the Commonwealth took over the department, and yet they are still at the stage when tenders are being called. That is the'result of red tape, and I respectfully suggest the advisability of shaking up the officers, so that the people in the interior portions of Australia, who are opening up and developing the country, may obtain postal and telegraphic facilities. In my opinion the department is run a little too much on commercial principles, the idea of the Minister apparently being that each service must pay its way. Postmaster-General not get revenue, if the Minister for Trade and Customs gets it ? view, but up to this time the post-office has always been used as an auxiliary in the development of the country. It is monstrous to expect that every new service must pay its way from its inception, and if the present policy is continued it will seriously retard settlement and development in the interior. Then, I want to know the reason why these extravagant demands for guarantees are What made in the matter of telephone and telegraphic communication? If I desire a telephone to be constructed between two towns, I must give a cash guarantee to cover any loss that might occur. Under the Western Australian law, municipalities have no power to give these guarantees, but must spend every shilling of the rates, except 3 per cent., on municipal improvements. It is the opinion of those who interpret the law that the municipalities are thus debarred from giving guarantees to the Federal Government in connection with telephone and telegraphic extension. AndI want to know how it is that in these matters some States are served differently from-others.?",49,William Mcmillan I Doubt Mr Alexander Stewart Of Messrs Stewart And

278,Mr Mahon,"I do not object to thattreated alike. honciable member of this House, who represents South Australia, and has an influential newspaper at his back, was instrumental in obtaining the construction of a telegraph line to Tarcoola, at a cost of not less than £14,000, without any guarantee being given to the Eederal Government. I understand that, iii the first instance, it was represented to this House that this money would be deducted from South Australian revenue as part of the expenditure of a transferred department; but now the claim is seriously raised that this is part of the new expenditure which must be borne by the Commonwealth generally. This is a matter which seems worth inquiring into. How is it that an honourable member from one State can have a large work like this done at a cost of £14,000 without any guarantee, while a Western Australian member, under similar circumstances, is, asked to deposit a certain amount in cash 1 There is another point requiring notice in connection with postal administration. This is in respect to the refusal to deliver letters addressed to Tattersall's. That step has caused an enormous loss of revenue, and the statement. I made at the time that the section would prove a failure is borne out by the fact that Tattersall's sweeps are now filling as well as ever they did. The House as well as the Government deserves censure for this. This is what may be called hypo-critical legislation. as well say the honourable member was guilty of hypocrisy in voting against the clauses. pretend to legislate for the suppression . of gambling, when we know that it cannot be suppressed in that way. WhatI said in the House was that if we desired to legislate against gambling we should do so directly, and not in an underhand manner, which is always more or less hypocritical. As regards the transcontinental railway, I notice that some honourable members are opposing its construction on grounds of economy. One of the South Australian members the other night gave, as his principal objection to the line, the enormous cost it involved, but I notice that when the same honourable member advocated the All States are extension of the Tarcoola telegraph line, he> made no inquiry as to the expense before-recommending the project to the House. Another honourable member observed that the Western Australian Government should build the Esperance line before South Australia, gives permission for. the transcontinental lineto pass through her territory. It will bewithin the recollection of honourable members that during last session I submitted amotion in favor of the construction of theEsperance railway, but I think these projects stand on different footings. They arebo th worthy of being completed, but there is no reason why the non-construction of the Esperance railway should retard the construction of the transcontinental line. I regret very much that some effort is beingmade to prevent the Parliament of South Australia from giving the necessary consentto the construction of the Port AugustaKalgoorlie railway. If ever a Governmentpledged itself to anything beyond recall, the Government of South Australia are pledged to give permission for the construction of this transcontinental line. To prove the truth of what I say, I have only to read a', letter written to the Premier of Western Australia by our Speaker, when he occupied the-high position of Premier of South Australia. The letter is dated 1st February, 1900, and is as follows :Following our conversation as to the possibleblocking of the construction of a railway line from. Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta by the Federal authority, by South Australiarefusingconsent,rendered, necessary by section 34 of clause 51 of the Commonwealth Bill, to the construction of the linethrough her territory, I regard the withholding of consent as the most improbable thing, in fact,, We might quite out of the question. To assure you of one attitude in the matter, I will undertake as. soon as the federation is established (Westand South Australia both being States of the Commonwealth) to introduce a Bill formally giving the assent of this province to the construction of a line by the federal authority, and to pass it stage by stage simultaneously with the passage of a similar Bill in your Parliament. I find also that your successor, Mr Speaker,, in the Premiership of South Australia, wrote on 31st July, 1901, to the Prime Minister as follows :In reply to your letter of 23rd inst., I have thehonour to inform you that prior to the submission of the Commonwealth Constitution Act for theapproval of the people of Western Australia, viz., the 1st February, 1900, the Honourable F. W.

282,"Mr Mahon""","It is pure cant toBut the only condition specified in your letter, sir, was bhat the Western Australian Parliament should simultaneously pass a Bill through their House. Now we are given to understand, however, that certain specified conditions were mentioned, and the letter of Mr Jenkins proceedsundertaking on specified conditions to inso far as the promoters are concerned t troduce a Bill formally giving the assent of this State to the construction of a line of railway to the Western Australian border. On the 11th JuneI telegraphed to the Western Australian Premier as follows :Re Coolgardie Railway. A Bill will be introduced into our Parliament, as agreed by Mr Holder, 1st February, lilOO, but we strongly insist upon line joining your State 40 to (JO miles the journey from Albany to Perth? north of Eucla. It appears to me that new conditions are now being added by bhe Premier of Soubh Australia before consent will be given. I notice, from the reported statements of some public men in South Australia, that there is a disinclination to give effect to the promise which you, sir, made as Premier on behalf of the Parliament and the people of South Australia. I have too high an opinion of the people of Soubh Australia bo credit bhe notion bhab bhey will permit their Government to commit such a serious breach of faith as this involves. I feel convinced that when South Australian public opinion is appealed bo, ib will be declared bhab bhe promise of the Premier of thab Stabe, given in good faibh, .should be redeemed. If bhab State had an objection to consent being given to bhe consbrucbion of bhe. Western Australian transcontinental railway, the time for bhat objection was before Western Australia agreed bo join bhe federation. tralia would not have come into the union. unfair to wait until now to suggest new conditions and to raise new objections to the project. But we find an explanation of that peculiar circumstance in the fact that South Australia appears to have set her heart on another bransconbinental line, though I venture bo bhink that, when true condibions under which proposed to build bhab line are known, no syndicabe will be foolish enough bo undertake the work. It is proposed to convey to a syndicate for the building of bhe line a berribory almost as large as the State of Victoria. The railway, when finished, is not to be handed over to bhe 2 H2 South Australian Government, but is to continue the property of the syndicate. That seems to me a most inequitable proposal. I know of two similar private railways in Western Australia, but they are both miserable failures. as the country is concerned. The most miserable railway journey a man can make in Australia is that from Perth to Geraldton, on the Midland Company's line. r is no comparison between the two. The trains run at the rate of about 15 miles an hour, and in the 318 miles, which comprise the whole distance, there is not a place where one may procure a decent meal, so that those who travel on the line invariably bake bheir own food and liquor wibh bhem. Bub bhe secreb of the South Australian objection to the Western Australian transcontinental line will be discovered in the report of an interview which took place in London between a newspaper reporter and a gentleman who claims bo be the power behind the throne in South Australia. He is not the Premier, but he informs all and sundry that at any time he likes he could turn the Government out. This is the report of an interview with Mr Darling, the leader of the Opposition in South Australia, the gentleman to whom I referAlthough his coming to London had no official connection with the promotion of the scheme for building a railway from Oodnadatta to Pine Creek, still, he hod made ""casual"" inquiries amongst bankers and financiers. ""They seem to be agreed,"" continued Mr Darling, ""that the state of the money market and the disposition of capitalists generally are not altogether too favorable nt the moment. They seem to think, however, that it is one of the ventures that might well be taken up by London capitalists when better times arrive."" The South Australian afterwards proceeded to show what the expression ""better times"" meant in his mind. ""The Commonwealth,"" he said, ""is at present entirely the opposed to the introduction of coloured labour ib is into any part of the island-continent. If that course is persisted in, then the tropical resources of the Northern Territory cannot be profitably developed. It is no use blinking this fact. WhatI would suggest is the introduction of Indian cooties under an indentured system, which has worked so well in other parts of the British dominions. I believe that the people of Australia will, in the course of a few years, come round to this view.""",51,William Mcmillan I Doubt Mr Alexander Stewart Of Messrs Stewart And

I believe, too, that they are to be exempt from State taxation. But Mr Darling has given the project away when he says, in effect, that this territory can be made profitable only by the employment of coloured labour. I think Darling or his syndicate, if it is foolish enough to undertake the enterprise, from employing coloured"" labour. Possibly the syndicate has not been told that the Eederal Parliament may impose taxation upon property: although, so far, we have imposed no direct taxation, we have the light to place a tax upon land. I apprehend that when those facts are made known to London capitalists they will hesitate for a long time before proceeding with the construction of the line. The correspondent from whose report I have quoted goes on to sayI reckon that if Mr Jenkins' land grant railway to Port Darwin is not built until the Australians have tar nod their buck upon white labour, then the man is not j et born who will travel on the line. AndI quite agree with him. I think when the question is fairly put before the people of South Australia they will not be guilty of a repudiation in the nature of a breach of faith. Despite what the politicians and leaders of Parliament may say, I should be perfectly willing to submit the issue to the people of South putting before them the promise which was made on their behalf by their Government. length upon the other questions with in the Governor General's -but no doubt other opportunities will in due course arrive when the various measures in the Government programme are brought before the House. Although Jam inclined to consider the High Court a necessary part of the federal machinery, I fear that as proposed it would be too expensive a luxury at the present time. I should like instead to see some arrangement whereby one federal Judge could be appointed to sit with the Chief Justices of the States whenever occasion required the services of the Eederal High Court, because it does not appear to me that there will be sufficient work for five Mr Mahon. Judges. I believe, however, that the whole matter is one that we might fairly postpone for the present. W it h regard to the federal capital site, I think that, in justice to New South Wales, we should proceed to its selection as soon as possible, but I should not be in favour of commencing the building of the capital while money is so dear in London, because no Government can profitably borrow at 4 per cent., and it is not possible to get money now at lower rates. COOK -Not much money would be required. has already objected to the borrowing of money for necessary works, such as telephones and telegraphs, I think we should not borrow to build a federal capital. We want telegraphs and telephones for the development of the back country more than we want a federal capital.

When will the honourable member be ready to carry out that bargain ? Australia, a right. so, but that statement makes our wrong no I intended to speak at some less hard to. bear. I am rather disdealt appointed with the declaration of various speech, speakers concerning preferential trade relations with the other parts of the Empire. I was surprised to hear the eulogium pronounced upon Mr Chamberlain to-night by no less a person than the Minister for Trade and Customs. It is a singular thing to find one who is widely regarded .as the darling of Australian democracy praising a man who in England has been a traitor to democracy; Possibly the attitude of one of the Melbourne newspapers in regard to Mr Chamberlain may have influenced the mind of the Minister.

294,Mr Mahon,"No doubt that that isfor his exhausting the language of eulogy concerning Mr Chamberlain. Until last Monday the Secretary of State for the Colonies was the darling and hero of that' great newspaper, the Argus. During the African war, and ever since he left the liberal party, the Argus has shown the greatest appreciation of the genius of that wonderful' man. Bub on Monday last the Argus says this of himReversals of policy by Mr Chamberlain have been too many and too remarkable to make it worthwhile to charge him with inconsistency. With him a policy or a principle is a thing to be adopted in view oF the exigency of the hour, and to be dropped as further turns of the political wheel may render necessary. J object to the savage manner in which the Minister for Trade and Customs corrected the small mistake-if it was a mistakemade by me in an interjection. I merely said that the Constitutions of Natal and Cape Colony had been suspended during the war in South Africa. WhatI should have said was that the light of the Parliaments of those colonies to meet had been suspended during the war. pension of the Constitution. without a difference, and the Minister for Trade and Customs devoted more attention to this trivial matter than it warranted. was rather surprised also to hear some of the views expressed from the opposition side of the chamber with reference to preferential trade. The leader of the Opposition said that if we were to have a protective Tariff we ought to close the doors more tightly against foreign countries than against England. I do not see much differencebet ween what the right honourable gentleman said and what the Minister for Trade and Customs has suggested. The utterances of the leader of the Opposition do not accord with the Cobden idea of free trade, because Cobden held that, although a protective Tariff might .injure the country against which it was directed, it w ould also r injure the country which imposed it. If that is so, how can the leader of the Opposition allow himself to become implicated in any imposition of protective duties 1 much as possible, if he could not remove them. proposed by the Minister for Trade and Customs of increasing the duties upon foreign products, and leaving them as they stand with regard to those which come from Great Britain. Personally, I should prefer to see the duties entirely abolished so far as imports from the mother cenntry are concerned, and revenue imposts collected upon goods from foreign sources. I was surprised that the Minister for Trade and Customs berlain, because he' must be perfectly aware that that right honourable gentleman hs-s proved a traitor to every political parby with which he has been associabed. Mr. John Morley, who, as a statesman, a literary man, and a democrat, is far and away above Mr Chamberlain, in writing bhe life of Cobden some years ago, practically foresaw bhe presenb proposal for preferential trade, or, as it was then known, fair trade. This is what he saysNobody has fully grasped the bearings of free trade who does not realize what the international aspect of every commercial transaction amounts to; how the conditions of production and exchange in any one country affect, both actually and potentially, the corresponding conditions in every other country. It is not free-trade between any two countries that is tlie true aim ; but to remove obstacles in the way of the stream of freely exchanging commodities, that ought, like the Oceann9 of primitive geography, to encircle is really a distinction the whole habitable world. In this circulating system every Tariff is a,n obstruction, and the free circulation of commodities is in the long run I as much impeded by an obstruction at one frontier as at another. This> is one answer to an idea which has been lately broached among us, under stress of the temporary reaction against free trade. It has been suggested that though we cannot restore protection in its old simplicity, yet we might establish a sort of National Imperial Customs Union among the English dominions. The territory over which the flag of Great Britain waves is so enormous and so varied in productive conditions, that we could well afford, it is urged, to shut ourselves within onr own walls, developing our own resources, and consolidating a strong national sentiment, until the nations who are now fighting us with protective Tariffs come round to u better mind. The answer to this is that the removal of the restriction on the circulation to a more distant point would not affect the vital fact that the circulation would still be restricted and interrupted. To induce our colonies and dependencies to admit our goods free would, of course, be so much gained : just as tlie freedom of interior or domestic commerce, which was one of the chief causes of the early prosperity of Great Britain, was by so much a gain over the French system, which cut off province from province by customs barriers during the same period. But freedom of internal commerce, whether within an island or over a wide empire, is still not the same thing as universal freedom of exchange. An interruption, at whatever point in tlie great currents of exchange, must always remain an interruption and a disadvantage.

299,Should Become So Enamoured Of Mr Cham,"tninsiiction that tends to develop trade between any nations whatever. We derive benefit from it in one way or another. The mother country has no interest in going into a customs union with her colonics, witfi the idea of giving them any advantage, or supposed advantage, in trading with her over foreign countries. I do not know that I need weary the House by continuing this debate. I should not have spoken but for some remarks which were made regarding the transcontinental railway to Western Australia. I hope that in discussing the various measures which are to come before us, we shall display the same good feeling and friendliness that was shown in connection with every measure except the Tariff last session. If the Government will direct their attention to securing a proper administration of the Postal department, they will perforin as great a public service as has been rendered by the Minister for Trade and Customs in his department. I honour the Minister for what he has done, and I believe that the people of this country, almost to a mancertainly those in the back country of Western Australia-approv e of his administration. AlthoughI sit in opposition to the right honourable gentleman, I concede the fact that his dealing out of evenhanded justice to the weak and the strong must meet with all-round approval, and that his action in bringing to j.ustice men who held their heads high in the community, and regarding whom no suspicion was previously entertained, redounds to his credit. I hope that he will continue in the course which lie has hitherto followed, but that he will make a strenuous effort to avoid the irritating delays which have caused so much loss and annoyance to merchants in the past. I rose mainly to deal with the objections regarding the transcontinental line to Western Australia, and to urge the j Government to give more attention to the administration of the Postal department, and to conduct it upon principles other than those which appear to actuate the Postmaster-General. I do not intend to go over the ground which has been traversed so often by other honourable members. I should be glad to"" say a word or two in defence of the attitude of the Parliament of South Australia in reference, to the transcontinental railway to the Northern Territory, but, unfortunate!}', I am unable to do so. It seems to me that the granting of such a large concession to a private company to enable them to build a railway for their own convenience is altogether indefensible. W it h reference to the attitude of South Australia towards the Western Australian railway, I think that the honourable member for Coolgardie is hardly doing justice to the Premier of the former State. The South Australian Government have not stated that they will not carry out the promise, but they have stipulated that the proposed line should be constructed in a certain latitude. dition made in the first instance? an explanation for that. During the period which elapsed between the communication sent to the Premier of Western Australia by Mr Speaker when he was Premier of South Australia, and the letter sent by Mr Jenkins, the present Premier, the Tarcoola gold-fields were discovered, and the Government of South Australia are now naturally anxious that the line should pass somewhere in the vicinity of those fields rather than, as suggested, some distance southwards. This would relieve the South Australian Government of the necessity of constructing an almost parallel line to Tarcoola. The proposed deviation will not add 25 miles to the total distance to be covered by the railway, and the condition laid down is a reasonable one. Western Australia will object to such a condition, but we are informed that all sorts of other conditions aie suggested. that the people of South Australia will go back upon tlie undertaking entered into first by the Minister for Trade and Customs, when he was Premier of that State, and afterwards by Mr Speaker when he held a 1 similar office. But before that line is built other conditions may prevail. I do not think that the people of South Australia will go back upon their undertaking merely because Mr John .Darling, or even ii dozen or two individuals, may think it is desirable to do so. I say this without in any way suggesting that either South Australia or her representatives are necessarily in favour of the line. But that is a very different matter from declaring that if the line is to be undertaken, South Australia will nob stand in the way of its construction through her territory. I suppose that honourable members would smile if I suggested that",54,William Mcmillan I Doubt Mr Alexander Stewart Of Messrs Stewart And

One paragraph in that long deliverance statesA number of other important measures are in preparation. Among these is a Bill to provide a uniform navigation and shipping law. This measure, however, is necessarily long and complicated. Later on thn speech contains the following declaration :My advisers will gladly take advantage of any -opportunity which may offer of bringing these -subjects before you, but they are not sanguine of being uble to do so in the course of this session. I think that statement is a reasonable one to make. It would be quite impossible for us to enact uniform shipping legislation -embodying all the navigation laws of the -different Statesi n one Act during the present session. I understand that a Bill to .effect this purpose is in course of preparation, and that it contains some hundreds of clauses. -should not care to attempt to pass such a measure during the current session. But I put it to the Minister for Trade and -Customs that there are some Bills that the 'Government intend to proceed with which -are less urgent than is the passage of a ;short Bill designed to protect Australian .shipping from the unfair competition to which it is at present exposed. A measure -containing only a few clauses would be sufficient for the purpose. Under the cir-cumstances which obtain to-day, Australian -shipping is gradually being taken away from local companies by foreign vessels which, once in several years, call at a port -outside the Commonwealth merely for the purpose of getting their crews to sign fresh -articles. they are enabled to defy any legislation which we may enact with reference to the -employment of white men upon them, and to override the conditions with which Australian vessels have to comply. believe that the House would readily con.senfc to consider a short measure such as I suggest. There is a great deal hanging to it . In this connection I need only point »out that an agreement exists between the Australian steam-ship owners and their seamen, ' which will expire during the present month, though an arrangement has been made to continue it t ill December next. If something is not done in the interim to place foreign ships in a similar position as regards wages, manning, &c, to -that occupied by Australian vessels, an all-round decrease in wages will take place. It may be said that that matter will be covered by the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, but the arbitrators under any A ct will take into consideration the unfair competition to which the owners are subject. owners of vessels which trade here to pay the increased rate of wage ? tion whether we could. It seems to me that it would be far better to introduce a separate Bill for the purpose of covering these special disabilities. I know that the Minister for Trade and Customs does not care about devoting himself to a short measure of this kind. He would prefer to thoroughly master the whole question, and then draft a measure to meet the necessities of the case. If honourable members study the figures contained in a blue-book which Of course we was presented to the House of Commons last year in regard to this matter, they will be disagreeably startled. Those figures show that a large increase has taken place in the number of lascars and foreigners employed upon British ships, and a corresponding decrease in the number of Britishers so employed. During the past ten years I find that the lascars upon British ships have increased by 12,288, and the foreigners by 8,750, a total increase of 21,038 seamen, whereas the number of Britishers so employed has decreased by 7,155. the fact that the men can do better than go to sea ? By adopting that subterfuge that the labour of the lascar is cheaper. These figures, I submit, are sufficiently startling to merit careful consideration, unless the whole of the mercantile marine of Britain is to be manned by foreigners I and lascars, which would be a particularly serious matter for the Imperial navy in the event of a naval conflict. In the course of his remarks, the honourable member for Parrarnatta spoke of the agreement which had been entered into with the Eastern Extension Telegraph Company. He declared that it was a matter for congratulation that the interminable agreement which previously existed had been amended, and an arrangement for ten years substituted.

Messages by the Cape cost just as much as those by Port Darwin; and the amount received by South Australia is the same irrespective of the line used. Sir Darwin line would not have been used. matter, because the landing facilities at Fremantle and Glenelg would have been used. AVe have no right .to complain of the Eastern Extension Company trying to defeat a rival, but we must complain of an attempt on the part of the Commonwealth Government to unduly favour the Pacific line at the expense of the former company. Three of the eastern States are concerned in one cable, and the western States are concerned in another, and the postal authorities have decided that all messages, the routes of which are not indicated by the senders, must go by the Pacific cable. That appears to be a deliberate action in order to force as much business as possible to the Pacific line. Why should unrouted messages handed in at Kalgoorlie be sent all the way round to Brisbane, and thence by the Pacific line, when a shorter and quicker route, in which AVestern Australia is interested, is available? not interested in that route. word "" interested "" in the sense of partnership. to Western Australia which way messages go, but I think they are sent by the line from that State.

A fair thing would be to arrange that all messages should go by the quicker route, or by each route alternately. Either method would be adopted, but with the present arrangement the Government can fairly be accused of favouring the Pacific line. I should now like to refer to the public service regulations. These as a wholeare fairly liberal, but there are a few to which exception may be taken. I shall not refer to details, because I think the public servants may be trusted to bring any disadvantages under which they labour under the notice of their superior, but there is one regulation which it seems to me ought not to be allowed in its present form. By regulation 41, officers are expressly forbidden to publicly discuss, or in any way to promote political movements. That is a very wide and sweeping regulation. Officers are further forbidden to use any official information for political purposes, or to disclose any such information without the express direction of the permanent head. These latter regulations are quite proper, and will meet with the approval of not only the public, but also of the officers themselves. Under regulation 41, however, public servants are unable to join any kind of organization whether of single taxers, free-traders, or protectionists, or in any way to promote a political movement. It may be said that the regulation! is not to be .interpreted literally-that it is a power which will never be exercised : but it is a very dangerous power to place in the hands of the Executive. I shall not go into details, but merely mention that recently we have seen a very extreme view taken of what a political association' is. AVe have seen the most disastrous results in one of the States as a consequence of the adoption of that extreme view. Here, I do not use the however, we have a much wider clause, and one which I think honourable members will agree should not be in the regulations. It was first published on the 23rd December last, and took effectonthe 1st January of this year. There are other clauses in the regulations to which I should refer, but that I do not wish to keep honourable members a t this late hour. I ask the Minister, howI have seen it ever, to consult with the Public Service Commissioner to see if the regulations which I have dealt with cannot be modified, so that the public servants of the Commonwealth may enjoy as full rights of citizenship asthose outside the service. There are one or two other matters upon which I wished to speak, but I shall leave them over until 'another time.

I hope that when the debate is con-cluded we shall get to work as speedily as possible, and that the session will not be unduly prolonged. this late hour it is not my intention to keep the House very long. I would preface my remarks by thanking honourable members who visited Western Australia to see for themselves the conditions of an importAnt State, which in many respects, I am sorry to say, has been misrepresented. The people of our State, however, regretted that more federal members did not go there to inquire into our conditions, and to be witnesses of the prosperity which we .are enjoying and shall continue to enjoy for a considerable time to -come. As in 1892 our population was only 58,000, while ""in March last it was 219,000, honourable members will realize that the State has not stood still. On the contrary, it has progressed by such leaps and bounds as are phenomena] even in the history of Australia. I am aware that An impetus was given to our progress by the discovery of gold, but other reasons for it are the liberality of our laws and the generous encouragement which is given to settlement. The measures to which reference was made in the Governor General's speech are of very great importance. It must be remembered that the conditions of the various States are very diverse. I may fairly say that there are not two States whose conditions are alike. Consequently the legislation which is proposed here necessarity provoked a great deal of discussion. We can only hope that the laws which are passed will prove beneficial, not to particular States alone, but to the whole Commonwealth. Last session we passed into law twenty-one Acts, apart from measures of a financial nature, so that our first session was not an idle one; and I feel sure that the legal foundation for the working of the Commonwealth which was thus laid will later redound to our credit. We have heard from some of the eloquent speakers in this Chamber that many of the Bills which are to be brought forward this session will be of the greatest importance to the -future welfare of the Commonwealth, and I feel certain that the no doubt they must. W it h regard to the establishment of a High Court, I feel that unless some economical proposal is put before us I cannot support the Bill. My idea is that the Judges of the States courts will be sufficient for some time to come. There may be cases involving hundreds or thousands of pounds which should come before federal courts, but, as a trial, the ChiefJ ustices of the States might very well be used for a year or two to constitute such a court. If that is done, there will be a great saving of expense, and justice will be meted out to those who ask fori t . W it h regard to the federal capital, I , for one, willnot agree to the expenditure of any large sum of money upon buildings. I agree with the honourable and learned member for Parkes that it is a mistake for the Federal Parliament to meet in one of the capitals of the States, because its members must be influenced to some extent by the newspapers of that State. If economy were practised I think that the necessary buildings could be erected without imposing too serious a burden upon the finances of the Commonwealth. I am entirely in accord with the proposal to establish courts of conciliation and arbitration. We have just had an illustration in this State of how business and commerce are paralyzed when a large industrial dispute takes place. If a similar dispute occurred at one time in more than one State the disaster would be very great. An y measure which will prevent strikes, and will save men, and especially women and children, from their effects, will be a good one. In AVestern Australia there were in 1901 two strikes which paralyzed trade, and honourable members can imagine the consternation and misery which was created by the stoppage of supplies to the gold-fields, which are dependent for communication on about 400 miles of railway. I am also ready to support the proposed naval subsidy of £200,000 per annum. It would be suicidal for a country with a population of something like 3,800,000, to spend, say £1,000,000 upon the purchase of a war > v -ssel. AAe should still have its up-keep r to provide for, and it would practically give us no protection at all. I feel sure, however, that under' the new naval agreement we shall be well protected. I hope that the Government 'will see that the war ships are allowed to move from port to port. In the past the people of",58,George Turner Bu T The Port

Such a department need not necessarily be -expensive, but it would do a great deal of ,good by its investigations into the capabilities of various kinds of soil, and by the information which it could give to agr.i-culturists of all kinds. I wish to call the Attention of the Minister for Trade and 'Customs to a case which I should like to bring under his notice. A firm in Western Australia some time ago imported some timber, and as the documents necessary to pass a Customs entry did not arrive with the timber, an arrangement was made with the department thab a deposit of £ 5 0 should be paid, and that the entries should be made in dueform when bhe proper -documenbs arrived. Thab happened in due -course, and somebhing like £ 2 6 was paid in duby. Bub upon an applicabion for a refund of bhe difference, ib was stated thab the money had been paid inbo bhe revenue accounb, and thab the Cusboms Acb did nob allow any of ib to be reburned. I will read copies of bhe papers in bhe case which have been placed in 1113' hands, bhe originals having been senb bo bhe Comptroller-General of Customs. The first is a letter to ni}'self, which I do not think it necessary to read. The next letter is addressed to bhe Collecbor of Customs, Fremantle, and is dated Fremantle, 6th November, 1902. It reads as follows :Dear Sir,-B y the Wo/lowru, which reached this port in January last, at Adelaide, we had 1,215 pieces of timber transhipped from a vessel from America. The papers forwarded to us were not sufficient to satisfy your department, and, by jiermission, we deposited the sum of £50 (fifty pounds) to obtain delivery, and to produce the specification and other information when received. These papers have come to hand, and we desire to complete entries, but we are informed that .the £50 has been paid into revenue. The amount of duty charged in the shipment is it will be seen that a sum of J-23 Ss. 8d. is due to us. We will be pleased to learn that upon our pissLegislature declined to authorize the coning the necessary entries we may obtain a refund of this amount. The reply was dated 7th November, and reads as follows :In reply to your letter of yesterday's date, I beg to inform you that the amount in question being on deposit over the period allowed, viz., G (six) months, was carried to revenue, and as your firm failed to produce the documents required by this Act within the prescribed time, I am unable.to approve of any application for a refund of ihe amount overpaid. On the 22nd November a letter was addressed to the Comptroller-General of Customs at Melbourne, in the following terms :We respectfully ask your consideration of a deposit entiy made by us in January last, as ]ier onr letter to Collector of Customs here, and his replies thereto, as per copies enclosed herewith. We learn that according to section 17, Federal Customs Act, six (6) months is the period allowed for such deposit, but of this fact we were ignorant, and, therefore, under the circumstances, we trust you will deal justly with the case. On the 4th December the Comptroller General repliedI have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 2nd inst., for refund in connection with an amount deposited by you with the collector, Fremantle, in January hist, to cover duty 011 certain timber ex Wolloicra, and in reply to inform you that the Customs Act does not permit compliance with your request. I think that was really a hard ease, because the firm affecbed was one of good standing, and handed over £ 5 0 as a deposit in order to secure duty which amounted to not more than £ 2 6 . I direct the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs to this matter in bhe besb spirit, and I feel sure thab thab honesby of purpose which has distinguished his administration will prompt him to act fairly in this instance.

I desire to $&y a few words wibh reference bo bhe branscontineubal railway bo Wesbern Australia Some honourable members, representing -U26 f Is. 4d., so South Australia, seem to look upon this proposal in a very parochial spirit.

Thehonorableand learned member for Parkes rather pooh-poohed the idea that the railway would be of any use for the purpose of conveying troops. I hope that many years will pass before any necessity arises for using the line for such a purpose : but I feel sure that we should act wisely in placing ourselves in a position to convey broops to almost any point of our exbensive coasbline, in order bo meet a threatened Ib is questionable whether a railway from Esperance Bay to the gold-fields, such as has been ardently desired by the people of South Australia, would pay or prove of any real benefit to our neighbours in that in fact, it might have bhe effecb bhab neither the present line from Fremantle or bhe suggested line would pay; so that I hope too Mr E.

I hope the Government will push on with the inquiries now being made in regard to the transcontinental railway, and that the line will be surveyed without unnecessary delay. in view of the long speech made by the Minister for Trade and Customs, we may fairly ask the Prime Minister to consent to an adjournment of the debabeab this stage. might go on a little further to-night. I have It has been stated that if a been very considerate to honourable members iu allowing early adjournments, and I think they should be satisfied if we close ab a quarter to eleven. cumstances, the Prime Minister might very fairly have consented to an adjournment, bub I know bhab I need not expect very much consideration from him, and, therefore, I am quite prepared to proceed. A great variety of subjects have been dealt with in the course of this debabe, bub mosb of bhem are of the greatest importance, and deserve the fullest consideration at our hands. Therefore, I do nob regard bhe time devoted to their discussion as wasted. No doubt the Government are anxious to conclude We do nob wish honourable the debate, in order that they may escape further caustic criticism, and enter upon the work of the session without further delay. One of the charges levelled against bhe Prime Minister is bhab he was nob perfectly fair to the electors of the Commonwealth, and particularly to bhose of New Soubh Wales, when he indicated to them the Tariff policy which he stated it was intended to submit to this Parliament. The Prime Minister, in his reply to bhe leader of bhe Opposition, declared bhab there was no reasonable ground for bhe assumption thab he was not perfecbly frank wibh the electors of New South Wales in regard to this matter. But I am disposed to think that the criticism of the leader of the Opposition was perfectly justified. I would reinvasion. mind the right honourable gentleman that a very strong feeling existed in New South Wales over the question of the adoption of the Constitution. That feeling largely obliterated the old lines of difference beState: tween persons entertaining opposite fiscal views. If for no other reason than that, the Prime Minister should have fully disclosed to the electors the character",60,George Turner Bu T The Port

342,Mr Brown,"In view of all the cirof the Tariff which he intended to submit to this Parliament. A t the conclusion of the severe contest in connection with the adoption of the Constitution a meeting was held at Bathurst to consider the future position of the federal movement. A t that meeting the chief figure was the Prime Minister, who was regarded as' the leader of the profederal movement in New South Wales. The battle-cry which he then raised in connection with the impending struggle was not one of protection versus free-trade, but the main contention was that the Constitution was in danger. He appealed to the electors to rally round the federal party, and thus save the Constitution. The reason for this action was that a large section of the anti-federalists were prepared to do all they possibly could to defeat the purposes underlying that instrument of government. A t tlie meeting held in Bathurst, amongst the gentlemen who occupied seats upon the platform were the honourable member for 'Wentworth and the honoiable and learned member for Parkes. The tenor of their addresses was strongly in accord with the policy outlined by the Prime Minister; bub they were wise enough nob bo burn bheir boabs, and when bhey became familiar wibh the characber of the Tariff which was bo be submibted, bhey wisely drew back.' No doubt they congratulate bhemselves bo-day bhab bhey are nob in bhe position of many of bhe old-bime free-braders of New Soubh Wales. For example, one of bhe right-hand supporters of bhe Prime Minister in his own electorate was a free-trader. He supported him upon the understanding bhat the righb honourable genbleman was bo be bhe leadernob of a probectionisb Governmenb, bub of a Federal Adminisbrabion. The federal idea was bo be uppermost. When the Tariff was submitted bo bhis House he withdrew his support, and during the course of the present debate the Prime Minister has declared thab bhe genbleman in question had nob sense enough bo perceive whab was the real position at the time. Yet in his Maitland address I find that the Prime Minister, amongst other things, stated-I have not come here to conduct a protectionist campaign, though under other circumstances I should have been prepared to do so. Later on, in addressing a Brisbane audience, he is reported to have said that the difference between the policy of the Government and that. of the other side was only a thin veneer that it was .not the wide fundamental distinction which is implied by a probecbive as distinguished from a freebrade Tariff. During bhe same campaign bhe Minisber for Home Affairs is reported to have saidHe could only call it cruel to raise the fiscal question now, when the very Constitution itself rendered free-trade and protection alike impossible. All these facts go to show that the fiscal issue was not submitted to the electors. I would further point out that Senator O'Connor gave utberance bo sentiments similar bo bhose enberbained by the Minister for Home Affairs. The Vice-President of the Executive Council is reported to have saidWe ought not to allow the wretched fiscal question to come in, but we ought to choose the best men. That was the original battle-cry. The men who were in sympathy with the federal movement were to receive first consideration, aud the wretched fiscal issue was not to be raised. But what happened? After bhe elecbions had been won, the Government had to evolve their taxation proposals. In submitting bhose proposals bo bhis House the Minisber for Trade and Customs declaredThis is a protectionist policy. We were sent here by the people to support that policy, and we place it before you with the force of our majority behind us. That is very different from the statement which was .made throughout New South Wales prior bo bhe elections. All things considered, I think there is very substantial ground for the criticism which has been levelled against the Government upon this particular matter. I regret to say that the high expectations formed of the first Federal Administration have not been realized. Probably bhe reason for bhis is bo be found in bhe facb thab bhe Prime Minister selected his present colleagues very largely from bhe legal profession of bhe obher States. The resulb is that in the adminisbrabion of bhe affairs of governmenb we gebtoo much of legal bechnicalibies and boo little of common-sense. The result is that much friction has been caused throughout the Commonwealth by an incapacity on the part of Ministers to handle matters in a commonsonse manner. WhilstI freely confess bhab 1 was in opposibion bo bhe Consbibution Bill, because I wished to see it more democratic in some respects, I bhink I have every reasonable ground for claiming thab I am as sincere a federalist as the men who fought for a conservative I hope that federation will not be judged by the mismanagement of the first Federal Government. mover of the address in reply in the hope that as time goes on those causes of friction will disappear, and that the great advantages to the whole of the people of Australia from this union will present themselves in so Strong a light that dissatisfaction will be forgotten, and all will assist in upholding and supporting the federal movement. i\ matterof great regret to every friend of the union that the Federal Government have made such a bad start. If even now the Government .could see their way to clear themselves of the mere legal technicalities, red tape, and blue paper which, as it were, make the Federal Government stink in the nostrils of the average member of the public, they would serve the high purpose I have no doubt they have in view much better than they are doing at present. This weakness is seen right through the various departments, Minister in the case of the half-dozen hatters, down to the administration of the Post and Telegraph department, am afraid that even the of Defence is not altogether free from this irritating hatters, I wish to say that I supported the provision under which they excluded, because I believed that a law of that character was necessary and desirable in the best interests of the people of Australia. AndI am not prepared to go back on the stand I then took ; but it is most regrettable that the powers conferred bj' this provision were put into operation on this particular occasion. that the papers which have been produced place a much more favorable light on the conduct of the Prime Minister appeared when the question was exciting high feeling in the State of New South Wales. ground for the feeling of friction which was occasioned in that State. Minister in his reply seemed. to wish to lead the House to suppose the noise was caused by opponents of his Government, of legislation of this character. I remind the Prime Minister, that perhaps one of his strongest political friends in New South Wales is his late colleague, Mr Brown. the present Premier of that State. That Constitution. gentleman is not likely to lend himself toany expression of hostility towards the Federal Government on measures of thisI join heartily with the description, but he saw grave grounds fortaking exception to the action of the Prime Minister. In the height of the disturbance, before the Prime Ministercame to a decision, Sir John See telegraphed, to him as follows :I sincerely hope your Government will see fitrelease hatters on OrovMs without further delay. But it is Matter raising intense dissatisfaction here. 'The following day Sir John See wired againJust received cable from Agent-General that, action taken to prevent landing of British workmen seriously affects financial proposals of this State. Again strongly urge permission to land. all the facts of the case. the Premier of New South Wales, who is not in any way hostile to the Prime Minister of from that of the Prime the Commonwealth.

But red-tapeism. As to the he could notsupportthem in the matter of thehatters. I am open to correction, but I am were informed that Mr Anderson also is a strong supporter of the present Government, and notlikely in a matter of the kind to do anything to their detriment. Mr Anderson spentsomething like £30,000 in Sydneyi n equipping a factory for the production of' hats, and he was not likely to spend thatsum of money for nothing. For his factory I admit he required 72 skilled"" hands, and was prepared to give employment to about 200 or 300 other persons; and,' according to histhan own statement, he endeavoured to secure this skilled labour in the State of Victoria before he sought assistance from outside theThere was some substantial Commonwealth. I find from a return prepared by the trades unions for the informaThe Prime tion of the Prime Minister, that in this tradethere are 173 skilled hands in Victoria, that twenty in South Australia, fifteen in New South Wales, and three in Western Ausand of the principles tralia, or a total of about 211 within theBut Commonwealth. Papers produced show conclusively that Mr Anderson was not able to get anything like the number he wanted in Australia, and he-decided to import hands. I .",61,George Turner Bu T The Port
343,Mr Tijdob,Si r John See did not know,63,George Turner Bu T The Port
344,Mr Brown,"That was a request fromcannot understand the -opposition which in certain quarters was shown to theimportation of skilled men of this description. Itmeant theopening of a new industry, and enlarging the productive powers of the Commonwealth; instead of making the conditions of labour worse, it meant the opening up of new avenues of employment. I have no sympathy with the cry that, the population of the Commonwealth should be kept down to its present figure. We have immense possibilities in the way of developing the wealth of Australia, but the possibilities are dormant until such time as intelligent labour can be brought to bear.' If this Commonwealth is to be the great nation we hope, we must be prepared not only to see an increase of population but to afford facilities to that population for developing the natural resources of the land. To prohibit the starting of new lines of industry, or to prevent the introduction of skilled hands, is, in my opinion, the most suicidal policy which could be followed ; at any rate, it is a policy to which I cannot give any adhesion. Victoria, and increasingly so in New South Wales, such are the conditions that I'believe it would he most unwise to launch.any large scheme of assisting or inducing population, to come here. We arc not able to hold the population we have at the present .time. The very best men of these two States are -being driven away because the natural resources are in the hands of a monopolistic few, who will not uso those resources themselves, or afford others reasonable facilities for d.oing so. Until the State Governments solve this problem I have no hope of any great additions to our population in the near future, but am rather inclined to think that the leakage we are now experiencing will continue, to the detriment of the Commonwealth and our national prosperity. The Prime Minister took a week to consider the matter of the six hatters; and here I may say that I believe the right honourable gentleman, in insisting on an exemption being applied for, was ' only carrying out the law. The difficulty of the position was first of all that the particular section was in an Alien Restriction Act which primarily dealt with coloured races; and. both employers and workmen in the old country may be excused for their ignorance of the character of the legislation. these men. were told something about the law in Melbourne. left the old country. son, according to his own statement, sought legal advice, and he was informed that the Act did not apply to men who were beingbrought out under the terms of his agreement. Afte r considerable negotiation, after he had been put to the expense of journeying from Sydney to Melbourne to interview the Prime Minister,. and after the Prime Minister had consulted a number of persons, interested in the trade, it was discovered that the whole trouble was due to the fact, that one of the blue paper forms of which the Federal Government is so fond had not been filled in. When Mr Anderson wasset on the right course, the Prime Minister discovered, as he wrote in his minute, that I t is clear that Mr Anderson cannot find hisBut in the State of 72 men among the existing personnel of the Australian hat trade within the Commonwealth, and orders were issued to allow the men to be landed. Instead of being treated as. they were, they should have been treated as the Sultan of Johore and the Maoris whocame here were treated. It was most unwise to administer the law as it was administered. I am a friend of the Act , because I believe it to be a necessary one, and I want to see its provisions carried into effect. But I say that it was unfortunate, in the interests of that legislation, that the incident happened. If the men had a right to come here, they should not have been placed in such an invidious position; but, on the other hand, if they came out under conditions inimical to the publicwelfare, they should have been treated as undesirable immigrants, and not allowed to land. I believe that great damage has been done to the Commonwealth in the opinion of the old world by the action which was taken. I make that statement on the authority of the Premier of New South Wales, and of the Agent General of that State, both of Whom are personal friends and former colleagues of the Prime Minister, and would not say anything calculated to injure him .unlessthey'found it absolutely necessary to do so. now.",63,George Turner Bu T The Port
