These will be found set out in the Navigation (Survey and Equipment) Eegulations, and the Navigation (Loadlines) Eegulations. Similar charges are made in the United Kingdom by the British Board of Trade. The Australian charges are, however, in almost every case, lower.

The matter will be settled at the earliest date practicable. 2. Ifc is widely known that a change of policy is inevitable, and in the interim it cannot be expected that sales oE apparatus could be effected as they might be under settled conditions, j t would not be wise for people to buy sealed sets in existing circumstances; but under the new conditions dealers wil l doubtless clfcct small modifications of any stocks they may hold of sealed sets in order that they may bu available for various wave lengths. 3.

The notes have only a mythical value, and the sooner those for which there is no gold backing are withdrawn the better it w ill be.

The menibers of the proposed board should be gentlemen who are well acquainted with financial affairs, and who know the facts about our Australian trade and industry. They should not be subject to political control, and should only issue notes for gold. It is ridiculous that the Notes Issue Board should have refused to issue notes on the security of sovereigns. A sovereieu will always buy a note and a little more, but a note will not buy a sovereign. New notes should be issued whenever new gold is offered in exchange for them. people should be able to demand gold for notes at any time, but they cannot do so at present. Why should the associated banks be compelled t.o lodge reserves with the Commonwealth Bank? They should be allowed to retain their money and invest it as they desire, provided thab sovereigns. notes should be in safe custody. Commonwealth Bank at present has its clearing house at the Bank of New South Wales. That bank is much stronger than the Commonwealth Bank. sociated banks as a matter of fact have built up Australia, and their system of exchange has been altogether to the benefit of the people.

Some honourable members say that it has made Australia blossom like a rose. I would say, like a rose in a bottle of mixed pickles. Men who control financial affairs have to be properly trained to look at things from the bankers' stand-point.

PARKER MOLONEY (Hume) [12.4] -The honourable member for Darwin( Mr Whitsitt) who has just resumed his seat, is entitled to his own opinions, but I shall endeavour to show how absolutely misleading soma of his statements are. People who have no time to study the intricacies of finance, can bo forgiven for not understanding the position, but for an honourable inember in this House to make use of the statements contained in the speech of the honourable member who has just sat down, is unforgiveable. The honourable gentleman led off by saying that this country owed nothing to ths Commonwealth Bank. . Such a statement can be brushed aside without comment. It impresses itself on no one's mind, and certainly not on the mind of the Trea surer (Dr. Earle Page). Throughout his speech the Treasurer paid a tribute to the work of the Commonwealth Bank. The honourable member for Darwin, by way of showing the private banks in a more favorable light than the Commonwealth Bank, said that the private banks used to hold eight sovereigns for every note they issued. The absurdity of that statement is apparent on the face of it . sorry thafc the honourable member persists in the statement. show thc honourable member how utterly ridiculous his statement sovereigns included all the gold held by the banks against all their liabilities. in respect to notes represent about one-fifteenth or one-twentieth only of . tlieir total liabilities. If we accept the view of the honourable meniber, thafc the gold held by the banks was a backing for the notes they issued, they would have no backing at all for their other liabilities. view of that, does the honourable member still persist in the views he has expressed? He should take the trouble to look into these matters carefully before The making such loose and wild statements. The honourable gentleman asked what would happen if the people with current accounts were to draw cheques and demand payment. He said that, so f a r as The sooner Australia the private banks were concerned, everything would be all right. Let me refer to the Treasurer's speech, and we shall see what would happen if those people presented cheques to the f u l l value of their current accounts. The Treasurer saidWe find the percentages of total legal tender as compared with liabilities not bearing interest have been :In 1886 ... ... ... 46.2 per cent.

Ifc is surprising that any honourable member in this chamber is unaware of a simple fact like that. No private bank in this country would be foolish enough to say that It is true. it could immediately meet all cheques so I am presented to it , ancl nobody w i th any knowledge of the position seriously thinks it could be done. I am surprised It was true in 1910. that the honourable meniber ""for DarwinL e t mo should be so innocent. MrE . RILET -Speeches like that of is.

I can only say that this is a shameful use of public funds in order to bolster up the pronts of wealthy shareholders in private banking institutions. Quite contrary to what has been said by the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, the Commonwealth Bank may be said to have triumphed in spite of the dead weight of its opponents. it has made nearly £5,000,000 in profits for the people. It exerted a steadying influence which, during the war period, saved this country from anything in the nature of a financial panic. honourable member for Darwin( Mr' Whitsitt) represents a primary producer's constituency, and a knowledge of what the Oommonwealth Bank did during the war period, when the primary producers were largely cut off from their overseas markets, should have prevented him from making the slanderous statements he has made against that great institution. notice of tire honourable member. may be so, but such statements are repeated outside, and it is just as well that a reply to them should be placed on record. Wlieat was the first great staple product of this country dealt with during the war period, and the first compulsory wheat pool was handled by the Commonwealth Government arranging with the Commonwealth Bank, and to a lesser extent with the joint stock banks, for advances to be made on wheat certificates. Every one knows what was the result of that arrangement. It extricated the primary producers of this country from the dilemma tbey would otherwise have been in through being cut off fro m their pre-war markets? the hands of the food speculators. so, and at the same time it eased to a great extent the local financial situation. The same system was followed in subsequent harvests during the war period, but after the first wheat pool the Commonwealth Bank, as a Government institution, was placed in the paramount position. at every capital centre. Although honourable members are aware of the facts, it is just as well that a few figures should be given, to indicate the colossal nature of the work in the performance of which the Commonwealth Bank was the chief instrument. From 1915 to 1921 the wheat yield amounted to 640,000,000 bushels, and realized £185,000,000. So that wheu I say that the work in this connection performed largely by the Commonwealth Bank, was colossal, I am not using the language of exaggeration. Up to the present time Throughout the war period it was the great steadying influence of this bank that relieved the primary producers of this country from the very difficult position in which, bufc for the assistance it The rendered, they would have been placed. will surely recognize the very important part which the private banks played in fche matter. already mentioned the part taken by the joint stock banks, but I say that except m the case of the first compulsory wheat pool fche services they rendered took a very secondary place when compared with those rendered by the Commonwealth Bank. Commonwealth Bank the primary producers would never have received the same consideration from the private banks. only fche Commonwealth Bank thafc held the private banking institutions in check during the war. If the steadying influence of the Commonwealth Bank had not been exerted we can imagine what would have happened during the war period from our experience of the private banking institutions in pre-war days, aud when the Commonwealth Bank waa not in existence. Speaking of many with whom I have come into contact I It took them out of can say thafc the experience of the man on fche land of private banks has, T h a t is in many cases, been a very sorry and sad one.

87,Mr Parkermoloney,"It was that there is to-day amongst primary producers, and especially wheat farmers, a -lasting sense of gratitude to the Commonwealth Bank for what it did for them during the war period. WhatI have said about wheat cau be said also about the handling of wool, meat, butter, f r u it , and most of our primary products. This work was done by fche Commonwealth Bank as fche recognized central authority and pivot for the financing of our primary products during fche war period. Apart from what the Commonwealth Bank did in the interests of primary producers we know what ifc has done in connection with the floating of war loans. The statement has been made, but it will stand repeating, that ifc saved the people of this country £6,000,000 on the commission charged on the floating of loans. The rafce charged by the Commonwealth Bank was 5s. 9d. per £100 as against a rate of £ 2 7s. I d . per £100 charged by private banking institutions. This represented on Australia's internal war loans a saving to this country of £6,000,000. to-day will stand up in this chamber and decry the Commonwealth Bank as an in stitution which the country wonld have been better without. thafc there was a member in this House who would not appreciate the work of fche bank, and would not have a kind word to say for it . The Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page), throughout his speech, indicated that the countiy owes much to the Commonwealth Bank. what is to become of it now ? already said that one does not need to read the bill to know what is intended by it ; one has only to remember the acclaim with which the measure was received by fche. private banking institutions of the country. Ifc is proposed to hand the Commonwealth Bank over to a board that will certainly not be in sympathy wifch the expansion of its functions in the interests of the people. is safe to sayfchafcthe intention of the bill is thafc the Commonwealth Bank should in in the interests of the people as in fche interests of the private banks. The bill is intended as a prop for private hanking institutions. As the Treasurer, who introduced the bill, and many members of his party, do not believe in the extension of public utilities we can hardly expect the bill to be designed to develop a national bank in the interests of the people. public utilities. Treasurer said that he would sell the railways if he had his way. He, at least, could not be expected to bring down a bill to develop a truly national bank, and I am not satisfied that his attitude towards the bank is more favorable than it is towards the railways. Tliere is a great difference between the treatment of the primary producers by the Commonwealth Bank and their treatment by the private banks. In view of that, one wonders how any one claiming to represent the interests of the primary producer can laud the private banks and decry the Commonwealth Bank. I remind honourable members of the Country party that when a proposal was made fro m this side of the House during the 1921-22 harvest to provide a cash payment of os. a bushel for wheat, an amendment wa3 moved by Yet there are people who a Countiy party member that half the amount should be paid in certificates. The amendment was agreed to against the wishes of the Labour party, and there are I did not think mauy men on the laud to-day who can inform the honourable member for Darwin( Mr Whitsitt) that when they took their certificates to the private banks fchey were charged an interest rate of 7-i per cenfc. for discounting them. Again, what were men like the honourable inember for But Echuca( MrH ill ) told a few weeks ago I have when the question of financing the next wheat pool was under consideration? They were told that the private banks had ""finished with them."" I do not know whether the honourable member for Echuca would endorse what the houorable member for Darwin has said, but when he placed the private banks on a pedestal he must have had in his mind the fact thafc a few weeks It ago they would not take part in financing fche wheat pool. In so far as the private hanks have displayed any willingness future function not so much during late years to help the primary producers, it has been because of the existonce of the Commonwealth Bank. What hope of assistance could be held out for the primary or secondary producers if the Commonwealth Bank did not exist? And yet it is interesting to know the extent to which the private",28,Commonwealth Bankbill Second Reading

I have in mind scores of people, notably in the electorate of In d i , whicli I forced off their holdings by the depredations of private banks. I have in my mind afc present the case of a man who, in a period of drought in New South Wales, lost about half his stock. E v il days came to him, as they come to many others in this country. bank, which allowed him an overdraft. The drought did mot break as soon as was expected, and after being threatened by the bank, he was given a certain time in which to meet the overdraft. There was only one thing thafc saved hima Labour Government was in power, and ifc threatened to introduce moratorium regulations to protect him and others similarly placed. The threat proved effective, and it was the sole reason why he was allowed to remain on his land. His subsequent career shows thafc he was a t h r if t y , deserving man, and an asset The fco this country. The short extension of time allowed to him enabled him to reNot cover, and he is now prosperous. I quote that incident to show that the struggling settler owes very small thanks to the private banking institutions of this country. on the case mentioned by the honourable member, they would probably have sold On the land to one of their friends. Yet, what very probably true. A t the last election the Country party, to which the Treasurer belongs, went to the countiy knowing all these things.

But clearly the man on the laud is to be sacrificed so that the wealthy shareholders in the private banks may be coddled. disappointment will also be felt throughout that the Government has not seriously dealt with the exchange problem. bill offers no relief whatever in that respect, although the exchange rate is a great handicap to primary and secondary industries. The Treasurer, in his speech, suggested three remedies. thafc there should be an adjustment of credits due to Australia in Loudon by the liquidation of the Government securities there in lieu of importing goods. Secondly, he suggested a return to the gold standard, bufc finally he rejected the two foregoing suggestions and submitted a third remedy, which he said he favoured. l i e remarkedThe Government recognizes that both internal and external borrowing should be arranged as judiciously as possible. . . The establishment of a central bank on the lines proposed would place independent expert advice at tlie disposal of the various Governments, and assist in harmonizing, and, if necessary, in curtailing tlieir loan operations. The only remedy to whicli the Treasurer pins his faith is the curtailment of public borrowing. In the last twelve months, however, two loans have been floated abroad, one of £8,000,000, and one more recently of £4,000,000. the Government should set an example to show thafc ifc is sincere in its contention that public borrowing should be curtailed, lionorable members expected the Government to bring down some concrete proposal on the exchange question, but the speech of the Treasurer was indefinite and hesitating to a degree. The Minister evaded the issue by saying that he would leave the matter in the hands of the experts to be appointed to the board. In the event of these experts having no solution to offer the position will be as unfavorable as ever. The. Government has merely expressed the pious hope that there may be a curtailment of borrowing. If that is the key to the situation, arrangements should have been made long demonstrates that the bank is hamstrung ago, to have only one borrowing authority by the very people who ought to be exin Australia.

The whole of the assets of the Australia when it is realized municipality would have been offered as security, but I was told by the ActThe ing Governor of the bank thafc there was no money available.

Several cases in which a similar answer was given have come under my notice.

If those in charge of the bank study the interests of the private banks instead of permitting their sympathies to run along the lines of the bank's progress, they are not fit for the positions they hold. The Commonwealth Bank has made fair progress, saddled though it has been with unsympathetic administration, and oue can imagine what I submit that progress would have been made under sympathetic control. In my own electorate are many flourishing centres, and yet only two branches of the bank are established there. I believe that most other country electorates are even less favoured. I could name twenty flourishing towns in my electorate where a branch of the bank would thrive, but no steps have been takeii to extend the operations of the institution there. MrA .

Dr. absolutely contrary to the fact. the Acting Governor is adopting his present attitude of his own free will, his sympathies must lie with the private banks, in whose service he ought to be. When gilt-edged propositions are submitted to those in command they display about as much activity as a petrified elephant. They say either that there is no money available, or that they are not looking for the kind of business submitted. It is deplorable that the bank has been kept stationary in country districts where the people are most anxious to have the facilities that new branches afford. Any development that has taken place, has been brought about despite the unsympathetic administration. If the leading officials have moved slowly in the past, the bill now before us is calculated to make them proceed more slowly still. One can only read into the measure the intention to maintain the Commonwealth Bank as a prop to the private banking institutions. It is not the desire of the people that that course should be followed. Those who originated the bank hope to see a truly national bank established, and developed on national lines. In my opinion, the time is ripe for the whole of the banking in this country to be medium of a national banking system, acting on behalf of the community. Sitting people of Australia would like to see a real national hank established without further delay. I want to see a national-ized banking system brought about with a mobilization of credits not only in times of war, stress, or trouble, but also in normal times. Prior to the war, people would have ridiculed the idea that Australia could raise the amount of money which was spent on sending troops overseas and on the various activities in which the Government engaged during the war. It was the mobilization of credits that enabled Australia to discharge its obligations; and nowadays no one wonders how it came about. It is not, therefore, too much to expect that the same thing should be done to develop the CommonI f that wealth in peace time to the greatest possible advantage. The mobilization of credits is not surrounded with that to it . A f t e r all, credit is the veiy basis If then of banking. Banks may have whatever backing they like in the shape of bullion, but it is of little or no use to them with out the further backing of public confidence. Credit is simply public confidence. It is depressing to think that in a country in which so many persons are dependent for their very existence upon the sweet w ill of private banking institutions, in stance after instance can be quoted of people being forced out of their holdings because of their inability to get from banking institutions the accommodation to which they were entitled. The absurdity of the position is easily seen when a comparison is made between ordinary traders and ordinary banks. The difference between them is that in the case of the trader the public supplies the business and the trader supplies the goods, whereas in the case of the bank the public supplies not only the business but also the goods in the for m of public confidence, without whicli the bank would have to close its doors. In these circumstances I can see nothing wrong in having a mobilization of credits in a country like this so that done through the what the people create may be used for and on behalf of the people. This can only be done by bringing about a comprehensive nationalized system, of banking. I suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. cannot conceive why so many persons should be at the mercy of private bankThe ing institutions. These institutions could not prosper but for the fact that the public supplies that confidence or credit which is their very life-blood. The time is over-ripe for giving the people the control of the banking system of the Commonwealth. The bill offers no measure of relief in this direction. It simply places the people more firmly in the grip of private banks.",31,Commonwealth Bankbill Second Reading

A t the same time one has to take as intelligent an interest as one can in important matters of this kind, and I have read the bill very carefully and listened attentively to some of the speeches that have been delivered upon it. I was particularly curious to learn exactly what is the gravamen of the charge which the Opposition has to bring against the bill, and I find, upon a careful perusal of the speech' made by the Leader of -the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) that his main complaint is that the measure represents a dastardly attempt on the part of the Government to kill the Commonwealth Bank. He says that the effects of the amendments proposed will be to enable [76] the directors of the Commonwealth Bank to assist private banks in which they are interested to such an extent that it will be discounting their bills and leaving itself without any security. exactly that. recollection, the Leader of the Opposition said that the bills of the private banks will be discounted by the Commonwealth Bank, and that that will lead to an accumulation in the private banks of a mass of notes for which the Commonwealth will have no security. It is difficult to undermeans by that charge. Therefore, I have carefully considered each amendment contained in the bill, asking myself, "" How can this proposal possibly have the effect which the Leader of the Opposition predicts? How will this amendment tend to kill the Commonwealth Bank? . How will it tend, as the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin) so weirdly said, ' to scientifically strangle' the Commonwealth Bank?"" Whilst the Leader of the Opposition says that the object of the bill is to kill the Commonwealth Bank, the Treasurer (Dr. Earle Page) says, "" On the contrary, the Commonwealth Bank is not fulfilling the functions for which it was originally Resigned, and my amendments are intended to entween these conflicting contentions I have referred to the speech of the then Prime Minister and Treasurer ( Mr Andrew Fisher) when moving the second reading of the original bill in 1911. The gist of the right honourable gentleman's remarks was this, ""We see from the prosperous returns of the private banks that there is room for another bank, and we think this a favorable opportunity to establish a Commonwealth Bank that will transact the Government's business, and also engage in ordinary banking."" Then Mr Fisher proceeded to express the hope that the bank would develop into an institution dealing in ordinary bills of exchange and other such liquid securities, and eventually become a bank of banks, and not a mere money-lending institution.

At the same time there is on record the expressed hope of Mr Fisher that in time the Commonwealth Bank would become a bank of banks. the slightest doubt that the framers of the original bill, in setting before them that ideal, had in mind the Bank of England; they evidently looked forward to the time when the Commonwealth Bank would become practically what the Bank of England is to-day, an institution which by its very constitution gives stability to manner in which he acts depends the the whole banking system of the country. That is what I found when perusing MrI quite agree that the success of such an Fisher's speech.

Mr Fisher did not anticipate the time when the ordinary private banks would be dispensed with and a national bank substituted. the term "" national bank "" or "" people's bank "" iu any such sense; but looked to the time when the Commonwealth Bank would really be a central bank-as the Bank of.England is-giving stability and unity to the whole banking system of the Commonwealth. with the amendments proposed by the Treasurer, and to ask this question in regard to each one of them: ""How can this particular amendment in any sense upset or strike at the foundation of the Commonwealtli Bank, or tend in any way to strangle the bank's operations?"" It is exceedingly difficult to discuss a somewhat tors to obtain from the bank financial intricate and important problem of this nature without the aid of notes, and I have to depend upon my memory to keep the amending proposals in their consecutive order as far as possible. members of the Opposition say that their charge is that the Government are introducing amendments the object of which is to strangle the bank, the only fair way in which to meet such arguments is by taking the amending proposals separately in order to see in what way any single one tends in thatdirection. The first proposal is the substitution Jfr. Maxwell. for a governor to control the Commonwealth Bank. How can that amendment, if carried into effect, tend to strangle or in any way curtail! the operations of the bank? I return to Mr Fisher's speech again, and I find There is not that when discussing the question of the management of the bank, he said, in effect, that the future of the bank would depend upon the Governor and the way in which he shaped. He said, in effect, "" We make the constitution o? the bank, we place the Governor there as director, and upon the future success or otherwise of the bank.""

I assume that the Government will make a wise selection. What has been said by the Leader of the I now wish to deal Opposition ( Mr Charlton), and those who think with him? As I understand their utterances, they believe that the men representing the pastoral and agricultural interests will in some way get at the bank. I believe the charge in this connection is that these men will dishonestly use their positions as direcassistance for institutions and undertakings in which they are interested, and for which they will offer no sound security. says that. was said. pleading. the objections raised against the appointment of a board of directors.

131,Their Bills Of Ex,"Dr. MALONEY T h a t there may becreated by Charles II . , of anything but sacred memory. The history of banking is almost a romance for those who care to study its pages. On a former occasion I pointed out how, at an early period in the history of banking in Victoria, it was possible for any money-spinner who could command a sum of £125,000 to start a bank in this state. ford) -Does the honourable member in tend to use that incident as an illustration ? Dr. already appears in Hansard, in the report of my speech on the original banking bill. I pointed out then that any moneyspinner with the sum of £125,000 could have started a bank in Victoria and obtained authority to issue an unlimited number of notes. Those honourable members who, like my&elf, are getting on in years will remember the position when all the associated banks in Australia/there were no fewer than 87 different banks then-ha d authority to issue notes. Very few people could give, off-hand, the name of the bank whose notes they carried in their pockets. I recollect, on one occasion, walking down Collins-street with a friend, and putting questions on this point to a number of persons whom we met. Not one person in the twelve whom we questioned could say what bank had issued the notes which he was carrying. bank notes of a certain denomination. As a result of all this confusion, after the Australian-European Bank failed, the notes issued by that bank were passing as currency throughout the back-blocks of Australia for over 25 years. Honourable members w ill , I am sure, agree that with so many different banks of issue, it was much more difficult than at the present time to detect forgery in notes. The practice of the Bank of England is never to allow a note returned to the bank to go back into circulation, so that if any forgery is attempted the authorities know at once. When I was in the note issue department of a private bank officer to call over the numbers of the notes returned to the bank, while another officer checked the call in the ledger. If the same number reappeared, the practice was to examine the note carefully under a microscope and ascertain if it was genuine or a forgery. . If it was genuine, the presumption was that the note of the same number previously returned must have been a forgery. afraid the honourable member is not confining his remarks to the amendment before the Chair. Deputy Speaker, but Mr Speaker ruled that honourable members should be permitted a fairly wide range in the debate on this bill. If you rule that I must confine my remarks strictly to the amendment at a later stage. not hear Mr Speaker's ruling on the point raised, so I must ask the honourable member to comply with the directions of the Chair. to do so, Mr Deputy Speaker, but you and I are too old in parliamentary experience to be prevented from developing our argument in the way we desire. W it h your permission, I shall direct my attention to the amendment a little later. If honourable members desire the information concerning the position in Victoria during the time of which I speak, I refer them to my remarks in Hansard. I claim credit for having been the first to reveal the danger of one bank being able to issue an unlimited number of notes. Section 12 of the Banks and CurrencyA c t 1890 All they knew was that they held readsNotes payable to bearer at sight or on demand issued in Victoria by any banking company, firm, or individual banker, in the hands of any bona fide holder thereof for value who has received the same in the ordinary course of business witliout notice that the same has been issued or dealt with contrary to the provisions of this Act and has not subsequently dealt with the same otherwise than in the ordinary course of business shall in the event of such company being wound up or such firm or banker being insolvent or bankrupt be a first charge on the assets in Victoria of such company, firm, or banker, not being the subject of any mortgage, pledge, lien, charge, or other security in favour of any other creditor I specially direct attention to the signifithe practice was for one cance of the concluding sentencenot being the subject of any mortgage, pledge, lien, charge, or otlier security in favour of any other creditor.

Section 14 of the act from which I have just quoted readsNo banking company, firm, or individual banker shall issue notes payable to bearer at sight or on demand unless such company or firm has a subscribed capital of not less than Two hundred and fifty thousand pounds, and a paid-up capital of not less than One hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds, or unless such individual banker has a capital of not less than One hundred and twenty-five thousand pounds, and any company, linn, or banker issuing notes contrary to the provisions of this section shall be liable to a penalty amounting to Twenty-five pounds per centum of the amount of the notes so issued, to be recoverable with full costs of suit by any person who may sue for the same.

Well, we have got a start-w o have a Commonwealth Bank, thanks to the Labour partybut I want more. I want that bank to be' an institution which will help the farmer w it h cheap money, and will not call in the loans when times are bad and ho needs the assistance most. This is no visionary idea. It has been done in othor countries. In New York, for instance, they are adopting the rural credits system to give cheap money to farmers on longtime overdrafts. In order for the bank to become great a Board of Management should be appointed, consisting of the Governor, representing the Commonwealth, and one representative from each of the subscribing States, who should represent the States Savings Banks, the Governor possessing a casting vote. Thus wo preserve banking equality of Commonwealth and States. In France and Germany the small farmers can borrow all the money they require at 3 per cent, to 5 per cent., payable by small instalments over a term of about 50 years, or sooner if they wish. The greatness of these countries is -largely due to the prosperity and independence of the small farmers, a n d ' l want to see a similar state of affairs here.

Not only should they be assisted to produce, but to market their produce. I have given my meed of praise to a great man whose financial acumen was exercised for the benefit of Australia. His endeavours to secure the establishment of a national bank for the Commonwealth were unceasing in the party to which he belonged, but to which I am sorry to say he does not now belong. adopted his views, and carried them to fruition under tbe leadership of Mr Andrew Fisher. There is one flaw in the existing Commonwealth BankA c t, and attempts were made in this House to rectify it . We should have consolidated the savings banks of the states with the savings bank of the Commonwealth. The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition ( Mr Charlton) meets with my f u l l approval. a youngster I served in a bank for about seven years, during a period of eleven years. In the case of au ordinary bank, in selecting its directors the first man shareholder of the bank, and then any man of wealth, squatter, or merchant may be called to the board. But, after all, we know that the conduct of a private bank is l e f t to the manager. ten private banks it is the practice of the directors to say, "" Yes, Mr Manager."" I ray Smith, who was a bank director here for 20 or 30 years, attended a meeting of bank clerks held in the Temperance H a l l . He did not know that the clerks in his bank were called back to work at night. I told him so from the platform of the hall, and I said, "" If you will walk down to the bank with me we shall find them working there."" He was astonished to find them at work, and he said, "" I never knew they came back."" We directorate of the Commonwealth Bank. It differs from any other bank in the world. It is a bank of issue and deposit, and at the same time a savings bank. I can remember that 50 years ago there were penny savings banks in the Old Country, and at one time there was a post office savings bank in Victoria, but never so f a r as my reading goes, has there been another bank like the Commonwealth Bank, at the same time a savings bank and a bank of issue and deposit. Leader of the Opposition has given a great deal of thought to this subject, and I am sure he w ill agree with me that we [77] should have on the directorate of the bank, an expert in savings bank business, who should have control of that department, subject, of course, to the governor. The directors should give the whole of their time to the work of the bank. They should not be half-time men. I hope That party we w ill not appoint to the directorate ""guinea pigs,"" such as are many of the directors of the private banks. I have little doubt that the Commonwealth Bank w i ll ultimately become the greatest banking institution i u the world, unless other nations follow our example in the establishment of similar institutions. The Commonwealth Bank is certain to increase in power and influence in the community. The directors should be finanAs cial experts, and where in Australia can we better secure such men than from amongst those trained in our banking system? Who could be better fitted to be a director of the bank than one who looked to is the biggest has successfully passed through the different grades in its service? There could, of course, be no objection to the appointment of a heaven-born, genius of finance, wherever he might be found. In nine out of Very few merchants dealing in bills of exchange know very much of the intricacies of the law pertaining to such instruments. I remember that.as a youthful officer of a bank I was somewhat of a favourite with the merchants, probably because I was so small, and ou many occasions they wrote questions which they asked me to give to the accountant to answer for them. I mention this to show that as a class, merchants cannot be regarded as financial experts, though there are, of course, amongst them men of great financial knowledge. That can be said of every calling. We know that many pawnneed financial experts on the brokers become financial experts, but they are uot the type of men we want on the directorate of the Commonwealth Bank. Although the Leader of the Opposition has submitted an amendment on the motion for the second reading of the bill, that is not to say that there is no good in it. I think there is much that is good in the bill, but honourable members on this side quite definitely desire that the Commonwealth Bank should be an institution not only for the conduct of higher The finance, but for the benefit of every erson in Australia.

Earle Page)_, to the serious industrial positiou that has arisen in the important town of Kalgoorlie. vious intimation a cablegram was recently received from the London directors of the Ivanhoe mine announcing that it was proposed to amalgamate that mine with the Lake View and Star mines and shut down the Ivanhoe mine. It was, of course, beyond the power of anybody in Australia to prevent that being done, and the result is that 500 men have been thrown out of employment. For every miner in Kalgoorlie four other people are kept employed in various avocations there. found for the miners a loss of 2,000 in the population of the town w ill be sustained. are married. Government has done everything it possibly can to alleviate the situation. The Premier visited the gold-fields, and 100 men were given work along the water supply main. sorbed in other mines, leaving a balance of 350 still unemployed. through not having any surrounding wheat-growing country, is in a particularly unfavorable position to provide work for such a large number of unemployed. These men have their homes established in Kalgoorlie, and they naturally require employment in the district. a teiegra.ni I received from the Premier of Western Australia, I interviewed the Minister for Works and Railways( Mr Stewart), and suggested that the men should be employed on the ballasting of the transcontinental railway. TheM in ister pointed out that the £50,000 allocated for that work for this year had already been exhausted. proached the Treasurer to find out whether a further sum could be made available, and he replied that he could not see his way clear at the present juncture to make a further grant. phasize the point that not more than half the ballasting work has been done, and it is essential that the whole of the line should be ballasted. A t the present rate of progress it w ill take nine years to side Ford's boat building shop at Berry's Bay. complete the work. Seeing that honourable menibers on the Opposition side of the House have on various occasions assisted the Government to relieve other industries, I hope that a sum w ill be promptly set aside to enable these men to secure employment near their homes. Only Y0 Without any premen are now employed at the Woocalla Quarryi n connection w i th ballasting operations, and about 30 men are engaged in rail-lifting. They are all employed at the eastern end of the line, while none are employed at the Kalgoorlie end. The State Government is doing all that it possibly can in the matter with its limited resources; and, seeing that the ballasting work must be done, I hope that the Government w ill make a sufficient sum available for the purpose. The men for whom I speak do not ask for soup kitchens or If no employment can be food; they are industrious people, and they simply want work. The present time of the year is ideal for ballasting Three hundred of the 500 men operations. It would not be necessary to The Western Australian ballast the whole of the line immediately, but if the work is put in hand for t h w it h these men w ill be placed on their feet and the fear of starvation w ill be averted. have to bring under the notice of the Kalgoorlie, Government a letter that has been received by Mr T.

The letter readsActing on I have to bring under your notice the condition of sixteen New Guinea natives at present engaged on the New Guinea Steamship Company's vessel, the Kavu. It would appear that these men do not receive proper food, housing, &c. It seems that some days they only receive two meals comprising rice (without sugar, &c.), and bread without butter. Perhaps every third day a 2-lb. tin of meat is given to be divided among the sixteen, Now and then tea is given, less milk, and with very I therefore aplittle sugar. There is no proper sleeping accommodation provided for them. Some sleep on deck beneath an iron enclosure (enclosed on three sides), others sleep in the holds. They have about three blankets each, very poor ones at that, and complain bitterly of the cold. I wish to emThcy state that the vessel "" makes plenty water,"" and appear very much afraid of her. They are emphatic on this, and say they want to go back on the Burns, Philp Mataram. As far as I am able to gather they receive about 7s. per month.
