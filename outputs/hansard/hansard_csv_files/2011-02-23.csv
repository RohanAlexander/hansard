Wednesday, 23 February 2011 ----Hasluck Electorate: Volunteers seen in the past 12 months and earlier on this year that the spirit of the volunteer is alive and well in this country. I would like to take a moment to thank some of the volunteers who have made a major difference in the lives of people not just in Hasluck but across this great nation of ours. My office received scores of calls and emails from people who wanted to know the best way they could help the flood appeal from the other side of Australia. Many donated what they could. Pensioners put their hands in their pockets to help others when they hardly had enough to help themselves and young people raised money at shopping centres. All of these efforts are worthy of praise, particularly the efforts of the Swan Districts Football Club in Bassendean, Western Australia. Instead of putting their feet up after winning the WA AFL grand final, the team and management at their own expense flew to the other side of Australia and mucked in with the clean-up efforts in Brisbane. I understand this was the single biggest effort from a sporting club in Australia, and I salute them. Western Australia has not escaped unscathed from this summer of natural disasters impacting on our coast. Literally the fringe of my electorate was hit by a major bushfire. Over 70 homes were lost but, mercifully, there was no loss of life. That was in no small part thanks to the SES and bushfire fighter volunteers who call Hasluck home. I would like to thank the 25,000 bushfire fighters in WA, who are organised into 750 brigades, but there is just not enough time. Instead, I want to thank the volunteer firefighters from across the City of Swan, the City of Gosnells, the Shire of Kalamunda and the Shire of Mundaring, who pulled together to help their colleagues fight this terrible blaze. I would also like to thank the SES organisations of Swan, Gosnells and Kalamunda for their efforts in assisting with the storms and natural disasters that impacted the region over the past 12 months. Volunteers come from all walks of life. Last year I attended a volunteer thankyou barbecue in Kalamunda. There are over 200 local volunteers who aid in a range of programs across the shire. Without these magnificent people, Hasluck citizens would not enjoy the quality of life that they do. They care for our elderly, work in our schools, help out at sporting clubs and strive to improve the lives of our disadvantaged. To you all, I say thank you. The contribution of people who put in time and effort is significant to the communities in which they live. Corporal Ben Roberts-Smith did not want to let his mates or the people around him down. Let us hold these people up as modern-day heroes from all walks of life. To all of them, I say thank you for the volunteer work that you do to make the lives of others better.

233,Mr Wyatt (Hasluck) (9.30 Am),"Volunteers are what make this country great. We havewe are having it. Australia’s oldest and greatest political party has a long tradition of being enmeshed in the local community. Sports clubs were a feature of party life in the 1930s, as were camps and excursions in the 1940s. In recent years the Labor Party has struggled to retain members. In this we are no different from hundreds of other mass membership organisations. As I documented in a book last year, Australians are less likely to join the Scouts and the RSL, to attend a religious service and to know their friends and their neighbours well. While we should always aim to improve, we should be proud of what we have achieved. TodayI want to speak about some of the community activities of the ACT branch of the ALP and how my own branch of the party is working to make itself more engaged and accessible. Local Labor members are involved in community festivals across Canberra. In my own electorate we organised a stall at the recent Canberra Multicultural Festival; at last year’s Fairday, which is an annual event of the AIDS Action Council; and at the Belconnen Community Festival, where I learned the hard way that, when the local strongman offers you a chance for an arm wrestle, discretion is the better part of valour. This coming weekend ACT Labor members will be at the Canberra Show. We will be there to share the community spirit, offering face painting and balloons, and speaking with ACT residents about how we can work together to build a better city and nation. In the neighbouring electorate of Canberra, I have it on good authority that Labor is an active presence at the Woden and Tuggeranong community festivals. In our local sub-branches and policy committees, people have worked hard to build an environment that encourages new members to actively participate in the discussions. Recognising that moving motions is not always the best way to canvass a complex issue, some have built a ‘general discussion’ component into their meetings. Others have made a habit of holding occasional meetings as a barbecue in a local park and encouraging members to bring along their friends and families. Another successful strategy is to invite regular guest speakers, including community leaders, businesspeople, union leaders and academics. ACT Labor also holds regular social events in Parliament House, including budget night drinks and policy forums. From its origins, Labor has been a regular presence in the community. I pay tribute to the many Labor Party members who continue that tradition in Canberra today. Herbert Electorate the cyclone and our readiness to receive visitors and tourists. My city of Townsville is still open for business. In fact, we never closed. I want to tell you that the days currently are hot and the nights are balmy, which is code for hot. But the barra are biting and the mud crabs are just about jumping into your tinnie. My city extends an invitation to any and all Australians to visit us for a short while and sample one of the truly great regional centres of Australia. Hop on a Kookaburra Tours bus with Tony O’Connor and have a really great bloke show you around the region. You can ask him anything and he will answer. It may not always be the truth, but he will answer with a smile on his face and a wink of his eye. Come and stay at any of our fine hotels and motels. If you want something a little more intimate, get a room at Classique Bed and Breakfast on the city fringe. The food there is to die for and the hosts are so friendly you will want them to adopt you.

234,Mr Ewen Jones (Herbert) (9.35 Am),"I rise to speak on Townsville’s recovery fromGo to Reef HQ and see the work being done with our Turtle Hospital, where research meets entertainment. The Museum of Tropical Queensland is a must if you have children. Go and dive at the Yongala wreck, one of the truly great dives in the world. It is coming up to 100 years since the ship sank and they are planning a series of events to mark that occasion. Go out to Mungalla Aboriginal Tours just outside Ingham for a wonderful walk through the Dreamtime, and mix with people who not only own the property but are part of the land. Come for a weekend and watch the Cowboys as we light up the NRL this year. Yes, it will be our year this year! Come by plane or car or motorhome-you will have a great time. Go out to the reef on a Sunferry, or catch the Sunferry across to Magnetic Island. It is truly a beautiful place. With its beaches and bays and restaurants and bars, you are guaranteed to have a great time. One thing, though, when you are on Maggie and you hop off the ferry and cross the hill towards Geoffrey Bay, be careful as you walk over the hill because it is exceedingly dangerous. The verges and shoulders are narrow and blind for the drivers. You see, there was supposed to be a beautiful walk around the front of these hills to link the bays and the beaches. It was going to cost only $4.5 million and both major parties made that promise. It would be one of the great walks in Australia as it would link not only the bays and beaches but also the walks through the world natural heritage parks. Unfortunately, our government has seen fit not to stick with that promise. But do not let this government’s callous disregard for election promises put you off. Get out to the island and have a great unwind. It is a great place and we will welcome you there with open arms. Townsville is open for business. Parramatta Electorate: Islamic Community Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (9.38 am)-Last week and this week there have been a number of birthdays celebrated in my electorate of Parramatta and, because of those birthdays, I find that I have been spending quite an amount of my time with my Islamic community. Last weekend they celebrated the birthday of the Prophet Mohammed. On SundayI attended my local Shia mosque down in Granville, Nabi Akram, a place that I know quite well, where some of the nicest people I have met were quietly celebrating, as is their way, the birth of Mohammed. I should also say that I am often invited at Christmas time to that mosque to celebrate the birth of Christ. It is usually on Christmas Eve, so I have managed to get there twice, I think, in the last six years. The rest of the time. I was off with my own family. They are a charming group of people at the mosque. They had made a very large cake shaped like a mosque. It was bright green and I had to eat at least half the dome on my own. It is worth pointing out, though, that in many places of the world it is not safe for the Islamic community to celebrate the birth of Mohammed. It is not celebrated by the fundamentalists and we have seen in recent weeks a number of bombings of mosques and events around the world where people celebrating the birth of Mohammed were targeted by extremists. It is really clear in my community that Australian muslims are grateful to be able to live in a country where they can live in peace, build good lives and celebrate their faith without fear. I also attended a concert by Darulfatwa Islamic High Council, largely of chanting of the Koran, something which I quite enjoy. This time. I got to hear it from the African community MAIN COMMITTEE and the Polynesian community and the Bosnians as well. I have to say when you hear the Arabic chanting style performed by Africans it is amazing how it takes on quite a different colour. It was an extraordinary event and again a fabulous celebration of the birth of a person that is incredibly important to many people in my community. This Sunday is a birthday of a different kind. I am off to my Ismaili Shiah mosque in Auburn. Just as there are a great range of versions of the Christian faith, there are a great range, even in my community, of versions of Islamic faith. The Ismailis are a particularly interesting group who believe that if you can only educate one child you should educate the girl. They come from all over the world and virtually every woman you meet has a university education and the men are all in small business. It is very interesting way to manage their economy. This Sunday they are celebrating the 100th birthday of his Holiness Dr Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin, their leader, a person who they hold in great esteem. It is a very important celebration for them and I will be pleased to be there. Casey Electorate: Healesville Community Bank share with members the wonderful community spirit of the Healesville community. Last FridayI had the honour and pleasure of attending the opening of the Healesville Community Bank branch of the Bendigo Bank. This was the culmination of around two years of community work. The Healesville community wanted a Bendigo Bank branch and it was in the wake of the tragic bushfires in Victoria that they decided to put together the community bank and work together to achieve this end. It was, as you would expect, a wonderful day of celebration and a real tribute to the community effort, determination and spirit which saw them succeed in opening their very own branch in Healesville. I want to take the time this morning to pay tribute to the board of directors. I would like to mention Gary Slater, the chair; Neil Skinner, the secretary; Fred Ward, the treasurer; Kerri Goding; Kath Gannaway; Bob Gannaway; Kath Holton; Barb Honan; Jeanette McRae, who is also a local councillor with the Shire of Yarra Ranges; Andrew Ricketson; and Sandra Schoffer. I also wish well all the staff of the new bank branch, led by Suzanne Dixon. The opening of branches like this cannot happen without the combined efforts of so many people. There are so many community groups in Healesville who pledge support and will support this new bank. They made it possible. There was the mentoring from other community members who have opened bank branches within the Yarra Valley. I would particularly like to mention Jacqui Hall, who acted as a mentor. Jacqui is on the board of the Warburton and Yarra Junction and District Community Bank. Adam Rimington, a Bendigo Bank employee, also provided a great deal of support. It was a wonderful day and a wonderful opening. The Healesville community were ecstatic, as you can imagine. They were treated to a number of songs from the Healesville Rocky Road Choir and also the Healesville Primary School choir. I would like to congratulate all of the kids at Healesville Primary who made the celebration just that little bit extra special last Friday. Congratulations again to all of those involved and to the Healesville community, who have such a strong community spirit. MAIN COMMITTEE",182,Constituency Statements
235,Mr Anthony Smith (Casey) (9.41 Am),"It is a pleasure to rise in this House andDairy Industry concerns expressed by many in dairy communities about the current price war going on amongst major retailers, in particular driven by the actions of Coles, who have put in place a $2 home brand price campaign. That has been matched by other retailers, such as Woolies, and I understand Aldi and others are now coming on board. In rural dairy communities there is incredible nervousness. They have lived through a decade of deregulation. The rights and wrongs of that have been played out by many. That 10-year period saw the number of dairy farmers in my community drop from 150 down to about 35 or 40. If we now have a price war that is unsustainable-and I use the word ‘unsustainable’ because Woolworths have said it is a price that is unsustainable-it will have flow-on impacts on regional and rural communities. Government must act. The ACCC must do its job and look at the long-term implications of short-term loss leaders and price wars such as what is going on now. I have asked the Prime Minister to consider the issues around this price war. I have asked the ACCC and Graeme Samuel to respond to the issues around this price war. I have also asked government to get its skates on with regard to food policy generally. I think this is an opportunity to really deliver on the question that is facing many communities to do with staple products: just what is the place in public policy of fresh and local nutritional products in Australia today? We have an obesity crisis. It is well identified, yet we seem to be accepting the increasing loss of key products that are being priced out of the market. That is a loss to regional communities but it has broader implications for food security in Australia. I hope that on those two fronts-the ACCC and the start of some public discussion around food policy generally-we see some action from government and government agencies. I hope we do not have to go through the public rallies, town rallies and jersey cows out the front of Parliament House to recognise the place that dairy farmers have in this country. (Time expired) Ryan Electorate: Community Service Awards Ryan Community Service Awards. Volunteer organisations and those who work within them are the backbone of the Ryan community. I have been privileged to travel around the electorate and present awards to the outstanding residents who have been nominated by local organisations for their contributions to our community. I sincerely thank these volunteers for their tireless work to make Ryan a better place to live, work and raise a family. I start by acknowledging Mr Andrew Bolton. Andrew has been the main driver behind remodelling the top sports field of St Ignatius School in Toowong, a process to which he dedicated over four years. He has been heavily involved in designing the field, based on the specific needs of the children, and has overseen its construction daily. Andrew is a deserving recipient of a Ryan community award. Just down the road from St Ignatius School, Mr Ron Archer has long been involved in the West Toowong Progress Association, helping to establish the West Toowong Bowls Club, a project that he has been leading since the 1950s. Over these decades, Ron has been a driving force in building an outdoor bowling green for the club and overseeing the move from a solely indoor venue to an official competition location for the Royal Queensland Bowls AssoMAIN COMMITTEE",184,Constituency Statements

237,Mrs Prentice (Ryan) (9.47 Am),"I recently had the pleasure of launching the inauguralciation. Ron has continually strived to take initiatives to improve the club, whilst maintaining its heritage and uniqueness, a trait which attracts members not only from the local area but from all over Brisbane. The West Toowong Bowls Club would not be the success it is today without Ron’s tireless dedication to the progress association. Another deserving recipient is Mr Dennis McKee. Joining the Greenslopes Private Hospital team as the volunteer welfare officer in 2008, Dennis has always shown compassion and integrity, continually putting others’ needs above his own. Dennis has never sought recognition for his efforts, and his unassuming and humble nature has endeared him to his peers and veterans, earning him the utmost respect of the local community. Mr Bill Beeson also falls within this category. For the past three years Bill has voluntarily taught seniors in north-west Brisbane basic computer and internet skills. He teaches eight classes over two days, 48 weeks per year. Bill’s commitment to our seniors is highly respected and appreciated, and I am proud to recognise his dedication and initiative. Mrs Marion Thomas is another example of a selfless individual using her skills to serve the community. Mrs Thomas uses her talent for music to play piano for residents at various agedcare facilities around The Gap, on top of her commitments as an organist for The Gap Uniting Church. Mrs Thomas is an active member of The Gap Amnesty International Group, and helps raise funds and awareness for international care agencies. In the past, she taught literacy programs in the prison system, and she continues this support through her membership of The Gap Uniting Church Mission, Outreach and Community Services leadership team. Mrs Thomas’s unwavering compassion, care and support for those in need is a trait that I truly admire, and I take great pleasure in recognising her efforts. I would like to collectively recognise the volunteers of the Wesley Breast Clinic. For many years, these volunteers have acted as conduits of communication between the patients and clinical staff. They perform various duties as part of their voluntary work, from the simple comfort of providing tea and coffee to patients to being a supportive ear to any patient or family member in need. In so doing, they create a welcoming and less stressful environment during a difficult time. The calibre of the recipients of this year’s awards was truly outstanding. The nature and skills of volunteers around Ryan are as diverse as the individuals are dedicated, and I offer my continued encouragement and support to community organisations throughout Ryan. Mr Ewen Jones-Hey! pired and I am sure that she would thank the member for Herbert for his enthusiastic support. Glebe Post Office Ms PLIBERSEK (Sydney-Minister for Human Services and Minister for Social Inclusion) (9.51 am)-I want to congratulate the member for Ryan for getting all of that in. I want today to talk about Glebe Post Office: a social and commercial hub in my electorate which offered essential services to the Glebe community for over 120 years until its abrupt closure earlier this month. Senator Faulkner has spoken twice in the adjournment debate in the Senate about the history of Glebe Post Office. It has been in its current site from 1886 when it opened on 5 January with a postmistress, Miss Minnie Knott. Miss Minnie Knott’s story is a very interesting one.

I would like to take this opportunity of tabling a non-conforming petition which carries the names of around 4,000 local residents, who have been thoroughly opposed to the closure of Glebe Post Office. I share residents’ anger at the lack of meaningful consultation from Australia Post about this decision. Australia Post could have harnessed the genuine groundswell of support for this historical service and worked with the local community to keep Glebe Post Office open. ble a document but because it is a non-conforming petition it cannot be received as a petition. Australia Post decided that the community’s energy and passion for this service was a storm to be weathered rather than a force to be harnessed. I also share residents’ anger at the model of corporate governance bound by the letter of legislated community service obligations but blind to the spirit of community service itself. This post office serves a poor and disadvantaged community. Most of the work done at this post office is to do with people paying bills with cash because a lot of residents do not have the money to have cheque accounts. That is not of high value to Australia Post, so they took this opportunity of closing this post office instead of keeping it open and meeting the spirit of their community service obligation not just the bland letter of it. This is a genuine example of community service and a lifeline to local residents the loss of which will be deeply felt in coming years. I finally want to acknowledge the enormous work of the residents of Glebe. They fought hard to keep this post office open. They are used to fighting. They fought to keep the Glebe as it is, protecting it from developers. Unfortunately, this recent fight was lost. Gippsland Electorate: Alpine National Park lition government’s decision to allow a trial of cattle grazing in the high country to help reduce the severity of bushfires. In expressing my support for the current trial, I condemn the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities for his theatrical display in support of the Greens during question time yesterday. If ever we needed any further proof that Labor is in government but the Greens are in charge, we had it yesterday. In response to a question from the member for Melbourne, the environment minister could not wait to fall in behind his Green masters. It was like whistling to a kelpie in the high country: Bandt whistled and Burke came bounding across the chamber, wagging his tail! I was worried he was going to lick the face of the member for Melbourne, such was his enthusiasm to please his master! MAIN COMMITTEE",186,Constituency Statements

241,Mr Chester (Gippsland) (9.54 Am),"I rise to express my support for the Victorian coaLabor may be in government but there is no doubt the Greens are in charge-and, come 1 July, it is going to get worse for regional Australians. When the Greens secure the balance of power in the Senate, regional Australians have a lot to be worried about. The Greens want to ban live exports, they want to ban rodeos, they want to shut down commercial fishing and the timber industry, they hate recreational anglers and they are already talking about a private member’s bill to kick the cattlemen out of the high country. Let me tell the House about the boiling resentment in my community. People have had an absolute gutful of city based Greens and Labor MPs telling them how to live their lives. The Greens have never created a job in regional Australia and they are a direct threat to jobs in our traditional industries. The minister for the environment needs to think twice before he becomes the wagging tail for every dog of a policy that the Greens put forward. The issue of cattle grazing in the Alpine National Park is a contentious one; I acknowledge that. There are strong views on both sides of the debate. But the Victorian government took a clear policy to the state election in November last year that it would take action to return cattle if it was elected. It won a clear mandate for that policy, particularly in the seat of Gippsland East, where Tim Bull removed the last remaining Independent from office. The Labor Party has been wiped out in eastern Victoria because it would not listen to locals. The Victorian government wants to take direct action to help reduce the severity of further bushfires. We need to reduce the fuel load in the high country. We know that hot fires destroy the environment. But in the past the more extreme elements of the Greens have even opposed fuel reduction burns. Returning the cattle for a trial has been conducted in a responsible manner; for example, there are no cattle in the areas regarded as environmentally sensitive such as the Bogong High Plains. I can tell you what is up there: noxious weeds, about 8,000 wild brumbies and thousands of deer. We got rid of one ‘Brumby’ in Victoria last year, but there are a lot more to go. If the minister and the member for Melbourne were serious about caring for the environment, they would support practical action. The trial to assess the impact of cattle grazing on reducing fire intensity deserves our support, particularly in the aftermath of the devastating Black Saturday bushfires. The Greens and Labor have a ‘lock it up and leave it’ mentality when it comes to managing parks and the environment. If the environment minister wants to be taken seriously, why doesn’t he reinstate the $11 million he ripped out of Landcare in his previous job. If the member for Melbourne wants to take on a real environmental issue, support the coalition’s efforts to control wild dogs, foxes and weeds, which are destroying the natural environment. (Time expired) Richmond Electorate: Tweed Shire Council Citizen of the Year speak about a really outstanding individual in my electorate. This wonderful woman is Lorraine Grennan. I would like to congratulate Lorraine. She was recently awarded the Tweed Shire Council Citizen of the Year. She is a truly remarkable woman. Lorraine was recognised as the Tweed Shire Council Citizen of the Year at the Australia Day ceremony held at Bogangar. She and other recipients were acknowledged for the great work and achievements that they do within the Tweed Shire. MAIN COMMITTEE",187,Constituency Statements
242,Mrs Elliot (Richmond,"Parliamentary Secretary for Trade) (9.57 am)-I rise today toI was very pleased to be able to attend these Australia Day celebrations, which also incorporated the citizenship ceremony. But it really was a day that highlighted Lorraine’s remarkable work. She was recognised for her ongoing work with a group called Compassionate Friends. This is a group that provides ongoing support for bereaved family members. Lorraine has been doing this work for a long period of time and is such a committed, dedicated and inspirational woman. Lorraine was born in 1940 and has lived her whole life in the Tweed, where she met and married Barry Grennan and where they raised five children. On 23 March 1983 Lorraine experienced her own family tragedy with the heart breaking death of her son Michael at the age of 20 from leukaemia. As Lorraine has said: The grief process is extremely complex. It is very different from one person to another and these feelings never go away entirely. She was very eager to fight this disease and assist where she could. She did lots of voluntary work with St Vincent de Paul and assisted many groups in raising money for cancer research. In August 1992 she started having meetings in her home for bereaved parents to provide support. The local chapter of Compassionate Friends was started to provide much-needed support right across the North Coast. Nearly 18 years later she is still having meetings in her home, with many people coming from South-East Queensland as well as from around the Northern Rivers. Compassionate Friends is an international organisation of bereaved parents offering friendship and support. It is non-denominational and non-profit and was founded in England in 1969. For the past two decades Lorraine has staged many meetings in her home. She makes many phone calls to grieving families. She organises special Christmas lunches. In 1993 she completed a book about her son Mick as part of dealing with her grief, and the book was titled Mick, Send Me a Butterfly. She receives overwhelming support from our community and she is a very highly regarded and very caring woman who continually reaches out to those in need of compassion and sympathy. I think the fact that she has been committed to Compassionate Friends for over two decades shows her level of absolute dedication. She really is one of the most truly caring and sympathetic people I have ever met. I congratulate Lorraine Grennan on this outstanding effort. She is an incredibly worthy recipient of the Tweed Shire Council Citizen of the Year. der 193 the time for constituency statements has concluded.

The main purpose of these bills, of course, is to propose appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the ordinary annual services of the government in addition to MAIN COMMITTEE",188,Constituency Statements
243,The Deputy Speaker (Hon. Peter Slipper),Order! In accordance with standing or,189,Appropriation Bill No 4 2010 2011
244,Mr Robb (Goldstein) (10.00 Am),"I rise to consider the appropriation bills that are beforethose provided in the 2010-11 budget. The appropriation being sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011 is around $1.4 billion and the total appropriation in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011 is just over $1 billion. These are appropriations required for moneys that were not anticipated at the time of the framing of the budget, so they are overruns or expenses adding up to close to $2½ billion that were not anticipated some eight months ago. In the context of these bills, there are funds being appropriated to support what would appear to be bad management and poor process. In other words, these appropriation bills will become a symbol of the incompetence, the waste and the failure of due process that have come to characterise this administration. For example, for the Department of Climate Change and Energy, there is an appropriation of $15 million to support functions that were simply transferred from the former Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts. Why do you need an extra $15 million for a new bunch of public servants to do exactly what a previous bunch of public servants had to do? Fifteen million dollars rolls easily off the tongue. It is not considered by those on the other side to be of any consequence. But it is a lot of money-a lot of money-and, at a time when households are pulling in their heads to try and make ends meet, to live within their means, we have a government that continues with this approach to public funding and the management of taxpayers’ funds which is unacceptable. There is $45.6 million for the closure of the Home Insulation Program. Now, the government made provision for this in the last budget. They spent all last year and part of the year before with red faces, apologising, as community resentment built by the day over the total incompetence of the Home Insulation Program. Given the public outcry that occurred with this program, you would have thought that the government would have at least given every consideration to what it was going to cost to mop up the mess-how much it would take to close the damn thing down and how much it was going to cost for public servants and others to do their best to fix the situation and satisfy the literally hundreds of thousands of householders who were dudded under this pathetic and mismanaged program. Six months later we find another $46 million, more or less, is required for the closure of this program. They still got that wrong. What can they get right in managing taxpayers’ money? This is another example of waste that just keeps on giving. The government seem incapable of taking full responsibility for this program: for the waste, the hurt and the deaths that have occurred. This program has so much against it, yet they are not capable of properly costing even the closure of the program. In relation to Immigration and Citizenship, of the $2.5 billion nearly $300 million is supplementary funding for operational costs associated with the management of offshore asylum seekers. In the space of six months the government has underestimated the cost of border protection to the tune of $300 million. It shows how out of control this government is when it comes to managing our borders. We now have about 6,000 people on the mainland due to be processed. We have boats arriving almost weekly, even though it is the wrong season. Individuals are putting their lives at great risk, as we saw tragically a few weeks ago. This government provides absolutely no deterrent for people who risk breaking through our borders. It has no control over the borders, which means people have no confidence in the whole immigration program. Is it any wonder that people are concerned more generally about the way this country is being managed and its borders are being protected? MAIN COMMITTEE No country has even signed up to the East Timor proposition. The Prime Minister had a thought bubble before the election and put out there as the ultimate solution that there would be a processing centre set up in East Timor. After six months of the most assiduous representations by our departmental officials all over the region, not one country has shown a scintilla of interest in signing up for that program. Yet Nauru is still willing to sign the UN agreements. It is just pure politics that is stopping this government from doing what it has to do. It is letting politics interfere with the cost of running these programs and it is threatening human life because of this lack of deterrent for people who seek to break through our borders. In the space of six months the government have underestimated the cost of spending on the border protection program to the tune of $300 million. We are now billions of dollars behind what was anticipated in the forward estimates some two or three years ago. This is a symbol of great waste and incompetence. The measures in these appropriation bills are endless symbols of the waste and incompetence by this government. This is a snapshot of some of the activities to be funded through these appropriations. These modest amounts add up to significant sums-in this case, $2.3 billion. The government would say these modest amounts are neither here nor there: ‘What is $15 million here or $300 million there?’ This is why we have a debt heading towards $90 billion. This is why we are aiming at a deficit this year of $40 billion and had one of $57 billion last year-the two worse deficit situations in our history. It has occurred because if you do not look after the pennies you do not look after the pounds. How can you justify a $40 billion deficit? How can you justify a $57 billion deficit and then stand there and say that you are managing this economy? How can you put up appropriations like this that demonstrate enormous incompetence? Overruns on so many programs should have been anticipated but have not been anticipated. Last night I stood in the main chamber and debated the levy for flood reconstruction. This levy will raise nearly $2 billion. If the government had stuck with its budget of six months ago it would have paid for that levy and more. If the government had shown that it was able to manage this place without further waste, without further overspending-if it could live within its means like every Australian family is being required to do at this point in time, despite massive increases in prices-we would not have to have the levy. It is quite ironic. We have two debates going on almost in tandem that demonstrate that the money was there, is there, to pay for that levy. There was no need for the levy, but of course this is a government whose instinct is to tax, to spend and to borrow. All the government have done since they arrived is to borrow, tax and spend. Where has there been one hard decision on the fiscal front? Even the measures towards flood reconstruction that they are paying for out of savings were basically all measures that we had identified at the time of the election. This government pilloried us in a political sense for putting up those savings. Now, after we went out and took the heat for those political decisions some months ago, they have taken those savings. Who has bleated about any of those savings? More or less one or two interest groups have, and they have caved in on those. They caved into the Greens. They bought off the Greens and Independents with hundreds of millions of dollars in order to enable their program to go forward. They cannot even make a tough decision and make it stick. They cave in to the political demands of the crossbenchers. It must be remembered that this government, in the middle of all this, is borrowing $100 million a day. A lot of the interest rate increases are because this government is still borrowing MAIN COMMITTEE $100 million a day. In other words, every 17 days this government borrows what it is going to collect on the levy. Every 17 days it has borrowed an amount equivalent to the levy. This government is being exposed almost daily for its incompetence and its lack of fiscal rectitude. There is a $45 billion interest bill to be paid over the next four years. This is incompetence in the extreme. There is no plan to address this funding and fiscal situation. The government claims that a surplus will be achieved in 2012-13. It may be manufactured, but what it is not telling you-the dead cat on the table-is the situation with the structural deficit. It is the issue that needs to be explained and it is the issue that the Treasurer has studiously avoided. The blow-out of the underlying structural deficit puts a lie to all the rhetoric we hear about the government having some plan to address our debt and deficit situation. So what is a structural deficit? A structural deficit represents ongoing spending commitments that are relied on from revenue that will not persist-in this case, the mining boom. It is a bit like a situation where someone who has been achieving, say, $20,000 a year in overtime for the last couple of years then thinks: ‘I’ll take out a mortgage. I can now afford a $500,000 mortgage with my regular pay and overtime.’ The expectation is that the overtime will continue into the future. So the worker takes out a $500,000, 25-year mortgage and then finds out two years later that the overtime has stopped. The excess demand for the products that the company was producing has dried up. He is back on his normal pay. All of a sudden he realisessituation where this person finds that he now can only afford a mortgage of $300,000 to $350,000 and not $500,000. But he has got a 25-year commitment. He has got a problem. He has to sell the house and get a smaller mortgage. He has to take tough decisions to live within his means. He has a structural deficit. He has long-term commitments, but the income to pay for those long-term commitments has not persisted. It is the same thing with this country. We have long-term commitments, nearly $100 billion of debt that this government is building up, and we have spending programs that will continue. They are recurrent expenditure. They will come year in, year out as annual commitments that this government is making that have no end, yet they are funding those commitments out of the proceeds of the mining boom. They are wasting the mining boom. There is an illusion about the state of the books of this country. They are going to use the mining boom money to meet current commitments, maybe in 2012-13. But what you find is that, when you allow for the mining boom and commodity prices going back to normal-and they willthere will be a supply response, and the demand will come off at some stage. There are 1,000 mines around the world that are now being put into production. There is infrastructure being built in Mongolia, in South America, in Africa, in Eastern Europe and in North America. There is port infrastructure to take the resources from thousands of mines to meet demand. So the supply response will increase. We think we are awash with gas, and we are, but we have still only got two per cent of the world’s gas reserves. So we will face competition. We will still do well, but the mining boom will come off, and it may come off sooner than we anticipate. It is all right to predict 10 years. I was in agriculture for 18 years and there were always booms and busts. Every time there was a boom in grain, people would move out of sheep into grain and everyone would always MAIN COMMITTEE",189,Appropriation Bill No 4 2010 2011
245,Mr Champion,You’d fix up the penalty rates.,192,Appropriation Bill No 4 2010 2011
246,Mr Robb,"Here we are-the incompetence pouring out of those opposite. So you have apredict a longer boom that what really occurred. Invariably, it was because no-one anticipated the supply response, not only the extra grain production within the country but the extra grain production around the world. Invariably, the price came back. It did not necessarily collapse; it came back to more normal levels because of the supply response. It invariably came back sooner than everyone predicted. There is a sort of boom mentality where people want to make assumptions about how long these things are going to last. We have those on the other side feeding in 10and 15-year assumptions about the mining boom. It is unrealistic. It demonstrates their lack of contact with the real world-with the commercial world. We now have a situation where, in the 2009-10 budget papers, the government featured this structural deficit. There had been a small structural deficit beginning at the end of our previous term in office, but it was about $2.5 billion. You know what it is today? It is $50 billion. There is an underlying structural budget deficit that has been identified by Treasury. It was first put in the budget papers of 2009-10. In 2010-11 there is no reference to it; it has disappeared. Six months after last year’s budget, Treasury quietly put out a paper that updated the structural deficit. It showed the structural deficit was growing astronomically-that, instead of coming out of it in 2015-16, we would come out of it in 2020. So we have a structural deficit of a large order. The reality of the budget as identified by the Treasury, as agreed by the government but never talked about by the government, is that the government have an underlying budget deficit which is going to go through at least to 2020. This means we will not have paid off one cent of debt-you do not pay off debt until you are into a real surplus-until 2020. We will not have paid this debt off until 2030. We are talking 20 years until the debt is paid off. What an absolute disgrace that this government would put us in such a vulnerable position. We are a small, open economy. If there is a double-dip recession or if there is a serious downturn in any way-instability coming from the Middle East with oil prices going up-then we are vulnerable. This government needs to restore the economic resilience that they inherited and subsequently trashed-that economic resilience that we need as a small country to work our way through things that are outside of our control, and the rest of the world’s control. But no, we go on blindly as though everything is fine. Spending, spending, spending; more commitments, bigger structural deficit, off into the future using all of the mining industry money. What a disgrace. What an absolutely irresponsible, inconsiderate, highly politicised approach to government. They are just looking to save their own jobs every three years. That is the total preoccupation of this government. That motivates all of their major decisions and it is has driven the spending, spending, spending approach of this government. They need to be held to account. These appropriations are a huge symbol of the waste and incompetence and politicisation of this whole budget process. This is a government which needs to take stock. It needs to do what every family in Australia is doing-that is, seeking to live within its means. For at least 12 months now every family in Australia has delayed incurring expenses they were going to incur and delayed things they were going to purchase because they can no longer afford them; the electricity bills have gone up 35 per cent in three years and interest rates have gone up $6,000 on the average mortgage in the past 12 months. This government’s $100 million a day in the finance market is putting pressure on interest rates. At least half of the interest rate rise is due to the excessive spending of this government. So $3,000 a year is due to the incompeMAIN COMMITTEE tence and politicisation of this government and its spending programs. That is the contribution they have made to average families in Australia, and it is putting enormous pressure on them. If this government exercised the same fiscal rectitude, if it exercised the same restraint that families who need to live within their means are exercising, then we would find that the economy would start to take some shape. But all we hear is spin and all we see is illusion. They have created the illusion of progress, and it is not there. Look at the structural deficit. Explain the structural deficit. Explain the worsening of the structural deficit. The government tried to say in 2009 it was due to the stimulus spending. What do they say now as it grows and grows and grows in the face of a mining boom of unprecedented proportions? It beggars belief that we are seeing this unfold. An opportunity to set Australia up for the future, to set Australia up to be resilient against any major events outside of our control has been squandered by this government. We need some checks and balances here. We need a situation where these sorts of things can be exposed. At the present time the government hides behind the so-called independence of the Treasury. Of course it is not independent; it is there to work for the government of the day. Most of the material in the red books and the blue books that came out after the election is blacked out. You could not see what any of the figures were; you could not see the really tough advice that was given to this government. All we ever see from the public service is what the government wants us to see. We have not got any group that is capable of providing some independent assessment. This is why we put up a proposal for a Parliamentary Budget Office at the last election. We were looking to have an independent and well-resourced statutory authority located in Parliament House, an authority tasked with providing objective and impartial advice and analysis on the Commonwealth budget and the budget cycle, on the mediumand long-term budget projections and on the cost of policy proposals. Look how politicised that was last time. We put up $50 billion of savings and the whole process was politicised by this government. I met with Ken Henry for 3½ hours and, on nearly all of the proposals for which the government subsequently pilloried us, the only difference was assumptions. Even when we put up a case, in most cases the head of the Treasury said, ‘We’ve made our decision.’ Sometimes it was a case of just two per cent-82 per cent versus 84 per cent-in terms of a take-up factor, but when you put that over four years, in a big program, it looks like a $900 million hole. They were simply assumptions and they were very close together. But Ken Henry said: ‘We’ve made our decision. That’s what we’ve put into our model. You can like it or lump it.’ That was the politicisation of this process. We need to take the politics out of the budget and the campaign process. We need a Parliamentary Budget Office. The government fought this proposal all the way through and denigrated it when we put it forward during the last term, but they accepted it when the Greens and the crossbenchers insisted upon it. But what are we seeing? Nothing as yet. It is our expectation that this office will be three desks in the corner of the library; that is what we will get. It will be another political response to a very legitimate concern. If we were in government we would have to face this scrutiny and objective assessment as well. This is not something put up to advantage us on one side of politics. This is a genuine, legitimate and sensible proposal. We should have an independent body, stationed within Parliament House, that can respond to any member or senator in terms of individual issues, deal with the policy costings MAIN COMMITTEE of both sides of politics well in advance of an election and find numbers that everyone accepts are the right numbers. We can then have a debate about policy in the election and not some orchestrated political process in a campaign which seeks to denigrate the opposition because the government has numbers and assumptions which may differ from other authorities. This is a really important proposal and it needs to be adequately financed so that we get the politics taken out of this process. I have another example of the great hypocrisy associated with this government on many issues. If you look at the forward estimates you will find that, in the latter years, the appropriation for natural disasters is the lowest in 10 years. I talked about it being an illusion if we get to a surplus. The government is seeking to manufacture a surplus. The appropriation is $80 million. We have just had to agree to $5.6 billion of expenditure for natural disasters. The government has a provision of $80 million, which is the smallest amount in 10 years. When the Minister for Finance, Senator Wong, was the climate change minister, she warned that: Climate change is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including cyclones, storms, droughts, heatwaves bushfires and floods. The finance minister is on record saying we are going to experience far more natural disasters in the years ahead, because of this government’s belief in the consequences of climate change, yet she has reduced the appropriation for natural disasters to its lowest level in 10 years. What hypocrisy! It just shows that there is an attempt across this government to manufacture a surplus in 2012-13 and ignore the structural deficit. This is politics. This is another example of the hypocrisy of this government in the way in which it is constructing and running the finances of this country. This government needs to tackle the cost of living. This was its big election pitch in 2007 but it has failed on all counts. There are families around this country who are facing deep financial pressures but living within their means. This government needs to take a leaf out of the book of Australian families and live within its means. (Time expired) 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011. I have listened very carefully to the member for Goldstein’s appropriation speech and his reference to meeting for three hours with the Treasury secretary. AllI can say is that I feel sorry for the Treasury secretary. He had to endure what we have had to endure, which is just a tepid audition by the member for Goldstein to take the member for North Sydney’s job. It is a shockingly transparent attempt to audition for another position within the shadow cabinet. The member for Goldstein talked a bit about the cuts that the opposition are going to make, and I would like to talk about the cuts to foreign aid in particular. There is in these appropriation bills an appropriation relating to foreign aid, which is a very important part of Australia’s international commitment. Australia has reached arrangements with other countries to provide resources to combat poverty, malaria and other blights on this world. Of course, the coalition parties are proposing to defer, as I understand it, $448 million of foreign aid to Indonesian schools. That might sound good in a One Nation email or when you are shouting it out in a shopping centre or in the front bar of a hotel. No doubt you would get a lot of heads nodding, because it is understandable that people would want to look after their own first. But if you make the counter-argument and say to people, ‘Would you support Australia welshing on its deals, welshing on its words, welshing on its commitment?’ they MAIN COMMITTEE",192,Appropriation Bill No 4 2010 2011
247,Mr Champion (Wakefield) (10.31 Am),"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3)would probably say no. What if you said to people, ‘Should we invite the Taliban to our doorstep?’ We have to remember that ‘talib’ means student. The Taliban drew their ranks from the schools and from young men who were made refugees by the Russian invasion of Afghanistan. We know that schools can produce educated, moderate people who are committed to economic growth and peace and justice in this world, but we know also from the Afghanistan experience that they can produce soldiers and movements and colour a nation’s politics and put the gun into a nation’s politics. It was John Howard who put the education aid scheme in place. It was not the Labor government; it was John Howard and Alexander Downer. And we know that Alexander Downer does not think much of the coalition’s referrals and does not think much of them walking away from this very important Howard government program. According to one source in the Sydney Morning Herald on 11 February this year, Alexander Downer said it was ‘a filthy proposal’ to defer the assistance that we might provide to Indonesian schools. We know that his successor in the seat of Mayo, Jamie Briggs-a very able coalition member-called on the party to retain the funding. He broke ranks on ABC radio the day before the funding cut was announced. He said the programs were designed to prevent terrorism and the rise of extremism in Islamic schools in our nearest neighbour. He said that the axing of that program, the cuts that were proposed by Tony Abbott and his shadow cabinet, were a bad idea. They are a terrible idea. The foreign minister has said that the only winner is Abu Bakar Bashir, but I fear that that would be the least of our problems if we allowed schools in our region to be radicalised by extremists, by people who seek to promote extremism. So we know that this was a terrible decision by the coalition. We really cannot believe they would propose it, that they would propose welshing on a deal, that they would take something out of a One Nation email and propose it in the parliament of this country, in the politics of this country. We now know it is all part of a broader strategy to appeal to the darker angels in our nature, to run not so much a dog whistle but a megaphone in the shopping centres and pubs of this country, to say that it is all right to be bigoted, all right to take a short-term view and all right to be reactionary. It is not all right. It is actually against our national interest. It is a terrible blight on our national interest. The coalition should think very carefully about the cuts they proposed and the impact they would have on our national circumstances. I think it is just terrible. They should rethink what they are doing. Also in this appropriations bill is $10.1 million for the Fair Entitlements Guarantee, which is part of delivering on Labor’s commitment to improving GEERS, increasing redundancy protection to up to four weeks pay per year of service rather than the previous cap of 16 weeks, removing access to financial assistance for company directors or excluded employees and making sure that this scheme is preserved in legislation, as opposed to just being set up under regulations or by government fiat. It is a very important thing. There have been a lot of contests in the community about unpaid entitlements, and I know this from my own experience of meeting with the lead union in this area, the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union. I have met with John Camillo many times about unpaid entitlements, and I have also met many times with Jon Gee, the secretary of the vehicle division. Jon is a very passionate advocate of making sure that people’s entitlements are secured, a passionate advocate of the car industry in my state and a passionate advocate of the Holden GMH plant at Elizabeth, which of course lies in the heart of my electorate. He came to see me only the other day with Paul MAIN COMMITTEE Brown, Heinz Joham and other delegates at the plant. They came to meet me, obviously about the future of the car industry. We know that we have the new Holden Cruze coming online, a new car rolling off the line. It is a symbol, I think, just as when Ben Chifley waved the first Holden off the line. It is a symbol of progress, a symbol of our nation’s ability to make things. It is a symbol in these troubled times, when the country is buffeted by the global financial crisis and by the troubles in the international car industry. It is a sign that this plant can prosper and survive in the most difficult of circumstances. Of course, the union, led very ably by John Camillo and Jon Gee, continue in the strongest possible manner to put forward their views about how we might secure even more production at Holden’s Elizabeth plant and in the car industry generally. We know that it is of tremendous importance to my local community. One in four workers in the city of Playford is a manufacturing worker. We are a city that makes things. We are a town-Elizabeth is still a town-that makes things, and it is important for this country to manufacture and export cars. We know that, despite all the difficulties that we faced through the GFC-and there were many sacrifices made by workers in that plant, sacrifices that they made together to preserve one another’s jobs and to make sure that the plant got through a difficult time in General Motors history-all of those sacrifices were based around the future of the car industry and making sure that Holden is still there in 10, 20 or 30 years time making cars for this nation, making cars for places like Bathurst and the hill. In the time. I have left I want to talk about a couple of events. RecentlyI attended a family day to welcome 7RAR, some 1,200 troops who were relocating from Darwin down to RAAF Base Edinburgh. It was a terrific day. His Excellency Rear Admiral Kevin Scarce, the Governor of the state of South Australia, attended, along with Kevin Foley, the relevant state minister; Group Captain Reg Carruthers; Michael Callan, Director General of the Defence Community Organisation; and Lieutenant Colonel Michael Garraway, who is the commander of 7RAR. They all attended that day, along with many soldiers and their families. It was a wonderful thing. There was an expo-like feel. Many of the local community organisations turned out to provide their services and to endeavour to encourage the soldiers to join in community life. There is at least one rugby club that is bidding for new players, and I am sure it will find a good pool of new players which will improve rugby in my state. It does need an improvement. We are predominantly an Aussie Rules state, and I am sure we will get a few players there for the local clubs as well. It was terrific to be down there to be part of one of the first events to welcome these soldiers to our local area. I look forward to meeting them again and, in particular, to seeing the improvements that they bring to RAAF Base Edinburgh. We know that the transition has not been entirely without its issues and difficulties, but it is very important both for the country and the defence forces and for 7RAR for that move to occur. Finally, I want to praise the Nicholls family, who are an absolute institution down at the Elizabeth Vale Soccer Club. More than one generation has participated in the club’s life. The bar in the club is named the Nicholls Bar. I would like to praise David Nicholls in particular, who for the past 45 years has been part of that club and has played 900 games for the division 1 A-grade, reserves, C-grade and the over-35s side. His contribution just in playing footballor soccer, as some would call it-is absolutely unparalleled. It is good to see someone out there playing at that age. It puts some of us, including me, to shame. I think it is an absolutely sterling contribution. Of course, it is not just on the field that he has contributed. He has MAIN COMMITTEE coached junior teams, reserve sides and the senior women’s side with great success. He has been the chairman of the senior and junior teams committees. I am sure that even though his playing days are now ended he will continue to be a big part of this club, just like his brother Roger Nicholls, who is an absolute stalwart not just of the Elizabeth Vale Soccer Club but of the shop assistants union-a person I have often relied upon for his good judgment and for his counsel not just in union affairs but in my own conduct as the local representative in this parliament. The Nicholls family is one of those families that you are proud of and proud to be associated with, and I would like to congratulate both David Nicholls and Roger Nicholls for being great South Australians. 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011. The appropriation being sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) is $1.359 billion, and the amount sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) is just over $1 billion. Critical in all this is that we have a Gillard Labor government that does not understand the cost of living. We have a Gillard Labor government that is addicted to tax and therefore addicted to increasing the cost of living for everyday Australians. The effects of the Gillard government’s increasing taxes will be felt more in regional and rural Australia than in any other part. The impacts of mining taxes, flood taxes and carbon taxes will be significant. Not only do we have a Prime Minister who does not understand the effects of rising costs of living on the average Australians; we also have a Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government who does not understand the needs of regional Australia. The minister does not live in regional Australia; he lives in the capital city of Melbourne; therefore he can be partially forgiven for that. But his department should be providing briefings to him to give him a full and detailed understanding of the needs and the concerns of regional Australia. On the ABC’s Insiders program, on 3 October, when questioned about what constituted regional Australia, the minister said: Every part of this country is constituted within their own region, Barrie. We’ve got a regional development Australia infrastructure that is comprised of 55 geographic regions. … … … When I talk about regionalism … it is saying all regions in the country, the whole 55 of them … Therefore it is no surprise that this minister considers capital cities as eligible for funds which should and must be targeted for regional Australia. I put a question on notice to the minister about the eligibility for Labor’s Regional Infrastructure Fund. It took him 90 days to provide a response. I asked the minister whether capital cities will have access to the Regional Infrastructure Fund, and all he could say was that he has not finalised the program guidelines yet, despite Labor having been in government for nearly six months. Minister, if you cannot answer a question about your portfolio, if you cannot rule out capital cities having access to regional funding programs, just what do you do as the minister for regional Australia? If Labor’s Regional Infrastructure Fund were really about investing in regional Australia, it would have been pretty easy for the minister to rule out capital cities as being eligible for the funds. I have to ask the question, as many people in this House and many people throughout regional Australia have: where will the money from the Regional Infrastructure Fund go? It is no secret that the Gillard Labor government is already taking $480 million out of the Regional Infrastructure Fund for Perth airport. Last time. I flew to Perth and last time. I looked, Perth MAIN COMMITTEE",195,Appropriation Bill No 4 2010 2011
248,Mr Baldwin (Paterson) (10.45 Am),"I rise today to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3)was the capital of Western Australia. Perth is a capital city, but here it qualifies for $480 million out of the Regional Infrastructure Fund. In Senate estimates last night Mr Crean’s representative, Senator Sherry, was questioned whether he considered Perth airport to be a part of regional Australia. He said no. Then when he was questioned about the biggest single allocation under the Regional Infrastructure Fund he was lost for an answer. So what we have here is the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing. It is no wonder that our 55 Regional Development Australia committees around the country do not know what is happening either. This is an example of a government baffling more in the community by increasing the bureaucracies and the red tape than delivering real action. This government is not delivering action or results for regional Australia. This government is more about rhetoric and spin than results. I note that in 2010-11 the government will spend some $15 million on administration costs for the 55 Regional Development Australia committees around Australia. I have travelled around Australia, I have met with the RDAs, I have had some confidential discussions, and there is disillusionment in what is happening. They are not being empowered. They cannot make decisions. They are sent forth to consult with the community but nothing is happening. Our communities, our representatives, the people that work on these RDAs, want to be empowered to make decisions that benefit all Australians. Can you imagine how a community struggling for funds feels when they sit there in regional Australia when dollars are tight, when councils have not got much money, when they are ignored by the state Labor governments, and all of a sudden $480 million of their allocated funding is given to a capital city project? The committees have told me they feel bogged down in holding endless community consultations and producing these wonderful, glossy, motherhood-statement brochures, but they are not able to deliver the results for their community because this government clearly has not found its way. Kevin Rudd was sacked as prime minister because it was felt that the Labor government had lost its way. I have to say that our new Prime Minister, the new Julia or the old Julia, neither of those in that split personality have found their way either. There is a difference between the needs of regional Australia and the needs of the capital cities. I cite an example of the arrogance and lack of understanding of a government about regional Australia. The youth allowance scheme that was put in by this government meant young people in inner regional areas were being forced to work more hours and for longer before being considered independent. Did we hear the minister for regional Australia stand up for these young people? No, he just toed the government line. Yet this bill was also disappointingly killed off with the support of people who also live in regional and rural areas, and there I am referring to Tony Windsor and Rob Oakeshott in their respective electorates. I think that their constituents will deal with them because they have failed to represent their regions independently. Another area of great contention for people in my area and people in regional areas across Australia is the lack of broadband. This government under the leadership of Kevin Rudd going into the 2007 election made much of the need to increase broadband speed. This was despite the coalition having a plan, the OPEL plan, at a cost of less than a billion dollars, which would have rolled out wireless infrastructure all across Australia. Today we have an NBN network which is going to cost tens of billions of dollars and I expect that we will be coming back here to visit appropriation bills where more money will need to be provided because it MAIN COMMITTEE has blown outside the original budget estimates. But in regional and rural Australia there will be many cities that will not have access to this optical fibre, and these communities will only get wireless broadband. If you had a plan and if you are representing regional Australia, you would have made sure that if you are only going to get wireless transmission-and if a plan that was already there, the OPEL plan, was going to cost less than $1 billion and would have been completed by the middle of 2009-then you would have continued with that plan and expedited it to deliver results. I fear, the community fears, and people in regional Australia fear, that they will be left until the last when their needs should be considered first and foremost because they suffer the tyranny of distance. In fact, at a doorstop interview on 17 February 2011, the minister for regional Australia was asked, ‘What’s actually being done to improve regional development?’ to which he replied, ‘Look, the key infrastructure agenda for the time is the rollout of the NBN broadband.’ More rhetoric, not results, for regional Australia. In fact, in this parliament on 24 November he said: … we will deliver better services, particularly to people in regional and remote communities. How is doing nothing delivering for people in regional and remote communities? How is delaying a program, which was to be delivered by mid-2009 across Australia, doing the right thing by people in regional and remote communities? People will miss out, and I welcome the decision by Telstra to roll out their new 4G network. I think it will be good. This government could have continued that OPEL project for less than $1 billion while it was developing its NBN program. One billion dollars, as against $40 billion, $50 billion, $60 billion, probably $70 billion, $80 billion or $90 billion by the time it is rolled out, is but a drop in the ocean. In 2007, the former coalition government announced the OPEL network, which would have delivered 12 megabits per second wireless broadband to nearly 900,000 households across regional and rural Australia. So here we have it: 18 months have passed since that date when it would have been completed in 2009, and still nothing. I am sure the member for Newcastle must feel totally embarrassed because she campaigned very heavily in a town called Thornton, a very large town, which, through the development processes at the time, put in the twin pair gain wire. It still only has dial-up speed, yet is a major town. And here we are, nearly four years on, and she has delivered absolutely nothing to those people-apart from rhetoric, more rhetoric and excuses. I say to the minister: now is the time for action. Now is not the time to burden people more and more and more with taxes. Now is the time to start to roll out some of these agendas for regional and rural communities. In April 2008 the Rudd-Gillard government announced it was abandoning the OPEL networks contract. Yet when Labor cancelled the contract they had absolutely no plan in place to deliver broadband for regional and rural Australia. The Labor minister for broadband, Stephen Conroy, said at the time of cancelling the contract: The Government will … call for comments on policy and funding initiatives to improve access to affordable broadband in remote areas … into the future. That was a press release by the Senator Conroy on 2 April 2008. So here we have a government that understands the principles of businessMs Marino interjectingMAIN COMMITTEE truly examined, it does not understand the principles of business either because he cancelled a plan without having a plan to replace it. He cancelled a plan that would have rolled out wireless infrastructure to regional and rural Australia for less than $1 billion under the OPEL contract to pursue a $55 billion flight of fantasy. He is a minister who to date has delivered nothing to those communities four years on. And they suffer the tyranny of distance; they suffer communication blackholes. What we want to see is action. The issue with this government is the fact that they are not businesspeople; they are not business managers. They have never had true skin in the game. They do not understand risk. They do not understand that when you spend a dollar you need to make a return on that dollar. What we have here is a government who are just prepared to fritter away money and, when times get tough, all they do is revert back to the old Labor mantra-which was reflected in the times of Keating and Hawke and that icon of the Labor Party, Gough Whitlam: let’s just tax. As Tony Abbott said so eloquently this morning in the House, Julia Gillard has never met a tax she did not like or a tax she was not prepared to hike. Ms SAFFIN (Page) (11.00 am)-I was going to start off my contribution by going through some of the good programs that are contained within Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011, but, having sat here and listened to the drivel that I have just listened to, I have to respond. I have to put on record some things in response to what the honourable member was just talking about. First of all, he started talking about regional development. He was saying that the government is not doing anything in regional development. As he was talking, I cast my mind back to 1997, when the coalition were in government, having been elected in 1996. What did they do for regional development? They just axed the department! That is what they did for regional development. That is how much they cared about it. This is the National Party, who say they are the natural party of the bush. They say one thing and do another. Then the honourable member talked about there being some disillusionment with things in regions and local councils. What did this government do? It funded a Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, which operates through local councils. Local councils put up their priorities, as determined by local communities through the councils, and there is money, real money, in it-hundreds of millions of dollars. In my electorate of Page there are small projects, and some larger ones, all over the electorate-which has five local government areas-where that money is being rolled out. We have a Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government, who worked in the area in a previous government. We are rolling the programs out. ThenI listened to the words on the NBN. I heard from the coalition that when they were in government they had the OPEL plan, and had that been implemented all would have been well and we would all have 12 megabits per second of broadband. They had 12 years; they had 18 plans. And what happened? Nothing. So to listen to them is toing proper mobile coverage. That is how much they care about regional Australia. So for me, as I live in regional Australia, sitting here listening to that just gets my goat-just listening to them talk as though they are so fiscally responsible, and talk about how there is nobody on MAIN COMMITTEE",198,Appropriation Bill No 4 2010 2011

250,Mr Fletcher,We had a signed contract which your government cancelled!,201,Appropriation Bill No 4 2010 2011
251,Ms Saffin,"They had 18 failed plans. Then they flogged off Telstra, without even ensurthis side who has been in small business and therefore we cannot govern. What an absolute lot of rubbish! The opposition’s approach to the budget is not only reckless; it is incompetent-it does not stand up to scrutiny. A recent example happened just this week: the recklessness with which they treated the Constitution with the student income support legislation-or youth allowance, as we call it-in trying to introduce money bills from the Senate. The opposition have demonstrated their fiscal recklessness by twice blocking $5 billion in savings measures put forward by this government. This includes the closure of the chronic disease dental scheme. That scheme had significant cost blowouts-an Abbott designed scheme that will cost the budget $3.1 billion over the next four years. I see that having an effect in my electorate. The government is trying to introduce a Commonwealth dental health scheme, which will benefit all in my area. If the resource distribution formula was implemented at its correct rate, we would have an extra $2 million put into my area. That would buy a lot of dentures. I have people waiting for dentures. Who closed the former Commonwealth dental health scheme? The coalition when they were in government. That was another thing that they closed, along with the department of regional development and other things. Back to fiscal recklessness, the means testing of the private health insurance rebate will cost the budget $2.1 billion over the next four years. And they claim that they are responsible fiscal managers who know who to manage money. There is an additional $5 billion in spending over the next four years as a result of opposition recklessness. They are also in the process of trying to block a further $2 billion in savings to the budget over four years by voting against reforms to the PBS. The opposition have demonstrated time and time again that they are not committed to bringing the budget back to surplus. The say one thing outside the parliament and their actions in the parliament are completely different. Their plan to pay for flood reconstruction was another debacle and fiasco. After spending weeks of Mr Abbott saying that it would be easy to find savings, what we got was a series of deferrals, double counts and back flips. They double counted $700 million in savings. And while they say that they would use that to fund rebuilding, they have already earmarked those savings to fund other spending measures. You cannot spend it twice on different things. They also claimed over $100 million in savings from the BER. But that is already allocated to projects that are committed or underway. It is very easy to find out-a simple read-that 99.9 per cent of projects have been completed or commenced. In my area, where I have 96 schools, I have been involved in these projects from day one and have seen them rolled out. Parents, students and teachers are saying that they never would have got these things but for this spending. It has been a one-off opportunity. They think that it is great to have these things done in their area. And it is infrastructure; it is what we need. We also saw the opposition have a debate about foreign aid, reversing their initial position. I have always been able to talk locally and at other levels about how there is bipartisanship in this area. To get a headline, they dropped that like a hot potato. They reversed their position on foreign aid, taking savings out of a measure that they not only supported in government but introduced. Mr Downer introduced it. At the time, funding schools in Indonesia was seen as a good and sensible thing to do. Then they rolled out Warren Truss and the Nationals, who said they would not support our infrastructure savings. I can remember how well they supported the regional rorts that were damned by the Auditor-General. They are probably missing that. MAIN COMMITTEE Who can forget the election cost blow out? Obviously, the coalition opposition do not talk about that. They have conveniently forgotten their shambolic costings release during the election campaign last year. When Treasury and Finance were finally able to take a look, they found that the coalition had a $10.6 billion hole in their budget numbers. These are the parties that claim that they know all about the economy and running businesses. They say that because they have run small businesses they can therefore run a national budget. But the figures just do not add up. The recklessness continues. I have observed it in the Senate. The Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendment (Fair Indexation) Bill 2010 was introduced by Senator Ronaldson. It would have a fiscal cost of $1.7 billion over four years and an underlying cash cost of some $175 million over four years. And it would increase the Commonwealth’s unfunded liabilities by $6.2 billion. That is not small bikkies; not small dollars; not small money. That is reckless. Why are they doing it? It is purely political rhetoric. They are playing politics. Some of these issues are not new issues. They are issues that communities grapple with all the time. During 12 years in government they did not tackle them; they did not even try. And now they do this. It is just reckless behaviour politically and it is also reckless behaviour fiscally. The opposition preach one thing but their actions prove another. They cannot be trusted with either the budget or the economy. They certainly cannot be trusted with the truth. because I hear what they say, I see what they do-it has always been fuss. They say one thing in the electorate when they are out and about and then do another thing in here. Their election campaign left a $10.6 billion hole. They blocked $5.2 billion of savings in both houses of parliament, and then they say, ‘We have to find savings.’ They have blocked close to $2 billion in savings by opposing the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme reforms in the House of Representatives and they have double-counted $700 million of savings in their flood response. What a mess around the flood response, too, with the flood levy, talking as though a levy was something new, something unusual, something that only Labor does. The opposition tried to introduce eight levies when they were in government, with Mr Howard as Prime Minister. Six of them went through. They were broadly supported by the parties and by the community. Some of them were not for natural disasters that we have never seen the likes of; some of them were for corporate failure. But we wanted to ensure that workers got their entitlements; we wanted to ensure that we helped the dairy industry. Some levies were for the stevedoring industry. I did not support some of the reforms on the waterfront, particularly the balaclavas and the dogs on the waterfront. Who can forget that? Six levies went through parliament. They were supported and they helped sections of the community. That is what Australians do. We are good at it. We do not object and yet you have the honourable member for Warringah running around, talking as though a levy was something that was invented by the federal Labor Party and that it is something new. People do support it. The opposition’s budget black hole has blown out to over $18 billion. That is a large amount of money. It is clear that the opposition have no credible plan to bring the budget back to surplus. In contrast, the federal Labor government has a clear budget and a fiscal strategy to return the budget to surplus in 2012-13, comfortably ahead of all major advanced economies. In fact, we are the envy of other major advanced economies in the world. MAIN COMMITTEE These appropriation bills Nos3 and 4 seek the authority from the parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the consolidated revenue fund in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last budget. The total appropriation being sought this year through additional estimates bills Nos3 and 4 is a little over $2.3 billion. The total appropriation being sought through Appropriation Bill (No. 3) is $1.36 billion and the total appropriation being sought through Appropriation Bill (No. 4) is a little over $1 billion. Some of these appropriations are in areas that are of benefit to all Australians and, when I read through them and note the areas in which they are in, I see they are of particular benefit to those in my electorate of Page-for instance, the trade training centres program. The Labor government has already awarded more than $1 billion for 288 projects, benefiting 927 schools, to create better job pathways for students. What a good thing to do, creating those pathways. Having a job really does mean everything. Having a job is something that we in the federal Labor Party know is important. That is one of the things that marks us out: we understand that. This year, 70 projects have already been completed and are operational, benefiting students at 171 schools. Some are in progress in my area and I can tell you that they are welcome. What do Tony Abbott and Christopher Pyne want to do? They promised to cut $968 million from the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program, robbing more than 1.2 million students and over 800 secondary schools of the opportunity to find better pathways to becoming the next generation of electricians, brickies, hairdressers, chefs, carpenters-people working in trades, working people. That is what we do. We manage the budget responsibly and we have a good fiscal strategy. We have to do that so that people get those jobs. I commend the bills to the House. Ms MARINO (Forrest) (11.15 am)-I am very pleased to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011, which is an actual appropriation bill-as opposed to the youth allowance bill, which we know was not an appropriation bill, despite the government’s attempts to label it as such for the sole purpose of maintaining their discrimination against regional students across Australia, like those in my electorate. In an action that reinforces the absolute contempt this government has for regional areas, the spurious arguments put forward by the Labor Party sacrifice democracy and fairness, a fair go, for students in my electorate simply for political expediency. Thousands of students arbitrarily classified as ‘inner regional’ by this government have no certainty and no guarantee of being treated equally. What they do have is the promise of another of Labor’s famous reviews that do not deliver. Students who finished year 12 in 2009 and 2010 in particular are in absolute limbo. They are contacting my office on a regular basis. They do not know where they stand and they do not know where they are going to stand after this review or where they will stand in the future. Even under the Rural Tertiary Hardship Fund Scheme, nothing at all has been delivered. Those who framed the Australian Constitution-including Sir John Forrest, after whom the seat of Forrest is named-envisaged a nation where there was no discrimination against people based on their location. This is seen, for example, in section 51. It states that the Commonwealth has the power to make laws with regard to taxation but, as it says under part (ii), it must do so ‘so as not to discriminate between states or parts of states’. That is exactly what this government has done in relation to youth allowance and it is continuing to do. Our forefaMAIN COMMITTEE thers decried discrimination based on locality-the sort of discrimination the Labor Party has entrenched in legislation. The government’s handling of the economy is an absolute disgrace, and it will go down as one of the worse in this nation’s history. According to the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the government will run a deficit of $41.5 billion this financial year and a deficit of $12.3 billion next year. Spending by the Gillard government will result in an expected net debt level of $94 billion by 2013-$94 billion. The interest on that will reach nearly $6 billion a year. It is an obscene number, even for this government. Of course, this does not include the government’s NBN investment, which, through an astounding accounting deception, does not actually appear in the forward estimates. There is no doubt, however, that the NBN will have a significant impact on the debt level of the Australian government in the next decade, probably well beyond the $43 billion price tag being bandied about, and that is certainly open to discussion. The ultimate net debt level of $140 billion is the legacy that the Gillard Labor government will leave the people of Australia, long after the stimulus spending is gone and forgotten. Once again, it will not be a Labor government that repays its own debts; it will no doubt fall to a coalition government to pick up Labor’s financial pieces. This will happen because a coalition government will end the waste, and this is a historically wasteful government. Irresponsibility continues to mark the performance of this Labor government. What about the waste with the BER? No-one can question the waste under the BER or the debacle that was the pink batts program. But, beyond paying back Labor’s debt, a coalition government will need to end Labor’s waste in order to provide the investment needed in regional areas like the south-west of WA. We have seen a neglect of infrastructure in my region, as in a lot of others, and it is an indictment of this government that, four years in, nothing has happened. Regional Development Australia in my electorate basically has no funds attached to it. It is a toothless tiger, trying with its gums to nut away at the infrastructure needs of the country. It has no capacity to invest. It can only go cap in hand to the government, and unfortunately it seems to be told that the cupboard is bare. The south-west of WA has infrastructure requirements that could have been funded by just one of the billions wasted by this governmentand there have been multiple billions of dollars of waste by this government. Just one of those wasted billions could have funded all the infrastructure needs in my electorate. Some of these would be extending the AusLink program to include road and rail transport south of Bunbury; finishing the Bunbury ring road, the port access road and the Preston River realignment; and upgrading the South Western Highway, providing 12 additional overtaking lanes from Yarloop to Waterloo, two from Waterloo to Picton and six from Bunbury to Manjimup. This is what I know needs doing. There is also upgrading of the Coalfields Highway from the Wellington Weir turnoff to Collie, providing additional overtaking lanes between Roelands and Collie, upgrading the Bussell Highway to dual lanes from Bunbury to Margaret River and the construction of the Margaret River perimeter road. Just one billion of this government’s waste would have done all this and more. Some things that could be done is to expand the capacity of the Collie-Brunswick Junction-Port of Bunbury rail network; to upgrade the Vasse Highway; to use the disused rail lines, perhaps south of Bunbury, to expand freight capacity when it becomes feasible; and to upgrade the Busselton airport and its runway. These are some of the things that could have been done with just $1 billion of the waste. MAIN COMMITTEE I also bring to the attention of the House the plight of the dairy industry in Australia-and I ask the member opposite to listen to this because I am sure that this is something he may not be aware of. The Australian dairy industry has a long and proud history. When the first fleet landed in 1788 it brought with it one bull, four dairy cows and one calf to supply milk to the new colony. This little herd was the foundation of the original Australian dairy herd. The pioneers, however, were not great stockmen. They managed to lose their cattle. The herd wandered off and was not discovered for seven years-but it had grown to 40 cows, so someone had done their job. Despite the industry now having a couple of million dairy cows, like the early settlers we have lost touch with our dairy herd, our dairy farmers and our dairy industry. The dairy industry in Australia has grown into a significant contributor to the Australian economy, and there is no doubt that Australian dairy farmers are amongst the most efficient in the world. We have the second lowest cost of production anywhere in the world and some of the highest quality milk. The question I put to this Australian parliament today is: do we actually want to maintain our dairy industry into the future, particularly in a state like Western Australia? Do we want to? WhatI am hearing is that we do not. According to the Australian Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry food stats, Australian milk production in 2007-08 accounted for 13 per cent of all food production and had a gross value of $4.9 billion. Of this, $2.8 billion worth of milk products were exported. But when you scratch beneath the surface there is pain and heartache being felt by dairy farmers, their families and their communities right across Australia. This industry, these families and their communities are hurting. Many are struggling to stay viable, with their incapacity to drive commercial returns. Many dairy farmers have left the industry that has sustained their families and their communities, often for generations. Most of those remaining are using their capital to subsidise their lack of income. According to ABARES, the proportion of Australian farms with a negative farm business profit hit a peak in 2004-05 of 61 per cent. Of those making a profit, many in the farm sector have incomes equivalent to welfare. In short, many Australian dairy farmers are losing money and many others are making the equivalent of the dole-and we are expecting people to work under these conditions and provide us with a staple food that is the best in the world. The only way many dairy farmers can afford to keep farming is to simply go further into debt or eat into their capital, or both. According to ABARES, in the six years prior to 2008 average farm debt increased from $237,000 to $494,000. At the same time, incomes for dairy farmers have stagnated, averaging over the same period a two per cent return on investment. Who is going to invest for a two per cent return and do the work that is required? Yet we expect them to; we demand that they do. The return for dairy farmers only reaches levels acceptable to most businesses in Australia by including capital growth in their net return. That is if the price of their land has increased; and when this increase is written in as a cash return annually, the overall return to dairy farmers is 8.2 per cent. However, this level of return requires the farmer to sell their land to access the money. That is what you have to do. Nice if you are ready to sell your farm and retire, but useless if you are not, and hopeless should one of your family want to carry on farming after you. And what about the new farmers who want to start? Where do they start? It costs money to produce milk, and in this debate we must be prepared to acknowledge this. It is an indictment when water in the supermarkets is priced higher than milk. That is just an abomination. MAIN COMMITTEE We also have to acknowledge that the farm gate price-the price the farmer actually receives for their product-is impacted, particularly in the liquid milk states, directly by the retail price consumers pay for their milk. Dairy producers are absolute price takers. The negotiations they have with their processors and, by default, supermarkets in a state like WA are extremely one-sided affairs. The processor, via the supermarket or the major retailer, will tell them the price they are going to receive. That is the price that the supermarkets have dictated. In a state like Western Australia, which is a majority liquid milk state, this has a direct impact on the price that is paid to farmers. The price that the supermarkets dictate will govern the price the processor can afford to pay to the grower. The poor old farmer has just one choice. He has this marvellous product but it is perishable. What does he do with it if he cannot sell it that day? It has to be picked up, it has to be processed and it has to be delivered to the market every day. It is not something we can store. That in itself creates a vulnerability that I do not think many, if any, in this place really understand, but it is one that the supermarkets understand because they certainly take advantage of it. It is ‘take it or leave it’ for the dairy farmer. It is in this setting that the supermarket chains, led by Coles, have decided to engage in a milk-marketing war using deep discounting to steal market share from each other. The supermarkets have said they will absorb the cost and that farm gate prices will not be affected. Well, if this is true it will be a groundbreaking event because it does not reflect the history of milk pricing since deregulation in 2000. When asked by members of the Senate Economics References Committee in their investigation into the milk industry in May last year, the major supermarket chains denied using milk as a loss leader. However, that is clearly not the case now. I notice, too, that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Joe Ludwig, is coming out in support of Coles in its bid for market dominance. Unfortunately, this demonstrates that the minister does not understand the impact that this type of activity in the market will have on dairy farmers in liquid milk states like Western Australia. The Senate has instigated another inquiry because it appears that the supermarkets are in fact using milk as a loss leader in the war for a greater share of the market. So how much faith can we put in the responses of those supermarkets in 2010-or was that previous inquiry misled? I hope this next inquiry will look at this, and I would ask how much faith we can have in the answers that will be given by the supermarkets. We will not get to the truth behind this because of the market power and dominance of the supermarkets and because those who could give evidence will be too afraid to do so. They will not do so because they will be out of business if they do and because they are dependent on the supermarkets to sell their products. The market share and market power of the major supermarkets, their collective buying and selling capacity, also mean that their profits are probably far greater than they will claim. They have the capacity to dictate and dominate. The barrage of lawyers and consultants they employ will ensure that, in spite of all the inquiries that we might have, we will never get to the truth about the contractual issues and product pricing of the supermarkets. I would say to Wesfarmers, who own Coles: change your name. Your genesis was in the rural sector. Your genesis was in farmers. So change your name because your behaviour in this instance does not reflect your history. In Western Australia since deregulation we have gone from 400-odd farmers down to around 160. We have recently seen a processor go out of business in our state. How are our MAIN COMMITTEE farmers going to hold on when all of the chains have to meet that same price to be able to sell milk and all those who sell milk have to meet that particular price? It will come back to the dairy farmer. Coles knows this well. They know very well that this will happen but they will say, ‘We will not put the price down but we know the rest of the market will have to react to meet that price,’ and by default that price will come back to the dairy farmer. That is how it will work. I say once again that the milk price war now threatens the viability of the farmers, their communities and their future. I ask this parliament: ‘Do we actually want a dairy industry in those liquid milk states?’ Ms BIRD (Cunningham) (11.30 am)-I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20102011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011. I should indicate that Appropriation Bill (No. 3) involves a total appropriation of $1.36 billion and this flows from the changes to the estimate of program expenditures, the timing of payments, forecast increases in program takeups, and some reclassifications and policy decisions that have been taken by the government since the last budget. Appropriation Bill (No. 4) has a total appropriation of $1.02 billion for numerous departments. I want to take this opportunity in the debate to address a number of specific issues within that range of policy areas and also address some of the local implications for my electorate. I would like first to address the component that addresses the fair entitlements guarantee to protect employee entitlements when employers enter liquidation. I would indicate that Illawarra workers have been victims over many years now of losing their legal entitlements when companies go broke, starting with the very famous example of Parish meats at Yallah quite a while ago. The lost entitlements often include superannuation. It is a particularly devastating circumstance for workers when this occurs. It is important that the government is committed to protecting workers who lose entitlements through no fault of their own but due to the insolvency of their employer. The Fair Entitlements Guarantee was announced as part of the government’s Protecting Workers’ Entitlements policy. We will deliver on that commitment. I know it will be very welcome in my area and I am sure in many other areas of the nation-anywhere where this has been the experience of local workers. The guarantee improves on the existing General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, known as GEERS. It improves it in two key areas. Firstly, it increases the redundancy protection under the scheme to pay up to four weeks per year of service rather than the previous cap of a total of 16 weeks. It also removes access to financial assistance for company directors or excluded employees and, unlike GEERS, it enshrines the Fair Entitlements Guarantee in legislation. These are important improvements to the protections we provide. They recognise that workers’ superannuation is forgone income serving as an insurance against their long-term well-being at retirement age. It is very important to the well-being of the people in our community. These changes will provide certainty to those employees. It will ensure that almost all Australian workers will get all of their redundancy entitlements in these situations. Protecting redundancy entitlements is a priority for the government. Consequently, the increased protection of redundancy entitlements has been implemented through changes to GEERS prior to the MAIN COMMITTEE Fair Entitlements Guarantee legislation coming into effect. This change applies to cases where an employer enters liquidation or bankruptcy on or after 1 January 2011. The following entitlements currently covered by GEERS will continue to be protected under the new Fair Entitlements Guarantee and they include up to three months unpaid wages and the amounts deducted from wages such as employee superannuation contributions that are not passed on to a superannuation fund up to three months prior to insolvency. It also includes all unpaid annual leave, all long service leave and up to a maximum of five weeks unpaid payment in lieu of notice. I think this is an important component of the appropriation bills before us and something that will certainly be very welcome in my own electorate. Within this range of appropriation bills there is also increased funding support for regional development. This is something that, since its election in 2007, this government has put a great deal of focus on, and it is particularly important for regions and their well-being both economic and social. Over the long term, regions are the drivers of growth in the Australian economy. So whilst the cities are, if you like, the headline growth drivers of the well-being of the nation, if they are doing well but the regions are dying on the vine then overall we are not doing well. So it is important that regional development policy addresses linking regions into growth opportunities and encouraging them beyond that to actually become drivers of innovation, productivity and national growth themselves. The regions are the place where those great opportunities for the nation actually are. In particular I want to acknowledge in addressing this issue the role that the Regional Development Australia Illawarra branch has played in our region since its establishment after we came to government in 2007. It was a combination of the previous area consultative committees of the federal government and the regional development boards of the state government, so they have been combined into one organisation. I was particularly pleased that the RDA Illawarra attracted to its board a really impressive range of local leaders who have done a tremendous job in progressing issues of regional development for the Illawarra. It is headed up by the chair, Eddy De Gabriele, who is a significant businessman in his own right in our region in the employment sector and also a well-known aficionado and official of the soccer industry. He has a widespread coverage of experience and is a well-known Illawarra person for the variety of roles that he plays. He has headed up the RDA tremendously well, seconded in the deputy position by Roger Summerill, who has a long history in communications-in particular with the ABC management over many years and also WAVE FM-and who is somebody who brings a profound understanding of our region to that role. The board more broadly has a good variety of expertise in the business and community sectors. The board has established a tradition now of what is called the State of the Illawarra Regional Leaders Summit. This is held each year and this summit pushes the region to look at the challenges and opportunities arising over the next 12 months and to come to a consensus view about where the priority efforts of our regional leadership should be placed in progressing the region over those following 12 months. It is really a tremendously useful thing for people like me because, as we would all know in this place, you get lobbied on about 101 ideas in your electorate, with people saying: ‘If only we did this, it would be the thing that would make everything so much better. This would address the unemployment issue. This would progress environmental improvements. This would address social disadvantage.’ Whatever the case may be, there is no lack of great ideas in all of our communities and so the MAIN COMMITTEE challenge becomes being under the pump to work out which of those can be best utilised and how to best utilise them. The RDA has fulfilled this role really effectively in the Illawarra and encouraged people to bring all those ideas with a good solid plan-what would be required, how much it would cost, what needs to be done-and then leaders from across all sectors go through those and say, ‘We think these have the best leverage opportunity for us all to get behind them.’ That does not mean the other ideas cannot be progressed by their individual organisations and so forth, but we drive the key ones as a region. It has been a tremendous initiative and most important from my perspective has been the push to have the National Broadband Network rollout extend as quickly as we can get it to do from the Kiama Minnamurra trial site throughout the region. The RDA has put together a clear priority list for major infrastructure which will connect Wollongong and Port Kembla with better road and rail links, so it is also looking at the transport opportunities and challenges. And we currently have the business case for the Maldon-Dombarton rail link underway. It is a $3 million feasibility study and I was very pleased to see in the release yesterday of the National Freight Strategy by Infrastructure Australia a recognition of the port of Port Kembla as a key national part of that task. Certainly we will be progressing the opportunity for that port to take on a greater role-because it drives jobs growth in our region-and to have that linked effectively by road and rail links. There is $5.9 million in these bills to strengthen local engagement and improve the wholeof-government coordination of policy for regional Australia. I am very encouraged by the minister. I think Minister Crean has been well and truly known for a long time as an advocate of regional responsibility and autonomy, regions understanding what they need and driving that. This funding is in addition to resources that have already been transferred to the Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government; the former Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government; and the Attorney-General’s Department. The recently established Department of Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government is growing by the day and is a dedicated agency which will have responsibility for regional policy and overseeing the rollout of initiatives across other departments. I believe that if we are to achieve real and long-lasting outcomes for communities across this nation then a coordinated approach is needed. There is an additional $100 million as part of the government’s partnership with local government, which has been an extraordinarily effective local partnership. I indicate that the government will provide $800 million over five years to establish the priority regional infrastructure program. The funding will be allocated following consultation with local governments and Regional Development Australia committees. The funding will be provided for transport infrastructure such as roads and bridge upgrades, community infrastructure projects such as town halls and sporting facilities, and economic infrastructure projects that support regional economies. I particularly appreciate the importance of regional infrastructure programs because I look at the great success that has occurred in conjunction with Wollongong City Council over a number of projects that have been funded under the previous community infrastructure funding. For example, what is known as the Blue Mile, which is a development of the foreshore of Wollongong from a fairly run-down footpath making it difficult to access part of the foreshore around the harbour and the bathing pavilion and pools, has been upgraded so that people with MAIN COMMITTEE mobility issues, the aged and the frail are now able to share that beautiful part of our electorate. It has been a truly successful on-budget, on-time project that the council has rolled out. I would acknowledge that there was some criticism of our council getting that funding by the member for Cook, the shadow minister at the time, who thought that because there had been some issues around the governance of Wollongong council we should not have been given that money. But I can say that, as I was sure at the time, the council has provided an excellent outcome in terms of that investment and it is truly valued by the local community. In the brief time left to me I highlight that the smart infrastructure facility at the University of Wollongong, which is worth $62 million of which the Commonwealth contributed $35 million, is nearly completed. The member for Throsby and I had a look at that only last week. The construction is coupled with two other buildings invested in by the Commonwealth at the University of Wollongong’s innovation campus which have helped support the region’s construction and building industry during the global financial crisis. In MarchI will also officially open the Wollongong Workers Educational Association’s new vocational training centre. This is a new building worth nearly $2 million and the Commonwealth contribution is $1.3 million. These investments, together with the Building the Education Revolution program which has been so successful in my schools, investments in TAFE facilities including a new engineering building at the TAFE, and the investments outlined at the university, represent nearly $300 million worth of investment in my area’s skills and education. They are particularly important foundations for the long-term future of the region. I have indicated that the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program has been particularly successful. The Blue Mile project of the Wollongong council involved a $5.9 million investment in local infrastructure in my electorate, and I would particularly commend the $836,000 worth of new investments to be made in the bathers pavilion upgrade at north Wollongong-a project that was well and truly welcomed by local people. (Time expired) Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011. These bills come forward in the context where we have a government that has shown a proven incapacity to manage the budget in a responsible fashion. We have a government which this year is proposing to spend $354 billion. That is almost $100 million a year more than the federal government was spending only four years ago. We have a government that is rampantly engaging in deficit financing. This year the deficit will be $41 billion. This is a government which is addicted to spending. We hear the assurances: ‘Don’t worry-in three years time we’ll return to surplus.’ You will forgive me, Madam Deputy Speaker, if I am somewhat sceptical of that claim, because these people have no track record of doing something which they promised they would achieve in three years. When we hear them say, ‘We may have consistently engaged in deficit financing; we may have turned the lever from surplus to deficit the moment we came to government and started spending in a profligate fashion, but don’t worry-we’ll become pure in three years time,’ I am sceptical, as would any objective observer be. The context we face is a government profligate in its spending which has shown a consistent lack of discipline and there is absolutely no reason to be confident that that lack of discipline is going to be corrected. I want to focus on one area where the lack of discipline in spending is particularly egregious, and that is the National Broadband Network. We have seen a very sorry saga of fiscal MAIN COMMITTEE",201,Appropriation Bill No 4 2010 2011
252,Mr Fletcher (Bradfield) (11.45 Am),"I am pleased to rise to speak on Appropriationill-discipline since the National Broadband Network was first put on the agenda by the Labor Party in April 2007. When the plan was announced then, Labor was going to spend $4.7 billion of public money, and that was going to be combined with private money. It was going to be a joint venture with the private sector-that is to say, a private sector player would be spending at least as much as the Commonwealth-and it was going to be a much less ambitious and a much less expensive scheme. It was going to be a fibre-to-the-node scheme that would deliver a 12 megabit per second speed to 98 per cent of the population, and it was generally thought to be an incremental improvement on the broadband infrastructure which Australia had at that time. It transpired, though, that the plan could not be delivered. In a fit of political desperation in April 2009 the previous plan was abandoned, and it now transpires that we were to spend $43 billion-an extraordinary rate of increase in spending-because all of a sudden we were going to be much more visionary, much more grandiose. Part of being visionary, part of getting the political shock and awe effect which was so desperately sought, was to spend more money. But in April 2009 we were told that some of that money would still come from the private sector. We were told that the $43 billion would be the total spent and there would be funding from both the Commonwealth and the private sector. Some of us, even at that time, were sceptical. Some of us, even at that time, were not drinking the NBN Kool-Aid. But when the implementation study emerged last year, the sad truth became all too apparent: not one dollar was to come from the private sector until the network had been built, until all of the risk had been assumed. And we now know that what is proposed is that there will be a total commitment, a total taxpayer exposure, of $41 billion, including $27 billion in equity, all of which will come from the Commonwealth, all of which will be taxpayers’ money, all of which will be public money put at risk in an unconscionably risky and poorly thought through venture. In addition, there will be $13 billion of debt which taxpayers will also be exposed to; if NBN Co. is unable to repay that, it will be taxpayers who will be on the hook. So we have seen extraordinary ill-discipline. The second point to make is that the accounting practices which have been followed in relation to the NBN have been dubious in the extreme. The fiction on which this exercise is based is that this is an investment and that, because taxpayers are going to get a return, there is no need to put this on the balance sheet, there is no need to put this on the profit and loss account of the Commonwealth-that is, to put it on the budget. But when we look at the figures which are put forward we learn that, even with the most optimistic massaging of the basic expectations around this business venture, the internal rate of return is going to be barely seven per cent. In the NBN corporate plan, which was published in December last year, we also learnt that the weighted average cost of capital is somewhere over 10 per cent. Let me make a basic observation about corporate finance. When you work out the net present value of a project, you compare the weighted average cost of capital with the return. In the private sector, in any environment where you do not want to throw your money away, what you want to have is a return which exceeds your cost of capital. Here we have the opposite. The return is seven per cent. The cost of capital, on the admission of NBN Co., is over 10 per cent. The net present value of this project is seriously negative. Public money is being splashed away in this project. This is the same project, I might add, which former Prime Minister Rudd called a first-class investment, and he called on mums and dads to get their money MAIN COMMITTEE into it as quickly as possible when this project was announced in April 2009. He did not lose his job because of his misunderstanding of accounting and financial practices but, based upon that revelation, he might as well have. We have seen that a ridiculous and rapidly increasing amount of money is going to be spent and we have seen that the accounting processes underlying this project are very dubious. But the third problem with this plan is that the policy underpinnings of it are very poorly thought through. It is far from clear what problem this is designed to solve. Shortly before Christmas the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy issued a media release in which he claimed that the most recent figures issued by the OECD demonstrated the need for the National Broadband Network. He argued that because Australia was ranked 19th in broadband penetration, one place behind New Zealand-and apparently that in itself was a completely shameful thing-that demonstrated the need to spend $41 billion on this project. There is a clear lack of coherent thinking in the rationale for this project. If our objective is to increase broadband penetration, to get up the broadband penetration rankings-which, according to what Minister Conroy tells us, is our objective-then the most powerful policy lever to pull is to reduce the price that most people pay for broadband, and the best way to do that is to increase competition. The Prime Minister herself told the parliament last year that Australia has very high broadband prices. Australia has the fifth most expensive broadband prices in the OECD. Let me engage in bipartisanship and agree that Australia does have the fifth most expensive broadband prices in the OECD. What, then, would be a sensible thing to do about that? Would it be a sensible thing to spend $41 billion on a new network, the capital cost of which will need to be recovered, consistent with this government’s promise that it is going to be an investment that will generate a return and therefore will require high prices to be charged to consumers? We know from the corporate plan that the entry level wholesale price will be $24. This will be the foundation on which the retail price will be built-and it will be the retail price that will dictate the number of people who take the broadband service, that will dictate whether we achieve our objective of increasing broadband penetration. What is the wholesale price that is charged today for the most common product, the unconditioned local loop service, which is the basis on which most people receive competitive DSL services today? The price is set in various bands. The vast majority of people in Australia are in band 2. The unconditioned local loop price today is $16 per month. This will be replaced with a price of $24, which is 50 per cent higher. The wholesale price, the entry level price, is going to be 50 per cent higher. That is before you look at the details of the corporate plan, which makes it clear that NBN Co. intends to ramp up the price which is charged over time. We are going to see prices increase. How that is consistent with an increase in penetration, if that be our policy objective, is very unclear. The fourth point is the amount of money that is likely to be wasted. So far, I have taken it for granted that the assumptions in the corporate plan are reasonable and credible and therefore the financial projections are credible. There is $41 billion at risk on the proposition that this network will capture 70 per cent penetration, that 70 per cent of homes around Australia will take a service from this network. It is well accepted that the main source of competition is likely to come from wireless services. So we might well ask: what proportion of households take a wireless service today? Today 13 per cent of households take a wireless service. That MAIN COMMITTEE number is up from three per cent just a few years ago. The corporate plan assumes that that rate will top out at 16 per cent, that it will stay flat at 16 per cent and just will not move. That is certainly a helpful assumption if you are trying to come up with a plan which demonstrates that there is a financial return to be generated-bearing in mind that it is this government’s commitment that it will generate a financial return. But is it a credible assumption? The only experience I can bring to bear is my 15 years of public policy experience in broadband, including eight years on the senior leadership team of a large telecommunications company, where I was regularly involved in assessing the viability of business cases. Let me say very clearly that anybody who brought forward a business case of this kind in the large telecommunications company I worked in would rapidly have been invited to make alternative career plans. This is not a plan which is financially credible, it is not a plan on which any private sector player would for a second contemplate risking the investment that the Gillard government plans to risk. Indeed, the corporate plan makes that quite explicit on its face. The corporate plan says quite explicitly that these are not returns that would attract a private sector player. Well, isn’t that the truth! Forty-one billion dollars of public money is at risk on a project which is based upon fuzzy policy assumptions, which is based upon unrealistic projections about take-up and which will have a series of disastrous side-effects, including reducing competition, because it constrains-it seeks to block-anybody else from building a network in competition and it trashes perfectly viable existing infrastructure. There is no dispute that fixed line competition in Australia needs to be improved and the way to do that is to separate Telstra. That is our policy. That is the Labor government’s policy. There is no difference between the parties on that core point. Nor is there any dispute that broadband infrastructure needs to be improved. The dispute is about this particular plan, which is extraordinarily wasteful and profligate and very, very badly thought through. priation Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011 by acknowledging the heart breaking situation that is now developing in New Zealand, our nearest neighbour. Clearly New Zealand has a very special relationship with this country. The word ANZAC means much to many, whether they be young or old. It is a special relationship, but now we see our friends in New Zealand in a very special time of need. My deepest condolences go to the families who have lost a life. To all the workers who are working so tirelessly over there, including a number of Australians who have been sent over there in the last 24 hours: I wish them well in their endeavours and I hope we recover more people and rescue lives as quickly as possible. This is another significant time that we in this parliament should be reflecting on, just as we did on the floods in Queensland, the bushfires in Victoria and other disasters, because I think the Prime Minister got it right when she said New Zealand is a family to us. I am happy to participate in this debate. I want to make some comments about being elected as the member for Fowler. As I was just saying to my colleague the member for Parramatta, Fowler is a very new electorate for me. I need to work very hard to ensure that people understand not only that they have access to me but also that I am in tune and responsive to the needs of that particular community. Things which are very striking out there include the strength of community spirit in Fowler, which has been tested many times. There was a threat to local libraries, with a council decision aimed at closing the local libraries. Also, people MAIN COMMITTEE",211,Appropriation Bill No 4 2010 2011
253,Mr Hayes (Fowler) (12.01 Pm),"I would like to start my speech in the debate on Approcame together in a very difficult time to raise money for flood victims-and I know you were in the chair, Madam Deputy Speaker, when I spoke on the condolence motion about the Queensland flood appeal. There is also the spirit I see in the most multicultural electorate in the country-if we can believe the ABS statistics-particularly in various associations for the elderly and others that not only support the preservation of traditions and culture but also have a very clear support for the ongoing education of people in the electorate at large. It has been a personal objective of mine to provide as much assistance as possible to the community to achieve these goals by providing information, whether it be on funding or grants as they come forward from time to time, using our database for those organisations as opposed to people having to get out there and read the Herald to determine when and where those opportunities lie. I think it is a role for every one of us in this parliament to go out and help those organisations in our communities that do good work in our community, in effect making their work easier by using what facilities we might have. I have always strived to maintain my promise to the electorate, whether that be my former electorate of Werriwa or my current electorate of Fowler, to be as available as possible, particularly for those in most need. I have found it helpful more recently to deliver a permanent outreach program, to complement what we do with mobile offices. I will talk about that a little later. I have spoken about the threat to such institutions as local libraries. I could not believe this, but it is true-fortunately, we had a debate in private members’ business on this issue only this week: the Liberal and independent councillors on Liverpool City Council took a decision to close local libraries. Local libraries very much go to the cohesion of our community. They are not just repositories of books, they are not just places where you can go to have meetings, where people can gather; but they are places where people can go and use the internet. A lot of people use our library facilities to apply for jobs online. We have a lot of young people, including people like Ian McNamara, who came from Miller, who gained his love of computers at the local library and has gone on to become a computer engineer. It just staggers me that a group of councillors would take a view such that that sort of rationalisation could just go through on a balance sheet, and they could move to close local libraries. It took many months of strong campaigning by local residents-with the support, obviously, of Labor councillors; and I would also pay regard to the state member, Paul Lynch, who supported the local campaign-to have those Liberal councillors revisit their decision on the first council meeting this year. The result, in my humble opinion, was a victory for common sense. It demonstrated what a community can do through cooperation, through commitment and through a genuine belief in common sense itself. The individual stories that rose out of that battle show the spirit of the community. I commend the members of my community for standing up and fighting this battle, not only for every kid to be able to access books, in an academic and in a social way, but also to have those facilities retained and made available for all members of our community. It is just so essential. We often talk in here about the development of the love of reading, and yet we see that there are bureaucrats out there who think that is something we can trade off. If we are here, and we are committed to advancing our communities into the future, one of the things we should never attack is the library. Interestingly, local libraries were recently aided by the introduction of a new program which is going to help with greater accessibility for the disabled. Again, in Western Sydney we are overly represented-only because of land values-by MAIN COMMITTEE families with disabilities. I was happy to be able to draw to the attention of not only the Liverpool council but the Fairfield council-and, quite frankly, anyone who wanted to listenthat they could access further Commonwealth moneys to help with the accessibility of their library space for people with disabilities. Again, that goes to what all modern societies should be looking at: a bigger role and greater undertakings with respect to inclusion. The community of the electorate of Fowler, in recent times, has also confirmed for me a passion for education. Fowler is an outer metropolitan seat. It is the most multicultural seat in the country. We have a very strong enclave of the Vietnamese people. They have only been here for the last 35 years-since the fall of Saigon. I was very happy to attend the Tet festival, the Vietnamese New Year festival. The highlight of that was making presentations to each of the kids who scored in excess of 99 per cent in the HSC. There were about 35 kids all up. I saw a passion for education and the drive to achieve not only in these commendable young individuals but also in their parents. Some of the parents whom I spoke to told me that they work two jobs in order to ensure that their kids have the very best education. That is very positive from a group who would ordinarily be referred to as ‘new Australians’. The amount of emphasis that they put on education is because they know that the key to success in our vibrant land is a good education. They are ensuring that their children participate. The other thing that is pretty interesting, given the demographics of the area that I represent, is that the majority of schools have very active P&Cs. The parents take a very active role in supporting not only their own children’s education but the school and the teachers. That was something that I was very interested to see on display out in Western Sydney. The principals and the teaching staff at those schools are the fundamental learning resources to establish the children’s futures. I know them to be very professional and very committed. I would like to mention one, Beth Goodwin. She is the principal of Cabramatta High School. She was also named the Fairfield Citizen of the Year. Beth does not live in that municipality-I happen to know where she lives, which is in Campbelltown. I get to see what this woman does at school and at every other form of social event designed to include young people in our vast and changing community. She is in there in many different ways, such as through sponsoring or encouraging the participation of young people, whether through Rotary events or other events to do with social inclusion. She plays an extraordinary role. I had the opportunity to meet with a couple of young people who recently graduated from university but who had been taught by her. One of the young fellows-and I cannot remember whether he was Vietnamese or Cambodian-said that Miss Goodwin gave him his thirst for education and learning. This young man is going to go on and make a significant positive impact in the world that we live. Those are good stories. We should be celebrating, when we get the opportunity, the people who make a difference in our communities. Beth is one of those, so I very much welcome her being named Citizen of the Year. That recognises her passion for education. She brings the world to her students. She is to be highly commended. It is something that we should be encouraging. This reward is well deserved for her contribution to education and her commitment to the region. While on that, I would like to mention another prominent person. I know her very well, and I should not refer to her age. She retired as a teacher many years back, Norma Shelley. She is better known locally as Auntie Norma. She is an Aboriginal elder and former teacher. I see this woman participate in various events, whether they are Aboriginal specific, about incluMAIN COMMITTEE sion, about education or in the interests of the development of young people in outer metropolitan Sydney. Her hard work in representing and fighting for the rights of the local Aboriginal community is to be commended. Her role in championing the cause of young people has been tremendous. In our community, the pace of life is probably no different than anywhere else. Everyone has other things to do. People need second jobs to pay their mortgages. It is very good to have someone there who has a firm grasp on reality and who, when decisions need to be made, can take the bull by the horns and stand up and make them. I thank Norma for her years. She just demonstrates so much energy and so much commitment. We in the community are very lucky. I understand how lucky I am as a member of parliament to have people like that in my community to help do good work. The general philosophy I had when I came into this parliament was not to get out there and promise things that you know you cannot deliver or try to be all things to all people. I took the view that I should, in the first instance, identify those people who make a difference in their community and try to work with them to help them do their jobs better. I am very fortunate I have identified two. They make such a tremendous difference themselves, but I know it is only two of many. My staff will not be happy because, I suspect, that I have departed very much from what they want me to talk about. But I just want to say that, from a local member’s perspective, one of the best things we can do is to go out of our way not only to learn from our communities but to actually understand those people who do make a difference and to spend our time, effort and resources helping them, regardless of politics. tion bills Nos3 and 4, I stood here and said that the government were going to seek more money for failed policy and they did. They came into this place this time last year and they sought an extra $98 million in the immigration portfolio for offshore asylum seeker management-an extra $98 million. The actual budget for that year was $124, 981,000. They came here in February and asked for almost a doubling of that budget. It did not stop there because, by the end of that year, not only had they spent the $98 million but they had spent an additional $69 million, more than double what they had spent that year. At that time. I said that these were the costs of failed policy. At that time, when the government put their first budget together, in 2009-10, the estimated costs for that year were $125 million. At that time, since the failure of the government’s policies, 19 boats and 707 people have arrived. When I stood in this place in February last year, when the government were asking for more money, around 70 boats had arrived. There is a terrible sense of deja vu here because, here we are again, the government having already budgeted at the beginning of this year for $460 million, they have come back into this place on operating costs alone and they are now asking for another $290 million. And 208 boats have arrived. There is a pattern here of failed policy. The government continue to persist with policies that have failed and they keep coming into this place and asking for more money to pay for those failures. Those are the facts that are before this parliament and that is the question being put to this parliament. The government say, ‘We won’t change the policies, we can’t change our failures, so just give us more money to pay for these failures.’ By the end of this year I guarantee that they will not have spent $760 million which, by the way, is more than seven times the amount the government MAIN COMMITTEE",214,Appropriation Bill No 4 2010 2011
254,Mr Morrison (Cook) (12.16 Pm),"This time last year, when we considered appropriawere spending on this matter when they were first elected. It will be more than that, more boats will come and no changes will be made to policy. I oppose the government’s policy in this area, because it has failed. It is a policy which I oppose. That opposition will not change until the government changes their policy to things that work. Interestingly, this time last year when I was engaged in this very same debate, when I raised the issues of cost in this chamber, the member for Longman-who, I note, is no longer here-called me a racist. This time last year I raised issues of cost. I find it a chilling echo of a year ago: when I continue to raise issues of cost the government cast all sorts of slurs. My comments on cost continue. Here we are back at groundhog day, because the cost is not changing and the government’s policies are not changing. Here they find themselves throwing the same old insults without any proof or any ability to substantiate anything they have claimed. Things have been repudiated and here we have a government that are trying to run away from their own failures. Let us go through those failures. Those failures to date have seen 10,250 people arrive on their watch on 208 boats. Two of those boats included SIEV36, which was set alight and on which people were killed, and SIEV221, which was the most tragic of those cases as it crashed against the rocks of Christmas Island in December last year. There are other boats that have gone missing. In a speech last year I referred to one boat containing over 100 Afghanis who had left in the previous October and their families never heard from them again. At least 220 people, we know, have perished on these voyages. Yet the government still have not changed their policies. The costs continue to rise at all levels both in human terms and in financial terms. I oppose the government on their policies because they are not effective in discouraging people from taking these journeys that lead to their most tragic loss. I oppose the government on these policies because, since the government came to office, the number of special humanitarian visas that have been provided to offshore applicants in our program has fallen from one in three to one in five. That is around 1,500 fewer places for that special humanitarian program in this year alone. These are the impacts of failed policies. I know the government do not want to focus on their failures. I know the government want to cause every distraction they can because they do not want to sit in this place and hear me remind them on a daily basis of their failures. Their failures in the area of border protection are manifest. They can throw whatever they like at me, but this opposition to their failed policies on border protection will continue. It will continue until they are changed. As I look at the specific appropriations in these bills, I see that in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011 there is $290 million extra for the running costs in the blow-out this year of offshore asylum seeker management. In Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011, there is $152.8 million in additional capital expenditure for the establishment of the Northam detention centre and the Inverbrackie detention centre, which was previously announced by the government. It is interesting what you find when you do your homework in this place. A statement by Senator Evans-and I will seek to table this document at the end of my remarks-on 8 February 2008 said this: The Pacific solution was a cynical, costly and ultimately unsuccessful exercise introduced on the eve of a federal election by the Howard government. MAIN COMMITTEE This is how much he said the entire program cost-$289 million. That is less than what the government are asking for in this appropriation for their blow-out just this year. This cost that the minister at the time referred to was not just for a six-month period. This cost of $289 million was for between September 2001 and June 2007 to run the Nauru and Manus OPCs. It cost less to run the Pacific solution for almost six years, on the government’s own statement, than what the government are asking for in this appropriation bill to cover the cost of their own policy failures in less than a six-month period. That is an indictment of the government in their own terms. If they think $289 million to put in place a policy that worked is a waste of money, I would like to know what the cost blow-out of the government is in their own terms, using their own criteria. Let us think about what these have been. In May 2009, in the budget for the following financial year, they estimated forward costs of $124 million for that year, $113 million for the following year, $110 million for the 2011-12 year and $106 million for the 2012-13 year. This is how the record now reads in terms of the most recent additional estimates published by this government: in the year they were going to spend $125 million-that is, last year-they spent $292 million, and in the year they said they were going to spend $113 million-that is, this year-they are going to spend, at this stage, $761 million. But guess what? They say, in their additional estimates, that next year the costs are going to fall by half a billion dollars. This government is saying that next financial year-it is not that far away; it is four months away-the costs in this budget for their failed border protection policies are going to fall by half a billion dollars. Such is going to be the success of their not changing their policies that they are going to continue to keep costs at that level for the next three years. What that means is that, on their own additional estimates figures, they have already blown out the budget by over $1 billion. If costs stay at least where they are forecast to stay this year, then over the next three years that is going to cost another $1.5 billion-and that is just running costs; I have not even started talking about capital. That is on top of the $290 million they are asking from this parliament today. It is worth observing that that blow-out over the next three years plus the blowout they are asking for in this document alone are more than the funds they intend to raise from the flood levy through the legislation that they have brought into this parliament. This is a government whose failings on this level know no parallel. This is a government that does not want to hear and does not want the Australian people to hear the scale of its failures. The Australian people can rely on one thing, and that is that this is an opposition that is not easily intimidated. We have an opposition leader in this country who is not easily intimidated. There is a shadow minister for immigration and citizenship, supported by my colleagues, who will not be intimidated into refraining from holding this government to account for its failures in border protection. This is a government that seems to think it can make decisions that are above public scrutiny. Well, the Australian people do not think that and the opposition does not think that. As uncomfortable as it is for the government to hear me come into this place day in, day out; week in, week out; month in, month out; and year in, year out, I will be loud and clear in saying that this government’s border protection policies have failed. That failure is on this government’s head. It is there in the costs and it is there in the human tragedy that has occurred as a result of people smugglers that the government has been unable to stop with its MAIN COMMITTEE own policies. The government’s only reaction is to come into this place and repeat malicious gossip in a way that tries to distract attention from its own failures. Government members interjectingsilence. am going to be here day in, day out, holding them to account for the sake of the Australian people. Government members interjectingmember for Longman said last year when he called me a racist in this chamber for having this exact same debate on costs. Today, I have the members opposite accusing me again because they do not want to hear the cost. Ms Owens-Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: nobody on this side made those remarks. The member for Cook is well and truly extrapolating. Ms Owens-You said we were embarrassed! withdrawn? Ms Owens-Yes, I am. posite said I should be embarrassed. IfI have misheard that then I have misheard that. IfI have misheard that then I withdraw, and I would also ask them to confirm that they do not think I should be embarrassed. subject because the costs and the appropriation sought in this bill speak for themselves. They speak of manifest failure. They speak of a government that simply cannot admit the truth of its own failures. I am going to go back to the issue of the Pacific solution and at the end of my remarks I will also seek leave to table a Senate question of February 2002 that was answered on notice. The answer goes into precise detail of the cost of the Pacific solution. It was part of a report by Senator Cook into these matters some years ago. It shows that the establishment and provision of infrastructure costs at Nauru and Manus Island-the Pacific solution-was a grand total of $20 million. Northam is costing eight times that much. I have come into this place again today to talk about the failures of this government. I have talked about the cost of the failures of this government. The government refuses to answer to the costs that they have incurred and continue to seek from the Australian people on these matters. This opposition and this shadow minister will not shirk from continuing to hold this government to account on these matters. MAIN COMMITTEE",217,Appropriation Bill No 4 2010 2011

263,Mr Morrison,"They are very touchy on this topic, and they should be touchy on thisI will finish on this remark: one of the reasons we have such a big problem in our detention network-over 6,300 people-is the asylum freeze introduced by this government against Afghan and Sri Lankan asylum seekers and the suspension of their claims. If the government wants to look at a discriminatory policy on immigration, this is the only one I am aware of that has been introduced into this parliament, and it was by this government. I seek leave to table the documents. Leave granted. Ms OWENS (Parramatta) (12.31 pm)-I was going to speak on another matter in relation to the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011 but that contribution by the member for Cook has led me in a different direction. I will start by saying first that I would be delighted if one aspect of what the member for Cook was saying was true, which is, that a country the size of Australia, through its policy on our treatment of asylum seekers, could somehow stop 46 million people from moving around the world-if we were so powerful that our policy in this one area would stop the number of refugees in the world from rising as it has in the last three or four years from 15 million to 46 million. Countries all around the world are experiencing the same surge in arrivals as we are-in fact, greater surges than we are. The US and France and Europe are receiving many more. The surge is far greater there than it is here. If the member for Cook is suggesting that those surges are actually caused by Australia’s policy, that is a very weird assertion. The idea that Australia’s policy somehow caused the increase in violence that caused massive numbers of people to flee Sri Lanka or massive numbers to flee Afghanistan is quite absurd. If you look at the history of people arriving by boat, consider the Vietnamese, for example, where millions of people fled Vietnam, and around 800,000 are estimated to have drowned fleeing Vietnam. Every country on the way was pushing people back out to sea. They all had policies of pushing the boats back out to sea and yet the people still came because they fled circumstances of certain death. When people flee what they believe is certain death they flee to somewhere. It is really simple. As many as 1.8 million Afghanis have fled into Pakistan, 1.2 million have fled into Syria and three million have fled into Iran. Enormous numbers of people have been displaced and are fleeing what they believe is certain death. So the idea that our policy could somehow stop that is absurd. When people flee certain death they flee to somewhere. We in Australia receive by boat a very, very small number of people relative to those fleeing in the world. When you look at the cycle of arrivals in Australia, every time there is a great outbreak of war or civil unrest around the world the numbers increase, and they increase here as well. They increased for Vietnam, they increased around the year 2000 with the Afghanistan war and they decreased significantly following the outbreak of what we thought was peace in Afghanistan, all around the world including in Australia. So to assume that somehow, as the member for Cook seems to suggest, Australia with its humane treatment of asylum seekers could actually prevent people from fleeing from certain death is quite absurd. I want to talk too about the response we saw last week to the government’s decision to fly asylum seekers to the funerals in Sydney, because we have heard some of the comments by the member for Cook and he has not admitted at this stage that he was wrong in those statements, just that he made them on the wrong day. It was an astonishing thing for me, and it MAIN COMMITTEE showed an extraordinary ignorance of the plight of the people that we are talking about when we are talking about asylum seekers. In Australia-many of us gratefully-have never experienced the kinds of life experiences that many of our migrants, particularly our refugees, have experienced. I have a lot of them in my electorate, and the stories I hear are appalling. I have a couple who were forcibly separated from their two-year-old child and do not know where she is. She is in the Congo somewhere. I have a 24-year-old boy who arrived in Australia with his six younger brothers and sisters. He has put them all through university or high school. He is now 24. He never tells me where his parents are, but I assume that somewhere along the way he lost them. They are dreadful stories. We in Australia saw the plight of a young boy who lost his parents in that dreadful sinking on Christmas Island, and we were rightly moved. But I think what we need to understand as people is that, for every one of those stories that we are now aware of that happened on Christmas Island, there are many, many stories of circumstances and experiences that are appalling and that have occurred before the people came to Australia. That is why they fled. They fled because they had to pick up their sister’s body after she had been tortured and they had to pay for it. They fled because their entire families are dead and they are the only one left-appalling circumstances; things that we do not even want to think about. We know what happened once that young boy reached Australia and we feel for him, but surely we did not need to see him crying at a funeral in order to feel compassion for his plight. Surely we should have felt compassion before that, and surely we should feel some compassion for what people are going through around the world and play our very small part in adhering to our responsibilities under the UN convention. We take and have been taking around 12,000 or 13,000 people a year under the humanitarian program for quite some time. This is not new. In fact, I think the first time we did it was in about 1958, when we took some refugees from Europe after the Second World War. It was about the same number, about 12,000, and we were a much, much smaller country then. We have been doing it for a long, long time and it has proven to be, I think, a very good thing for us. We have within our community through our refugee program, but also through our large migration program, contact with the world. We actually have the world in us. We have bright, shining threads that link us to cultures that are thousands of years old where people have come to the same conclusions about building better lives, becoming better people and raising families via different paths. This is a remarkable thing that we have in our country. In my community of Parramatta, I am continually astonished at how I can be talking to a person that I have known for ages-I have not known he was of Hindu faith but have known him for ages; I have worked with him; I have ridden my bike with him-and suddenly I will say something and he will come out with something which philosophically just takes a slightly different angle to get to the same result. I said to someone the other day, ‘Oh, I was terribly weak on my bike this morning,’ and he said, ‘Failure leads to success,’ in a very typically Hindu way, and then three other people came in and said very similar things. I have absolute delight in my community when I meet people who have lived lives that have run parallel to mine. One of the great human tragedies, in many ways, is that we can only live one life. I know that some people in my community believe that we can live more than that, but I believe we live one. Maybe, if you are lucky in that life, you can become good at one thing. Maybe you MAIN COMMITTEE can become knowledgeable at one thing. Maybe you can learn to live within a certain cultural framework or a certain religious framework well in one lifetime. But what a great gift it is that we have in our community people who have experienced those paths from different perspectives. We, as members of parliament, would all know that we have an opportunity that very few people in Australia have-which is to look in those windows, to be invited into the families, to the weddings, the festivals, the temples and the mosques and to share just a tiny glimpse of the wealth of the world, the philosophy, the approaches to self-improvement and the approach to life ever after. It is all here in our community and it is one of the great things that makes us strong. I wanted when I first came in here today to refer back to something I said in my first speech. I think it is quite topical here today. I said: One of the great strengths of Parramatta is its rich cultural diversity. Our multicultural society is something to be treasured. Parramatta is home to large Chinese, Indian, Arabic, Korean and Tamil communities, among others, and these communities have added to the economic and social capital of our region. In recent yearsand this was in 2004I have noticed a change in the language governments use in relation to multiculturalism, a trend towards the use of the word ‘tolerance’, or ‘tolerating difference’. For me, tolerance is the bare minimum. Tolerance is the level you set for the most racist elements in our society to lift them to the barest acceptable level. For the majority of open-minded, decent Australians, a celebration of diversity is the benchmark. That was said when I came into parliament and since that time. I have had six years of this great gift of being able to celebrate with communities in a way that most people simply do not. I know there are some people who are afraid that the world might be changing, and I suggest to them that the world that they think is coming, where we have different cultures within us, has actually been here for a long time. You can work alongside a person who might look like she is of Indian origin. She might be Hindu, she might be Buddhist or she might be Muslim, depending on which country she comes from. You probably do not know. I worked with a woman for two years before I knew she was Jewish. I worked with a man for two years before I knew he was a Muslim-he was Bosnian. I just did not know. We had good relationships, we worked well together and we socialised together, but I just did not know. Many Australians do not get to experience the way some of us do the incredible breadth and diversity of our own communities, and that is to be regretted. I urge my community members, if they feel uncomfortable with a certain group in the community, one group or another, to walk towards them, not away from them. Around 25 per cent of Australians were born overseas. That is the same proportion we had in 1901. It has been constant for 100 years. About 45 per cent of us have one parent born overseas. That has been constant for about 100 years. It goes up and down a little bit, but essentially it is the same. We are an extraordinary example of a country that has taken people in from around the world and built a society that actually works. It has not always been easy. There were times when I was younger where I heard people say some dreadful things. For example, I heard that people in my street had become terribly worried about the Greek Australians because they painted their houses blue and concreted their yards and property prices were going to plummet as a result of those blue houses. I was working in a factory when the Vietnamese boat MAIN COMMITTEE people first arrived and some of the people in the factory were incredibly worried that these Vietnamese refugees would take over economically because they worked too hard. We have all heard people say that our Chinese migrants’ children are getting too much tutoring. We all hear this fear. My Muslim community sometimes asks where the women can swim without the presence of men. In my community, it is not that much of a problem because the leagues club segregates its swimming pool. Parramatta Leagues Club takes women on one day and men on the other. I have told them all this, so a lot of the Muslim women in Parramatta go to the leagues club for their segregated swimming. Again, I suggest to anyone who is criticising the Muslim community for seeking segregation they could perhaps have a go at the Parramatta Leagues Club for doing the same thing. In fact, I know that quite a few leagues clubs do the same thing. I would say to people who look at what is happening overseas-who look at unrest in one country or another-that we in Australia have lived through this before. We have lived through circumstances where we have had people in Australia who in their homeland might have been in conflict who live together quite peacefully here. In my African community, for example, the women in particular get together on a regular basis across national boundaries, across language groups and across religions. Even where they may have been in conflict between north and south, they are now together and learning to live together in this country in a positive way. We in Australia will not be defined by what happens overseas. We in this country are defined by the way we treat each other-not by what happens overseas but by the way we treat each other. To pull away from a person because you fear that they might behave in a certain way is very foolish because it causes that person also to respond defensively. I think for our Muslim community the response after 2001 has caused many of them to reaffirm their approach to Islam perhaps even in a more fundamental way than they did in their homeland. I am aware of some girls who were not wearing the veil in their homeland but do now in Australia, largely as a response to that pushing away of that particular community. I again urge all my fellow Australians to have a very good and open look at some of the extraordinary wealth we have in our community and to remember when you see what is happening overseas that it does not happen here and we will be defined by our relationships with each other. debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 20102011. In the same vein as the previous two speakers, the issues I wish to raise are on migration. I spoke earlier in the House today and pointed out how we are dealing with probably the most disorganised and bad government since the Whitlam era. I am going to point out to this House today some examples of why this government is in such a mess. Not only is it in a mess financially and economically on things like the levy but it is in a mess on migration issues. As representatives, as we all are in this place, trying to represent people in our electorates and trying to do our job to help good, decent people wanting to come to this country, we are being thwarted by the dysfunctional, shambolic nature of the Labor Party’s reorganisation of their migration system. For example, since 2010 some of the changes in the ASCO codes to sas, stranded here because of the retrospective changes made on issues such as eligibility of MAIN COMMITTEE",220,Appropriation Bill No 4 2010 2011
264,Mr Randall (Canning) (12.46 Pm),"I am very pleased to make a contribution to theoccupations, the IELTS tests on English and not taking into account the nuances of occupations et cetera. As a result we have a whole lot of people here with families, people who have sold up overseas to come here to try and make a contribution to Australia as skilled migrants, and they have been stranded because of the Labor Party’s retrospective application since they have been in government. They are hanging on by their fingernails now and they are still making a mess of their migration system. One of the clearly and patently crazy and disturbing cases is a case in my electorate, where Vince and Teresa Borrello own a cheese company called Borrello Cheese, a very successful business set up by a couple of Italian migrants who have come here and set up a cheese business. It is a boutique cheese business and they sell bocconcinis around Perth to just about every outlet, because bocconcini is the flavour of the day along with other specialty cheeses. Vince was self-taught and he started up his cheese factory just off Thomas Road in Oakford in my electorate. He and his wife and his family are involved. The business has grown to such an extent that-how dare they?-they try to bring across a qualified and skilled cheese maker from Italy. Mr Pelati, who they have tried to bring to Australia, is not only qualified but someone who can help and mentor those who are all self-taught in Vince’s cheese factory. That is all fine. He ticks all the boxes. If you think that this is a partisan thing, anyone on the other side, Vince is trying to get help from a former Labor member of parliament, Nick Catania, who is now the mayor of Vincent in Western Australia. Vince is throwing his hands up in the air about the application of the migration rules in this case with Mr Pelati. His qualifications are right and his English is right, not to mention the fact that he is mentoring and training those on the ground. I got contacted by Vince. Vince is an enthusiastic and energetic sort of person. He started yelling down the phone at me one day about the fact that Mr Pelati was going to be thrown out of the country. Why? He had ticked all the boxes, as I said, to do with qualifications. They had advertised throughout Australia for a cheese maker before they went to the huge expense of bringing someone and their family here. They had to pay all the transport, medical and set-up costs for him because he came on a 457 visa. Then they were told that he was going to be thrown out of the country. When I got involved, the young case officer-I will not mention his name because he was probably only following instructions-had hit him with this letter saying, ‘Unless you deal with this, this man is going to be thrown out.’ SoI went to a senior case officer, Mr Robert Hardy, who is very good. Robert drilled down very quickly to what the problem was. Everything was fine except for one thing. The problem was that the Labor Party, because of their exposure to the unions, do not like skilled workers coming here on 457 visas, so they make it as tough as they can. member of parliament had to join a union to become a member of the Labor Party. And you are saying that the only way that a skilled worker from another country can advance is if he joins a union. Do not be so stupid. This bears out why this man is in trouble: it is because of your mentality, you cretin. Fancy saying that. I cannot believe that you would go down that track.

266,Mr Randall,"That is stupid. I expect better from you. We know that every Laborwill withdraw that comment. that this company-for whatever reason, and I know that this is happening throughout Australia in other businesses-must pay one per cent of their 2009-10 wages, which in this case is $8,890. This is extortion at its best. They do not need to do this. But somehow the Labor Party, because of influence from the union, have said, ‘We’re going to put a hurdle in front of you, which is that you have to pay one per cent of your wages into a training levy.’ Ms Rishworth interjectingwant to intervene they can rise and ask the member a question. Do not yell out across the chamber. will happen. Kingston should remember that if people want to ask a question they can rise and ask a question of the member. We will not yell at each other across the chamber. The member for Canning has the call. per cent levy on wages is ridiculous. You will see why in a moment. Anyway, he was willing to pay this $8,890 over and above everything else that he has paid to get this cheese maker into Australia. What happened is that Mr Hardy came back to me and said, ‘We can probably get this through if he agrees to pay two per cent.’ So now we have nearly $18,000 that Vincent Borrello has got to pay. When I asked why it was two per cent, they did not have any good reason why. They just said that two per cent might get them out of jail on this issue. So who do they pay it to? Not the immigration department. No, you have to find a registered training organisation to pay your two per cent levy to-that $18,000. Begrudgingly-Vince is filthy about the fact that he has to pay this extra when he had been shown in writing that it is one per cent-he is going to pay it. His business is going well enough to pay two per cent. But he cannot believe this arbitrary hit on him. He then goes out to get a receipt from a registered training organisation after he pays them this two per cent levy. He cannot find a registered training organisation in Australia that does cheese makers. That is the problem. So Vince is still fishing around Australia trying to find a registered training organisation. They think they have found one in Melbourne that he can give the money to. Can you imagine what this registered training organisation in Melbourne is going to say? ‘Why in the hell are we getting a cheque like this from a cheese maker in Western Australia?’ Vince would reply, ‘Oh, it is because that is the extortion I have to pay to get this man into this country under the rules of the Labor Party.’ It is shambolic and it is ridiculous. At the moment he is being held to ransom by this government’s policies. This government’s policies are absolutely out of whack. We hear a lot from the other side feigning their interest in humanitarian issues. I have a Mr Harati in my electorate, whose daughter, Ms Samira Harati, is stranded in Malaysia. It is a sad story.

273,Mr Randall,"Thank you, Deputy Speaker, for your support. The paying of this onedaughter. Mr Harati became an enemy of the state in Iran and as a result he had to leave the country. He came here on a humanitarian visa. His daughter and her husband left Iran with him and they ended up in Malaysia, where they made an offshore application. The Haratis cannot return to Iran. She became pregnant whilst in Malaysia. Her husband absconded with their child back to Iran and left her stranded there. She cannot go back to Iran and she cannot come to Australia. She has no means of support in Malaysia. The Haratis spent much of their time and much of their money going to Malaysia to try to help their daughter. So where is the humanitarianism of this government? I have written to two ministers about the Harati case. No help-‘just get in the queue’. When they came to my office and I told them that the minister said, ‘Just get in the queue,’ Mr Harati then said to me, ‘Well, why don’t I just get on a boat. Why don’t I pay a people smuggler $20,000 and get on a boat because then I will get a visa.’ We know that, of the 10,000 people who have come to this country by boat in the last 12 months or more, all of them bar about 160 have been given a visa-160 out of 10,000 have been sent back. And here we are with Samira Harati stranded in Malaysia. Where is the humanitarianism from this government? The migration policies of this government are absolutely skewed all over the place. I have a case of a Ms Thivanka Liyanage, a Sri Lankan resident, who is seeking a resident return visa. She was here and went to Murdoch University in Western Australia from where she graduated four years ago with a Bachelor of Commerce. She gained permanent Australian residency soon after that and remained in Australia for approximately six months before returning to Sri Lanka. Why? Because her father was involved in the civil war there. He was one of the special forces commanders. She was there to support her family through that conflict. She tried to return to Australia to re-ignite her residency and they have given her only a three-month visa-and her family is here. Talk about family reunions! It is just crazy. It is another one that has been put the minister and put on the too-hard shelf. To his credit, I had a meeting with the minister and he was very polite to me and said he would do what he could to help. But nothing has eventuated on all these cases that I am raising with you. There are so many other issues to consider. How about Francesco, an Italian who came out here on a visa with a business that requires his specialist skills. They have changed the ASCO. He has his wife and children here-they go to school-and they want to make Australia their home. They have changed the ASCO codes so that you can no longer have restaurant managers in the codes. Where is the fairness in that for him? Then there is Nono, a Portuguese man who is in the same position. He is trying to get support but hurdles have been put in front of him. He is a fantastic person but he will probably have to leave this country in about 12 months time because he does not fit the box of the Labor Party’s new policies on migration. I will never know why you are absolutely hell-bent on looking after the rights and the interests of those coming here unlawfully by boat but you ignore decent people who have applied properly through the right means. I will conclude by mentioning that I caught a taxi in Perth the other day and the driver was a guy called Kenny, a black African from Zimbabwe. Kenny came out here as a person who was involved in the flour-milling industry. He had the skills. He is now actually driving a taxi, and I cannot understand why he would rather drive a taxi than be a skilled flour miller. He said that he is so frustrated because he knows so many people in Zimbabwe who have problems with the Zimbabwe regime and they are in queuesMAIN COMMITTEE the member will have the right to continue for his remaining time when the debate is resumed. Sitting suspended from 1.00 pm to 4.00 pm 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011. The total amount of additional appropriation, reclassification, modification and changes as a result of the legislation is $2.3 billion. This is an important piece of legislation because it deals with a variety of different areas which I will address in the course of this bill-issues in relation to floods, particularly in my home state of Queensland, trade training centres, local and community infrastructure, and Active After-school Communities programs in a variety of different areas. It is important legislation in a number of ways. It provides $120.7 million to assist people in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia who have been adversely affected by the floods. I said this morning in a speech in the main chamber that my electorate of Blair has been really adversely affected. Its schools have been devastated. Bundamba, Ipswich State High School, Mount Tarampa, Patrick Estate, Ipswich East, Brassall State School-school after school has been affected. And road after road has been affected. I read out a whole list of roads and bridges this morning in the main chamberessential community infrastructure, which is vital to maintaining business, helping farmers get produce to the markets and getting children to school. I was speaking to the principal at Toogoolawah State School and she was telling me of the real trouble they are having in getting the kids in her school community to school because of bridges that were down and roads that needed to be fixed. So providing assistance in this way is so important. That is why I am absolutely aghast at the coalition’s attitude towards the flood levy. We have seen their response to appropriations, their response to savings and their response to a levy. We have seen an almost Shakespearean tragedy over on the other side since the budget. I can never forget the response of the Leader of the Opposition to the last budget. He said that the shadow Treasurer would provide information later about that-about the savings they were going to particularise. The shadow Treasurer passed the parcel to the member for Goldstein, the putative and aspiring shadow Treasurer, and he said that he would do it. Then they had the fiasco where no-one could provide the information. We remember how those press conferences all ended. And then we had the coalition’s costings in act 2 of the Shakespearean tragedy. We saw them in the last federal election alleging that they would comply with the Charter of Budget Honesty but not doing so, claiming that they would find $50 billion worth of savings and not being able to do it. We know that the Treasury and Department of Finance and Deregulation have found a $10.6 billion black hole in their costings. Now we are seeing the third act of the Shakespearean tragedy, something akin to Macbeth. We are seeing the savings soap opera mark 3 with respect to the opposition leader, who said it would be easy to find the savings, that he would have them ready in the next few days. A day went by, another day went by, a further day went by, a week went by, a fortnight went by and then I saw him on the Sunday program Insiders saying, ‘Gee, it is going to be tough to find those savings; it is going to be really hard.’ We saw an absolute and utter farce. This is their response to the flood levy, this is their response to appropriations and this is their response to budget integrity, probity and capacity.

275,Mr Neumann (Blair) (4.00 Pm),"I speak in support of the Appropriation Bill (No. 3)The opposition wheeled out all these deferrals, which they knew would happen year after year and would leave a black hole of $1 billion. Then they said, ‘We’re going to sacrifice our national interest with respect to Indonesian schools.’ John Howard knew fighting fundamentalism was important. He absolutely knew it was important. And the deputy leader of the Liberal Party knew it was important as well. They said, ‘We’re going to cut back on GP superclinics.’ GP superclinic performed magnificently in my electorate during the floods. Dr Simon Barnett and his crew ought to be congratulated for the work they did at the Ipswich evacuation centre and at the Riverview Neighbourhood House evacuation centre. Then they said, ‘We’re going to cut back on the BER’-$150 million deferred on the BER. If they had come to my electorate they would have known full well that the school halls we built through the BER in many cases acted as evacuation and recovery centres in places like Esk and Fernvale. We see this utter farce over on the other side-a Shakespearean tragedy of mouldering and smouldering ambition of different players. But the money that is being allocated will help my electorate, and I am very pleased to support it. The opposition claim that the trade training centres are useless and that they would get rid of them. Here we have funding allocated for non-government schools for trade training centres. In my electorate we have the Ipswich Trade Training Centre and three non-government schools: St Edmunds College, a Catholic school; Ipswich Girls’ Grammar School; and Ipswich Grammar School. There has been a $3 million investment, and you can see what is being done there for those kids. You can see the delight on their faces when you go there. It is a fantastic initiative in my seat. And then, of course, there is money being allocated for additional trade training centres. Staines Memorial College, another independent Christian school in my electorate, will also be getting money. You can see that funding is going to happen for that. The college is teaming up with other independent Christian schools to provide trade training centres that will help kids in the Ipswich and West Moreton region-a fantastic initiative being played out on the ground in Blair right now. There is funding here under our Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program opposed by those opposite-opposed forever. But if you went to places like Esk and saw the delight on the faces of those kids at the skate park or if you went to the Fernvale Indoor Sports Centre, funded with $2.1 million, and saw how important and popular that centre is, you would see how it helps those kids. If you saw the Ipswich Civic Centre, funded with $300,000 for an outdoor cafe and eatery, or if you saw what the funding meant to the Brisbane Valley rail trail, you would see how it helps as well. We are funding further assistance through this program: over $300,000 given to the Ipswich City Council for the Bell Street redevelopment, partnering with the states and with the local council, and for drainage and for the skate park up at Kilcoy. In these appropriation bills we are seeing funding for local community project needs under the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. Another important matter is the Australian Sports Commission’s provision of $21.6 million to continue the Active After-school Communities program until December 2011. This is a fantastic initiative. Over 3,200 schools are taking part in care services out of school hours each semester. In the six-year duration of this program 52,000 community personnel, including teachers and after-school carers, have had access to free training for community coaches, boosting the capacity and the capability of our sports system. Seeing traditionally non-active young people being involved in this program is terrific. Recently we had an announcement of another round of funding, and 14 outside-school-hours care services in Ipswich and the SomMAIN COMMITTEE erset region will get that funding-places like Coominya, Fernvale, Brassall, Rosewood, Walloon, Redbank Plains, Minden, Booval, Springfield, Karrabin, Kilcoy and Ipswich. Given that the Australian Bureau of Statistics says that one in five Australian children is overweight or obese, this is an important program that is being funded under this appropriations legislation. Two thousand new kits were announced as part of this program. We are seeing Playing for Life kits keeping Ipswich and Somerset kids active. These important kits from the Australian Sports Commission are being rolled out particularly under this budget announcement and the appropriations bills here. These 2,000 new kits represent a federal Labor government investment of $1.2 million in addition to the $43.5 million already invested under the Active AfterSchool Communities program. I have been to St Joseph’s Catholic School in my electorate to talk to the young people there and see the sorts of activities they do. It is a wonderful program, with additional funding under this appropriations legislation. The NBN is also mentioned in terms of modification of assistance. The NBN is important in my electorate. Why? Because in little country towns in my electorate there will be fibre to the premises. In towns like Minden, Fernvale, Esk, Coominya, Toogoolawah, Kilcoy and Lowood there will be fibre to the premises 100 times faster than the broadband speeds we have today. The Somerset region has been a broadband backwater. That is why the Somerset Region Business Alliance, not necessarily known as a body affiliated to the Australian Labor Party, has been so supportive of the NBN. There will be fibre to the premises for 93 per cent of Australians, with speeds of up to 100 megabits per second. Broadband is particularly important in the Western Corridor, as those members who represent rural and regional seats know. How do I know it is important? I have here a submission from 31 May 2010 on making the Western Corridor NBN ready, signed by the mayors of the Ipswich City Council, Toowoomba Regional Council, Lockyer Valley Regional Council, Somerset Regional Council and Scenic Rim Regional Council. It urges bringing the NBN to those areas. Two of those mayors represent cities in my electorate and three of them represent cities in the federal seats of Groom and Wright. All of them urge in the submission that the NBN be rolled out in the Western Corridor of South-East Queensland. All of these council areas are flood affected. The submission says: Support for the Western Corridor National Broadband Network’s submission has been provided by many leading business, educational and community organisations including the Queensland government owned corporation, Springfield Land Corporation, University of Queensland, University of Southern Queensland and Regional Development Australia. The councils-all of them, not just the ones in my electorate but the ones in the federal seat of Groom and the federal seat of Wright-say: The councils applaud the Australian government on the establishment of the National Broadband Network to implement this critical infrastructure. That is why it is important that in this appropriation money is given and assistance provided for the NBN. The NBN will make a big difference in those regional and rural areas in my electorate. That is why people who do not traditionally support the Australian Labor Party have been so supportive. I am very supportive of these appropriations bills because they include additional assistance which will flow through to my seat of Blair. I said this morning that the coalition has forgotten about the federal seat of Blair. In the last federal campaign they made zero MAIN COMMITTEE commitments in Blair and not one shadow minister visited it-not one. But the federal Labor government has 1,311 projects, worth $180 million, in my electorate under the Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan. There are 220 projects in 65 schools, totalling $108 million; 11 roads projects totalling $3.1 million; and 1,069 housing projects totalling $69.3 million. The coalition voted against all of them. That is the extent of the coalition’s concern for the people of Ipswich and the Somerset region and of their opposition to investment on roads, projects, housing and infrastructure. But the greatest example of all is their threat to close down the Ipswich Motorway upgrade. But the greatest example of all is their threat to close down the Ipswich Motorway upgrade. Only we have brought it in; only we support it. Even my opponent in the last election campaign could not bring himself to have the wit and wisdom to support it. The coalition is always against the people in my electorate because it is crystal clear from the way they vote in this House and the way they campaign back home that they do not support money going into South-East Queensland, particularly in the federal seat of Blair. electorate of Gilmore. Gilmore is now a very diverse electorate. Whereas prior to the last redistribution it could genuinely be described as regional, the addition of part of the urban area of the Shellharbour local government area has made the seat a challenging proposition. The seat is fundamentally made up of five urban clusters. There is Milton/Ulladulla at the southernmost point, the bay and basin area further northward, followed by the Nowra/Bomaderry area, Kiama, and then the southern parts of the Shellharbour LGA. Until the inclusion of the Shellharbour component, Gilmore could be described as occupying the lower socioeconomic demographic. The Shellharbour area was part of Throsby, which at one time was one of the safest Labor seats in Australia. Its population was aligned to the culture of the steel city of Wollongong from which most residents relied on their income. But life is in a constant state of flux. Nothing stays the same and certainly not forever. The demise of the once great steel industry has brought with it a subtle change, but a change nevertheless. As working-class areas have become gentrified, so have attitudes and expectations. When I was presented with the challenge of going into Labor heartland, I approached it with some trepidation. For a long time it was accepted that this area was hardcore Labor and that I was in for a pasting. Luckily, I did not let that colour my thinking and just went on doing what I did best. The result speaks for itself. What it did show me was that there is more at stake than just plain political affiliation. It showed me that people were not so rusted to their beliefs that they would not change their mind if a better argument were made. It showed me that if they were treated with honesty and respect, rather than being served dogma, they were at least prepared to listen. When I doorknocked, I can honestly say I cannot recall any instance of resentment at the fact that I was a Liberal. All were polite and civil even those that admitted that they would be voting Labor, despite saying they thought I was personally okay. Whilst things and areas change, deep down where it counts, the issues confronting individuals and families are the same from one place to another. People are worried about their family’s welfare, the rising cost of living, taxation, global warming, the future for their children, quality of life and whether or not they have a job. They feel the pinch when interest rates go up, when the price of petrol goes up and when they cannot get timely medical treatMAIN COMMITTEE",228,Anzsco Classifications Mean A Retrospective View Of People That Have Been Here On 457 Vi
276,Mrs Gash (Gilmore) (4.15 Pm),"Appropriation of funds is extremely important for myment. They worry about who will look after them in their august years and how they will cope if they lose their job. They worry about crime, juvenile delinquency and the fact that they often feel alienated from the mainstream of government. Many do not think their opinion matters and, given the shenanigans of the New South Wales Labor government over the course of the last 16 years, I am not surprised. They hate talking to recorded messages and they hate anyone who jumps the queue. In short, regardless of where they live, they are just like you and me. During the 2010 federal campaign, I secured a number of promises for initiatives that would bring benefit to specific areas. I want to list some. They included $2.6 million for a Shoalhaven headspace site, $1 million for the Kiama Harbour upgrades, $35 million for a cancer care centre equipped with a linear accelerator and $20 million for the Princes Highway. There was $10 million for the Shellharbour marina, $1 million for CCTV cameras, $25 million for an Australian technical college and the list goes on. Unfortunately, most have had to be placed on the backburner for a better day-I hope we will be in government soon. I ask the residents to try to remember just what their Labor counterpart actually did promise for Gilmore. A GP superclinic was promised for last December if Labor came into government and still we have nothing-not even on the drawing board. I acknowledge the former Prime Minister’s promise of a cancer care clinic for the Shoalhaven and a commitment to the GP superclinic. I am not going to deny they will be welcome, especially in light of the chronic parlous state of local health services. The linear accelerator is a subject that has been well canvassed by my state colleague, Shelley Hancock, member for South Coast, who has also described the gradual deteriorating decline in service standards in regional areas. The direction I am going in is to seek better and more opportunities for the people of Gilmore, no matter their political inclination, but this will not be achieved by imposing more taxes on the Australian people, particularly in Gilmore. I have long been an advocate of the need to improve accessibility to education and encourage young people to pursue learning for their own benefit. There is nothing more liberating than an education. I know, because I was forced to leave school when I was 15. I will again be pursuing the realisation of the commitments I made in seeking re-election last year, albeit from another direction. With an imminent change of government in New South Wales things will change, hopefully for the better. We might now begin to see funding for projects we know are necessary for the social and economic good of the community. It has been shown that a prosperous community is better placed to weather uncertainties than one that is in the red. What better example than Australia’s ability to weather the worse of the global financial crisis, not because of the $900 handouts, the failed pink batts or the school BER programs, but because the Howard government left a surplus and a Future Fund-now all, sadly, gone. I want more for all the extended communities within Gilmore. The people of Shellharbour and surrounds are confronting a local economy less and less dependent on the steel industry. Their economy is evolving from a reliance on manufacturing to a reliance on other industries, some yet to be identified. The greater Wollongong area we see today will not be the same in 10 years time and we need to prepare for the change. The same applies southward but perhaps in a slightly different direction. With the change of government, I lament some of the things that have been let go, things like the principle of mutual obligation, which required a token contribution from individuals MAIN COMMITTEE who accepted unemployment benefits. This is what Work for the Dole was all about-trying to resurrect the notion that the world does not owe you a living and, in the process, benefiting local communities. What is wrong with trying to discourage a free, handout mentality? There are many out there who see unconditional social security payments as their natural right, an entitlement that is sacrosanct. I also lament the demise of area consultative committees. ACCs were hugely successful. They delivered many benefits to Gilmore during the life of the Howard government. The ACCs had the ability to coordinate community interests and bring together disparate interests and, most importantly, to deliver the goods. They were truly focused on the community in which they were situated. The government’s alternative model is a shadow of the ACC model. Regional development offices, whilst seemingly pretending to do what ACCs did, in fact, do not. They cover a wider area, are less connected with the community and, so far, have remained comparatively invisible. The new beast has proved to be disappointing. Bring back the ACCs is what I say. The demise of the Green Corps has been in a similar vein, with its replacement model more a gesture than a practical response. I cannot remember any projects completed under this government that have assisted the community. Where a new Green Corps project was being announced almost quarterly by the former coalition government, I am hard-pressed to remember when a project under the new regime was last announced. I am also concerned at the backslide of defence contracts. There is now talk of the MRH90 helicopter replacement program being axed, yet the previous two Labor defence ministers guaranteed me that the program would be implemented to the benefit of HMAS Albatross. Should this not happen, it will have a severe impact on the prospects of the defence industries in and around Nowra. Defence is a huge contributor to the local economy and any diminution of its activities will be keenly felt. If the MRH90 is to go then it is imperative the government does all it can to fill the vacuum it creates in Gilmore. Procurement tenders are long and expensive and the risk of losing trained, qualified staff is great. The former coalition government’s Investing in Our Schools Program recognised the importance of infrastructure investment. This enormously successful scheme provided over $1.2 billion dollars directly to schools. Crucially, Investing in Our Schools also recognised that it is the people on the ground, the school communities themselves, who are best placed to decide what is needed and how to get it done. In contrast, Labor’s BER rip-off completely ignored schools. In typical Labor style, Julia Gillard’s school halls program told schools what they would get and did not even bother to ask what was needed. Labor’s system gave taxpayers’ money directly to state education department bureaucrats-who are not accountable and are not construction experts. No thought was given to local contractors, who have been doing it tough. Under the current system, government schools have no incentive to save, as money not spent at the school is reclaimed by the state governments. Labor’s addiction to bureaucracy, combined with Labor’s ‘We know what is best for you’ attitude has prevented parents, students and schools getting value for money. That same dynamic has struck the government’s public housing projects. In the Shoalhaven and the Illawarra, subcontractors working on the building sites have been left out of pocket following the collapse of the prime contractors retained by the government-all out-of-area contractors. Many local tradesmen are owed thousands and are unlikely to get anything back. MAIN COMMITTEE It is a failure of adequate oversight when the contracts were let and afterwards, adding to the litany of waste of the BER projects. Talk about promising so much and delivering so little. What happened to the big-ticket item promising to take over public hospitals? It has been massively diluted to warrant being described as a non-event. So too the carbon tax. In August of last year, the Prime Minister emphatically ruled out the introduction of a carbon tax. Under the government I leadshe saidno carbon tax. Guess what? It is back on the books and with it sky rocketing electricity and other energy bills and the cost of living generally, something I am sure a lot of Australians are looking forward to with bated breath! I think not. GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch also had a short life, as if they were ever a realistic proposition. They also promised not to change the Baby Bonus eligibility, a promise that had a life span of less than a year. They said the same thing about health insurance, and that met with the same fate. In the same vein as GroceryWatch and FuelWatch, the idiotic concept of a peoples’ assembly on the issue of climate change. Talk about a ‘minime’ version of the 2020 Summit talkfest that went nowhere. I am waiting for their much-vaunted trade centres to be delivered. The previous speaker spoke about that. He is lucky he has a Labor seat, I suppose. But they seem to have slid into the same time frame of delivery as the NBN scheme. Vincentia High School was promised a trade centre just after the election. Still zip-nothing, not even tenders called. At least when they do call tenders I hope they look at local tenders. Let us talk about the NBN scheme. When they rolled out the pilot program in the Kiama/Minnamurra area everyone thought it would be underground. Yes, locals thought that would be great. At first it started out that way. The trenches were dug, then filled and then overhead cables started to appear. Extra steel posts were erected on houses that already had the trenches dug, and large, thick, black cables, spreading three or four houses from the one poll were erected. So what is going on? Like the cheque that is in the mail, the GP superclinics are on the way, but I am not holding my breath. But most of all, I lament the frittering away of a surplus that took ten years to build and a single year to expend. Whilst the necessity for spending as a stimulus at the time cannot be denied, the means by which this has been done and the extent is also disappointing. The waste and mismanagement surrounding recent stimulus spending projects is a worrying concern. So too the massive investment in an NBN that could well be made redundant before it is even delivered. The point is that this huge commitment of taxpayer funded resources has effectively hobbled the room we had to move in the future. Despite the government’s continued reiteration of its commitment to bring the budget to surplus in three years, few believe it and they have good grounds for those doubts. The litany of failed or broken promises, underperformance or just plain waste by this government is extensive and well known. They have an unenviable track record and any serious punter cannot ignore such a track record when new promises are wheeled out. In comparison, some of the achievements of the Howard government that set the stage for a prosperous and secure Australia cannot be allowed to be forgotten. MAIN COMMITTEE The commitments I subscribed to in the election campaign of 2010 remain valid today and I reiterate my commitment in pursuing them-a total of $104 million compared to the two promises my Labor counterpart made and has still not delivered. However, I am encouraged with the prospect of a new coalition government in New South Wales. Many of these commitments require a bipartisan and cooperative relationship, which was utterly absent during the last 16 years under Labor. They simply predicated most of their decisions on politics unless it suited them to do otherwise. There are examples, some of which I have alluded to previously, where the interests of the community took a back seat to politics-the North Nowra Link Road and Princes Highway are but two shining examples in Gilmore. In fact, my Labor opponent in last year’s campaign stated clearly that the Princes Highway was not important to the residents of Gilmore. How many more funerals do we have to have before there is a change of mindset? In the context of habitually ignoring your constituents, the New South Wales planning minister wants to urbanise the Killalea State Park in Shellharbour, also in my electorate. For a government that once railed against the evils of urban sprawl, it is revealed they are now its keenest advocates. The same party also railed against the evils of coastal development, transferring many planning powers to the New South Wales Department of Planning, accusing coastal councils of planning laxness. Emerging in this government is a similar and patent want of conviction, direction and concern for the interests of all Australians, not just their select few. It is a sad state of affairs and it is painful to watch billions of dollars of taxpayer’s money going to waste at the altar of political expediency. My pledge is to continue working hard to ensure the best outcomes for the future of Gilmore and to pursue the benefits that many in the cities have taken for granted and that we in country Australia do not have. I want to see this country headed by a Prime Minister who is elected by the people not selected by Labor powerbrokers. 2010-2011 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011. I have a particular interest in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) as it includes an appropriation for the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations of $10.1 million to introduce the Fair Entitlements Guarantee. The Fair Entitlements Guarantee will replace the existing General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, much better known as GEERS, of which I have been critical for many years due to its shortcomings when dealing with employee entitlements. This measure will deliver on Labor’s election commitment to improve workers entitlements protections in the event of the financial collapse of their employer, something which over the years we have seen happen far too many times. It has certainly happened in my electorate of Deakin in the time that I have been the member. It is a very stressful and trying time for workers in companies to find that suddenly they have no money in that week’s pay but not only that they have no annual leave, no long service leave entitlements and no redundancy payout whilst the company goes through the process of being wound up. This certainly happened with two local employers in Mitcham, where my office is in the electorate of Deakin, and it dragged on for an awfully long time. Workers had to rely on local charities like the Salvation Army to get through that period of time. Although there needs to be changes above and beyond the coverage of the Fair Entitlement Guarantee, what it does cover is of great benefit to workers in that situation. MAIN COMMITTEE",231,Anzsco Classifications Mean A Retrospective View Of People That Have Been Here On 457 Vi
277,Mr Symon (Deakin) (4.30 Pm),"I speak in support of the Appropriation Bill (No. 3)This allocation of $10.1 million will extend current entitlements to include redundancy pay, up to a maximum of four weeks for each year of service whereas currently the maximum is only 16 weeks in total under GEERS. When those local employees were thrown out of their jobs, there were people that had worked at the one company for 20 years. Although they qualified for a GEERS payout, 16 weeks of redundancy pay for 20 years of service is something way below any acceptable community standard. On 25 July last year the Gillard government committed to taking strong action to ensure all employees receive their entitlements, including superannuation, if their employer went bust. As I have said, GEERS did not cover many things and, although it was better than nothing, this is a much bigger step on that path. The Howard government GEER Scheme left workers in many cases tens of thousands of dollars worse off not only in current entitlements but in prospective entitlements. To give you an example, a worker who had worked at the same factory for 20 years, as I have already spoken about, with an annual income of $65,000 and an award entitlement to three weeks of redundancy pay for each year of service is entitled to a total redundancy benefit of $75,000 under that industrial instrument. Under GEERS a worker with that length of service would only be guaranteed their 16 weeks redundancy payment of around $20,000. Under the Fair Entitlements Guarantee, such a worker would receive the entire redundancy payment of $75,000. Everyone in this House knows how hard Australian employees work and they deserve to know their wages, superannuation and other entitlements are safe. The Fair Entitlements Guarantee will deliver new certainty that workers will receive the redundancy entitlements they are owed in the unfortunate circumstance of an employer going out of business. The entitlements covered by GEERS which will continue to be protected by the Fair Entitlements Guarantee include up to three months unpaid wages and amounts deducted from wages, especially employee superannuation contributions-a topic I spoke about in this chamber only a few days ago. Superannuation is particularly problematic because in many cases an amount may be shown on the payslip but not deposited with the super fund. So the employee may well think that they have the money in the bank, as it were, only to find out many months later-or in some cases over a year later-that there was no deposit. There are processes, through the Australian Taxation Office, to try to recover that but it is a long and uncertain process. As I was saying, the Fair Entitlement Guarantee also covers all unpaid annual leave, all long service leave and up to a maximum of five weeks payment in lieu of notice. The Fair Entitlements Guarantee does not apply to the portion of income earned above the annually indexed rate of $108,300, and directors and excluded employees of the employing company, as defined by section 556 of the Corporations Act, do not quality. As with the GEERS, payments under the Fair Entitlements Guarantee will only be made once an employee’s company enters liquidation. That is another area that needs to be looked at further, because in many cases a company can take an awfully long time to go from administration across to liquidation. Remember that those people who had a weekly, fortnightly or monthly income and certainty-in some cases for many years on end-are suddenly thrown into uncertainty and turmoil. I think people in Australia deserve something better than the system we have at the moment where they may have to rely on charity only a number of weeks after having had a full-time job for a decade or more. MAIN COMMITTEE The Australian government will continue to seek to recover payments from companies through the liquidation process. That is also a very long term undertaking. Currently, the government recovers approximately $15 million per year through this process. It is anticipated that a similar level of recovery would continue under the Fair Entitlements Guarantee. This is a continuation of winding back Work Choices and other pieces of legislation that were brought in during the time of the Howard government. As I said, although it is not a huge change in dollar terms, on the ground for people who are affected, it will make a real change. Workers will now have the knowledge that they are protected against the loss of their hard-earned, banked entitlements which are held on trust by their employer for all those years. I would also like to talk about the effect of the Building the Education Revolution in my electorate of Deakin. It has been a revelation. Schools which, in many cases, have not had any substantial capital work done on them since they were built in the 1950s or 1960s now have a new lease of life. They can now advertise to prospective parents and look good. I have some great schools in the electorate of Deakin that have suffered from a bit of an image problem. They have been great schools on the inside but the paint has been peeling off the outside and the buildings are old and unsuited to modern-day learning. Those schools are always at a disadvantage when it comes to attracting parents to come and have a look with the intention of sending their kids to that school. Some of the schools now have new buildings open or underway. And those are the things that the schools like to show off first. This is their move, in many cases, into the 21st century. For example, I have seen a classroom built in the 1950s which only had one power point in it. That might have been fine when there were no laptop computers, overhead projectors or any of the other equipment that, these days, is taken for granted in most schoolrooms, but it certainly does not work now. Our children deserve better than that. To be stuck with out-of-date infrastructure is simply not fair on them. Our local schools need to be able to take that step into modern learning spaces and there is so much more to be done with them. Infrastructure as a whole, right throughout Australia, is lagging behind. Things that were built 30, 40 or 50 years ago may still be standing but are not always suited to the current task. As a nation we need to make sure-especially in education-that our infrastructure, the teachers, and the environment in the schools are first class at every school. The schools I will talk about in my electorate of Deakin cover the range. I have large private schools, I have small Catholic schools and I have primary schools that range from 140 students to over 800 students. They are all types and each one is different. They all have a different culture and they all have a different way of doing things. But the one thing they have in common is that they all strive to do their best for the students who go there. I, as the local member, am always on hand to assist with anything that I can do. Sometimes I can help directly and sometimes indirectly. The BER has helped schools such as Blackburn Primary, which has an original building dating back to the 1880s that is still in use. It is one of the historic buildings of the suburb of Blackburn. There is very little left of that age in the area. They also now have, out the back of the school, a brand-new full-size basketball facility which they can now use for school assemblies. In the first few years that I went to that school for school assemblies they had assemblies in four converted classrooms with the walls knocked out. You could just about fit the 400 children in the building, but you could not fit the parents in. So, if the parents came along MAIN COMMITTEE for the school assembly, every time. I went there I would see a number of them standing outside. When the assembly started they would stick their head in through the window so they could hear what was going on inside. Blackburn Primary has an excellent school band, one of the best in Melbourne, I dare say, at a primary school level. There is great interest from the parents in hearing what their children can do musically. Now they have an area where they can set up a stage, where they can play, where they can practise but, more importantly, where people can come along and see that. One of the great joys of opening a building like that is to see the uses it can be put to. That school also has an agreement with the local basketball club, which uses it after hours. That not only provides a little bit of income for the school but also helps out the basketball club because there are not enough courts in the local area for them to practise on. That is just one example of how this program works at one school. But, of course, it is not just one school. There are 28 schools in my electorate that are doing different things with different buildings. Some have taken state government designed templates, but many others have sat down with me and the state department and worked through designs and worked through differences and got to a point that they would not have got to if we had not done that work. We managed to put together a local template design that provided a larger building for some schools that were not allocated the same amount of money as the bigger schools. That has meant that some schools that were lined up under the state template program to receive a building that would have housed half a court now have a full court and can now also rent that space out to sports clubs. Schools like Dorset Primary or Ringwood Heights have managed to do more with less. The difference between that and the experience of other schools that already have their buildings up and running is that this took a bit longer, but it is a piece of infrastructure that I hope stands there for many, many decades to come. I think it is much better that way, and on the day the building is opened everyone at the school appreciates it because they have had that input and because they have got what the school wanted. It might be a sports hall or a library or, in many cases, new classrooms. As I said before, many of the schools in my area have very old classrooms and some of the schools have opted for new learning spaces and classrooms that are used in a different way from the traditional methods. Classes are grouped together. Laptops are carried around by the children and teachers mix and match. That is a great thing to see. It is such a change from the days when I and many other people in this place went to school. I would also like to talk about the buildings still to be opened. I still have around 23 BER projects to be opened in the seat of Deakin. There are a great number of those coming along in the next few months. I know the children at all the schools where they are being built are so keen to get into their new classrooms. Every time. I visit a school they always ask me if I am there to open the new building, even though they can see the builders still on site. But it is a great thing that we can stand in this place and talk about projects that will benefit not only our community now but also our communities for many years into the future. great concern to me and so many of my constituents in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011. It relates absolutely to the government’s use of taxpayers’ money-and just as absolutely I question it. I take this opportunity to speak of the outlays already expended in pursuit of a carbon price. As we should remember, MAIN COMMITTEE",235,Anzsco Classifications Mean A Retrospective View Of People That Have Been Here On 457 Vi
278,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (4.45 Pm),"I welcome the opportunity to speak on a matter of the imposition of a carbon price on the Australian people was specifically ruled out before the 2010 election. The Prime Minister said, ‘There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.’ What was said before the election by the Prime Minister had no bearing on what she would do after the election. What we have seen, therefore, is the real Julia. Regardless of the reliability of the Prime Minister, my intention is to speak of anthropogenic global warming or, rather, the theory of anthropogenic global warming. Normally, any speeches in this place about AGW are confined to recounting various estimates and claims of the coming apocalypse brought on by human induced global warming. It always appears more interesting, apparently, to talk about the calamity that approaches-the rising oceans, the bleaching coral reefs and the increasing number of extreme weather events. I will speak of such claims in the future, but today I speak of science and computer models. The government will soon seek to impose a price on carbon to reduce the CO2 output of our nation. I do not believe this would be successful, nor do I believe it would achieve a drop in temperatures. Rather than going over the entire amount of evidence on AGW, I will cover the alleged link between CO2 and temperature. In the last 2,000 years there have been two previous periods of substantial warming, demonstrated by studies based upon reconstructed temperature data from a variety of sources. These periods are the Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period. Using the same calculations of reconstructed data over 2,000 years to the present, it may surprise many members that 80 per cent of all studies have demonstrated that the Medieval Warm Period was, in fact, warmer than the current period. Bizarre as it is, there are some people here that continue to believe the current period is the hottest ever and that this is due, in the main, to CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere. Ever since the government chose to only engage in dire predictions and computer modelling above science, debate has been closed down in this place. I reiterate, however, that an overwhelming number of studies suggest that the Medieval Warm Period was warmer than now. But here is the point: there is a further anomaly beyond the fallacy that somehow this current period is hotter than any other period in recent history and it relates to CO2 concentrations. During the Medieval Warm Period, the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere was some 100 parts per million less than it is currently. It was typically hotter a thousand years ago than it is now, but there was less CO2 in the atmosphere. Indeed, during the Roman Warm Period it was typically about the same or a little hotter than now. Yet again, there was less CO2 in the atmosphere. The question must be: how can it be alleged that CO2 is the forcing factor when both warm cycles of the last 2,000 years corresponded with lower CO2 concentrations than there are currently? What has occurred is that the figures for the current period have been fixed by some to a convenient degree. Indeed, to make sure the current period appears warmer than previous warm periods, recent data has been assessed using instrumental temperature data, which is not available beyond the last 100 to 150 years. Before that, temperatures have been calculated using the reconstructed data method. Using reconstructed data from a variety of sources, from the present back 2,000 years, the current period is demonstrated to be typically cooler than the Medieval Warm Period and the Roman Warm Period. It is only when comparing ‘apples with oranges’-in other words, reconstructed data with instrumental temperature data-that the current period can be made to seem warmer than both the Roman Warm Period and the Medieval Warm Period. In any case, there remains the fundamental and critical disconnect that MAIN COMMITTEE whenever there were higher temperatures in the past 2,000 years there were in fact lower CO2 levels compared with now. Rest assured that I do not base this speech just on these highly relevant facts but also on more recent information, because in recent times there is also a similar disconnection between CO2 and temperature rises. In particular, the significant warming in Greenland in the 1920s took place without CO2 rising higher than three to four parts per million, while the temperature rose by two to four degrees Celsius. That warming was actually attributed to local climate issues, such as the Northern Annular Mode-the North Atlantic Oscillation-but clearly without a significant anthropogenic influence. A study by Overpeck et al in 1997 determined that from 1955 to 1990 the mean circum-Arctic air temperature fell by 0.4 per cent during the same period that the CO2 concentration rose from 313 to 354 parts per million, or by 41 parts per million. As previously stated, there are significant disparities between temperature and CO2 concentrations. Predictions of catastrophic climate change are predicted only through computer models. Let us think on that with regard to these models and their predictions. The assertion is that computer programs have been developed that consider every possible natural influence and factor that controls weather. That is what we are being asked to put our faith in. We are in effect being told that these models are so advanced, so technically accurate and so completely representative and inclusive of every possible facet or vagary of the weather that they can tell what is going to happen in 30, 50 or 100 years. What a marvel of modern-day science they represent. It is a pity they cannot predict cyclones, Queensland floods or even the exceptionally cold Northern Hemisphere winter. To return to my points so far, I question whether computer models that do not even consider clouds can be trusted to be accurate in their long-term future predictions when real temperature comparisons do not show a relationship between temperature rises and CO2 concentrations. I suspect that if you threw into these models the influence of the entrails of a rock python you may not reach any more credible prediction, but the output of snake oil to be sold would be even greater than the amount already being produced. I have spoken now at fair length about key science issues regarding the theory of anthropogenic climate change. Of course, in addition to name-calling of people like me who question that theory and who are genuinely interested in investigating the science and truth in these matters, there is also the other part of the orchestrated campaign to restrict free speech in this country, and that is to deride those who still question the apocalypse as being in the pay of big oil companies. Alternative views are dismissed as being motivated by vested interests. There is, however, no better example of the influence of vested interests pushing an agenda than those who adhere to the theory of AGW. It is on that side of the debate that vested interests truly lie-but I hesitate to call it a debate as it seems that so many individuals, groups and businesses now see the acceptance of the theory of AGW to be in their interest, and hence there is no debate. I would classify adherents of the AGW theory into three groups: those who believe that AGW is a reality, those whose first priority is the advantage they discern they can achieve from the acceptance of AGW as a reality, and those who fear personal and professional ruin should they oppose and speak out against the theory. Of those three groups, I have the least problem with those who totally believe in the theory, as they are authentic. I think they are MAIN COMMITTEE wrong, but they are at least authentic. I speak next of those who fear personal disadvantage should they oppose and speak out against the theory. I consider them low on courage but I think it is sad that they are willing to stand back and admire the emperor’s new clothes rather than adopt a professional approach. Yet of the three groups the most despicable of all are those who do not believe in AGW yet still see a personal advantage for themselves or their organisation. That advantage may be political, as we see in this place. It may be an advantage in a business sense, whereby market share or advantage may be gained by deriding the business of competitors as producing high emissions or as being responsible for high carbon outputs. It may be an advantage in an academic sense, whereby research dollars are being sought or the standing of one area of science may be improved over the standing of another area. In any case, my main point is that in many cases there is anything but an honest belief in the science of AGW. It follows that a person who does not believe yet still supports that theory most definitely stands as part of vested interests in this matter. It is my view that of all those who advocate for the theory of AGW, more than half would have political, business or academic potential benefit and would sense the advantage and move to realise that benefit. I will speak of political benefit and who stands to gain from being a believer. First and foremost there is the party of socialism-the far Left, the radical Left. I of course speak of the Greens. For the Greens, the AGW issue is like a Trojan Horse that carries within it the real Greens agenda-a Trojan Horse that is being moved inside Western democratic societies, only to then reveal the socialist agenda: the redistribution of wealth and the legalisation of illicit drugs, along with other bizarre Greens policies like Medicare funded sex change operations et cetera. There is no more sinister vested interest in the political arena than that of the Greens, and they are socialists all. I have described the three groups of advocates of AGW theory. Perhaps they are better listed as believers, opportunists and cowards. I do not doubt that all three groups are represented among the government’s ranks. There are believers such as the member for Wills and the member for Lyons, two members whom I respect for their belief. However, the vast majority in the government are those who see political advantage in maintaining government, internal advancement or just continuing in this place. Those who toe the politically opportunistic line are the majority, yet there are still those who fear to speak out and they are the silent ones who have never spoken on this matter. Before concluding, I will speak on the scientific community-or those who purport to be interested in the science. Some time ago I attended an event here at parliament called ‘Science Meets Parliament’. At that event a couple of years ago the MC spoke of how much research was being influenced by the theory of anthropogenic global warming. He quoted a research study that had investigated the influence of AGW on flea populations on dogs. Clearly the way to get your research funded in this country is to ensure that AGW is part of your study. If you want to be able to do research and exist as a scientist in this country, join the AGW advocacy team and reap the benefits. Does that mean that if you question the theory of AGW you are on your own? It certainly looks like it. I would therefore make the point that if we speak of vested interests then we should look at everyone whose job depends on not questioning the theory of AGW. Beyond research projects, what about those specific businesses, organisations or institutes that mention climate or MAIN COMMITTEE carbon in their titles? Because their businesses and jobs depend on the theory of AGW, I name as non-objective vested interests the Climate Institute, the ANU Climate Change Institute, the UNSW Climate Change Research Centre, the Climate Futures team at Macquarie University, the Monash University weather and climate centre et cetera-the list goes on. Every employee, every academic, in every one of these bodies would personally suffer from any critical examination that highlights the faults in the theory of AGW. The list of people without vested interests who could be considered genuinely neutral is getting very light. I am sickened by AGW advocates pointing the finger at those of us who question them by calling us vested interests. I and those who question this theory of AGW have no motivation of personal gain in this matter. What we are motivated by is a search for the truth and a wish to do what is right, not what is easy. Going with the flow and hiding in the crowd is the easy option. It is the path of least resistance, but it is not in the national interest and I certainly was not elected to oppose the national interest. I am approached by an increasing number of constituents who are concerned about what they see happening around the world: record cold weather in the Northern Hemisphere and the predictions of endless droughts in Australia, now broken by heavy rains clearly influenced by the La Nina weather system and not AGW. It is little wonder that there are also increasing calls for the Australian National Audit Office to conduct an audit of the Bureau of Meteorology’s records. I support that request. Let the sun shine in, I say. As I have said before, I am not a scientist, but I think there is more than enough scientific information available and it is easy enough to understand. It suggests that there is nothing settled about the science. There have been further developments in this matter. Another body of vested interests has been established. Although it has been suggested that the Gillard government’s well-funded task force is some neutral force in this matter, in reality it is nothing more than a facade for spending up big to promote and advertise carbon pricing. It is a PR unit whose sole purpose is to avoid the sort of scrutiny that I have today highlighted the need for and instead push for the final result of imposing a carbon price-an electricity tax, a petrol tax-which amounts to a tax on living. It is a tax that will undermine the productivity of this nation, a tax that will lower the standard of living of our people, a tax that will reduce our capacity to respond to natural disasters, a tax that will weaken our ability to respond to future financial crises, a tax that will take away our capacity to react to future challenges, whatever they may be. Overall, this carbon tax will weaken our nation and waste more money on the fallacies that there is a link between temperature and CO2 concentrations and that this nation is in any circumstance able to take action that will result in lower global, or even local, temperatures. The science backs me on this, and if this place had not abandoned sense for madness late in 2007 we would not be in a mess like this. (No. 3) 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011. The new measures that this funding will be applied to represent public expenditure that will enhance productivity and economic growth. I am pleased to note the allocation of funding to conduct an implementation study into a high-speed rail network. The Gillard government has put high-speed rail back on the national agenda, and that is welcomed by all in my electorate. This first stage, a study, will determine the economic benefits and financial viability of a high-speed rail network along Australia’s east coast. I know that there is great interest in highMAIN COMMITTEE",238,Anzsco Classifications Mean A Retrospective View Of People That Have Been Here On 457 Vi
279,Mr Stephen Jones (Throsby) (4.59 Pm),"I rise today to speak on Appropriation Billspeed rail in my electorate of Throsby because both the Illawarra and Southern Highlands currently serve in many respects as dormitory villages for the 20,000 people who daily commute to Sydney for work. A high-speed rail network would provide an enormous economic benefit to these regions and bring this population closer to the employment and other opportunities in Sydney. And while this region is not yet within the scope of this study, I will be working with the member for Cunningham to do everything we can to ensure that the Illawarra is on the radar for the future. The Gillard Labor government has put high-speed rail back on the national agenda because of its potential to spur economic development and transform the way Australians get around this vast continent of ours. We are making the first significant federal investment in urban passenger rail and we have begun rebuilding more than a third of the interstate rail freight network. The Gillard government has a proud record of economic achievement and fiscal responsibility. It is now well established that Australia’s economy is in a far better position than almost any other advanced economy in the world. Australia’s economy is strong. Our job creation capacity is strong, with over 740,000 jobs created since Labor came to office. Our fiscal position is strong. Despite the challenges from recent natural disasters, our budget is still on track to return to surplus in 2012-13, the fastest fiscal consolidation of any country anywhere in the world. While the Gillard government’s economic record is one to be proud of, the contrast with the economic credibility of those opposite could not be more stark. The opposition’s approach to the budget is both incompetent and reckless. The opposition have demonstrated their fiscal recklessness by twice blocking $5 billion in savings measures put forward by this government-this is from an opposition that says, ‘There is plenty of fat in the budget and we know how to save it.’ As well as that, they are also blocking a further $2 billion in savings to the budget over four years by voting against the reforms to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The coalition not only opposed the economic stimulus package that kept Australia out of recession but have opposed just about every sensible measure this government has put up. They know all about how to say no, but do not know what the word ‘yes’ looks like. The coalition likes to claim that there are plenty of savings to be found in the budget. However, when it comes to the detail of their proposals, what we find is double-counting, misrepresentations, political opportunism and downright economic vandalism. They have, for instance, double-counted around $700 million in savings, showing that they simply do not understand that you cannot spend the same money twice. And who can forget that in the 2010 election campaign the coalition were forced to own up to a $10.6 billion black hole in its election costings? It is not just the record of the coalition in opposition that calls into question their economic credentials. In government, despite presiding over the mining boom mark 1, the Howard government squandered the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity this economic circumstance offered this country. They did not invest in infrastructure, they did not invest in education and they did not invest in skills. In fact, the coalition left this country with a $46 billion infrastructure deficit and an appalling record on productivity-in fact, productivity had been declining for around a decade. This morning we heard the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, claiming that the Howard government was the gold standard in fiscal responsibility. Well, if that is the MAIN COMMITTEE gold standard, I suggest that it is fool’s gold. The rewriting of history by those opposite in this regard is nothing less than astounding. For most of its time, the Howard government was the highest taxing government in Australia’s history. That is right-the highest taxing government in Australia’s history, because Australia’s tax to GDP ratio during the Howard years was constantly around 25 to 26 per cent. It is, since the election of a Labor government, now around 22 per cent and forecast to drop even further. The record shows that whilst in government the coalition presided over some noted ideological follies that wasted billions and billions of taxpayer dollars. That is right-billions of taxpayer dollars wasted over the years by the Howard government. One of these coalition money wasters was the way the proceeds from the privatisation of Telstra were used to porkbarrel regional electorates on projects that did nothing to enhance regional telecommunications. This is from the party that now purports to stand in this chamber and elsewhere to champion the cause of regional electorates and that opposed our plan to do something to offer real, fast, reliable broadband to regional Australia. They did nothing at all over their 11 years in government. According to some analysts, the coalition wasted more than $1 billion on fattening up Telstra for privatisation on various programs that did absolutely nothing to improve regional services. When the Audit Office looked into some of this expenditure they found a complete shambles. In a 2003 report, the Audit Office said there was no evidence of any framework to monitor the efficiency and effectiveness of program delivery for Networking the Nation. And while the coalition make much of their record of retiring debt, the fact is that the only way that this had happened over their period in government was by selling off Telstra and other public assets. And where did that leave Australians in terms of their critical telecommunications services? The answer is exactly nowhere. The coalition short-changed Australian taxpayers yet again when they sold off the first tranche of Telstra shares by massively underpicing them. These shares increased by $12 billion in just one year. That is $12 billion that could have gone into consolidated revenue but did not. Let us talk about IT outsourcing. This is another coalition money waster: the IT outsourcing initiative that was rolled out between 1997 and 2000. This was an initiative that was supposed to lead to a billion dollars in savings but instead lead to a massive blow-out in costs across government departments before it was abandoned after yet another damming Auditor General’s report. We will never know the full cost of this coalition ideological folly but there is no doubt hundreds of millions of dollars were wasted-and departments were left with computer systems that did not work and contracts they could not get out of. It is terribly convenient for the coalition members opposite to now rewrite history and gloss over the massive waste of public money that occurred during their time in government-billions of dollars wasted on reckless, ideological programs. There are a host of other examples that could be detailed here if time permitted. There was the waste of money on the sale of Commonwealth estate property, which returned a negative financial return and which was condemned by the Auditor-General in 2001. There were the billion-dollar foreign currency losses in 2000, condemned by the Auditor-General in 2000, and the hundreds of millions wasted on Employment National and Job Network in 1999-2000. MAIN COMMITTEE There was the regional rorts program in which the Auditor-General found that $350 million was handed out to coalition held seats-with some projects funded before an application had even been received. Then there was the $121 million spent trying to sell Work Choices, part of the massive $2 billion spent on advertising by the Howard government. Those opposite have absolutely no credibility left when it comes to fiscal responsibility or managing waste. Maybe, if we had this record, we would be desperately trying to rewrite history as well. But I do not think that Australians will ever forget John Howard’s broken promise on interest rates and the humiliation for the coalition government when the Reserve Bank was forced, by bad economic management, to raise the interest rate-for the sixth time-during the 2007 federal election. So let’s not have those homilies from those opposite, those gold standard allusions from the member for Warringah that somehow their 11 years in government was one of immense fiscal responsibility. They presided over squandering the greatest mining boom since the gold rush and the waste of literally billions of dollars of taxpayers’ funds, and they have very little to show for it. There were 19 broadband plans and still not a decent broadband system for areas of regional Australia or indeed anywhere outside capital cities. The Gillard government takes its role as a good economic manager very seriously. However, this government is far from complacent when it comes to the future. We know we face a challenge to create a high-productivity and low-pollution economy. That is why the Gillard government has an economic plan. It plans to cut business taxes, invest in the infrastructure this nation so sorely needs and keep building our pool of retirement savings so that we can be more self-reliant when it comes to domestic investment. It plans to build the capital that we need to fund the mining industry boom mark 2 and the infrastructure and business investment that is needed for future productivity growth in this country. We have a plan to build a stronger, broader, more competitive economy that will create even more jobs, and let us not forget that over 740,000 have been created since Labor came into government. Let us compare that with where we would be if we had followed the economic prescriptions of those opposite, who said, ‘Don’t inject fiscal stimulus into the economy; let’s see over 10 per cent unemployment.’ This is an unemployment rate that is currently crippling the economies of the US and many of the countries within Europe right now and having a devastating effect on spending, consumer confidence and business recovery. If we followed the prescriptions of those opposite, we would have unemployment hovering at around 10 per cent when many economists are describing the five per cent unemployment that we now enjoy as full employment. I for one believe-and I am sure the member for Eden-Monaro will agree, representing a similar electorate-that five per cent unemployment, while our historic low, is still not good enough for us. We will not be happy until all of those people, particularly young people in electorates such as ours and yours, Mr Deputy Speaker Thomson, are in meaningful employment. But we are on the path to do that and we have a plan to do it and a plan to meet the challenges of Mining Boom mark 2. These bills are an important part of our plan to manage the economy through these difficult times. We are dealing with the challenge thrown up by the worse natural disasters to beset our nation in living memory. We are dealing with that challenge and we are dealing with the capacity constraints that we will have to manage as we manage record levels of mining investment, particularly in Queensland and elsewhere. We are dealing with the big long-term challenge of improving productivity and dealing with global warming. We are dealing with all of MAIN COMMITTEE those challenges with very little cooperation from those opposite. When you look back on their economic record it is of little wonder because they are clearly clueless when it comes to managing this economy in the interests of ordinary working people. I commend the bills to the House. 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011. In doing so, I want to touch on some local and national issues which relate to government appropriations. They certainly concern the people of Dawson. BeforeI do, I want to respond to some of the claims made by the member for Throsby, particularly in relation to Regional Partnerships. The reality is that the government cannot hold its head up high with regard to regional funding. Regional Australia has been waiting since November 2007 for a locally driven regional funding program. The government was keen to scrap Regional Partnerships and sink the boot in there, but it has not put anything back on the table. Now we have regional development organisations right across this country that simply do not know what is going on. They have been made to do studies and make pretty books, but no-one is any the wiser about what funding is coming. So the government cannot hold its head up high with regard to its regional funding commitments. The member for Throsby talked about the government’s response to mining boom No. 2. Its response is basically to tax it. That is not a response at all. I did the sums during the election period. We worked out that about $40 million a week was going to be ripped out of Central Queensland when you look at what the mining tax would take from the coal exports. It would be like having a pittance thrown back at you. For every $100 note that floats out of the Mackay region, with its mining industry, the government would be giving us a gracious 50c back. That is certainly not any way to treat mining areas, but that is how the government is going. I want to put on the record that I am opposed to many of the items that the government seeks to appropriate funds for in these bills, but I will touch on that later. BeforeI do, I want to talk about the funding promises that were made in the seat of Dawson by the government. A range of commitments were made by the Labor Party during the election. Very interestingly, earlier this week I got an answer to a question on notice that I had put to the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and Local Government back in November. I asked which funding programs those promises were coming from and when that funding was coming. The answer, particularly to the second part, was very telling. The funds are coming from this financial year. SoI have to say: why are we still waiting for those promises to be delivered? The Mackay Amateur Basketball Association were promised $6 million as a contribution to a new basketball stadium, only after the Liberal-National Party made a similar commitment. The Mackay football association are also waiting for a $1 million commitment to the relocation of the Mackay junior soccer grounds. Why are they still waiting if the funding is allocated in this financial year? The Airlie Beach main street funding is a $5 million contribution, and we just do not know where it is. Where is that money? More to the point, where is the rest of it? The Airlie Beach main street upgrade project is going to cost in excess of $45 million, and that figure does not even include the land resumptions. Labor committed a whopping oneninth of the funding for that project. How nice of them. MAIN COMMITTEE",242,Anzsco Classifications Mean A Retrospective View Of People That Have Been Here On 457 Vi
280,Mr Christensen (Dawson) (5.14 Pm),"I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3)We got $1 million in funding for a Bowen water park, but we are not sure exactly where it is, even though it is allocated for this year. More to the point, why the hell is the government funding a water park when a private developer has already built a water park for tourists about a five-minute drive down the road? Why did the government not put forward funding for the real water issue in Bowen-the fact that the town has been drinking dirty water for the last 15 years or more? It was not something that the government can claim they did not know about. Their candidate was the local mayor of the area, who has presided over a situation where Bowen residents have had to drink, wash and shower in brown, rank and unclean water. The government could have chipped in to help the community out with a solution to this problem. They could have offered the Whitsunday Regional Council funding for a short-term or long term solution. But, no, instead of dealing with Bowen’s biggest problem, dirty water, and building a water plant, what we got was a proposed water park when the town already has one. And we are still waiting for those dollars, even though we know that they can be made available right now. We have Labor’s paltry $10 million commitment to a feasibility study for the Mackay ringroad. They put up $10 million for a key transport project for Mackay that is going to cost probably in excess of $300 million-perhaps $400 million. The Labor Party could not even follow the Liberal-National coalition’s lead and get this project to the point where it was shovel ready. Yet we are still none the wiser as to exactly where that paltry $10 million for this project will be made available. I am told that the Department of Transport and Main Roads are none the wiser either, and they are the project deliverers. We cannot dillydally on the funding for this ring road project. It needs to be delivered as soon as possible so that we can get the study done, which will probably tell us what we already know-that the traffic situation in Mackay is getting too congested and a ring road has to be built. When we get that study out of the way we can get into the planning, design and preconstruction works. But this will, of course, need extra funds. Those funds need to be forthcoming before 2015, when the third round of AusLink funding, the major transport funding program of the federal government, becomes available. Here is a message for the Prime Minister and the federal transport minister: if the $10 million study is not done in a timely fashion, if further funding is not forthcoming to get this ring road shovel-ready before 2015 so that we can access this AusLink funding to complete the project, and if Mackay residents are left to suffer in traffic jams of the size you would not witness here in Canberra, it will be on their heads. I want to mention some things that the government did not commit to during the electionthings that the government is not appropriating funds for right now-that would greatly assist the Dawson electorate. The first thing is a youth mental health headspace centre. The Liberal National coalition committed to funding such a centre in Mackay for four years. We had a motion that the House passed, calling on the government to roll out headspace and EPIC centres across Australia. I am told we have one person a week attempting suicide in Mackay. A growing number of those are young people. SoI would call on the government to look at Mackay as a vital-need area for a headspace centre. I would call on them to consider, in the coming budget, allocating funding for a headspace centre at Mackay. We need $4 million for that centre. The process for funding these headspace sites seems to be very arbitrary; often it is a marginal seat that gets one. I would say to the government: forget the politics; look at the MAIN COMMITTEE facts. Look at the situation we are facing in Mackay. Put a headspace centre where it is needed and help us by providing that funding. There are many other deserving projects that the government should be looking at funding, particularly through its community cultural development grants and its community organisation infrastructure grants programs. This is stuff that the Liberal-National coalition looked at, during the last election, and found worthy of funding. The Mackay show grounds need to be transformed into a major regional events precinct. The Whitsunday motorsports raceway is a brilliant local project that would boost tourism in the Whitsundays by opening up the lucrative rev-head market. All it needs is funding from the Commonwealth. There is a need for funding for the Proserpine Community Centre-a small, volunteer-run centre that offers an array of community support services to Proserpine and the Whitsundays. They need $700,000 to build a new centre because they are currently bleeding from rental costs after being kicked out of an old hospital building by the state Labor government. Then there is a need for funding to upgrade the facilities at the Whitsunday Sports Park in Airlie Beach. There is a need for funding to help the Burdekin Shire Council with local vandalism and crime problems. Perhaps the government could dip into its Safer Suburbs funding program to help with that particular problem. There is a dire need for government assistance to help with the beach erosion that is occurring at McEwens Beach, Midge Point and Slade Point in the Mackay region. Residents in these places, particularly at McEwens Beach, are at serious risk of losing their homes due to the continual erosion of their beachfronts over the last 50 years. SoI call on the government to consider a special grant to help these communities out. In fact, it could fund nearly all of the initiatives that I have just outlined by simply reallocating money from one thing that I probably do not want-funding for the superclinic. If the government could look at that funding and reallocate it, all of those other worthy projects could be funded. We would have those projects instead of a superclinic that the government wants to build in competition with, and against the wishes of, hard working local GPs and their staff in the Mackay region. I also want to bring to the attention of the House and the government some other local matters which have only come to light since the election, over the last few months. I have spoken before in this House about the situation that is faced by the sugar industry. It certainly is a dire situation that we have. The huge rainfall that occurred before Cyclone Yasi, before the floods, impacted greatly on just about every sugar growing area in my seat of Dawson. Cyclone Yasi has caused a 10 per cent loss to production, particularly in the Burdekin. I acknowledge that the government and the state government are currently offering $250,000 concessional loans to farmers who have been affected, but that only applies to certain areas and it has a lot of strings and conditions attached. What the industry needs is a grant or a concessional loan for growers from Mackay and to the north that would assist with replanting. The industry is telling me that basically they will be under full capacity of production until 2014 because they cannot afford to replant. If we could get a concessional loan for those people to do replanting, that would be a quick way of getting the industry back to full production. MAIN COMMITTEE I refer to tourism which is also suffering at the moment in the wake of the floods and Cyclone Ului. We have had massive cancellations throughout the Whitsundays. The Liberal National coalition is proposing $100,000 concessional loans to people in the tourism industries and other industries that have been indirectly impacted. But the government should also look at other measures to help the tourism industry. One measure that has been put to me is a special round of funding that could be looked at through the Export Market Development Grant program. To get these people out there marketing their businesses to the world is probably the best marketing that tourism could have right now. There is probably no person more passionate than the person who has got their backside on the line, so to speak, who has got their money in the till. If we could look at the EMDG program for the tourism industry, I am sure that they would be able to sell their product to the world. The fishing industry, which I also spoke about earlier in the House today, is also suffering the effects of Cyclone Yasi, but they are not eligible for the $250,000 concessional loan. I would again call on the government to look at that situation and rectify that, because these people hurting. The catch has basically gone from Cairns to Mackay, and there are going to be people out of work and fishermen basically shutting up shop because the industry will just not be sustainable as it is. I also bring to the government’s attention and the House’s attention the state of digital television reception throughout the Dawson electorate. From Congulla in the north to the Whitsundays in the south it is very patchy. In fact, it is just unbearable in some areas. We face a switchover, I understand, this year, and the situation needs to be addressed. If there are funding implications there, so be it. People cannot be left without basic television coverage and service. These are the things that the government have not funded-things that should be funded. What they have funded in this appropriation bill in some instance does beggar belief. We have $290 million allocated to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship for operational costs associated with the management of offshore illegal immigrant processing. That is more than six times the annual operating cost for the Howard government’s Pacific solution. It just shows that the government have completely lost control of the borders and now we, the taxpayers, are paying for it. There is a proposal for over $300 million in foreign spending-which, quite frankly, I personally find unbelievable at a time when we have got crises on our own doorstep that the government plans to tax people for. There is more than $17 million being allocated to the NBN at a time when we are cutting funding for flood-proofing on the Bruce Highway. What is more important: downloading movies on the information superhighway or getting essential supplies up national highway? There is $15 million in funding going to the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. I assume that some of that is going to pay the climate commissaire Tim Flannery. Some of that money perhaps should be used to pay for the other side of the coin-Professor Bob Carter, an actual climate scientist, a geologist, from my electorate. He could certainly handle that debate. It is unbelievable that these measures are being funded when the basics-roads, mental health services, local sports and community facilities-are not being sorted out. We can only hope this government starts getting the priorities right for the people of Dawson. MAIN COMMITTEE Dr MIKE KELLY (Eden-Monaro-Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry) (5.29 pm)-What a pleasure it is to be able to speak in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011 which are further evidence-if further evidence is needed-of this government’s agenda to sort out the long-term problems of this country and set a forward, visionary accomplishment of the things that this nation really needs. In following the member for Dawson, the stark contrast is there for all to see. Obviously, the member for Dawson is yet another one of those flat-earthers who thinks the NBN is only about downloading movies. Nothing could contrast the two sides of politics in this chamber than that statement and the statement. I have heard echoed by Barnaby Joyce in the Senate as well. Not understanding what this technology will deliver for rural and regional areas in particular is an indictment of those members who sit in these chambers who represent or claim to represent those regions. What a contrast we see from those Howard years to now-those years that I refer to as the Rip Van Winkle years when we saw the complete negligence of the key infrastructure and skills issues in this country. We saw the groaning road and rail problems we faced and the pile-up of the ships in the ports. We saw the 18 failed attempts to deal with our national broadband network needs and now yet another failed policy approach, adding to 19 their attempts in this sphere, as we recently saw another paltry effort to address this issue. Also, the key issue of climate change was ignored throughout those years. One of the great indictments of the Howard government is the fact that during those years the renewable energy percentage that was servicing this country fell-did not increase but fell-from 10 per cent to nine per cent. It is a delight to see that those agendas have been addressed and are being brought forward now so effectively, delivering real results on the ground for this country. The issues are being delivered through these budgetary measures for rural and regional Australia. What a stark contrast this is. Why are those members of the National Party, those members representing rural and regional Australia, not standing up for their electorates, their people, supporting measures that will clearly benefit them? I look at some of the specific provisions of these bills that address these issues. I look at the $12.5 million going towards supporting the joint projects with the United States which are designed to reduce the cost of solar energy technologies. We can reflect on the success of the microgeneration projects that the government has been engaged in-the subsidisation of the solar panels and solar heating-which, in their own right, have dramatically reduced the cost of the installation of these systems in domestic housing situations. This has opened up to a much vaster section of our community the possibility of installing these systems on their homes, a possibility that certainly did not exist before with the price of these componentsthe panels et cetera. Those microgeneration programs and policies have had the desired effect and it is now the challenge for this government, for this country, to move on towards tackling those macrogeneration issues. We can see the evidence of that as this government moves forward to fund research and to promote the investment and provide the market opportunities for that sort of investment to happen. It is a great tragedy that the coalition reneged on that CPRS deal we had made with them; otherwise, we would have seen the flow of $100 billion, as estimated by many investment funds, towards the installation and development of those critically needed energy generation capacities. MAIN COMMITTEE In these bills we see $69.8 million being brought forward for the non-government schools component of the BER program that has been completed earlier than expected. This is a success story, again. It is further evidence of what a wonderful program the BER has been and of all the investment that we are making in our children. As I move around my own region and visit the 71 schools, I see the overwhelming reaction by students, parents and teachers and their gratitude at seeing the investment, particularly in these rural and regional areas, that is opening up the broad quality of the education that kids in rural and regional Australia will get. It is very exciting and very rewarding to see. For example, we know that where we cannot now teach languages, when this technology is fully delivered we can have a classroom in Moruya linked with a classroom in Jindabyne being taught by a language teacher in Sydney. This means that kids in rural and regional areas will have the opportunity to get the same quality of education that exists in metropolitan areas. So it is wonderful to see those projects all around my region, particularly in the 71 schools, including 17 private schools, that have done such a wonderful job of managing these projects and delivering beautiful facilities that are well and truly overwhelmingly enjoyed and supported by the community and their teachers. We also see the trade training centres program evidenced in these bills-the $48.3 million reappropriating amounts from last financial year. These trade training centre projects were extremely important, are extremely important and will be extremely important, particularly for rural and regional areas. It is so important that we build the skills that are needed to match the potential local industries and job opportunities in these areas. Why anyone would oppose these trade training centres is beyond me. Obviously, it demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of the importance of marrying these technical educational opportunities with local needs. In my region, I am very pleased to say that the Bombala High School Trade Training Centre is already under construction. It will focus on primary industry and forestry skills for our region and for our kids. Also, the Eden Marine High School Trade Training Centre project will focus on construction skills and marine industry skills. That centre will team up with the trade training centre project at the Bega High School, which is also supported by Bega TAFE. This brings together the wonderful capacity that the TAFE system brings to our rural and regional areas. The Bega High School project will focus on primary industries and construction. This is very well in tune with the sorts of needs that our region has. We can already see the impact of other investment from the government in our region. A particular issue we talked about was the groaning road and rail problems. A classic example of that was, of course, the Princess Highway in Eden-Monaro. The Bega bypass, which has been on the books now for over 40 years, is critically needed. It is a key choke point in that system. What happens now is that any B-double that attempts to pass through Bega has to uncouple on the outside of town and recouple on the other side of town. It is very dangerous when these trucks navigate the dog leg through town and it also reduces the amenity of life for the citizens of that town. When the bypass is complete B-doubles will be able to travel straight past the town, which will reduce the inconvenience and be far more economically efficient. This will also tend to open up possibilities-as I would hope to see in the future-for the port in Eden. It is one of the country’s finest deep-water ports. I think it will play a pivotal role in the MAIN COMMITTEE future of port capacity in this country as we start to see the problems of strain developing in the ports of Sydney and Melbourne. Also, we see $17.1 million dollars for additional work to support finalisation of the definitive agreements between Telstra and NBN Co. and the implementation of arrangements for the establishment of a new agency to manage the universal service obligation. A critical issue for rural and regional areas is universal service obligation. It means that providers have to ensure that standard telephone services, pay phones and prescribed carriage services are reasonably accessible an equitable basis to all people in Australia, wherever they reside. This is very important for regions. I mentioned the NBN Co. and what it will potentially offer. It was a privilege to be at the Heywire activity at Old Parliament House a couple of weeks ago, where a number of our fine young men and women from country Australia received awards. It was very clear from talking to them how much they get the importance of the NBN. It will open up for young people in those areas the possibility to break through the straitjacket that their current support systems constrain their imaginations with. When this system is available, they will only be limited by their own imagination. Their creativity will be unlocked through this. Business, health and education applications will also be available through the NBN. Of course, the bills provide for the government to meet its obligations in relation to the disasters we have recently experienced. It certainly has been wonderful to see the nation respond to those situations, and this government is definitely playing its part. It would be wonderful to see the coalition play its part by stumping up to support the levy bills that are presently before the main chamber. We have also seen the government’s implementation study for a high-speed rail line going ahead. This future capacity for this country will arrive, I believe, at some point in the future. This funding will help accelerate that process. This program is of very much keen interest in my region, because one of the possible routes for that VFT would be through Eden-Monaro, coming through Queanbeyan, down through Cooma and Bombala and then perhaps on to Orbost and through the Latrobe Valley. That is only one possible route. We will have to see what emerges from the study but it will open up enormous potential for the country when it is delivered. We need to get that process going, and this is a very important instalment in that. We also see the investment in local infrastructure and the $800 million program for priority regional infrastructure projects. It is magnificent to see what has been achieved on the ground in relation to community infrastructure projects. Just this last SaturdayI was down at the Bega rec ground, where $200,000 of government investment made it possible for us to attract National Rugby League first-grade teams-the Canberra Raiders and the Melbourne Storm-to come and conduct a trial activity at that ground, which attracted a crowd of nearly 7,000 people and brought a lot of visitors into the region. More than that, the two teams spent an entire week in the region engaging with kids. They went to the high schools pursuing themes of decision making, eating healthily and engaging in active lifestyles. It was just a wonderful fillip for the entire region, all made possible by the investment in the Bega recreation ground. This is what these investments can achieve and why they are so important. We have seen so many towns around the region benefiting-all of them have benefited. In every town you go to in my region you will see these projects. They have created local jobs. They got us through the GFC without the damage that could have been caused with lost jobs. At the same time, MAIN COMMITTEE they have improved the amenity of life for people in the country and improved the towns’ tourism attraction at the same time. These things are wonderful achievements of the government’s programs over these last few years. One last aspect of these bills that I think is also of interest to my region is the $52.9 million that is being invested in the construction of a satellite receiving station, which is related to the government’s International Forest Carbon Initiative. Many people in my region are very concerned about the impacts of deforestation and its contribution to climate change. The government has been aggressively pursuing this issue because, as we know, the mechanism to address emissions from deforestation is not currently included under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. So it has been an ambition of this government to pursue the so called REDD-plus aspect of this scheme, or Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, particularly in developing countries, so that it can be included past 2012 as we see the new climate change agreement that will replace the Kyoto process. We have invested $273 million in that process. What we seek to achieve there is to make it demonstrably clear that it is possible to measure, to metricise and to incorporate deforestation, reforestation and maintenance of forests in a carbon pollution reduction scheme process. This satellite ground station will be a key component in demonstrating that, for the benefit of our neighbours in particular. Through this process we have been engaging with Indonesia. The ground station will demonstrate that forests can be monitored effectively through satellite data and on-ground forest measurements. So we are leading the charge in this respect, and I know that will be very heartening for all those members of my community who are interested in seeing greater action taken on climate change. I am very proud of what this government has achieved. We are governing for the future. We are delivering real improvements for people on the ground, for their daily lives, as well as addressing the long-term challenges and needs of this country, in stark contrast to the troglodyte attitudes of the coalition. mentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20102011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011. However, his last statement was uncalled-for and unnecessary and inappropriate. Having said that, I would like to talk about some good news and some bad news. The good news concerns the Long Jetty at Port Welshpool. For the last two federal election campaigns we have made a promise down in south Gippsland to rebuild the jetty. Because we have failed to gain the confidence of the Australian people, we have been unable to fulfil that election promise. I have also been unable to convince Martin Ferguson to invest in the Long Jetty. Perhaps, if we had not had a change of Prime Minister and there needed to be an announcement down in south Gippsland, it would have been an ideal tourism announcement and it would have been a great fillip for this community that suffers in a number of ways. We are not the rich community we once were in the fifties and sixties when dairying was at its peak. It would also have been great for the current government to commit to the heritage of this nation by rebuilding the jetty. Part of it was burnt out 12 months ago, so it became more imperative that something be done. Along comes the miraculous restoration of the Liberal-National Party in Victoria. Last week the Deputy Premier, Peter Ryan, made a great announcement. He said that they would MAIN COMMITTEE",246,Anzsco Classifications Mean A Retrospective View Of People That Have Been Here On 457 Vi
281,Mr Broadbent (Mcmillan) (5.44 Pm),"That was not a bad address from the Parlianot only do a feasibility study for the reconstruction of the Long Jetty but also commit $3 million to those parts that are broken and open up the jetty for use. Why is an old jetty important to me? It is one of the longest jetties in Australia, going into deep water and servicing a magnificent deepwater harbour. It is important to me because I always had a dream that people with disabilities should as much as possible be able to share in the life that those of us with full abilities have. This is a fantastic spot for wheelchair fishing and for disability access. It is great for recreation of this nature, and it takes us out into water we could not otherwise get to. Disability has always been a passion for me, and it is still a passion for me today. Rebuilding the Long Jetty will create building jobs, and that is great, and we have changed the attitude of the organisations that look after the jetty-Ports and Harbours, DSC and those people-from the Labor government’s view, who just wanted to close it down and get rid of it. It happens to be down in Peter Ryan’s area, which helps a lot. The Jesuits did a survey of that area around Port Welshpool and they found, as I mentioned before, that rather than it being a wealthy area it turned out that this area was quite poor and anything we could do to enhance the economy in that small township of Port Welshpool, and Welshpool, would be a fillip to the rest of the community. Why would it be a fillip? I know the two members here at the moment are not from rural Victoria but, just the same, they would understand the decline of small towns. When you have your economic indicators decreasing rather than increasing, things happen. You start to lose your stores but, worse, you lose your kinder, all of a sudden the school is under threat, perhaps you are not buying as much fuel as you were so the fuel outlet is under threat, and there is a steady spiralling down. The investment that Peter Ryan and the Liberal-National coalition have made here is going to enhance the area’s economy. It is going to grow their tourism industry, it is going to create jobs, it is going to help with disability services, it is going to break the nexus of decline in the area, and it is going to give a fillip to the whole of the community, which is now enthused about getting on with it. In Busselton in Western Australia there is an underground viewing area off the Busselton Jetty. It attracts 600,000 people a year to the Busselton Jetty to go underwater and look. We have got amazing fish and sea lions-very special species-in the area of this inlet. So the commitment to the jetty means that we will have a great opportunity to perhaps commit further funds or even for private enterprise to come in and build an underwater viewing platform. I have other dreams too. This is where the ferry to Tasmania used to leave from to go to Launceston and there are some lovely facilities there that could be enhanced with either a small train from there around to the pier and access out onto the pier or a small unit of some sort that will actually take people from one spot in Port Welshpool to another. The pub would get more business. The other areas of activity such fishing tackle, bait, and recreational fishing would all grow. All of a sudden you would have one very strong, very viable community that was previously in decline. You would have people wanting to come into that area to start new businesses and new operations. Instead of the spiral going down we would have a spiral going up. That is the good news and I thank Peter Ryan and his Nationals for the commitment that we could not deliver. I apologise for that. We had to win an election to deliver it. Perhaps one day we will get a chance to enhance what is already there-sooner rather than later I hope. MAIN COMMITTEE The Prime Minister went to New Zealand only a few weeks ago, and I should say that we have just witnessed a horrific earthquake in Christchurch and I would like to identify myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and others. We do see our relationship with New Zealand as a family one. There is not a person in Australia who does not have a friend somewhere who is either from New Zealand or associated with it. I have not been there myself, but everybody who goes there tells me it is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. I just want to identify with the pain and suffering they are going through at the moment. Having regard to that, the Prime Minister went there only a week ago, went into the parliament and announced that, regardless of the process, she will accept the umpires’ decision on New Zealand apples coming into Australia. I would just like to quote a former member of parliament. He is talking about apple growers and pear growers. He said: Instead of doing nothing for these people when they face this very genuine risk from New Zealand apples, the federal government should be saying to them, ‘We will stand with you, we will support you and we understand that the risk which you are talking about is not one which you are imagining, is not one which you have made up and is not an issue about you guys getting a subsidy. We understand that there is a very real risk that many of your orchards and properties will be substantially devalued if we allow this disease into our country.’ I reiterate clearly and passionately: Australia is still a sovereign nation. We should not kowtow to the likes of the World Trade Organisation. The role of the federal government is to stand with the apple and pear growers of Australia, not to aid and abet the World Trade Organisation and the New Zealand government to the detriment of apple and pear growers in Australia. That was Christian Zahra, the former member for McMillan, talking about apples. I am concerned about those apples coming into this country. They say to me, ‘Look, Russell, your apple growers will survive.’ Yes, I believe they will. Although there are things we can put in place, once fire blight is here we cannot get rid of it, and it will absolutely devastate our pear industry. If it gets a run here, it will devastate our pear industry. Where do many of our pears go? They go to New Zealand. I know we live in an international world and an international market and I know we are trying to get stone fruit into New Zealand, but this is an issue for this nation. There is a process that we were going through and the Prime Minister baldly said we will accept the umpires decision and bring these apples in, giving a green light to those apples coming into this country from a country we know has fire blight when we do not have fire blight. I may have lost this argument and now the apples will be coming in, but I am putting it on the record: I hope we do not rue the day when the Prime Minister of Australia went to New Zealand and made that commitment to have their apples in this country and I hope it does not destroy forever our clean, green pear industry-gone. That is the great threat. There has been an argument for a long time-from Christian Zahra in my electorate, back to Barry Cunningham, John Riggall and Barry Simon-about this very issue. Every member has stood up on behalf of his apple growers and pear growers. It is the right thing for us to do. We have to address the concerns of our community. I believe this fellow, Christian Zahra, rightly, addressed that. But he was attacking the Howard government at the time. At least Mr Howard followed process on this. I know it is a battle in the international field when it comes to one agricultural product against another. In admitting that I have lost the battle, I want to put on record my MAIN COMMITTEE great disappointment that the Prime Minister would go over and make a statement like that when there is still a process in place which she would have been advised of. These are appropriation bills. In these bills the government has a need to outline to the community why it is raising more money and where it is spending it. There is one thing I will not do: I will not pick something out of here, particularly, say, on immigration or on overseas aid in two spots here, and start telling this government or any other government how it should be spending it or setting one person against another in this nation over issues such as overseas aid or immigration. I will not do it. I will not say, ‘There is an extra $300 million going into our aid or immigration program or the need for the department to spend more money.’ If you want me to come into this place and say, ‘We should not be spending it on people coming in; we should be spending it on this school or that hospital,’ or ‘You should be getting more of a pay cut,’ and ‘Why are we sending money overseas?’ I will not divide my community on issues like this. I will not do it. It is really important for this nation. I just talked about our international argy-bargy with other people with regard to agriculture. We have international responsibilities, too, as a wealthy nation. I have spoken to Mal Washer about the Islamic schools in Indonesia, which he has visited. They are beside themselves with our support. He has visited those schools. He knows how important those schools are to the regions and the kids that they are serving-and they love Australia. We just heard from the Mongolian Prime Minister today how important the liaison is between his country and our country through education scholarships. The Prime Minister, you heard today, announced those. I will not be a divisive person on these issues. It is important that we do go out and explain to people why we spend the money that we spend. But to divide one in our community against another or set one group against another for political benefit is not my style. I will not do it, and where I see it I will stand against it and every time it raises its ugly head in this place I will stand against it again. If it eventually costs me my seat, my political activity or my career or the attacks start to come, I tell you now that you have an option: if you do not like what I do and you do not like what I say, in the election that comes up within three years you can vote against me and you can vote me out. I will say that on any issue that arises in this place. You have a choice: you can vote me out of this place. (Time expired) Dr LEIGH (Fraser) (5.59 pm)-These are exciting economic times. While many developed countries struggle with large debt burdens and double-digit unemployment, Australian public debt and unemployment are both extremely low. Business activity and consumer sentiment remain strong. The causes of the current economic boom are unprecedented. This morning, the Reserve Bank governor told a conference in Melbourne: Thus far, the demand for resources has stretched the global capacity of suppliers. Prices of key raw materials have consequently been driven upwards. As a result Australia’s terms of trade have risen sharply, to be about 65 per cent above the 20th century average level, … Even assuming the terms of trade soon peak and decline somewhat, they are nonetheless, over a five-year period, at their highest since at least Federation-by a good margin. With the terms of trade at their current level, Australia’s nominal GDP is about 13 per cent higher, all other things equal, than it would have been had the terms of trade been at their 100-year average level. Of course Australia has substantial foreign ownership in the resources sector so a good proportion of this income accrues to foreign investors. Nonetheless, probably about half of that additional 13 per cent of GDP accrues to Australians one way or another. MAIN COMMITTEE But with this growth also come new challenges. How the rapidly increasing global supply of commodities rises to meet global demand will be a critical factor in Australia’s future. David Gruen, Executive Director of the Macroeconomic Group of Treasury, said earlier this month: There are a range of possible scenarios here. One possibility, which presumes no serious prolonged adverse developments that derail the catch-up process in China and India, is that average prices for commodities remain relatively high-well above the average cost of production-for an extended period to maintain strong financial incentives for continued rapid exploration and development of new mining capacity. An alternative possible scenario is that, in the rush to exploit the current extremely high rates of profitability, so much global supply is brought on stream that commodity prices fall substantially over the next several years-back closer to the marginal cost of production, or even below it for some time. While these scenarios are both possible, it seems most likely that the terms of trade will be significantly higher on average over the next couple of decades than they were in the couple of decades preceding the current mining boom. He went on to say: A related development, and one that is likely to be relevant over the next 15 years, is increased direct competition in the non-resource parts of the Australian traded sector from China and India, with flow-on effects to employment in those sectors of the Australian economy. The most obvious parts of the Australian traded sector likely to be subject to this increased direct competition are manufacturing-especially as Chinese and Indian production moves to increasingly sophisticated manufacturing goods (for example, automobiles) as their real wages rise, but also parts of the IT sector, where lower costs, especially in India, provide a continuing incentive to outsource. The high level of the Australian dollar acts to accelerate these trends. Similarly, the RBA governor has noted: … the rise in Australia’s terms of trade over the past five years is the biggest such event in a very long time. It reflects powerful forces at work in the global economy to which our country is more favourably exposed than most. It presents opportunities and challenges. With a large boost to income, we need to think about the balance between saving and spending, because we do not know the permanent level of the terms of trade. I argue for erring on the side of saving for the time being, and I think this is by and large what is happening so far. With a large change in relative prices, we should also expect to see a good deal of structural change in the economy. As these quotations illustrate, these are exciting times to be an economic policymaker but they are challenging too. They call for a commitment to ongoing economic reform yet, sadly, that commitment has been lacking from the opposition in recent years. In contrast, Labor has a strong and proud tradition as economic reformers. Whether it is the Curtin, the Whitlam, the Hawke, the Keating or the current Labor government, this side of the House understands the need for economic reform to ensure a strong economy. Alas the opposition is currently led by a man who has described economics as a bore. Why bother with that detail when you can simply say no? To illustrate some of this confusion I would like to go back a few weeks and read you a couple of quotes from some of the leading economic spokespeople in the coalition who seemed at that stage undecided as to whether the Australian economy was strong or weak. The shadow Treasurer, speaking on ABC’s AM program on 27 January, said: Yet Australia is growing at above trend growth. We have unemployment at 5 per cent. He also said: MAIN COMMITTEE … the Labor Party in Government today is still running what’s known as an expansionary fiscal setting. They are still running a big spending budget as if Australia is suffering the impacts of a recession. On the same day, however, the shadow finance minister said in the Australian: … the economy remains soft and when households are already hurting. The economic spokespeople for the opposition cannot agree as to whether the flood levy will dampen economic activity or overheat the economy. The Leader of the Opposition, when asked about the flood levy, said: Look, er, inevitably, um, any new tax, I think, will, um, dampen economic activity. That is what he said to ABC Brisbane on 28 January. The day before, however, the shadow finance minister was telling Melbourne talk radio: You do get a sense that their first option that they always jump to is another tax, and it is unnecessary. We don’t need it, and people are feeling the heat. This is going to add to that inflationary burden. They cannot even decide whether the impact of a flood levy is going to be contractionary or expansionary. They cannot decide whether they are Arthur or Martha on this fundamental economic question. Fortunately, though, while those opposite are prevaricating, Labor is getting on with the job. Today we are talking about two important appropriations bills. These bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011, will bring about fundamental economic reform. I would like to go to four aspects of that reform now: Trade Training Centres, Active After-School Communities, flood assistance, and contributions to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. Trade Training Centres are an essential part of Labor’s recognition that we need to reinvigorate trades training for the 21st century. We need to make sure that young people receive the trades training that they need and deserve and because adding trades training to the school curriculum can increase school attendance rates. We know that schoolchildren who stay on to year 12 tend to do far better in the labour market. The government has already awarded more than $1 billion for 288 projects, benefiting 927 schools. To make that a little more concrete, I visited the Trade Training Centre that will be used by many students in the electorate of Fraser. It is a trade training centre set up for four schools. It is based at St Mary MacKillop College in Tuggeranong. It works in conjunction with St Francis Xavier College, Merici College and St Clare’s College. It will be the ACT’s first Trade Training Centre. When I went down to St Mary MacKillop College in Tuggeranong I was met by Principal Michael Lee. He was extremely enthusiastic about the potential of the trade training centre. He showed us around the building work which had started in 2010 and talked about the importance of improving vocational education and training opportunities. This is very much the next stage of the education revolution and it will underpin our nation’s prosperity and the prosperity of young Australians. In his report on the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program, released on 2 February, the Auditor-General said that the program is being delivered in a generally sound manner. Alas, the Leader of the Opposition has promised to cut nearly $1 billion from the Trade Training Centres in Schools Program. Were that to happen, that would rob 1.2 million students and over 1,800 secondary schools of the opportunity to find better pathways. It would rob those MAIN COMMITTEE students of the chance to become the next generation of electricians, brickies, hairdressers, chefs and carpenters. I would also like to talk about the Active After-School Communities program. Under these appropriations bills, $21.6 million will be provided to the Australian Sports Commission to continue the program. They aim to engage primary school aged children who would not otherwise be physically active in sport and other physical activities. This follows the ‘Play for Life’ philosophy, aiming to inspire children, their families and coaches to continue their involvement in sport outside the program. The Active After-School Communities program provides funding so that schools can work in collaboration with local sporting clubs-that little bit of seed funding that we know can be so important in providing the social glue that allows community sporting groups to work in conjunction with their local schools. Funding goes to things such as training to become community coaches and getting equipment, and provides up to 200,000 primary school age children the opportunity to take part in this program. For example, in Canberra, Basketball ACT is a registered sporting organisation and junior basketball participation rates are booming in Canberra’s north-the result of the Active AfterSchool Community sessions run by Basketball ACT coach Jesamine Wheeler. Jesamine is the winner of the 5 Star Community Coach Award in the Active After-School Communities Program for being a positive role model, delivering the ‘Play for Life’ coaching philosophy, receiving community endorsement and showing innovation in getting kids active. This legislation will also provide $121 million to assist people in Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia who have been adversely affected by the floods that began in late November last year. Those payments will go towards assisting employees, small business people and farmers who have had a loss of income as a direct result of the flooding and the severe weather. These payments have been extended to floodaffected areas of Tasmania and areas affected by Cyclone Yasi. Lastly, I would like to go to our contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. As I do so, I want to strongly associate myself with the remarks the member for McMillan made in this debate before I stood up to speak. He very honourably said, ‘I won’t divide my community on issues like this.’ The implication of that statement, as I take it, is that he is, as many in the community have been, concerned about the divisive attacks as a result of statements by the shadow minister for immigration and by the shadow parliamentary secretary assisting the Leader of the Opposition-statements which I think are unbecoming in this House and which, in the words of the member for McMillan, aim to divide Australians. I praise the contribution that he made in this debate and I only hope that more in his party will speak out on this critical issue. The government is providing AusAID with another $129 million for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Global Fund focuses on some of the world’s deadliest diseases. It provides resources for research and treatment. Australia’s new commitment will provide HIV treatment for an estimated 28,000 people, provide tuberculosis treatment for 35,000 people and allow the distribution of over a million bed nets worldwide for the prevention of malaria. These are simple interventions but they are interventions that change lives throughout the world. Global poverty is an issue that all of us bear some responsibility for. As Australians we should do our part to ensure we have a world in which fewer children contract MAIN COMMITTEE these three deadly diseases, in which fewer people have to suffer from AIDS, tuberculosis or malaria. Since 2002, the Global Fund has saved an estimated 5.7 million lives. It is an astonishing figure: around the population of New South Wales has been saved by the Global Fund. The funding is incredibly cost-effective, used to tackle diseases which, in the case of HIV, threaten to strip away people in their most productive years. Australia is pledging a 55 per cent increase on our previous three-year pledge, demonstrating our confidence in the ongoing success of the global fund. We are a partner in HIV programs in Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and the Mekong countries. The Global Fund is doing important work throughout these regions. I urge the House to support the bills. 3) 2010-2011 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011. It gives me little pleasure to deliver this speech. It appals me, in fact, that I stand here in the House as a representative of the people of Australia, my particular patch Durack, with the knowledge that Australia is being bled dry by this Labor government. With an estimated $10 billion in outright waste and mismanagement, this government should be charged with negligence-negligence towards Australian tax-earned dollars and, more importantly, negligence towards the very constituents who gave it the authority to act on their behalf. The bleak state of affairs Australia suffers at the moment could be likened to the evil stepmother being left the inheritance and the children having to contest the will. If this were a fairy story-and, God help me, I wish it were-the story would have a happy ending. Alas, the story that the purse strings are being held by and the money is being wasted by a Labor government is in fact a true story. Until this government is voted out-or abdicates, as it should do out of goodwill to the Australian people-it will never have a happy ending. We have seen $2.4 billion mismanaged and wasted in the Home Insulation Program. What did Australian taxpayers get for their money? A hundred and ninety-one house fires and the creation of a quarter of a million dodgy roofs-not value for money in anyone’s eyes-and there is still the cost of thousands of inspections to ensure roof spaces are safe. We have watched Labor spend over $1 billion on consultants since coming to government, breaking a 2007 election promise to rein in $395 million of spending by 2009-10consultants who would have had a hand in overseeing the cancelled Fuelwatch program and the abandoned GROCERYchoice scheme (after it had cost us at least $7 million); consultants who watched as the solar homes program blew out by $850 million and was then cancelled; consultants who nonchalantly administered $300 million into the Green Loans scheme, which was subsequently cancelled. Colleagues, to coin an old phrase, this government have more front than Myer. They come today to ask for more moneysplashed around the money they inherited as if there were no tomorrow they would not be here today asking for more. Before the 2010 federal election, national mayhem erupted with the talk of slugging the resource sector with a big new mining tax.

284,Mr Haase,"more of my constituents’ money, more of my money. Surely if they had notmented to finance the promised return to budget surplus by 2013. Now we know there will be a $60 billion budget black hole over 10 years even with the introduction of this great big new tax. The proposal to introduce the new tax created confusion and doubt in the international capital markets, with rumours abounding that Australia would rate as a high-risk investment destination, putting at risk future jobsMr Melham interjectinglians, including that of the member for Banks. This tax has always been about bailing the Labor government out of the massive debt it has accumulated. Now it is obvious that even this great big new tax will not result in a budget surplus. This great big new tax will not clear the debt, will not get us out of the red and will not ease interest rates. Pandemonium seems to be the order of business for this government, creating hysteria and fear amongst both national and international investors in our resources sector and ruining our international reputation. All for what? To try to cover the continuing waste of Australian taxpayers’ money. It seems that chaos abounds everywhere we look with this Labor government. This government has ignored concerns raised by a Reserve Bank board member regarding the impact on interest rates of Labor’s uncontrolled spending. Surely concerns such as this must be listened to by the government. Economic mismanagement is leading to fiscal policies that work directly against the Reserve Bank’s efforts to rein in and stabilise inflation. The everyday impact of high government deficit is higher interest rates. Small businesses and homeowners are doing it tough enough. Increased interest rates on working capital and mortgages are the last thing we need. I reiterate the reason I am standing before you today: this Labor government have come asking for more money-the gall of them! First they blew the $23 billion left to them by the Howard government, then they taxed us some more. They blew that, then they taxed us some more. They blew that and now they want to tax us some more-only this time they are getting a little more devious. They have named one of the new taxes a ‘levy’. Somewhere in the Labor den is a little Laborite dreaming up new names for taxes. I can just see him dressed in red, green and white, with a big red nose and huge black shoes, tapping a pencil on his forehead as he checks the thesaurus for tax synonyms. You do not need to be a Rhodes scholar to see a pattern emerging here: more taxes; more money to waste. If Prime Minister Gillard and her band of tax grabbers have their way, 2011 will not be known as the year of decision and delivery but will be noted in history as the year of great big new taxes. So far we are looking at a carbon tax, a petrol tax, a flood tax and a mining taxand we are only in February! I read with interest the summary of appropriations for these bills and noted the request for more money for the Immigration and Citizenship portfolio. In particular, there is ‘supplementary funding of $290 million for operational costs associated with the management of offshore asylum seekers’. I also noted funding requests under the Attorney-General’s Department to the tune of $17.6 million to reimburse state and territory legal aid commissioners for providing legal assistance in national security, people-smuggling and drug related matters. I read a MAIN COMMITTEE",260,Anzsco Classifications Mean A Retrospective View Of People That Have Been Here On 457 Vi
285,Mr Haase,"future state royalties, tax revenue and the standard of living of all Australittle further and, lo and behold, there is the Federal Police wanting $24.8 million to increase its own technical and operational capabilities, especially for people-smuggling activities. I can think of a much cheaper way of handling asylum seekers and people smugglersreintroduce the Liberal Party’s policies in full. In 2010-11 the government will spend more than $760 million on people arriving illegally in Australia. This compares to less than $100 million in annual expenditure when the Howard government left office in 2007. mentary funding for operational costs associated with the management of offshore asylum seekers represents a budget blow-out of more than 60 per cent on the $470 million already budgeted for in the current year and more than double the amount spent in 2009-10. The last boat to arrive, on 19 February, had 46 people on board and, with a recently reported average cost of $150,000 for everyone who arrives by boat, this latest arrival will cost Australian taxpayers $6.9 million. When framing their budget for 2010-11 this Labor government assumed 2,000 people would arrive illegally by boat. More than 3,600 people have arrived this financial year, with four months to go. Since the softening of border policies in August 2008 we have seen 10,250 people arrive on 208 boats and since Prime Minister Gillard took over we have seen 67 boats with 3,698 people on board. Apparently a bill of almost $2.5 million a month is being racked up by this Labor government to house some 500 asylum seekers outside detention centres as it struggles to find a solution to the record number of boat arrivals. One interesting statistic I point out to show the difference with a government that had strong border policies and was careful with taxpayers’ money, as opposed to the current Labor government, is that this budget blow-out for one year of $290 million is greater than the total cost of running the Howard government’s Pacific Solution over almost six years. out is more than the Howard government spent on the Pacific Solution over almost six years. There is something in that for all of us to think about. As I said before, I can think of a much more financially viable option for Australia when it comes to dealing with asylum seekersstop encouraging these people to come here with weak border policies. Waste, waste and more waste. This government should be ashamed, or at least embarrassed, but do we see even a hint of remorse? No, all we see is a government with a rhinoceros hide asking for more money. In recent times we have seen an estimated $8 billion wasted in the Building the Education Revolution school halls program. We observed a promised $4.7 billion broadband network replaced with a $43 billion scheme, which still does not have a business plan and now looks like being superseded by advances in wireless technology. We witnessed $50 million wasted in advertising on the stimulus package, and then they wasted $46 million of the stimulus package by sending money to people overseas, criminals and the deceased. The apathy on the opposite side of the House is truly pathetic. This is real money we are talking about, real money earned the hard way by constituents, and the government’s apathy displays the contempt with which they treat both the money and the people.

289,Mr Haase,"It is dead right and, yes, you heard me correctly-this year’s budget blowAs you are all aware, I represent the electorate of Durack, the largest electorate in Australia. It is the largest by land mass and the largest by rating the optimism of the people. For the people of Durack the glass is always half full. Just recently when talking to a constituent about the Labor government’s waste, a cocky said: ‘Well we can’t complain about waste in this neck of the woods. They haven’t spent any dollars to waste.’ And that, colleagues, is the plain and simple truth. I do not need to dress it up, put quite plainly this government has not wasted money specifically in regional Australia, disregarding of course the city-centric policies that overlapped into regional Australia. They have not wasted regional spending; they have instead cut it. Either this government is wasting billions of dollars on schemes that are irrelevant to the people of Australia or it bungles and fails. Either way it is a waste of taxpayers’ money of the highest order. In the first months of this financial year, this Labor government racked up a deficit of $21.7 billion. Net debt increased from $42.3 billion to $62 billion. Labor continues to borrow well in excess of $100 million each and every day to fund its continued spending. Net interest payments will peak at $6.5 billion per year in 2012-13. This $6.5 billion could be better spent investing in regional Australia. They do not mind taking the tax dollars from the bush but they sure as hell do not like spending any money in return. Labor’s first budget stripped $1 billion out of regional programs. The second budget stripped out even more and included an emissions trading tax. The third recommends a big new mining tax, a carbon tax, and probably a tax on petrol as well. What can we expect in their fourth budget? In a statement by the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government on Regional Development Australia made on 20 March 2008, he said amongst other things that he would support regional Australia, he would drive economic prosperity, he would deliver on pre-election promises-that was a big call-and he would build partnerships in the bush and be responsive to local priorities. These partnerships were going to improve with new investment in infrastructure, health, housing, water innovation, education and skills development. I am yet to find evidence of delivery that makes any of these statements truthful. Labor has broken its promise to expand the role of what used to be the area consultative committees. Instead, their replacement, Regional Development Australia, has no programs to administer because in the first three years it had no dollars to allocate. A whole network of regional people were selected and then given nothing to do. In the transition more than 500 voluntary committee positions were terminated and 150 jobs lost. That was in spite of repeated assurances from the Labor minister that the jobs were secure. Regional development is no longer funded direct to community organisations or to the private sector. This has added another layer of bureaucracy. Apparently this government believes that Canberra knows best, and it has instructed that all future funding decisions will be made in Canberra. Amongst other things the Labor government abolished Land and Water Australia and cut $63 million in CSIRO agricultural research. A $12 million cut has also been made in funding to the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and in the 2009-10 budget Labor cut cargo-screening resources at ports and airports by $58.1 million. This has made it much easier and more likely for animal and plant disease to enter Australia, putting our agriMAIN COMMITTEE cultural sector at risk. There is no excuse or pardon for a government that is incompetent when managing taxpayers’ funds. I do not accept it and neither should the people of Australia. Ms ROWLAND (Greenway) (6.29 pm)-I am delighted to be speaking in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011 and the cognate bill this evening. It is an opportune time, because we are hitting the six-month mark since the election in August last year. There is a question that I often get asked and which I am very happy to answer-that is, in addition to why did I decide to pursue an interest in being a member of this place and how I find it, and I can answer those in a couple of ways. The first is that, as members here may know, I come from a proud local government background. I was previously a councillor on Blacktown City Council, the largest local government area in New South Wales, as its deputy mayor. One of the reasons why I became so interested in public service was that I wanted to be able to do something that would have immediate effects on people’s lives. Some people talk about local government being the level of government that is closest to the people. For example, people who are standing in the rain one day waiting for a bus contact their local councillor and you are actually able to make something happen for them in a positive way, by getting a bus shelter put there within a short period of time. Those are the kinds of positive things you can do for people lives. The additional question people ask me now is whether that changed when I came to this place, and I am delighted to say, Madam Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou and the member for Banks, who I am sure will agree, that by working with communities you actually end up being closer to your constituency than anyone could have imagined. I would like to go through a few of those things because, as I said in my maiden speech some five months ago, we have a wide range of people and places, and a diversity of community in Greenway, as I know the member for Banks and you yourself have, Madam Deputy Speaker. To be responsive to those various communities means that you need to listen to them. As I said in my maiden speech, during the campaign I found myself doing far more listening than I had ever done in my life. Six months later, I am very proud to say-and I know the community is proud-that we have been able to work together to secure a number of very significant projects for the local community that are being delivered and that are making and will continue to make a very positive difference to people’s lives. That is the reason why we are here. The first area I want to run through is health, which obviously came up as one of the biggest issues during the election campaign, and it is one that I made sure was at the forefront during the campaign when I was listening to people and at the forefront, of course, when I was elected to this place. I am very pleased to say that, in addition to the COAG agreement that the Prime Minister announced, things can be translated to Greenway that are really going to make a difference to people’s lives and are making a difference now. I am very pleased to say that work is about to begin on the $15 million Blacktown GP superclinic. When the minister wrote to me late last year confirming that as the local member I was pleased for this to go ahead, it was with absolute delight that I was able to confirm that this was something the community said they wanted. Their main cause for concern was that we are in such a high growth area in Greenway-with not only a growth area to the north of the electorate but also a growing ageing population to the south of the electorate-that having access to quality health care was an absolute priority for many families and individuals. A GP superclinic is going to take so much pressure off the only public hospital in Greenway, Blacktown Hospital. MAIN COMMITTEE In fact, it is the hospital where I was born. SoI am very pleased that we will be able deliver substantial benefits in the form of a GP superclinic and for Blacktown Hospital itself. The other thing I wanted to mention is that the GP superclinic is coming on top of a number of other very significant funding announcements in health by the federal government. We have had a $17.6 million injection for the University of Western Sydney’s clinical school at Blacktown Hospital, which will train future doctors and nurses. Importantly-and because US is a local champion of Western Sydney-this means that young trainee doctors and nurses will be trained in Western Sydney, and, if they are trained in Western Sydney, the likelihood is that they will stay in Western Sydney. I think it is very important for young people to know that they have a career path locally and that they have that support. There is $4.2 million for new beds at Blacktown Hospital and nearly $900,000 for new equipment. When you calculate that these individual pieces of equipment can save lives, including a defibrillator, and heart monitoring and breathing machines, it shows that on the ground we can actually make a positive difference to people’s lives. There is also over $400,000 from the government’s elective surgery strategy for other equipment at Blacktown Hospital. I am also very pleased to say that funding has been delivered to ensure over 8,000 more clinical training days for local medical, nursing and allied health profession students. As I said, this is important because when you grow up locally and train locally you are then more likely to work locally. SoI am very pleased that, with the community, we have been able to argue for our fair share and I am very pleased that we are able to deliver on those commitments to the people of Greenway in the area of health. The other things I want to mention have to do with some projects in a variety of areas. The first area I want to talk about is sport. With a high growth rate of young families, sport is an integral part of life in the Greenway community. One project in particular that I want to mention is the Football New South Wales headquarters. Minister Anthony Albanese came out to announce an investment of $8 million in a project for Football New South Wales to move their headquarters to Riverstone, which is central to the north-west region growth area. Amongst other things the funding will help to construct are nine purpose-built quality football pitches, a boutique stadium, an indoor pool swimming complex and the new official Football New South Wales offices. There are no fewer than 14 local football teams in the community and all of them will benefit from this facility. I am very certain that we have a young Tim Cahill or a Harry Kewell in Greenway and that this project will make a substantial, positive benefit to the young people in my area. I also want to mention a couple of what may seem like small local grants made by the government; however, they have made a very positive difference to the lives of a number of groups in my area. Coming, as I said, from a local government background, Blacktown City Council was only recently able to announce that it had received over $5.6 million in funding from the federal government as part of a series of community infrastructure grants for five projects that I personally took up for the people of Greenway. We are now in the process of delivering them. Those projects include an upgrade to Morgan Power Reserve at Kings Park, which is just down the road from where I grew up. A $20,000 grant will go to Kings Langley Little Athletics, and here I want to mention Darren Tait. I talked before about working with people; obviMAIN COMMITTEE ously these things do not happen just by being identified by the local member. Darren Tait, from Kings Langley Little Athletics, helped to make that project happen. Also, the Riverstone Girl Guides will receive $50,000 for an upgrade of their hall. I have mentioned the Riverstone Girl Guides in this place before. I joined with them a few weeks ago to conduct a flood fundraiser. Despite the fact that they require a new hall because their hall is falling apart, they put aside their needs and helped out with that fundraiser; they put the needs of others ahead of themselves, which I thought was absolutely fantastic and a testament to those young women. They have for a long time needed a new hall, and $50,000 is going to make an incredible difference in ensuring that Riverstone Girl Guides continue and they can meet in their own facility. A project that is very close to my heart is the upgrade of the International Peace Park at Seven Hills to the tune of a quarter of a million dollars. The International Peace Park is the home ground of the Seven Hills Junior Rugby League Football Club-and I have very happily accepted being their patron. I met with a senior person from their club, John Regan, during the election campaign. When you meet local sporting people who are so committed to what they do and who get absolutely nothing in return, you see how much they want to ensure that their sport continues and that young people come up through the ranks. The club has for a very long time needed an upgrade of its park and new change facilities. During the election campaign, I was very pleased to show the then minister for sport, Kate Ellis, around there, and we were absolutely convinced of their need. This is one of the largest junior rugby league clubs in the area, and they were in desperate need of an upgrade to their facility. I happened to be walking through the Seven Hills shopping centre the other weekend when the club were having their registration day, and I could see the delight of these young people and the club’s senior personnel in having this project get off the ground. These are things that only happen when a community is working together. I am so pleased that I have had the opportunity to work with Seven Hills Junior Rugby League in bringing this project to fruition. The other area is a topic that was probably my main area of interest when I was on council, and that is the environment. When people think of the urban environment in cities such as outer Western Sydney, they might not think that it is something that is of great importance to people, but of course it is. It is of tremendous importance to people to ensure that they have open space that is well maintained and that they have facilities to be able to take their families to. I was extremely pleased to be able to deliver $765,000 in the revitalisation of Faulkland Crescent Reserve in the suburb of Kings Park. This is a suburb that borders an industrial estate, and it is a well established suburb. For many, many years, Blacktown City Council has been developing a master plan for that reserve. It was literally shovel-ready, the residents had for many years been consulted and I was able to put that case to the minister responsible at the time, Mr Tony Burke, and take him around. I saw the delight from residents who had contributed to the master plan over all those years when it was finally announced that it was able to come to fruition. I cannot tell you how pleased those residents are. This is a huge park that is going right through their suburb. Their amenities are going to be completely upgraded and it is something that has been really welcomed. As I mentioned, being in a growth area brings with it many challenges in terms of infrastructure, and one of the main challenges is, of course, roads: connecting part of the suburbs-the newly developing areas-to Schofields, Quakers Hill and Riverstone in the north. MAIN COMMITTEE The upgrades of roads there have been a significant issue for residents for many years. Bear in mind that many of these areas do not even have footpath paving or guttering of any kind, yet they are in urban areas. We were able to secure $4,550,000 for the upgrade of a significant road through Quakers Hill called Burdekin Road. This is an example of being able to take some leadership in infrastructure and put in the necessary road improvements before houses come. How often do we say we should not go planning and putting in houses until we have the necessary transport, schools and other infrastructure links in place? This is really an example of listening to the community-listening to the concerns of local residents and also the council, which is very well informed on these matters-and being able to deliver. I can honestly say, as someone who traverses the long electorate of Greenway on a regular basis to be in touch with my constituency, that this is really going to make a significant difference in the quality of life of people when they move into those suburbs. I want to say something else about some local projects in the area of Building the Education Revolution. I have now gone to many of the openings, every one of which has been absolutely well received. It has been an absolute delight to be able to meet with parents, students and teachers, each of whom has welcomed the projects that have been delivered. The member for Banks will agree with me on this: how many times do you go to these schools for these openings and hear them say: ‘This would not have happened. We have needed this for so many years. We have needed this hall. This school has been standing for 50 years and we have needed it, and it simply would not have happened if not for the BER.’ I was very pleased that Deputy Prime Minister Wayne Swan was able to attend the opening of my new electorate office in Seven Hills just before Christmas. We had a number of community members who were at that function, and it was a fantastic occasion. I thank him again for taking the time to come. In his speech he talked about the BER and in response, without even being prompted, so many people-community members that I have had occasion to deal with-said the same thing. How good is it that we have been able to have a policy which kept the good, hard working men and women of Western Sydney in work and invested in education, which is the great enabler for young people in Western Sydney to be able to get ahead in life? A policy that was fulfilled and was able to combine those two things is really an example of the community and government working together. Dr STONE (Murray) (6.44 pm)-I make the point in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011 that there needs to be more expenditure in Australia on a particularly difficult problem we face as a result of our culture of drinking. I know this government, as did previous governments, recognises the problem of alcohol abuse but we need to spend more time and effort on recognising foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. Alcohol consumption is a part of the Australia way, and it has been since 1788. We all know about the Rum Rebellion, when alcohol was part of our exchange system because other money was difficult to get. A 2010 study from the Western Australian Department of Health found that 86 per cent of people in Western Australia over 14 stated that they drink alcohol, while 10 per cent say they drink on a daily basis. Most Australians consume alcohol at a low level and at a level that does not affect their health. In fact it is part of their general recreational pursuits. However, this Western Australian Department of Health study indicates that 41 per cent of the sample reported that they drink at levels that do put them at risk of shortMAIN COMMITTEE term harm-that is, binge drinking-and 11 per cent reported that they are at risk of long-term harm to their health. The highest rates of drinking at harmful levels occurred with teenagers and young adults; 31 per cent of 20to29-year-old women reported that they are binge drinking at least monthly; and 12 per cent said that they binge drink at least weekly. The study defined binge drinking as ‘five or more standard drinks per occasion’. At least 23 per cent of teenage girls said they binge drink monthly and 11½ per cent said they binge drink weekly. When you realise that about half of all pregnancies in Australia are not planned, that we have some of the highest rates of teenage pregnancies in the developed world and that the numbers are getting higher, it becomes extremely concerning that the very high rates of alcohol consumption are amongst our teenage girls and young adult women. Many of these pregnancies are well advanced, and alcohol consumption has been continuing, before the woman even realises she is pregnant. Two key factors contribute to foetal harm from prenatal alcohol exposure. The first is the timing of the drinking during the pregnancy. It is generally considered that the first trimester is the most dangerous time for damaging the brain and other parts of the developing baby. The second factor is the intensity of the exposure. However, low levels of alcohol consumption during critical times of foetal development can also result in foetal harm. Unfortunately, women with a drinking problem are the least likely to access antenatal care, compared to other women in Australia. This means babies may be born with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or FASD, or foetal alcohol syndrome, commonly called FAS. This is an irreversible and 100 per cent preventable cause of brain damage, often associated with physical disabilities. This is about babies born in Australia in the 21st century-we should not ever tolerate one baby being born with these permanent and debilitating conditions. Why am I talking about these things in parliament in February 2011? The problem is that we do not even know in Australia how many children do have foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. We do not have any routine screening for alcohol use during pregnancy, and so very often a woman who is pregnant when she presents to a doctor, gynaecologist or obstetrician is not even warned about the dangers of consuming alcohol. I have already mentioned that up to 50 per cent of women do not know they are pregnant for quite a few months anyway. There is a lack of standardised routine data collection for monitoring and evaluating maternal alcohol use in pregnancy, and research into pregnancy, infant and child outcomes is inadequate. There is a lack of routine screening of infants and children known to be at risk of harm from prenatal alcohol exposure. For example, there is still no effort to diagnose FASD in infants whose mothers are known to be dependent on alcohol. Health professionals have limited knowledge of the diagnostic criteria for FASD and many are reluctant to make a diagnosis for fear of stigmatising the family or simply getting it wrong. Few health professionals have been assessing children for foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. One of the problems is that it is only since the 1970s that this disorder has received much attention in the medical professional journals and numbers of our health service professionals were trained before that time. It is very difficult to obtain a sound picture of the social and economic impacts of FASD in Australia. There are no Australian studies of the costs of MAIN COMMITTEE FASD for individuals or for communities. The prevalence data for FASD in Australia is both underestimated and incomplete. It is not possible to determine the current population costs. However, I want to commend the Gillard government for announcing a $1 million grant to support a key Indigenous children study which aims to identify the prevalence of this alcohol spectrum disorder in some Indigenous communities in remote Western Australia. Let me stress, however, that FASD is not an Indigenous condition or something that is only found in indigenous communities around the world. It is a problem in the population of Australia as a whole. It just so happens that, given the socioeconomic status and the alcohol consumption and abuse in a lot of our Indigenous communities, there is a higher incidence of foetal alcohol spectrum disorder at this time. We have to rely on FAS or FASD studies from outside of Australia to understand what sorts of outcomes there are when a child is born with the intellectual and physical disabilities associated with exposure to alcohol during foetal development. In the United States, in a study of 415 patients aged six to 51 years old, 90 per cent were found to have mental health problems, 60 per cent had disrupted education, 30 per cent had alcohol and other drug misuse problems and 50 per cent had inappropriate sexual behaviour-those were people 12 years and over. Antisocial behaviour, alcohol and substance use and abuse and mental health problems are common in individuals who are affected. They are often not able to have an independent life. This is a serious condition for individuals who, through no fault of their own, were born with this condition. The potential adverse life outcomes for individuals have also been studied elsewhere. There are studies showing that 60 per cent of people diagnosed with FASD end up in trouble with the law, and 50 per cent have experienced confinement in detention, jail, or a psychiatric or drug or alcohol related inpatient setting. This is a condition that has major impacts, and not only on the individual but on their family and their community. Individuals with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder very often become involved with the criminal justice system. They may not understand the arrest and court process. They have diminished competency and capacity and often do not fully grasp the severity of the situation. At the moment, there is an inquiry being run through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs that is looking at juvenile offending in Australia among our Indigenous populations. We have taken evidence that numbers of the juvenile offenders from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities would seem to be suffering from foetal alcohol spectrum disorder. That is a great shame, given that this is a totally preventable condition. Prevention is about understanding the relationship between alcohol and complex psychosocial issues, including aspects of the history and culture of a community. It is about poverty, lack of information and education, addiction to alcohol and the extent to which those in our medical profession understand or want to learn about this condition. There are a range of prevention efforts that all require very special strategies. These must be aimed at the whole population as well as specific groups, such as school age children, adolescents, women of childbearing age, pregnant women and high-risk women. I was very pleased to see that one of our beer companies very recently stated that it would begin to put labelling on their beer, warning that alcohol could be a risk to health. I am disappointed that they did not go a little further and say ‘in particular, in relation to pregnancies and MAIN COMMITTEE the health of the unborn child.’ When that statement was made by the beer company, it was unfortunate that, almost at the same time, our wine producers were saying that any further labelling of their product-referring to wine-as dangerous for the unborn and that it should not be consumed during pregnancy, was considered too much information to put on a label and was not appropriate. When we export our wines into countries like the United States, in some states we have to include that information on the label; it is a legal requirement. In Australia we have recommendations from our National Health and Medical Research Council saying that no alcohol should be consumed during pregnancy, given the dangers to the unborn. Foetal alcohol syndrome is the most common preventable non-genetic cause of intellectual disability. The broader spectrum of disability associated with exposure of the foetus to alcohol in pregnancy involves considerable morbidity and costs to society-not to mention the costs to the individual in lost life opportunity. The effects of FAS and FASD occur in early childhood and persist throughout life. In the special schools in my own electorate, which I visit very regularly, I find particularly poignant the numbers of children with foetal alcohol spectrum disorder, because in each of those cases it was totally preventable. With the assistance of some of my colleagues on both sides of the House, I am going to organise a group of parliamentarians who will do all they can to bring about a change in the Australian community’s attitude to the drinking of alcohol during pregnancy. Of course any other alcohol abuse is not to be tolerated, but this is particularly for women drinking during pregnancy. I want to commend the then Senate Select Committee on Regional and Remote Indigenous Communities for putting recommendation No. 14 into their final report in 2010. It asks that: ... the Commonwealth considers the development of a communication strategy to provide simple, practical advice to parents and guardians caring for a child with Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder, and that the status of FASD as a recognised disability is clarified to ensure that parents, caregivers, schools and communities are able to provide adequate support to children with FASD. This is most important. At this point in time we do not even have recognition of FASD as a disability, so it is so much harder for carers to seek and receive adequate support. Very many of the children with FASD or FAS end up in foster care or care beyond their family, so it is even more important that the community is educated about the symptoms of foetal alcohol syndrome and what can be done to give these children every chance to live an independent life. I am very pleased that the women of Fitzroy Crossing, in particular the Indigenous women, have taken up this extremely difficult issue for their community. They have presented the problem to the United Nations at an international forum. They have been courageous in addressing the alcohol problems of their community. The early prevalence study reveals that maybe as many as 50 per cent of their children are suffering from this condition into the second generation and that the school in that community will have to have very special support. That support is going to be provided to make sure all of those children and their carers are given a chance. But of course the most important thing is that that community, like other Indigenous and non-Indigenous communities right across Australia, understand that it is not wise to drink at any time during pregnancy. MAIN COMMITTEE All women and men in Australia need to understand that alcohol and pregnancy are a dangerous mix. It is not simply against the human rights of the child to be born with a disability that is 100 per cent preventable; it is a permanent problem for them and for the community. to take this opportunity-in the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011-to update the House on some developments in my local community: in particular in relation to commitments that had been made prior to the 2010 election and also commitments that had been made during the course of the last term of parliament, many of which have now been delivered and some of which are well and truly underway. BeforeI report on the progress of those particular projects, I will comment on some of the initiatives that we proposed during the course of the 2010 election campaign. One of the commitments that we made was a commitment of $1 million to an upgrade of the Western Sydney International Hockey Centre’s fields. The hockey fields are a regional facility, and they are home to many games not just throughout the weekends but on weeknights as well. They really are the centre of hockey in the greater Penrith region. The facilities have been there for some years, but unfortunately over that time they have fallen into a state of disrepair. That has meant that in recent years one of the two hockey fields has not been available for use for hockey. The granting of this $1 million for the upgrade of these facilities will go a long way towards addressing those difficulties. The commitment that we made was to provide $1 million to upgrade both of the hockey fields and, to the extent that there are any funds left over, to apply those funds for the purpose of embellishing and improving the surrounds of the hockey fields. I would like to take the opportunity to thank the University of Western Sydney, on whose premises the hockey fields are located-in particular the vice-chancellor, Professor Janice Reid, and also Rhonda Hawkins-for their assistance in facilitating this particular project. I acknowledge Tony Geange from uwsconnect, who was also involved in the project. On the hockey side, I make special mention of Noelene Knowles and Pat Hurley, who have been great advocates of this project for some time and have undertaken a considerable amount of work at the preliminary stages to ensure that we had a proposal that was suitable for a funding application. Whilst processes take some time, and it looks as though the university is working through the implementation of this funding, we look forward-if not later in this season then certainly for the season next year-to new or upgraded hockey fields being available for use not just for local players but for players from further afield. Another commitment that we made in the course of the election campaign was $200,000 in community safety funding under the program for CCTV, which is an initiative that the minister, Brendan O’Connor, came out to Penrith to announce. These funds will be applied not just for the purposes of CCTV but also to improve general levels of safety in the area that is located between Westfield Penrith Plaza and the Joan Sutherland Performing Arts Centre. This is an area that has become idle loitering space, if you like, for many of the young people in the area. On a Thursday night in particular, after frequenting the shopping centre, they will hang around in this area, which can sometimes cause a little bit of concern to those that might be attending a show at the performing arts centre or doing some shopping themselves. I would like to acknowledge Mr Antony Keenan, who is the centre general manager at Westfield. AnMAIN COMMITTEE",262,Anzsco Classifications Mean A Retrospective View Of People That Have Been Here On 457 Vi
290,Mr Bradbury (Lindsay,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (6.59 pm)-I risetony is a young person himself but a man with great passion and someone who is working very hard with local young people and other stakeholders to ensure that there are activities there to keep young people engaged in their spare time, particularly on a Thursday night and particularly in this space. The space is commonly known in the local area as the Mondo, and I know that this funding will go a long way towards improving that area and lifting the overall levels of safety for all concerned. In the course of the election campaign we also made a commitment to expand our commitment to the Cumberland Conservation Corridor. Prior to the 2007 election we committed $15 million to expanding the conservation corridor. Subsequent to that commitment, working closely with the New South Wales state government, we were able to apply those funds towards the purchase of the former Airservices Australia site at Cranebrook, a 181-hectare site containing several important and critical remnants of native vegetation. Having preserved that site, which now forms a very central part of the Cumberland Conservation Corridor, at the last election we committed to provide an extra $7½ million to build upon that. This corridor connects up with the regional park on the ADI site and the other areas secured as part of the commitment we made back in 2007. That commitment was to secure the bushland on the Orchard Hills defence site and to set aside, for future preservation, the Airservices site at Shanes Park. All of these sites are connected, particularly through South Creek and Ropes Creek, forming a flora and fauna corridor throughout Western Sydney. These funds will help with acquisition and further tree planting in order to augment the Cumberland Conservation Corridor. Those were some of the commitments made in the course of the last election campaign. But I want to take the opportunity to update the House on some of the projects that are currently being delivered in my electorate. Perhaps the most significant one, not just because of the dollars involved but because of its impact on the local community, is the $96.4 million investment in the redevelopment of the Nepean District Hospital. This is an investment that will massively increase the capacity of a hospital that is located at the centre of one of the key growth areas in outer Western Sydney. As part of this funding, there will be six additional operating theatres; extra day-only and extended day-only beds; two new purpose-built, 30-bed surgical wards to replace the older wards; a new surgical outpatient clinic; a new 12-bed intensive care pod, including six more Intensive Care Unit beds; a new renal dialysis unit for hospital inpatients; significantly, a new 64-bed mental health unit and community mental health facilities; and an extra 32 chairs in the oral health building. These investments are well and truly underway. Anyone that has driven past or walked past the Nepean hospital site will see that the buildings are well and truly under construction and we look forward to those works progressing to their completion-to deliver the sorts of health services and health infrastructure that a growing community such as mine not only requires but deserves. I acknowledge the important contribution of Professor Michael Peek, in particular, to securing funds for the Nepean Clinical School, which is located adjacent to the Nepean District Hospital. The funding of $17.2 million will ensure that we have a first-rate, state-of-the-art teaching clinic-a clinical school-opposite the Nepean District Hospital. This will ensure that the teaching hospital that the Nepean hospital has become is also a place where young student doctors will, hopefully, have the opportunity to get a better sense of the community-to sink MAIN COMMITTEE their roots, so that in the future they not only contribute productively as doctors to our community but also become an important part of it. I acknowledged Professor Peek. There are many outstanding doctors operating at the hospital, many of whom live in our local community. I know that this is a philosophy that they are keen to foster. All of this health spending will, I think, ensure that we have the capacity that we need. But, most importantly, it will ensure that the nurses and other assisting staff doing outstanding work under difficult circumstances at Nepean District Hospital will start to have the facilities that they need in order to do their job and do it well. I recently attended a function held by the Penrith Cricket Club at CUA Stadium. In attendance at that event was Richie Benaud, that great icon of the game of cricket. Richie was, of course, born in Penrith. In coming back to re-establish that connection many years later, he spoke very highly of the facilities that are now on offer in our local community. Within eyesight was the work currently being undertaken at the Howell Oval, which is the centrepiece of cricket in our district and is adjacent to CUA Stadium, which is where our rugby league is played. Together they are establishing the nucleus of an important sports precinct along Mulgoa Road. The work has had $5 million allocated to it. About $3 million has been dedicated to the upgrade of the Howell Oval pavilion. The other $2 million has gone towards improvements at the southern end of CUA Stadium. These improvements, whilst not complete, are certainly very visible to the onlooker. You can see that tremendous work has been undertaken and that the improvements are not far away from being completed. One of the items that I have spoken about in this place before is my commitment to delivering a healthy river. The Nepean River is a great artery that channels through the centre of my electorate. The health of that river is so important to our community. That is why it was so important when our government committed $77 million to improving the health of the river. To provide some feedback on what that has achieved-and I am sure there are many scientific studies and analyses that will demonstrate that that work has been worthwhile-a couple of months ago there was a sighting of a platypus in the Penrith sewage treatment plant. The sewage treatment plant is connected by various waterways to the Nepean River. I am told that it is the first time that a platypus has been sighted within the catchment in a very long time. In large part, that is a testament to the improvements in water quality. So if it is good enough for the platypus, it is good enough for all the young people in Penrith, on the scorching hot days that we get throughout the summer, pushing up around 45 degrees, to go and have a swim in the Nepean River, as so many of their parents and grandparents have done previously. I also note that I have spoken at length in the past about the $500,000 commitment we made towards the aquatic weed harvester. It is almost like a lawnmower on the water to chop away the salvinia and other aquatic weeds. The Nepean Rowing Club have taken a delegation to see me on a few occasions to raise the fact that the work of the aquatic weed harvester had not been extending out to the front of their facility. I took the opportunity to write to the New South Wales Minister for Water, Phillip Costa, to see whether or not he was able to provide any assistance to better resource the Hawkesbury River County Council as they undertake their weed management activities. He wrote back to me on 22 February. This is good news. He has indicated that he has made available some seed funding, the amount of $20,000, to ensure that further activity can occur in ripping up those weeds out the front of the Nepean MAIN COMMITTEE Rowing Club so that our rowers can continue to undertake their activities on the river. So that was a good little win. Congratulations to Phillip Costa. I hope that in the future we get a longer term commitment from the state government for funding for those activities. I recently had the pleasure of attending the opening of the Barnardos homework centre at Cranebrook. They received some funding from the federal government but they also received funding from a philanthropic organisation within the property industry. As result of those funds, a new homework centre has been established in the middle of Cranebrook, servicing a disadvantaged community. Many of the residents in that part of Cranebrook are facing a range of challenges. It is an area that has been typically characterised by a high concentration of department of housing accommodation. Over time, that has created a challenging environment. From working very closely with Barnardos, I know that many of the young people who may have otherwise found themselves going off on the wrong track have been able to be steered back in the right direction as a result of the work of Barnardos. I acknowledge Barnardos, in particular Stephen Cole, who has been the inspiration behind that project. He has done an outstanding job in making it all happen. It is a great privilege to be in this place, representing my community. One of the things that I am very proud of is that I have been, and continue to be, part of a government that is delivering real improvements and real projects that are making a difference in my community. (Time expired) Ms O’DWYER (Higgins) (7.14 pm)-I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 20102011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2010-2011. I do it on the basis that the government have made some quite preposterous claims. The government said before they were elected that they were going to be economic conservatives, that they were going to be great economic reformers and that they were going to be good, strong economic managers. Very sadly for the Australian people, not one of these claims is true. One only has to look at these appropriation bills to find evidence of that. We need only look at the border protection policy of the government to see that they have had huge blow-outs in the border protection budget. The government claimed, when it changed the policy in August 2008, that it would have different policies from the previous coalition government. It claimed it would be more compassionate but that it would be equally successful at deterring people smugglers and deterring people from getting on leaky boats to come to this country in dangerous circumstances. There could be nothing further from the truth. Since the change in the government’s policy in August 2008 the number of boats that have arrived in Australia is 208, and counting, and the number of people who have arrived is upwards of 10,250. Very tragically, lives have been lost and families have been torn apart. But rather than look to the failures of its policy, rather than change its policy, this government ploughs on. It ignores the human tragedy, and we see in this appropriations bill some of the serious economic impacts. In Appropriation Bill (No. 3) there is an extra $290 million for running costs in the blowout this year of offshore asylum seeker management. In Appropriation Bill (No. 4) there is $152.8 million in additional capital expenditure for the establishment of the Northam detention centre and the Inverbrackie detention centre, which has previously announced by the government. This is very interesting. The government has made much of the fact that it cannot pick up the telephone, speak to the President of Nauru and again begin offshore processing directly in Nauru. One of the great claims why this cannot occur and why, instead, it must MAIN COMMITTEE pursue the East Timor solution-which we know will never happen-is the terrible cost of the program. Senator Evans said in February 2008 that the Pacific solution was very costly, ultimately unsuccessful and that part of the reason for its lack of success was this extraordinary cost. We have done our homework and looked at the figures. The cost of running this program is $289 million. That is less than what the government is asking for this year with its budget blow-out. And it would cost much less to run the Pacific solution for almost six years, based on the government’s own statements, than what the government is asking for to cover the cost of its policy failures for less than a six-month period. So this is not part of the solution, but this is not the only area that the government has claimed to want to reform. It has also claimed that it wants to have great new tax reform. The government spent just over $10 million asking the Secretary of the Department of Treasury to conduct a tax review. It said that this was the most comprehensive tax review that had ever been conducted and that this review would form the basis of its great tax reform. There were 138 recommendations that came out of the Henry tax review. One of these recommendations was to introduce a new mining tax. Well, surprise, surprise-this was the only recommendation that the government liked. In fact, it liked it so much that it took it to the election and, despite the fact that the mining tax will have a significant impact on Australian businesses and jobs, it will proceed with its flawed mining tax, having stitched up a deal with a number of mining companies before the last election. We should look back on the Henry tax review. It said that we had just on 125 existing taxes. This government has added an extra tax, the mining tax. It said before the last election that it would not be looking to deliver a carbon tax but already this promise has been broken. The government is now looking to when it can actually introduce this carbon tax. The latest example of the government’s supposed tax reform is the new disaster tax, the flood tax, that we are now debating in the other chamber. It is probably useful to refer to the American humorist Art Buchwald, who said: Tax reform is taking the taxes off things that have been taxed in the past and putting taxes on things that have not been taxed before. This is certainly a mantra that the government knows well and it is certainly the mantra that they live by. We should compare the government’s tax record to that of the previous coalition government, which is a much better record. It is a record that the present government could learn from. When we were in government we lowered the tax rates-at the top level, from 47 per cent to 45 per cent and, at the lowest level, from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. This of course had a very direct impact on Australian families. It made it much easier for Australian families to save their money, because they did not have to contribute so much in tax. We increased the income tax thresholds across the board, again, making it easier for Australian families to save and to then choose how to spend their money, whether it be on educating their children through the independent school sector, on new business initiatives or on a whole variety of things. The choice was absolutely with them. We cut the company tax rate from 36 per cent to 30 per cent, again, making it easier for companies to do business and to employ Australians. We also introduced the concessional 50 per cent tax rate on capital gains. But probably the most extensive reform that the coalition government brought into effect was the GST reform, aimed at bringing about a fairer tax system for Australians whereby we MAIN COMMITTEE were then able to provide further tax relief through tax cuts in 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007. The GST reform replaced the wholesale sales tax and nine different state taxes and provided a source of funding for the states. Today in the other chamber we are also dealing with the introduction by this government of a new flood tax. The government claims that it requires this $1.8 billion flood tax in order to preserve its current fiscal management. It claims that, in addition to imposing this tax, it will make cuts to expenditure and that this balance is the right balance. Of course, nothing could be further from the truth. The supposed expenditure cuts that the government says it will bring into effect have already disappeared before our very eyes. They have disappeared because, in order to secure the support of the Australian Greens, just over $340 million which was going to be cut from various government programs that the government said were superfluous to the needs of the Australian people has in fact gone back onto the books. They have cut a deal with the Greens. But they have not just cut a deal with the Greens; they have also cut a deal with the member for Denison. He has his own claims. He wants $50 million that was to be cut from the teaching program to go back onto that program, which means that almost 25 per cent of the expenditure cuts that the government claimed they would bring into effect do not now exist. Despite the fact that we have asked the government repeatedly whether they are going to make further expenditure cuts, they have been silent on this matter and they have told the opposition that we must wait and see what cuts they are going to bring forward in the budget. The government claim that they are going to put on the Australian people a $1.8 billion flood tax because it is the right thing to do. It is the first time in history that a disaster tax has been imposed on the Australian people. Normally, when unforeseen events occur, those unforeseen events and disasters are dealt with out of consolidated revenue. This creates a very new precedent-dare I say a dangerous precedent-and in fact the recent inquiry that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics held into the flood tax supports the view that this is a very bad precedent. Economists appeared before the committee and Professor McKibbin, who is a very senior economist and a member of the Reserve Bank board, presented strong evidence that to bring in a disaster tax, to respond by taxing, would create a very bad precedent in terms of the broader economic framework. This was supported by another very senior economist, Mr Saul Eslake, who also said that this was a very bad precedent. Not only is it a bad precedent; both economists also spoke of the churn factor involved in actually collecting a tax such as the $1.8 billion flood tax. The fact is that, because some exemptions apply because of the way this tax will operate, a substantial amount of the tax will be going into paying for the administration costs of the tax. We simply ask the government to be serious when they talk about reform and make the expenditure cuts that we know they can make. We have made the offer to the government that we would be prepared to sit down with them, to actually go through things line by line to find those expenditure cuts so that the government can live within their means. They have rejected that offer. Despite the fact that we have been rejected, we have put in place our own expenditure cuts that we would bring forward in order to ensure that the government live within their means, just like they ask all Australians to live within their means. MAIN COMMITTEE There is another element that the government needs to address, and that is further tax reform. As I said before, it made very great fanfare of the fact that it would be implementing serious tax reform. We saw nothing come from the Henry tax reform except for a new mining tax, and the government promised the Independents on receiving their support to form government after the last federal election that it would put in place a tax summit. The Independents are probably scratching their heads because they have heard nothing further about this great tax summit. Questions directed to the Treasurer, Wayne Swan, about when this will be, what date will be set and who will be invited are all met with stony silence. This goes to demonstrate that this government is not serious about tax reform; the only reform it believes in is implementing new taxes-a carbon tax, a mining tax and a flood tax. We do not believe that this is good reform. We believe that this will bring new costs for Australian families. It will hurt them further because it will put upward pressure on interest rates and it will increase the cost of living for Australian families. It is the wrong thing to do, and we do not support the government’s new taxes. Debate (on motion by Mrs Griggs) adjourned.
