They have expressed their opposition to proper and legitimate authority being exerted to secure constitutional government in Brisbane, and were prepared to allow the disorderly rabble which had temporarily taken charge of the city to remain in control of it . That is the logical outcome of their statements. The honourable member for Brisbane, a man I lissworn to uphold the laws of the country, Its spoke of the rebels as "" noblemen,"" and said that he was glad to be associated with In it are them, but this is what was published in the official organ of the Waterside Workers' Federatipn of Australia' Its leaders and spokesmen, by their errors, excesses, recklessness, and ambition, are bringing dishonour to the party, and compromising the cause by causing, as they did a few weeks ago, a disaster to unionism in Brisbane. Their excess of fanaticism was not even excusable, as the. Court granted the tram men the laudable object for which they asked. They swept away the Constitutional method of obtaining their demands, and; as the result of tbeir methods, they lost prestige, lost the strike, and caused endless pain and suffering.

8,Mr Palmer,"The Attorney-Generaldeal with some unworthy ideals which are being countenanced by the Government. In this connection I desire to say that a Government is responsible, not only for its overt and positive acts, but also for the light and leading which it gives to the people generally in regard to important matters. Quite a number of paragraphs have appeared in the public press from time to time expressive of the determination of labour unions to considerably reduce the hours of toil. They wish to make conditions easier. "" Do as little as you can, and get as much for it as you can,"" appears to be their motto. I wish to call special attention to one of these resolutions, because it appears to have the endorsement of the Prime Minister. It was published in the Argus of 10th June of the present year, and subsequently that newspaper printed the f o l l o w i ng : Mr Fisher was asked on Saturdayi f he was in accord with the resolution which had been passed by the Labour Congress in Sydney, to the effect that there should be established a, working week of six days of five hours each. In reply he remarkedSomebody once said something about hitching one's wagon to a star, and I think that is very good advice in this matter. I do not think that the drudgery of life can be too much relieved. Labour as we know it now is indeed a drudgery. I do not pretend to know to what particular star the Prime Minister has hitched his car. more probably attached it to a rooster than to a star. If I were asked what particular rooster, I would say, "" The gold-bespangled rooster who is in charge of the Home Affairs Department."" But, on further consideration, I do not think that that is the particular star to which the Prime Minister has attached his car. In my imagination I see certain falling stars. These stars for a moment captivate and rivet attention, but they soon pass into oblivion, and are heard of no more. I feel perfectly satisfied that it is to one of these stars that the Prime Minister has attached his political wagon. I come now to the serious part of this business. I say that no great nation can ever be built up without strenuous and energetic effort on the part of its people. To my mind, eight hours for labour, eight hours for recreation and mental enjoyment, and eight hours for sleep is a fair division of the day. But the unions, who control the Government, are forcing it in the direction of reducing the hours of labour to such an extent that our people will become effete. Does the Prime Minister suppose for a moment that it is possible to adopt a five hours' day for six days a week for the whole community? Andi f it cannot be extended to all why should it be extended to any? Would! the honourable gentleman give it to the housemaids as well as to the workmen in thefields? And if we give it to the housemaids, can we extend the same privilege to the housewives? I fear that one result of the determination of the men to thus reduce the hours of labour will be to impose increased toil upon the housewives. I would also point out that this proposed reduction in the hours of labour means a corresponding diminution in the production of the land. If the production of the land be seriously interfered with, the amount of wealth in the community will be considerably diminished. Who will feel the disastrous effects of that first ? Will it be the fairly well-to-do, the rich, and the opulent ? Wherever the available amount of cash and of good things is reduced, the first adverse effects are felt by those whom honourable members opposite are supposed specially to protect, and who are least able to protect themselves. For the maintenance of this fair land of Australia and its development, as we would fain have it developed, it is absolutely necessary that those who are in the prime and vigour of life should put energy, stress, vigilance, and skill into their work, and It appears to me that he has seek to do not as little, but as much as they can for their own advancement and for the genera] good.. Evidently, expert and active men are not wanted by the party in power. The policy of the Liberal party is to encourage men to do their best. The policy of the people who are behind the present Government is to enforce conditions und'er which men shall not do their best. A short time ago two men who were particularly skilled in bricklaying in Melbourne wanted to have a competition to decide who could lay the most bricks, in a proper, tradesman-like way, in a given time. The matter was made public and attracted a good deal of interest, but the organizers of the Labour movement stepped in and put their foot upon it, with the result that the competition never took place. They did not want to have it demonstrated how much a man could do. What they want to demonstrate is how little a man can do, and yet demand full wages. The President of the Arbitration Court, Mr Justice Higgins, was recently examining Mr Peter Macdonald, secretary of the Mildura branch of the Rural Workers Union. On the question of piece-work and speeding up,. this was Mr Macdonald's I mention that I touch every member upon, utteranceSpeeding up' was against the interest of the for anything that affects us so directly. At men's health, and he, therefore, could not agree the Hobart Labour Conference a certain to piece-work. If some men were more expert notice of motion appeared on the agendathan others, the worse should get the minimum paper. It is to the honour of the Conferpay or be dischargedBut the Labour unions always object to a fact that any union of men could adopt man being discharged if he happens to be such a motion and forward it to the Cona unionist, and if an inferior workman ference for endorsement is, in my judgment, were discharged, it is ten chances to one that it would cause a -strike, so that this simply staggering. evidence will hardly bear investigationand the best should get high wages. He was always willing to make concessions for aged and infirm men. I seriously question whether the union officials are willing. A man has to show that he is very inferior indeed before he can obtain the sanction of the Court to work for less than the prescribed rate of pay. They are rigidly conservative in that aspect of the case. right to live as well as the fast one? but the Labour unions are introducing conditions which make it ' impossible for any one who is past his prime to get employment. Many men who were in their, prime in the unions a few years ago are now beginning to experience that condition. Now that they are past their prime the unions do not conserve their interests as they did when they were in their prime. In other words, all this legislation is in the interests of the men who are best able to look after themselves, and against the interests of the poor* necessitous, and, -comparatively -speaking, inefficient men. In the Rural Workers Union the same condition is being introduced, and for the same reason piece-work is not to be undertaken. Piece-work means that a skilled worker will receive vastly more than the unskilled one. These unions are opposed to it, because they do not want any man to put forth his best effort. that? dences all over Australia that they want to get as much as they can for doing as little as they can. I wish to refer now to what appears to be still another unworthy ideal, an outcome of the condition of things which is being engendered under the aegis of Labour and Socialistic Governments. The want of fairness in the minds of men is simply appalling. This matter affects the Electoral Branch, and I am sure that when the raw, because we are always keenly alert ence that it was not carried; but the very The motion was as follows :That Conference consider the desirability of urging the Federal Labour Government to appoint labour supporters, where practicable and other things being equal, as officials at the polling booths in connection with Federal pollings. That is a poser. It is simply astounding that so unfair and partisan a proposition could find a lodgement in any brain. Let us consider it in the light of what happened recently in South Australia. An article headed "" Electoral Irregularities"" was published in the Melbourne Herald of the 4th January, 1912. It dealt with grave irregularities practised in the State to which I refer by certain men whose names I want to put on record. They have since resigned their positions as justices of the peace because of those irregularities. They were E. L . W. Klauer, M . L . C , W. G. Clough, F. C. Hahn, and T. B. Merry, all leading lights of labour. Here is a motion favouring the appointment, wherever practicable, of none but labour supporters to the office of returning officers for the Commonwealth; and here in the ranks of the labour unions is arevelation of corruption such as has never been made in regard to any other political body in Australia. I wish now to refer to another matter connected with the electoral arrangements. Under the Constitution, the Commissioners are at liberty to adopt one-fifth more or one-fifth, less than the quota; so that if the quota be 40,000, they may make an electorate of 48,000 in a town, or in a country electorate with only 32,000 electors. That has been the principle observed in the State of Victoria so long as I have any political recollection. I do not know the position in the other States; but,, whatever it may be, we have found in Victoria that the difficulties of country representatives have been increased as compared with those of town representatives. The areas are so extended in the country that it is extremely difficult for a man to get over the whole of his electorate. I venture to say that, in my own case, there are many districts of considerable importance, which,.",15,Speech Address In Reply

12,Mr Palmer,"There are many evialthough I have represented the constituency for some time, I have been unable to visit. This equalizing of the number of people .to be represented in the town constituencies is, I take it, the result of an Executive act. That may or may not be so; but, if .it is, it will bring considerable odium on the Government in the country. The electors will be alive to the fact that this particular method-for I take it that the report of the Commissioners will be endorsed by the House-ha s had the result of depriving Victoria of two country representatives, and increasing the suburban representatives by one. the Government have anything to do with that matter; it is one for the Commissioners. on this point; but I think I am justified in .assuming that there has been a sort of -general direction given to the Commissioners as tb the basis on which they shall work. ber must not impute improper motives to the Ministry. it is altogether an improper motive; the -'Government may feel quite justified in the action they have taken, but, in my opinion, they have made a fundamental error. -speech is all based on assumption ! are based on presumption. I now wish to -draw attention to what appears to me a great fallacy in regard to land settlement. There is evidently an idea in the minds of the present Government and their supporters that people can be settled on the land while impossible conditions of working the land are imposed. jurisdiction of the Arbitration Court, presided over by Mr Justice Higgins, there is the Rural Workers Union. The honourable member for Flinders last night directed our attention to the important point that the Judge of that Court is really vested with legislative powers, and he has been exerting those powers according to his wisdom. With that I have nothing to do; I am now merely stating the fact so pertinently and plainly put before us yesterday. Rural Workers Union, which has come into existence under the shadow of the Arbitration Court, has submitted a log, the result of which, I venture to say, must be that hardly a farmer in the community will be .able to submit to the rates of pay and conditions prescribed. They will not be able to submit, for the simple reason that they cannot afford to do so; and the first result will be to drive a very large proportion, who are now carrying on mixed farming, into the adoption of the old unfortunate system under which land was used practically as sheepwalks. Let us examine some of the conditions laid down in the log. There is, first of all, a demand for increased wages and overtime, ranging from is. 3d. to 2s. per hour. An eight hours' day is provided for, with a minimum rate of pay, with an allowance of 7s. 6d. per week for attending horses. I should like to place two examples on record. In the case of a ploughman, one week's wages of forty-eight hours, at the wages laid down, will mean £ 1 15s., with an allowance of 7s. 6d. for attending horses, and if he has ten hours overtime at is. 3d., totalling 12s. 6d., and an allowance of 12s. for keep when not provided, the total is £ 3 7s. In the case of a harvest hand, the wages for a week of forty-eight hours is £ 2 5s., with 7s. 6d. for attending horses; and if ten hours overtime be worked at is. 3d -and overtime is inevitable at harvest and seeding time-suc h a man, with the allowance for keep, will receive £ 3 17s. 6d. be much wheat-growing under these conditions. wheat-growing. not going to contest this log before the Court? am not in their confidence. I know that the industry cannot be conducted on such lines. unjust one it will not be endorsed. conditions imposed. The Rural Workers Union is asking for preference to unionists, which really means the creation of a ring or a monopoly in labour; and I suggest that not only outside labourers, but even farmers' sons, will be driven into the union. Then, again, before a farmer can employ an aged or decrepit person, he has The to secure the consent of the union; and union officials are to have the right to visit and inspect any farm., factory, or place to investigate complaints. Under such conditions, a farmer will not be manager of his own farm. On public holidays half rates of pay are to apply; and I",17,Speech Address In Reply

In this way the esfrit de corps of came a teetotaller, too. Let me apply his the militia and volunteers would be transmitted argument to this idea of Socialism. Those to the new Citizen Force. who are in organized Labour are for the time being receiving very considerable adfor. vantages at the expense of the general community, but when they all become Socialists, where will be the distinctive advantage As a practical man who has had that any one can enjoy as against another? The same argument will apply to theCivil Service. At the present time a large number of people are enamoured of the Socialistic proposal, because they look with a more or less envious eye upon those who are in the Civil Service. They see that civil I pass servants have certain advantages which outsiders do not possess. Buti f we could all become civil servants, where is the distinctive advantage which any one can enjoy ? We shall all be on a dead level. I want to bring this matter practically home in regard to the wearing of kilts in the Scottish Regiment. I have in my drawer a number of protests, which I shall hand in due time to the Minister of Defence, against the abolition of the kilts. One of the things which, I think, militate, and will continue to militate, against our defence system is the dull, drab uniformity of all men being practically in the same regiment and wearing the same kind of uniform,, with no distinctions whatever.

I leave this matter, because it carries on its face its own condemnation of honourable members opposite. I wish now to refer very briefly to the Northern,Territory. The honourable member for Corio, amongst others, visited the Territory recently as a member of a parliamentary party; and in an interview with the press he gave a' somewhat serious list of faulty arrangements. In the Argus of. 19th ultimo he is reported as having said on his return from the north to BrisbaneHe had never been on a Parliamentary trip on which the arrangements were so faulty. He probably forgets that he is somewhat infantile in the political arena. over my country and to judge for myself of its wants* had not previously gone on tour under the wing of a Minister. When he visits his own constituency he has to pay his own expenses ; but on this occasion he went under the wing of a Minister who, apparently, was. expected to carry out the arrangements on the "" Lady Bountiful principle. As he ,; did not do so, he did not satisfy the honourable member. The honourable member for Corio went on to sayA mistake had been made in trying to establish a stud farm at the Batchelor experimental station on the Pine Creek railway sixty miles from Darwin. The site was bad, and the horses and cattle which had been taken there were doing very badly indeed. very valuable. the point that I desire to emphasize is that the mismanagement of which the honourable member complains has occurred under the more or less Socialistic scheme which he and his party advocate. the Government which I was supporting did wrong, I should not hesitate to condemn it. member come over here and support the motion of want of confidence. Leaving this matter, which is comparatively unimportant, I come to the question of leasehold tenure. I'ask honourable members in all earnestness what is it that induces' men to leave more congenial situations to work under circumstances that are by no means so advantageous-to work where there are no social advantages, where everything is new 'and many hardships have to be endured? Is it not the hope that they will thus be able to secure some substantial gain over and above that which they could anticipate making in more settled conditions?The only way in which we caninduce people to settle in theTerritory is to offer them a freehold tenure. I would give every man who goes there a certain area of land, subject to the condition that it should be within his power to acquire the freehold of a defined portion of it.

57,Mr Palmer,"I am not in the habit of 'just suggested would really happen. Coming to the question of finance, it seems to me that the huge Conunonwealth expenditures that are inevitable will, if provided for out of revenue, become a very serious tax upon the people. The only possible way in which we can carry out the great schemes which have been foreshadowed, or are actually in progress at the present time, is to allow futurity to bear a portion of the cost. We can do that only by means of a loan policy, with the provision of a proper sinking fund, so that those who come along hereafter will bear a portion of the cost of these works, which will be for their benefit as well as for the benefit of the people of to-day. 1 shall not detain the House further. I have put ' in a homely way a number of facts of vast importance to our producers, and to the people generally; and I feel satisfied that, whatever their effect may be upon honourable members, they will make an impression on the minds of readers of Hansard wherever it is distributed. No more important debate has ever taken place in this chamber than that in which we are now engaged, and it has been brought about largely by the wantof-confidence . motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition, which will have my warmest support. desire to reply to some of the statements that ' have been made by the Opposition, but I shall do so as briefly as possible, since I recognise the necessity for giving every honourable member an opportunity, before we proceed to a division to-morrow, to express his views on the question now before us.. This debate is remarkable for two things: it is remarkable because of the number of charges that are contained in the indictment against the Government; and remarkable, also, for the number of lengthy speeches that have been made in support of that indictment without substantiating any one of the charges contained in it. It seems to me that the Opposition, in discussing the situation at their caucus meeting, came to the conclusion that they had a good case, and that they would have no difficulty in showing the public that the Government had done wrong in connection with the administration of the law so far as the Brisbane strike w'as concerned, as well as in the administration of the public Departments and the appointments they had made. There is one feature of the debate which is, I think, without precedent. The Leader of the Opposition had to make out a case for his side, but, after labouring the question of industrial unrest for a whole sitting, with the exception of about twenty minutes, he sat down without touching upon any other charge mentioned in the indictment. Later we had the honourable member for Parramatta, Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and the honourable member for Wentworth, endeavouring to substantiate the charges of maladministration and corruption in appointments. Then we had two other leaders on the other side taking part in the debate. The honourable member for Mernda, acting as the financial expert, was evidently the man set aside to deal with that particular phase of the question, and later, on the same subject, we heard from the honourable member for Flinders, whom we are always delighted to hear. One thing about that honourable member is that he is candid. He says what he believes, is consistent, and can be thoroughly understood. The events connected with the industrial trouble at Brisbane have been fully explained from the point of view of the Opposition. But I think that if it were possible they would get away from the position they have created for themselves by their explanation. Whilst they have not committed themselves to approval of the military being sent to Brisbane, the fact remains that the only construction the people of Australia can place upon the censure motion is that, had the Opposition been in power, they would have complied with the request of the Government of Queensland, and would have sent the military to quell the disturbance. That is their position as clear as noonday, and there is no escape from it. When the more intelligent members of the Opposition realized that that was the position in which they were being placed, they left the Brisbane strike severely alone. They could see that there was no advantage to the party to be gained by any reference to it. But there is no escape for them from the position which they have themselves created. It is strange that, whilst honourable members opposite have been condemning industrial unrest and strikes, not one of them has said a word in condemnation of the man who was the cause of the trouble in Brisbane. I am of opinion that we should not have one-half the industrial trouble, strikes, and locks-out that we have if a little more humanity were practised by those in charge of industrial concerns. Very often industrial strife may be avoided by the exercise of a little tact and discretion. I have in mind at the present moment one of the biggest departments of labour in Australia, and the gentleman who",21,Speech Address In Reply
58,Mr Charlton (Hunter) [5.19],"I646 Governor General's Speech: [REPRESENTATIVES.] is in charge of that enterprise, and controls, perhaps, a larger number of workmen than any other man in the Commonwealth, rarely has any trouble at all witb his men. He meets them, and comes to a mutual understanding with them, with the result that there is no strike or lock-out. If we had more employers like him, it would be better for the people of Australia. Referring to the Brisbane trouble, if the manager of the Brisbane Tramway Company had exercised a little tact, had realized that he must march in line with the times, that the time is past when it is possible to coerce men who wish to become unionists, that it was not his place to object to his employees becoming unionists or wearing a badge to denote that they were unionists, the trouble would never have arisen. whether honourable members opposite approve of his action or not, they have never once raised their voices in condemnation of it. In dealing with such matters, they are always prepared to blame the poor working man. In their opinion, he is always at fault. The honourable member for Flinders has told us that arbitration is of no use. What is the difficulty in connection with arbitration which is causing working men to discard it ? The reason is that, whilst the workers are compelled to go to the Arbitration Court to secure decisions in their favour, the employers, who possess the wealth, always appeal against those decisions, as the honourable member for Flinders clearly proved. The result is that the decisions of'the Arbitration Court in favour of the men are set aside. How can we expect working men to have confidence in the tribunal under such conditions? They are prepared to obey the law, only to find that the employers are not prepared to accept the decisions of the Court. The employers do not say to the men, "" We shall defeat vou in the Arbitration Court,"" but they say, "" We shall go to a higher tribunal and get the decision set aside, and you will be in the same position as before."" Mr W. H . IRVINE -If we compel men to go into litigation, we must expect both sides to use all the weapons at their command. a little further; we should extend the principle, and make the'provision dealing with locks-out and strikes of such a character that no employer should be able to enforce any.indiistrial condition without the consent of the Court. If that course were followed, we should have no strikes. Though the Opposition complain of industrial unAddress-in-Reply. rest, we find that whenever we have gone to the people to obtain greater powers to deal with these matters they have advisedthe electors not to grant the powers which are necessary for the purpose, I should except the honourable member for Flinders in this connection, because he believes that greater powers are necessary, but I have truly stated the position in regard to this question of arbitration so far as the Opposition generally are concerned. If that be so, their charge referring to industrial unrest has signally failed. The Leader of the Opposition told us that the Prime Minister had the opportunity of a lifetime when in connection with the Brisbane strike he received the same request both from the Government of Queensland and the strikers, I point out that, and that he refused to do anything. The only request made to the Prime Minister was to send the military to Brisbane, and he simply notified those who made the request that he could not comply with it. The honourable member for Parramatta endeavoured to make out a case against the Prime Minister for not doing something to bring about industrial peace on that occasion. I wish to ask the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and every other honourable member opposite, whether they remember November, 1909, when the biggest industrial upheaval that has occurred in Australia for a very considerable time took place? The Brisbane affair was a bagatelle in comparison. The present Opposition party were in power *at that time, but did any one of them move in an endeavour to bring about industrial peace in connection with the coal disturbance? NoAnd why? It was because they realized that the settlement of the difficulty was a matter for the State Government. They were willing that it should be left to their friends in the State Parliament. If they were consistent, they would admit that if the Prime Minister of to-day had endeavoured to interfere in the Brisbane dispute he would have been told to mind his own business, because it was a State matter. They are the people who, at the referenda, advised the electors not to give this Parliament the additional powers which would have permitted a man in the position of the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth to interfere in such a matter. The public of Australia require consistency in political action. It is not fair, merely because honourable members are in Opposition, to make any kind of statement across the floor of this House with a view to getting on to the",22,Speech Address In Reply
59,Mr Charlton,"^I say we should goTreasury bench. Every honourable member opposite must know that the Labour party had their birth in the sending of a military force to quell an industrial disturbance. Just as that action may be credited with the birth of the Labour party, I say that the death of the party would have followed the sending of. troops to Brisbane. It would have been the end of the Labour Government, and nobody knows that better than do the members of the Opposition. that they would have sent the military to Brisbane. They do not wish to commit their party to such a statement. But they have no care for consistency, or what they say on questions of this kind, if they can gain a political point, and get on to the Treasury bench. They know that if they had been in office, and had sent the military to Brisbane, that would have been the end of them so far as the control of affairs in the Commonwealth was concerned. I remind honourable members also that the Government were bound to give some consideration to the new system of compulsory military training which has been established, and which members on both sides approve of. Will honourable members say that if the military had been ordered out to deal with the disturbance in Brisbane it would have been possible for our military system to have continued to live? We know that it would have meant, not merely the political death of the Government of the day, but the death of our military system as well. The members of the Opposition know all this as well as I know it myself. Yet they submit a motion censuring the Government for not doing an act which they would not have done themselves, because of the consequences which must have followed. I do not wish to traverse the whole of the ground in connection with the Brisbane strike. pears to me, in a nutshell. I wish now to Say a word or two with regard to the financial position as placed before this Chamber by the honourable member for Mernda. It is easy for an honourable member to make an estimate. One need not be a financial genius to do that; but everything depends on the premises. If you build on a foundation of sand, you may expect your edifice to fall to pieces very soon. The honourable member for Mernda says that if we do not borrow we shall, within five years, have to increase taxation, because, within that period, we shall have to find £51,000,000, in addition to the ordinary expenses of the Government. I propose to show that the honourable member's premises were false. He said that our military outlay was £2,000,000, our naval outlay ,£5,000,000, tbe expenditure on the Post Office £2,000,000, the Northern Territory expenditure £500,000, and the cost of constructing the railways from Kalgoorlie to Port Augusta and across the continent to Port Darwin, £5,000,000 each. But had he made himself acquainted That is why they will not saywith the policy of the Government, he would know that last session the Prime Minister stated that tbese railways must be looked upon as works which would ultimately become reproductive, and, therefore, should not be paid for out of revenue. He said that he proposed to borrow in the first instance, I think, £1,000,000, from the note issue fund, to go on. with. Therefore, the honourable member for Mernda took account of an expenditure of £10,000,000 which he should have left out of his calculations. Is anything to be gained by inaccuracy of this kind? According to the honourable member, the expenditure on the Federal Capital within the next five years is to be £3,000,000. That is only an assumption for which there is no data. My opinion is that the expenditure will be much less. Affairs said last session that the vote for whicli he asked was to be the first instalment of a probable expenditure of £3,000,000. Mr KrNG O'MALLEY -Within ten years. estimate of the honourable member for Mernda must be reduced by another £.1,500,000. He has stated that the expenditure on the Fleet will be £20,000,000 within the next five years; but Admiral Henderson reported that only £23,000,000 I have put the position, as it apodd would be required within twentv-one years, and that, for the first seven years, £3>5°o,ooo would be sufficient. We have provided almost the whole of that siim already; so that it may be deducted from the estimate. The honourable member assumes that the expenditure on the naval bases and dockyards will be £15,000,000, but the Minister of Defence, who has experts to advise him, says that he believes that it will be about half that sum. Adding the deductions which should be made, from the estimate o°f the honourable member for Mernda, namely, £10,000,000 in respect of the transcontinental railways, £20,000,000 in respect of naval construction, £7>5° >°°o in respect of the naval 0",23,Speech Address In Reply

Not; withstanding the statement in the press, and by tiie Opposition, that we are driving the country headlong to destruction, it will -be seen, when the position is analyzed, that this criticism will not bear investigation. -Let me deal now with the remarks of the honourable member for Flinders. He has pointed out that the expenditure on Departments has been increased. That, no doubt, is so. He supported Governments which starved the Post Office. That that Department was starved is admitted on all sides, and the Opposition is always attacking us for not spending more than we are spending on it, although we have increased the expenditure by hundreds of thousands of pounds. honourable member, the increase in the expenditure of the Department has been about 21 per cent., and that of the revenue about 12 per cent.

67,Mr Charlton,"The honorableinterests of the people, and to the advisableness of the owners placing them on the market, rather than that the Government should be compelled to resume them', because he thought the money could be better utilized in constructing railways, Mr that the cost of living has increased conBeeby, in the very speech to which the honourable member for Parramatta alluded, said that already the progressive land tax which had been imposed by the Federal Government had been the means of placing a good deal of land on the market. I cannot read the exact words, but that is the purport of what Mr Beeby said, plainly showing that the honourable member for Parramatta simply took Mr Beeby's utterance and construed it to suit his own ends. He did not quote all that Mr Beeby said, but made it appear that Mr Beeby had stated that the tax had been ineffective, and that no benefit had been derived from it. What Mr Beeby was dealing with was the fact that, although the Federal land tax had been imposed, it had not been in operation sufficiently long, up to that time, to break up all the large estates, and that he was going to do something to prevent the unearned increment going to those who owned large estates where he was building railways. Shortlv afterwards, reply to a statement made by a big land-owner, pointed out, at Tocumwal, that he had indisputable knowledge that the Federal land tax .had caused a million acres of land to be placed on the market in New South Wales. Consequently, the honourable member for Parramatta, in making it appear that Mr worse off than other trades in tliat conBeebv had said otherwise, was doing him an injustice. Strange to say, whilst members of the Opposition on the public platform, for the purpose of catching votes, charge the present Government with having increased the cost of living since they have been in power, we do not hear one word from them to that effect in this Chamber. They are prepared to make a charge of that sort in the country; but I ask them to state here and now in what way we have increased the cost of living. We have imposed no tax except the unimproved land value tax, and that is a direct tax. Customs Tariff, except to rectify anomalies. How, then, have we increased the cost of living? There is no foundation for the statement, and honourable members opposite know that they cannot make it on the floor of the House, because it will not bear investigation. I have been looking up Webb's Mr Charlton. Dictionary of Statistics on the question of the cost of living in the Old Country, where a Liberal, and not a Labour 'Government, are in power. I propose to show, from the figures given in that publication siderably more than the increase in wages in the United Kingdom. Particulars are given in regard to bread, flour, beef, mutton, pork, bacon, butter, eggs, cheese, potatoes, currants, raisins, rice, tapioca, oatmeal, tea, cocoa, sugar, jam, and treacle, articles which are required for the daily, life of every family. Rents, which are very high, are excluded. The index number of ioo is taken to indicate the standard of cost in the year 1900, and the figures showing the increase in the cost of living up till 1907, the latest vear available, are as followYear. Cost of Living. Increase. 1900 ... 100 1901 ... 101.9 ... 1.9 1902 ... 101.6 ... 1.6 1903 ... 103.2 ... 3.2 1904 ... 104.3 --4-3 1905 1906 ... ... 103.7 103.2 --... 3-7 3.2 1907 ... 105.8 ... 5.8 Coming now to the question of wages-and Mr Beeby, in it is fair to make a comparison between them and the cost of livingI find, by the same dictionary, that the wages in the building trade were the same in 1907 as in 1900. In coal mining, taking 100 as the index number for 1900, the percentage in 1907 was 96.3, or a decrease of 3.7 per cent.; so that the miners in England are nexion. In engineering, the percentage in 1907 was 102; in textiles, the figure was 108.9 in l 9 ° 1 ; and for agricultural labourers it was 101.3. The average increase of wages, including agricultural, was 1.7 per cent, from 1900 to 1907. As against that, the increased cost of living, was 5.8 per cent., excluding rents. This means that the worker in Great Britain was paying 4.1 per cent, more for his living in 1907 than he was in 1900. With tliose figures staring us in the face, how can honourable members opposite accuse us of increasing the cost of living, and producing We have not interfered with the industrial unrest? Only recently, President Taft invited the rulers of different countries to co-operate in the appointment of a convention to inquire into the increased 1 cost of living. The question is a very vital one in America, where there is noLabour Government in power; and the cost of living has increased also in Canada, -Germany, France, and other countries. -Only two or three weeks .ago, Mr Asquith, the Prime Minister of Great Britain, stated, .according to the cables, that the industrial unrest was caused by the high cost of living and the increased rents. these facts, the members of the Opposition have the audacitv to tell the people of the country from the platform that the Labour Government of the Commonwealth are responsible for the increased cost of living, when they know that the same thing is happening in other countries all over the world, and that we have imposed no direct taxation, with the exception of the land tax. If that be so, what is the reason? The reason is that there are combinations all over the world which fix the prices. When this party is sensible enough to say to the people, "" You have returned us, but we cannot legislate as we like ; we want to prevent this additional cost, and, therefore, we ask for an extension of legislative power,"" the men who condemn us on the platform for bringing about the increased cost of living are those who tell the people that they ought not to give us additional power in order lo enable us to deal with that question. I do not wish to take up much more time. In regard to the censure motion, the Leader of the Opposition, although he spoke for four or five hours, touched only .one phase of the indictment; he proved nothing against the Government. It has been proved by the speech of the honourable member for Brisbane, by the reply of the Prime Minister, and also by the reply of the Attorney General, that there is no case against Ministers Honourable members on the Opposition side realize that fact to the f u l l , pute any motives. It is said that you have and so do the people in the country. Their own newspapers in New South Wales and Victoria are asking them to "" pull off,"" because they know that unless they do the matter will come up against them at the next elections. not listen to an honourable member who speaks for more than an hour, but we have the Leader of the Opposition here talking for a whole day, and sitting down without having proved a charge against the Government, stating that he was exhausted, and that he had been unable in the time he had occupied to do justice to his amendment. He was followed by the honourable members for Parramatta and Wentworth, who indicted the Government for maladministration in certain matters. It is very strange indeed that neither of them made a direct charge. Not one direct charge has yet been made from the other side. It has been merely said that the Government have made certain appointments. Some of the appointees, occupying minor positions, happen to be supporters of the Labour party, In face of but those who received the most important positions from this Government are opposed to Labour. Simply because we appointed some men who hold the same political faith as we do, it is corruption in the minds of honourable members opposite. Hasi t come to this pass that, because men who have every qualification for filling public positions support a certain party, they are to be ignored? I hope not. What would have been said by our opponents if , when we were sitting in Opposition, we had said that they were guilty of corruption in making certain appointments, and that they ought to have appointed Labour men? Their complaint is not worth consideration; it ought to be beneath the notice of honourable members. The honourable member for Wentworth came along and said, "" I do not make any charge in this direction, but is it not-a curious thing that so and so has happened ? Mr Denison is connected with the Tobacco Trust, and also with a newspaper in Sydney dealing with'the Cable Syndicate, which Mr Watson expects to employ when another daily newspaper is started in Sydney, and no action has been taken against the Tobacco Trust by the Government, notwithstanding the fact that their own Attorney-General has said that there are only three cases which could be initiated with any hope of getting a verdict-the Dried Fruit Combine, the Confection Combine, and the Coal Vend. YetI do not imbeen guilty of maladministration, but I only say that the facts I have mentioned are curious. I want you to tell me how it is that these things have happened."" Now. what do the Government know about the The House of Commons will business of Mr Denison, or any other gentleman in the financial world? They know nothing of such matters in their administration. If we can get the necessary power from the people at the approaching referendum we shall soon deal with Mr Denison's Tobacco Trust, and every other trust in Australia. Honourable members on the other side can depend upon our ""doing that. All we want is the power to go ahead, and the very men who are trying to stop us from obtaining legislative authority are the members of the Opposition. While they complain of these things, while they say that the trusts ought to be dealt ^a^jr-with, and that they are not responsible for certain things, they continue to shelter themselves behind these very trusts. They depend upon the votes of vested interests for their places in this House. they are doing that, they accuse others of not When we go to the country in April next, and make the question of additional powers our fighting platform, these will be the same gentlemen who will fight our proposals. They are anxious for us to ask for additional powers; they say that if we do it will be their opportunity, that we shall have to convert a very large minority of the people to a majority, and that it is not possible for us to do so. They think that in our appeal lies their hope of getting on to the Treasury bench; but they will find that since the last vote was taken the people have become more enlightened, and that they understand the matter very much better to-day. Honourable members will not find the workers divided on this or any other question; they will find that they have to face a solid vote, and this Government, which has carried out its platform, and has a record of honest administration, will be returned again to the Treasury bench with an increased majority. [6.5] I desire, first, to congratulate the honourable member who has just resumed his seat upon the fire, the vigour, and the animation which characterized his speech. points, too. his telling points, if honourable members desire them to be included; also his brevity, too. I may remark, in regard to the last matter that brevity on that side of the House in present circumstances is a very admirable quality, because the least said the soonest mended. Honourable members opposite, if they become too discursive, will find that they leave too many openings for attack by us, and, therefore, the honourable member for Hunter was wise in his generation in not having exfended himself at very great length on the subject. a great desire on the other side that hon; orable members on this side should also curb their criticism of the misdeeds of the Government. do not desire that any more light than can be possibly helped shall be shed upon the shortcomings of Ministers. honourable member for Hunter, taking his f it. cue from leading articles in certain newspapers, referring to speeches in theBritish Parliament, echoed the viewstherein expressed, and exhqrted the memWhilst bers of the Opposition to take heed of what tiiose journals are saying, and to be dealing with trusts and combines. as brief as possible, or, preferably, I take it he meant, to be absolutely silent. Notwithstanding what the newspapers may say, and notwithstanding the desires of the honourable member-and I am always anxious to defer to his wish as far as possiblethe members of the Opposition have to recognise that tliey owe a duty to other people besides the members of the Government, the party sitting behind them-, and the newspapers. Their first duty is to their constituents. They are not guided by any limitations which are put on their actions or their modes of procedure by any Caucus decision; they are responsible to their constituents alone, and to the country at large-. And neither a newspaper, Caucus, nor a party has the right to step in between honourable members on this side and those who directly sent them here to represent them. The duty I have to perform is not a pleasant one; but it is one I owe to my constituents, and I am. not going to shirk it at the bidding of any one. I think that I have in my constituency at present upwards of 5q,ooo electors. AmI going to sit dumb'at the bidding of any newspaper, Caucus, or party, when I * have to justify my position here to 50,000 electors, when I have to make known to them, as far as I possibly can, what is going o n . in this Parliament, and what they have to expect at the hands of the Government of the day? At any rate, I shall, as briefly as is consistent with the magnitude of the subject, deal with a few matters which ought, in the public interest, to be ventilated in this chamber. First, I have to-remark on the emphasis laid by a number of honourable members opposite on the part that trusts are supposed to play in connection with political questions and political parties. I notice that there seems to be been flung across at us, most unjustly and untruly, that the Opposition support trusts and combines, and that they, as a partyand I suppose individual members are also Our honourable friends included-ar e helped by the money of trusts and combines. I distinctly repudiate that suggestion, insinuation, or charge-howeve r And the it may be described.

Elliot Johnson,"It haspenny that has come into the coffers of our party from those sources. know personally any individual connected with trusts, and I have never in my life been approached, directly or indirectly, by any member of a trust, or any one representing a trust, nor have I received a single farthing in the way suggested. I have always had to pay my own election expenses; and it comes as news to me, who have taken no inconsiderable part in connection with the affairs of the party to which I belong, that it is in any way associated with any trusts, combines or monopolies. When legislation was introduced to deal with these organizations, there was not a single member of the party to which I belong who espoused their cause-no t one member stood up in their defence. Can honourable members opposite say the same in regard to themselves or their own party ? pose to prove that they cannot, and I shall do so from the pages of Hansard. If we wish to find the supporters and friends of trusts, combines and monopolies, and the creators of some of these, we have to go to that side of the House. That is a statement that I propose to support with proof before I sit down. It is all very well for member after member opposite to speak in disparagement of honourable members on this side, and endeavour to connect them with trusts, combines and monopolies; but the only connection that can be established as between any party, or any member in this House, and such organizations, is on that side, and not on this. the honourable member will say that Hansard lies. W ill the honourable member say that Hansard is not a reliable source of information ? honourable members listen? now. to throw some light on the ""coal business,"" and the formation of the Coal Vend; and honourable members will be a little surprised when they hear what I have to say-no t . only what I have to say, but what others have to say. will take a considerable amount of time to answer and explain away.

92,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"O ftion get the money from ? pass by those inane interjections. I propose to quote from a Hansard report of 3rd July, 1906, pages 936-7. The Government Whip, the honourable member for Newcastle, desired, with other honourable members opposite, to exempt certain persons and combinations from the penal provisions of the Bill, and he saidAt Newcastle, miners have practically gone out on strike to get a general agreement with their proprietors, and incidentally to bring the for a suit of clothes to-day than he paid proprietors into a combination, so as to put the a few years ago feels the injury to his business on a fair basis. is not used. quotation will be found in Hansard. ""Combination"" is the actual word, and ""combine"" is merely a contraction of "" combination."" I wish it to be clearly understood that I do not wish the position at Newcastle to be disturbed, because I believe that to disturb an arrangement of that description would be to do something which would bring an injury, not merely upon the combination of proprietors, but on all the employees of their collieries. The honourable member for Melbourne Ports, with that assurance which characterizes him, and that lack of knowledge by which he is also distinguished, wishes the House to believe that this statement was never made; but it was made on the floor of this House, from the very spot where he is now sitting. The honourable member cannot explain it away. Honourable members opposite forget, when they talk about wanting effective machinery to deal with trusts and combines, that it was the leaders of the Labour party in this House who formerly defended combines, and asked that they should be exempt from penalties. This is one instance. Then, again, the late Leader of the Labour party, Mr Watson, said in this HouseHansard for 1906, page 639I am quite with the honourable member for Newcastle that we should take care that nothing is done to prevent such legitimate combinationNewcastle and Maitland districts. The ColAgain the word "" combination "" is usedamongst coal mine owners as may be necessary to enable them to get a fair profit on the capiTreasurer; and the other members of the Comtal invested, and insure fair wages to the em-ployes, Will the honourable member for Melbourne Ports still say "" it never happened""? ""Will he again try to get behind the facts? I wish the honourable member would put -in an occasional hour in the study of .Hansard. Then he would not be led into such a false position as to publicly assert that events referred to by older members in Hansard"" never happened."" In the same speech of Mr WatsonI find that I interjectedWil l not the raising of the price be acting detrimentally to the public? Mr Watson replied, "" Not necessarily."" So that the raising of the price of an article according to him is not an injury to the public. I venture to say that every man who finds that he has to pay £ 1 more pocket, and that every poor householder who has experienced the snap of cold weather recently realizes that he is injured in pocket because of the increased price that he has to pay for such a necessary commodity as household coal. that increase? honourable member ought to know. Here is a little bit of interesting history which it is worthwhile to place on record. I find that the Newcastle Coal Vend was brought about in the first instance by a conference between the representatives of the Miners Federation and the colliery proprietors. It was not the proprietors who initiated the Vend. It was initiated by the leaders of the miners themselves. A conference was arranged, and I will tell the House what occurred at it. The Newcastle Morning Herald of 26th March, 1906, contained the following informationMrF . Livingstone Learmonth, representing the A. A. Co., and, in the absence of Mr Keightly, the Newcastle Coal Mining Co.'; Mr John Brown, representing Messrs. J. and A. Brown; Mr A. Thomas, representing the East Greta Coal Mining Co. L t d . ; nnd Mr Morrow, representing the Caledonian Co were present at a meeting called at the instance of the Colliery Employes Federation to discuss the question of an increase in the hewing rate of coal. These companies are the owners of thirteen collieries, including some of the largest in the lieries Employes Federation was represented by Mr Peter Bowling, President; Mr Jas. Curley, General Secretary; Mr A. Lewis, District mittee of Management, Messrs. J. Patterson, W. Brennan, W. Rees, J. McWilliams, S. Rees, A. Burns, and W. Wardell. Mr Bowling was elected Chairman of the Conference. ingIn opening the Conference, explained that the reason for calling the Conference was because the Miners' Federation had decided to ask for 1",30,Statemeut Showiito Percentage Increases In Ex Penditu Be Years 1909 10 1910 11 And 1911 12 Under Subdivisions An> Principal Items

107,Mr W. Elliot Johnsoni Have,"that the Newcastle Coal Vend should he excluded from the operations of the Anti-Trust Act. In the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 6th December, 1910, there appeared the following references to the same Peter Bowling, who had brought the Vend into existenceMr Peter Bowling's opinion of the vend is not a flattering one. In fact he has at different times declared that it was the principal thing the miners were fighting against. After calling it into existence they had to fight against it. In Saturday's Daily Telegraph a number of extracts from speeches made by Mr Bowling were printed, showing clearly what were his views'on the subject. Some of his phrases describing the vend were :"" The combination that is trying to smash up the workers of this community and get its claws on our industries "" ; ""Save the public from its octopus g r i p "" ; "" The vend has crushed out employment""; "" The conspirators of thc vend""; and others of like character. In view of these remarksthe Sydney Daily Telegraph very pertinently remarksit may come us a surprise to most persons to learn that he was one of the principal actors in bringing the coal vend into existence. Member after member of the Labour party in this House defended the Vend when the Anti-Trust Bill was before us, and many of their members pleaded for the Newcastle Coal Vend to be exempt from its provisions. They said that vends were wholesome combinations, that they were working in the interests of higher wages, and were really beneficial concerns. Contrast those terms of praise with the remarks I have just read, as applied to the Coal Vend, by Mr Peter Bowling, the actual originator of the combination. the Labour party, did his best, with others of his party, to prevent the anti-trust law 'being made effective against those trusts, by seeking to impose qualifications which would exempt certain monopolies, trusts, and combines from the penal provisions of the Bill. He is not now Leader of the Labour party in the Federal Parliament, but he is still one of the leaders of the party in New South Wales and throughout the Commonwealth ; and, since then, speaking from a public platform on behalf of Mr S. E. O'Brien, who contested the North Sydney seat with the present honourable member for North Sydney, he is reported by the Daily Telegraph, no later than the 4th of March this vear, to have saidHe did not object to the Coal Vend in so far as it meant the combining of the colliery proprietors to fix a fair price for coal, and to do .away with the cut-throat competition that ground -down prices and wages. Mr W. Elliot Johnson. Honourable members will see that prices and profits come first in the opinion of the ex. Leader of the Labour party in this House. He did not object to the Vend, so long as it continued to be a conspiracy between the colliery proprietors and their employee's to keep up the price of coal, with the dual object of increasing the profits of the owners and the rates of pay of the men. The Vend was only denounced as an iniquitous monopolistic combine when one section of the parties to it thought they were not getting a fair deal out of the increased price charged by the Vend for the coal. Are we not entitled in the circumstances to question the sincerity of honourable members opposite who, after having taken up this attitude, come to this House and denounce honourable members on this side as being hand and glove with, these combines, trusts, and monopolies? It is clear that the leaders of the Labour party are the persons who have stood up as the champions, and the only champions, of vends, trusts, and combines. I shall turn now to another leading member of the Labour party, and a member of the present Labour Administration. I refer to the present Attorney-General. In the Daily Telegraph of the 3rd March last year, he is reported in this wayPrices of half the things we ate, drank, and wore to-day were regulated by an arrangement between combines, trusts, and rings in the country. He did not condemn that. Honourable members will mark those wordsHe had no criticism for it. It was an inMr Watson, then Leader of evitable stage in industrial and social development. Rings, combines, and trusts were as much a consequence of modern progression as man was really a development of the baby. . . . Rings, trusts, and combines were not all evil, and in some respects had been instruments of good. It is not a bloated capitalist, or an honourable member on this side and who is supposed to be the special protegk of the bloated capitalist, who utters these sentiments, but a Labour Minister; and yet we have honourable members opposite professing to denounce trusts, and accusing honourable members on this side of being hand and glove with them, though we have never raised our voices in then favour. Members of the Labour party should, in this connection, criticise their own leaders and Ministers. They should clean out their own stable before they throw dirt at those who have not merited such treatment. To show how these utterances of the Attorney-General* were regarded by some Labour newspapers' perhaps it will be opportune to quote something that was said by such a radical newspaper as the Barrier Miner. This is what that newspaper had to say about tbe Attorney-General, his writings and speeches, in regard to trustsI f trusts, as he says, are such useful and altogether admirable institutions, being the stepping stones, if not the very gates, to the paradise of that co-operative Commonwealth we all dream of if these things are so, then why on earth is Mr Hughes trying to smash the coal , trust or coal vend at this particular moment. That was a very pertinent question for the Barrier Miner to ask. If this beneficial combination was doing so much for the workers, and was such an angelic instrument for raising the condition of the wage earners, why was the Attorney-General, at the time when he was saying and writing these things, engaged by legal process in trying to wipe out the Newcastle Coal Vend? The Barrier Miner said, furtherI f trusts are such useful machines in preparing the way for the control of industry by the people, if they are "" a phase of industrial evolution, .1 triumph for co-operation over sensethe charges levelled against us by the memless competition, and so a step towards control of industrial enterprises directly by the people "" -se e Mr Hughes' letter-if trusts are so good as all this, why on earth is Mr Hughes trying to smash the Coal Vend that has kept up the wages of both miners and seamen whilst ""-triumphing over competition""? We may well ask the same question. If these trusts, combines, and monopolies are a natural stage in evolution, as man is from the baby, and, if , as the Attorney General said, they are beneficial to mankind, why does he denounce them, and why do honourable members opposite accuse us of being hand and glove with them? If we were hand and glove with them, and if the Attorney-General's description of them! be true, we should be commended by honourable members opposite as people who are trying to benefit society. As a matter of fact, these sentiments regarding trusts, monopolies, and combines, are entertained by the Attorney-General and leaders of the Labour party; and if honourable members opposite do not agree with them., they should attack, not honourable members on this side, who have never raised their voices in favour of trusts, vends, monopolies, and combines, but their own leaders, the Attorney-General, the ex-Leader of the Federal Labour party, and other members of the party. The Attorney-General, inone of his articles on "" The Case for Labour,"" published ih the Sydney Daily Telegraph, wrote as followsI t is not only illogical and unfair to complain about the trusts, it is also very foolish. For the trust is really a labour-saving device, and the latest and most effective. The antiSocialist who wishes to destroy trusts is like the old Luddites who wished to destroy machinery. Mr W. H . IRVINE -Who said this? the present Attorney-General attacking the anti-Socialists for wishing to destroy the trusts. He does not refer to members of his own party as wishing to destroy trusts, and I take it that he assumes that it is their desire to maintain trusts, and preserve them in all their hideous ugliness. The article continuesThe early trade unionist fell into the vulgar error of regarding machinery as a device of the Evil One which ought to be destroyed. They have now learned better; they no longer seek to destroy machinery but to control it. But the anti-Socialist is still a troglodyte in this matter. He wants to club tbe trust. Because we object to trusts, combines, and monopolies, and believe that those which. are injurious to the public should be suppressed by legislation. Notwithstanding bers of the Labour party, we have the evidence of the Attorney-General that we are the people who desire to club the trusts. He continuedThe trust or combine is not merely a labour saving device, and the best and latest at that, but it marks a notable epoch in the history of production and civilization. . . . The central ideas of the combine are co-operation and systemization. . . . It substitutes order for chaos and combination for competition. It takes cognisance of factorsutterly ignored by the old barbaric ways of cut-throat competition. One might suppose that the writer was Rockefeller or Astor, or some other big monopolist and representative of capital, but the words are those of the Attorney General of the present Labour Government, one of the leaders of the Labour movement. The Barrier Miner criticised these statements, and the Attorney-General replied to the criticism in these termsWhatI said about trusts then, and what I say about trusts now, and always have said, is. that trusts and combines are phases in industrial evolution, and a triumph for sensible co-operation over senseless competition. The Attorney-General is the champion of champions of the trusts, and there has not been a word of condemnation or protest from his supporters. No utterance coming, from a member of the Opposition is to be compared in any way with the Attorney General's eulogium of trusts and combines.

108,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"This issome other members of the Labour party. In 1907 Senator Henderson, speaking in another place about the Coal Vend-hi s remarks will be found on page 3695 of the Hansard report of that year-said It has materially increased, not only its selling price, which I candidly believe it was entitled to do, but also the wages paid to the men engaged in producing the coal. The coal combine has done a very great service up to the present moment. for about fifteen years secretary to the Southern Coalfields. he should be regarded as an. authority on this matter. On 25th September, 1907, Senator Millen moved in another place to direct attention to the operations of the Coal Vend, and in the debate which followed Senator Henderson said this For years I have advocated the formation of sel the formation of combines with the objust such a combination of the coal trade as ject of bringing about monopoly by exists in that State (New South Wales) to-day. nationalization. . . . The coal combine of New South Wales and indeed some honourable members of this has done, up to the present moment, a laudable work. It has already very materially increased House, when they are taken off their guard, the output of New South Wales. It has maoccasionally let the cat out of the bag, and terially increased, not only its selling prices, then the public become seized of the true which I candidly believe it was entitled to do, inner meaning of things which otherwise but also the wages paid to the men who are would be inexplicable. The Labour party producing the coal. That was said in laudation of the Vend realize that it is easier to nationalize indusagainst which a prosecution has just been tries after they have become monopolies successfully concluded. Senator Guthrie, than it is to nationalize them one by one continuing the debate, saidI can largely agree with what has just fallen tor Turley expressed himself as followsfrom Senator Henderson. He illustrated his thesis by telling the history of the cut-throat shipping business, and approved of the subsequent Shipping Combine. Senator Lynch, wlio followed, saidIn season and out of season it was pointed -out that in the maritime carrying trade it was -owing to suicidal competition that the steamship companies were unable to pay a decent 'living wage. He urged them to combine, and they were very tardy in taking our advice. That Shipping Combine has often been denounced by honourable members opposite, 'but it was originated, not by the capitalists, but by members of the Labour party in this Parliament. It was at their suggestion that it was brought into existence. How, then, can they honestly charge us with being the supporters and champions of the trusts and vested interests. It is they who are the champions of combines ancl trusts. The quotations which I have made are not from reports of speeches published in what honourable members opposite stigmatize as the "" capitalistic press ""-as -though their press organs were not also supported by capital-the y are quotations from the official report of the debates of this Parliament, whose accuracy cannot be questioned. Senator McGregor, speaking in the same debate, saidSenator Findley ought to keep his mind easy and should not object to combines. When, however, a combine becomes a monopoly, then is the time for the honourable senator to act, and I am sure he will always find me ready to cooperate with him. Senator FINDLEY -What is the object of a combine if it is not for the purpose of. getting a monopoly ? Senator McGREGOR I ask the honourable * senator whether there would be any chance of nationalizing the coal industry if it were in the hands of small coal miners or master miners? That sentence shows us why Labour members favour monopolies. They realize that while there is competition the chance of nationalizing industries is small, and counSome honourable senators, support monopolies because their members as small competitive concerns. Then SenaI understand that Senator Millen, like myself, does not object to combines, but he does object to combines who say, "" We fix the price of the commodity that we produce at ios. a ton, but we will not supply it to every person who comes along."" . . From a common sense point of view, especially as pointed out by Senator Henderson, combination is necessary, because for years, on account of the low price of coal, the miners were practically starving, and could get only two and three days' work per week. Here is another champion of the Newcastle Coal Vend. Yet we do not hear a word from the Labour party in denunciation of that gentleman. Then, in speaking of the tobacco duties on the 24th January, 1908, Senator McGregor saidI have no desire to scotch the monopoly whicb Senator Pearce is so exceedingly anxious to scotch. There we have the declaration of Senator McGregor, as a representative of labour, that he has no desire to scotch the Tobacco Monopoly. He proceededI want it to continue to expand until it has a complete monopoly of the manufacture of tobacco in Australia.",34,Statemeut Showiito Percentage Increases In Ex Penditu Be Years 1909 10 1910 11 And 1911 12 Under Subdivisions An> Principal Items

110,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"ThenIt is not often tliat we get these candid admissions from members of the Labour party, but it is just as well to remind the public that they have been made in a place where their accuracy cannot be challenged. They are upon record for all time, so that one may turn to them for the proof of his statement if necessary. Honourable members opposite have no justification for endeavouring to associate the. Liberal party in the public mind with combines and monopolies. If there is any party in this House which can justly be associated with trusts, combines, and monopolies, it is the Labour party. Prominent members of that party, not only in this Chamber, but outside of it. have in their utterances conclusively shown this. Take, for instance, the statements made by Mr Edden, the Labour representative of Newcastle in the New South Wales Parliament. dealing with his utterances, I would remind honourable members that, notwithstanding that the Labour party take so much credit to themselves for the prosecution of the Coal Vend, they did not initiate that prosecution. The whole case was worked up before their advent to power by the Liberal party. The Labour party merely took up the proceedings at the point where they had been left by the Liberal Government when the latter resigned office. The initial steps connected with that prosecution were taken by the honourable member for Angas, who was Attorney-General in the Deakin-Cook Government at the time. When proposals for dealing by means of Commonwealth legislation with the Newcastle Coal Vend were before this Parliament, Mr Edden was interviewed by a representative of the Sydney Daily Telegrafh. That interview is thus reported on the 28th February, 1911lie thought that if the vend were dissolved it would be a most disastrous thing for the Newcastle district. Edden who was Minister of Mines in New South Wales at the time. As the representative of the Newcastle district, a Radical, working-man's constituency, he stated that if the Vend were dissolved it would be the most disastrous thing for that district. He addedAny successful attempt made to smash up the vend would, under the circumstances, therefore, tell him were not reasonable, and which, inin his opinion, be a terrible thing for the district. I think I have said sufficient about combines, trusts, and monopolies to show that if there is one party in this House which can be charged with exhibiting sympathy with them it is the party which now occupies the Ministerial benches. The Federal and State Labour parties are one, and we have to regard them as such. They are merely divided into a Federal and a State section. They are not separate entities. They form one party. We know that members of both the State and Federal Labour parties are constantly stumping the country declaring that the only cure for bad conditions of employment and low wages-the be-all, endall, and cure-all-is State employment. But what has been our experience of the State as an employer ? I venture to say that in no State of the Union has the experience of the community been such as to suggest But, before that better conditions or greater contentment will prevail, or more satisfaction exist among operatives, if they are employed by the State than when they are employed by private individuals. Whenever a strike occurs, members of the Labour party, both in and out of Parliament, urge nationalization as the only cure. They say, "" Make it a State concern and you will put an end to strikes."" But what has been our experience? In almost every State concern that we have seen there has been, if anything, more dissatisfaction than there has been in private employment of late years. Where the State has stepped in as a competitor with private enterprise in various industries, strikes have been just as readily resorted to as if those employed by the Government were employed by private individuals. In fact, I think the tendency to go on strike is even greater among Government employees in industrial concerns than among employees in private capitalistic-owned concerns, because the strikers know that they have the votes in their hands, that a Labour Government depend upon the industrial sections of the community for support, and that if they want to save themselves they must go even to the length of sacrificing public interests in order to placate what mands. I do not say that they are unjust demands; but occasions may arise when they may fairly be regarded as unjustifiable. There is always a danger, when the State is an employer, that rather than risk the loss of office, or political extinction, many a weak Minister would be prompted to give way to demands which his own conscience would the public interest, should not be conceded:",35,Statemeut Showiito Percentage Increases In Ex Penditu Be Years 1909 10 1910 11 And 1911 12 Under Subdivisions An> Principal Items

112,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"Mr may, perhaps, on occasion be unjust deLet me allude, in passing, to the instance, already quoted by an honourable member of Labour-owned newspaper in Sydney, The Worker. In that case, even the leaders of the Labour party were called upon to sub 1 mit to certain demands by their employees. They refused at first, or there was some diffiof our friends on the other side would do culty, and the workers on the paper actually went on strike because they wanted to receive the same pay as was given for similar work on the much abused capitalistic journals of the same city. For this they were designated by the president of the Australian Workers Union as a "" lot of bushrangers."" In New South Wales an attempt has been and is being made to employ a large number of workers in various occupations on Government works, and the result has been a succession of very serious strikes. When the Labour party in New South Wales, together with the Labour party in this Parliament, were before the electors, they told the workers that they had rjnly to put a Labour Government in office, ahd let them give work to the wage-eamers, and they would soon find that there would be an end of strikes. They said that so long as the Government was the employer, the incentive tb strike would be done away with; but as soon as they attempted to put this principle into operation, strike after strike took place in New South Wales. The same thing happened in Victoria, and, in fact, in every place where the Government stepped in as an employer. There have been more strikes during the Labour party's regime as a Government than ever previously. The New South Wales Labour Government found themselves faced with exactly the same difficulties as private capitalistic employers had to face. They did not seem able to meet the situation with any better grace than did those capitalists about whom we have heard so much, when they thought that the demands of the men were not justified. For instance, when -the men employed on the Moree and Mungundi railway threatened to strike for more money, after vainly endeavouring to get a rise, to which Mr Griffith, the Secretary for Public Works in New South Wales, thought they were not entitled, that gentleman is reported in the Daily Telegrafh of the 3rd February, 1912, to have saidIf the men go on strike, it will be their funeral; if they go on strike, I am prepared to close down the works or get other men, but >the strikers will lose their jobs. Mr W. Elliot Johnson. If those words were uttered by an ordinary private employer whose men went on strike, a strike in the office of a every Labour member in this or another place would be stumping the country from end to end, denouncing him from every platform. We, as an Opposition, are too meek and mild to do that sort of thing, as some if the boot were on the other foot. We know that these things are going On, but we are too considerate; as a matter, of fact, we are too affable arid courteous, as an Opposition, to hammer them home as we ought to do, and as those on the other side would hammer them home to us if they had the chance. Here is a Labour Minister who tells a number of workmen that they may go on strike, for all he cares; and that it will be their funeral if they do. He even goes further, and makes a threat to lock them out if they strike. If a private employer said he was going to get other men, and that the strikers would lose their job, they would call it "" victimization."" They would refer to it as putting "" scabs "" in the place of unionists, and as, "" blacklegging."" In fact, they would use all sorts of ugly and uncomplimentary 'names which I'must ask the pardon of the. House for using, even by way of quotation. ' I ' do not like those terms; but I have to use them because they are employed by our friends opposite. We do' not hear a word about ""scabs"" and ""blacklegs"" and "" tyrants "" when a Labour Minister threatens to close down Government works and put other men in the place of those who think that they are being unjustly treated. Mr Griffith fold these men plainly and simply that if they went on strike he' would close down the job and get somebody to. "" black-leg "" upon them-. . There was to be no discontent; everything in the garden was going to be lovely, if only they would put the Labour party in office. As soon as we got a Labour Government in office, and a Labour Minister was faced with the situation which . an ordinary private employer has to face, he became a human being with the same elements in his composition as every ordinary human being has, and he gave vent to his feelings accordingly, although the money was not coming out of his pocket, as it would come out of the pocketof the private employer, who, in the. circumstances, would certainly have greater justification for making use of these expressions. Let us :see what some of the Labour newspapers had to say on the subject. I think that -ample justification has already been shown for every count of the indictment whicli we launched against the Government. what has not been done, and what I propose to do, is to show what the Labour party outside members of Parliament, what the Labour organs and their friends outside think of them. Take, for instance, the Labour Call, which, I think, is not altogether unknown to some honourable members -of the House, especially those sitting on tlie -other side. In March last, the Labour Call, -referring to the Labour Minister of Public Works for New. South Wales, saidBecause Arthur GriffithIt does not even give him the "" Mr"" Because Arthur Griffith (Labour member) -committed a breach of faith with the members -of the Railway Workers and General Labourers UnionWe did not accuse him of committing a breach of faith, but the Labour Call acuses himand didn't pay them the extra shilling a dav 'he had pledged himself to pay them, the road-makers at Kosciusko downed tools and declared a strike; and then Arthur Griffith (Labour member) ordered the victimization of all of them, and instructed that they be "" paid off."" He said the strikers were "" industrial outlaws with whom he could hold no communication."" Arthur -Griffith (Labour member) thus assumes exactly -the same attitude as all the other sweaters and exploiters of the working men. This opinion is expressed, not by what our honourable friends opposite term a capitalistic newspaper, but by one of their official organs, published in this city. Let us take another newspaper, which cannot be classed amongst the capitalistic journals, and see what it says on the subject""Industrial Outlaws"" is Griffith's t it l e There is not even "" A r t h u r G r if f it h , "" just the one thing. plai n G r if f it h ""Industrial Outlaws"" is Griffith's title for striking workmen. Last week a number of honest -toilers at Kosciusko, discontented with the con-ditions of wage-slavery surrounding them, sought -redress of grievances by means of the strike. They informed Slave-Minister Griffith of their -intention, provided their wrongs were not -righted. Nobody on this side has ever dared to apply such an epithet as Slave-Minister to any' Minister, either' in this House or any other; but the Labour organs have no hesitation ih applying these epithets to their -leaders, and the foremost members of their partyThe Department turned a deaf ear to their appeals. Exasperated and determined, the men -ceased work-wen t on strike. Then the "" Blueblooded "" God-Almighty of the Government Slave-yard declared those striking workers."" In dustrial Outlaws,"" fired them off the job, and scab herded others to take their place, thus But playing the same capitalist game he himself denounced on his first appearance at Waratah as a ""Labour"" candidatea seat which Billy Hughes was warming before the Labour plum dazzled his eye. These be thy gods, O Labour, strike-breakers, scab-herders, and political hangsmen? That is the opinion, not of a capitalistic newspaper, not of the Daily Telegraph, or the Sydney Morning Herald, or the Age, or the Argus, but of a modest little newspaper called. The People. paper, but a boodle paper. newspaper ? not funny that any newspaper which has anything to say against the policy of the Labour party, or any of their acts, or attempts to criticise them, becomes at once a capitalistic newspaper, although it may not have a penny to fly with ? The only newspapers which we are told are not capitalistic are newspapers like The Worker. Is the Labour Call, by the way, a capitalistic newspaper? It has hit the Labour Ministry very hard. I propose to quote later from The Worker, and we shall then see whether honourable members opposite will call it a capitalistic newspaper. We want to show what the other side has to say about that side, not what this side has to say about them. What this side has to say about the Labour party is more than ten thousand-fold justified by what the other side's organs and friends have to say about them. that very often my honourable friends wish that they did, because then we would not have had the Attorney-General speaking with one voice, and the honourable member for Capricornia speaking, with a totally different voice, and contradicting everything which the former had said. Caucus rule. one of the things which happen. It occurs when my honourable friends are not able to exercise the controlling influence of the Caucus; they cannot get together and compare notes.

119,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"That isSydney, recently, we had a mild demonstration of the unemployed, and, as a result of that, some of the leaders of the unemployed were arrested, though not by a capitalistic or Liberal Government. I have never heard yet of a leader of an unemployed movement having been arrested by a capitalistic or Liberal Government. remained for a Labour Government to be in power for men to be denied the right of free speech, the right to address their fellow-unemployed, and to have the police hounded on to them, and arrests made. Let me read what occurred only the other day in Sydney, from the Daily Telegraph of 15 th JuneBUSY UNEMPLOYED . THE ARRESTED SEVEN. Daily Telegraph, 15th June, 1912. As a result of the unemployed meeting near the Labour Bureau, on Thursday morning, George C. Thompson, Joseph Warner, Arthur Rutherford, Thomas G. Phipps, Cecil Whitmore, Frederick Cassell, and George Hirst, on remand, appeared at the Water Court yesterday morning, before Mr Smithers, on a charge of having behaved in a riotous manner in Princess-street, city, the previous day. Addressing a meeting of unemployed is behaving in a riotous manner, apparently, with a Labour Government in officeSenior-sergeant Carson deposed that abotit to a.m. on Thursday, in company with other constables, he. went to 135 Princess-street, and stood outside the office of the Labour Bureau. There he saw the accused Thompson. He was arguing with several people, who were out of work. Accused was noisy, and was interfering with men going into the ofiice. He was condemning the actions of the Labour Government, nnd it large crowd was congregating. Witness ;ind fined Warner and Thompson, who had hudtold him to ""Get away out of this, or I ' l l lock previous convictions, £ 1 , in default seven days' you up."" Fancy the police, under a Labour Governallowed to pay in each instance. ment, going to a leader of the unemployed in Melbourne and addressing him in that way ! But it appears that things may be done under an alleged Labour Government that woud not be tolerated under any other Government. A Labour Government is the only Government that has ever set up a claim to be exempt from criticism. Recently legislation was threatened by the State Labour Government to punish criticism of the Government, and in this connection imprisonment for three years, and other penalties, were proposed. The report proceedsFor the defence, Arthur Rutherford, describing himself as a general worker, deposed that, after having unsuccessfully applied for work at the Labour Bureau, he addressed a crowd, urging the people to form a deputation to wait on the Premier. He w.as then arrested. Mr W. Elliot Johnson. A deputation of the unemployed may not bePremier; but I venture to say that if a Liberal Premier had been in power no such embargo would have been placed upon* them, and no arrest would have taken, placeIt The remainder of the accused each gave evidence denying that their behaviour had been riotous. under which they were arrested. law administered by a Labour Government, who find it convenient to ignore the law when sentences are passed on convicted criminals.

127,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"The re-of the Brisbane Strike Committee, and the active partisanship of the Prime Minister in their illegal proceedings were actuated by a desire to see bloodshed. Such statements .are a wicked perversion of facts, and the -members responsible know it. It is a most cruel insinuation on the part of honourable members opposite who have thrown it across the chamber. I am sorry that this should be so, because it has dragged the debate down to a level I very much regret. However, honourable members opposite know perfectly well that there is just as much humanity in the breast of every member of the Opposition as there is in that of any honourable member on the Ministerial benches. This must be admitted by every man who is a man, and who does not merely want to make political capital out of that unworthy insinuation. We are, unfortunately, obliged by the exigencies of political warfare to divide ourselves into hostile -camps; but I have always tried to make that hostility purely political, and not personal. I do not think it can be charged to me that I have ever levelled a personal insinuation at any of my opponents. I am prepared to fight every ounce in me, with the gloves off, in regard to political principles and in fair political warfare; but I am not prepared to descend to anything like the gutter type of political controversy. -I limit myself purely to the political side, to questions which properly come within our purview as members of the Legislature. I think I am in the happy position of being on most excellent terms of friendship with every member of the party opposite; I entertain no feelings other than those of the highest personal regard and esteem for every one of my colleagues in this House. If I have to criticise their actions or their administration or policy, it is only in the course of my duty, and possibly it causes me more pain than it does to honourable members opposite. When1 look .across at the seraphic countenance of the most innocent looking man who represents Brisbane, and who is usually found smiling .at his desk, I find it hard to imagine that -he was so recently helping in the effort to -overthrow constituted authority in Brisbane, and took a leading and active part in the strike operations. We all recognise that the honourable member's heart is in the right place, but I am afraid that his heart very -often runs away with his head. He does not always take time to consider his responsibility as a legislator, or he does not allow -that consideration to influence and temper his dealings and conduct outside. I am not saying that his conduct outside is to be reprobated in any way, but, on the public platform, it is indiscreet in a legislator to give too free rein to impulsive and ill-considered words. AlthoughI do not think the honourable member intended it, the Brisbane strike was, in my opinion, prolonged largely by the influence which he exerted, and by the fact that he wrote a letter to the Brisbane Courier. The accuracy of that letter, as printed, has not been impugned or in any way called into question, and therefore I quote it, as followsI am convinced that prior to 6 p.m. on Tuesday the matter in dispute could have been amicablv arranged, as Mr Badger had, I understand, expressed his agreement to refer the question, as to the right of the men to wear the union badge, to the Arbitration Court. Both parties being thus willing to accept the finding of that Court, the other matters would have been very easily arranged but for this unaccountable attitude towards the employees union. Nevertheless, at that very time the subject in dispute was really one of the plaints in the case before the Arbitration Court. I am surprised that the honourable member for Brisbane did not make any reference to this subject in his speech the other day. for Darling Downs read his disclaimer afterwards. did not disclaim this. This is what_ the honourable member for Brisbane said in a letter to the Brisbane CourierI have to-day examined a certified copy of the claim, and assure the public that there is not a word of reference to the matter of wearing badges. Not a word as to the matter of wearing badges ! Well, let us see. Messrs. Frank Brennan and Rundle were the solicitors for the employees in the case which had been referred to the Arbitration Court. The plaint of the employees was lodged in October, 1911. The letter of the honourable member for Brisbane was dated the 31st January of the present year. In the plaint there was set out, under the heading "" Conditions of Work,"" the following paragraph, which was numbered 39AThe employees shall be permitted to wear and display fhe badge of membership of the association. To that the Tramway Company had filed a reply as follows:This respondent disputes the claim in paragraph C, 39B, of the plaint, and says that no distinction between members and non-members of the association should be allowed.",39,Statemeut Showiito Percentage Increases In Ex Penditu Be Years 1909 10 1910 11 And 1911 12 Under Subdivisions An> Principal Items

131,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"Was i tstead of associating himself with the workers, had contributed to the funds of the Employers Federation, and had sided with it? What would honourable members opposite have said about him and his occupancy of the post of Prime Minister? They would have denounced him from every platform in Australia. The principle is the same, no matter on which side it is practised; and whatever Mr Fisher in his private capacity might have been at liberty to do, this act on his part, as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, was one that he had no right to do, and for which he certainly deserves the severest censure. .We have been asked whether, if we had been in power, we would have sent the military to Brisbane. In reply to that question, I shall quote what the Prime Minister himself said at Brisbane, and also what the Attorney-General said in this House a few days.agoThe Prime Minister said that if necessary he would "" place all the resources of his Government at the command of those responsible for protecting life and property."" 1 did not hear any. member of his party say that he was "" out for blood "" when he made that statement. Then, again, the Attorney-General saidI t is perfectly true that in certain circumstances it is the duty of the Commonwealth under the Constitution to supply military forces for the purpose, where a State is unable to do it, of suppressing domestic violence. I did not hear any member of the honourable gentleman's party ask him if he was "" out for blood "" if he "" wanted to shoot down the unionists."" When those honourable gentlemen made these statements, no member of their party asked them if they wanted to see the strikers shot down, nor did any honourable member ask, "" For what is the military wanted if not to shoot them down?""' No; they are too cunning for that. But I am going to bring out these facts, and to prematurely explode the mine which honourable members opposite have been so clumsily trying to lay under our feet. They must not forget that when these little matters are trotted out by them, these facts will go side by side, with them. Let honourable members opposite put the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General upon the defensive. Let them put them upon the political gridiron ancl call upon them to explain their own utterances. I express ' no opinion on the subject; but when the Labour party want to know what would be done by us, I quote the utterances of members of their own Administration. I let them supply the answer. .What did the Minister of Defence say on this subject? Speaking in the Senate on 2nd November last, he said, referring to the present AdministrationThis Government, or any Government, if there is to be government, has the obligation of defending the laws which are upon the statutebooks of the Commonwealth, whether the attack on the law comes from without or from within, and I say that anything shoTt of that is anarchy, and not government at all. Anything short of that is licence and not law. No Government can be true to its principles unless it is prepared to take up that position. That is not a statement by any member of the Opposition, or any alleged representative of the capitalistic class. It was made by the present Labour Minister of Defence, a colleague of the Prime Minister. likely to conclude his speech before 11 p.m. ? endeavoring to condense my remarks, but the enormities of the present Government are so extensive that it. would occupy the best part of twelve months to deal with them even in a more or less cursory fashion. I refer to these matters because it is necessary to do so in' order to counteract some of the charges which have been levelled at us by the other side, arid to show the position in its true relation to all the circumstances. I recognise'that honourable members of the Labour party do not care what we think of their actions, and pay no regard to any criticism by the Opposition, or the so-called capitalistic press. I propose, therefore, to quote a few references to the Brisbane strike by their own friendly organizations and organs. It is not necessary for us to say one word in condemnation of the attitude of the Government towards the Brisbane strike. No word of condemnation that we could utter would be half as stinging or as strong as the words of condemnation of the strike, and the conduct of the strike, which have fallen from those who cannot by any stretch of imagination be deemed to be antagonistic either to the Government or the party to which they belong. case, honourable members opposite were blamed by representatives of their own friendly organization. Mr Miller, president of the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council, saidWe can't have any tin-pot unionHe described the Brisbane Tramway Association as a tin-pot union.

135,Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"In thisof the House had referred to that, or any other union, in such terms, merely because it was not a wealthy or influential organization. Mr Miller saidWe can't have any tin-pot union ceasing work and then calling for a general strike without the Council knows the exact demand. Then the Transport Workers Union of New South Wales, of which the Attorney-General is president, passed the following resolution concerning the strike which the Prime Minister has justified, and with the conduct of which he has expressed his approvalWhilst in sympathy with any union individually, or a group of unions, confined to one industry, resisting oppressive regulations or conditions, we are not in sympathy with the principle honourable members who are sitting opposite of general strikes. They are illogical, and injure indiscriminately and wantonly destroy amicable relations. We know that the Combined Strike Committee at Brisbane did all they could to get other unions to come to their assistance, but were not successful. But, whilst the Prime Minister was expressing approval of the Strike Committee, and said he was delighted with their conduct of the strike, we have his own Attorney-General condemning general strikes in very strong terms as being illogical and tending to wantonly destroy amicable relations. Then the Minister of Home. Affairs had something to say in connection with the same strike. He saidThe defeat of the .Labour party in South Australia was, in a great measure, due to the Queensland and other strikes. must decide what they preferred : Strikes, Wages Boards, or the Arbitration Court. Whatever course they took they must use it, and that alone, to make war against the serried ranks of the capitalists. Instead of wasting money on strikes the workers should buy shares in industrial and like concerns, and so acquire the influence necessary to control the industry and regulate wages The Honourable George Beeby, Labour Minister for Lands in New South Wales, speaking at Orange, on 12th February, declared that the general strike at Brisbane was111 conceived; and the rash act of men blind to the teaching of past experience. Still another Labour Minister dealt with the same subject. Mr Griffith, Minister of Works in New South Wales, saidHe agreed as to the South Australian elections-that backswing of the political pendulum, but was a direct result of a definite cause, namely, the Brisbane strike. South Australia, too, had had strikes, although every prominent Labour poliMr W. Elliot Johnson. tician regarded the strike as a barbarous and obsolete weapon, and a general strike in particular as a nice blend of imbecility and barbarism. Whilst the Prime Minister was justifying and upholding the work of the Brisbane Strike Committee, all these other leaders of the Labour party condemned it in these very strong terms. I find that at a meeting of the Newcastle Labour Council, on 13th February, telegrams were received from Mr Coyne asking, that Newcastle should "" fall into line."" But did the men of Newcastle fall into line? What did they think of the Brisbane strike and those who were conducting it, including some me at the present time? I find that Mr Musgrave said, speaking of the telegrams referred to, "" Throw them under the table "" ; and it was decided by the Council that the Brisbane unionists could not be helped by calling out the Newcastle men. Representatives of various churches also referred to the strike, and, amongst them, Rev. G. E. Rowe, of the Methodist Church, Brisbane; Rev. Canon Garland, of the Anglican Church, Brisbane; Rev. W. H . Lewis, of the Congregational Church, Brisbane; Rev. Father Wright, of the Roman Catholic Church, Ipswich; Rev. Father Brady, of the Roman. Catholic Church, Rosewood; Archbishop Donaldson, of the Anglican Church, Brisbane; and Bishop Duhig, of the Roman Catholic Church, Rockhampton, and a number of The workers other Church, dignitaries of various denominations. They were all agreed that the strike was wrong, unjustifiable, and an injury to the community, and they denounced it. I have reports of their remarks here, but, with a desire to economize time, I refrain from reading them. Honourable members who care to do so can read their statements for themselves. I want to point out that the city of Brisbane was in a state of siege. An irresponsible self-elected committee arrogated to themselves the powers of local government. They ignored the civic power and the local legislative power, and attempted to set themselves up as dictators and controllers of the city of Brisbane, with the right to issue permits to people to trade, to supply food, or to do anything that an ordinary free citizen has a right to' the result was not a mere automatic do under democratic government. I have here facsimiles of letters which were sent to various people, and of permits and the conditions governing them. I propose to' read one or two of these for the sake of reference later on. This letter is from ""The Trades Hall-Affiliate d with the Australian 'Labour Federation ""Combined Unions Committee, Brisbane, 6th February, 1912. Dear Sirs, We have been informed that you are conveying supplies from your stores to various establishments in this city.

As wreckers of a good case they were about the limit, and the last possibility. It will be some time before the Labour cause recovers from the effects of these disastrous alleged friends. What is wanted in Queensland just now is a new set of lenders. The old ones have too great a capacity for mishap. In reply to Coyne's statement that the men had been sold, the Bulletin puts this very pertinent queryWhy were they sold? . . ' . On the face of things, they paid certain eloquent blatherskites, or leaders, to prevent them being sold, and if they were sold, all the same, it seems they badly want new blatherskites. While the strike was in its dreary middle age it was discovered the Court had been sitting on the original dispute (the badge question) and had decided in favour of the tramway men, thereby declaring the whole strike business to be a superfluous fatalitv. The leaders tried to cover up their awful blunder by declaring that, but for the strike the case would never have got to the Court. did not know how to do the simple job of getling a case to the Court, also suggests the need the strike is that some hundreds of the staunchest unionists in the town have lost their ago I was on the point of asking the honorcertain document which he said he desired The passage which he was reading had been quoted by two or to remember every quotation that is made, of the Speaker in reference to the control A member who resorts to persistent irrelevance may, under Standing Order No. 19, be directed by the Speaker or the Chairman to discontinue the one animal in the his speech, after the attention of the House has been called to the conduct of the member; and akin to irrelevancy is the frequent repetition of the same arguments, whether of the arguments of the member speaking, or the arguments of other, members; an offence which may be met by the power given to the Chair under Standing Order No. 19.

146,This Tacit Declaration That They Mr W. Elliot Johnson,"In remust not refer to that. not. speeches able member must proceed with his speech. tainly. have deemed it necessary to read the extracts which I have quoted. The whole aim of the speeches delivered by honourable members opposite has been to throw the onus of opposition to the Brisbane strike upon honourable members on this side of the House, and to make it appear that that opposition arose from antagonism to the workers. My object has been to prove that that accusation is absolutely baseless. The most hostile criticism of the Brisbane strike has emanated, not from our party, but from those who are friendly to the Labour party. I come now to a statement which appeared in The Worker on 26th March of the present year. It readsThe Brisbane strike lasted five weeks too long; the question which is before the Chair. it should never have occurred. Now that tbe trouble is over, officially over, the truth may he told. Are we to understand from that remark that until the strike was over the truth could not be told-that it had to be concealed from public observation? ceedsAnd the plain truth is that the Brisbane men caused industrial turmoil throughout the Commonwealth, and sacrificed the positions of a large number of unionists, in order to obtain a verdict that could have been obtained without one man leaving his job. That is just what we have contended. The spirit of solidarity displayed in the Brisbuilding out of revenue,"" I ask them where bane strike was beyond praise. That it should have been called for under such circumstances must be deplored by all who know what suffering such solidarity involved. . . . The right to strike as a last resort cannot be given up, but at best it is a double-edged sword to be used only on grave provocation, and when all other methods have failed. To use it lightly is to direct a blow at trades unionism itself. Nothing has been said by honourable members upon this side of the House in conf i r m a t i o n of the attitude of the Governzient, and of those responsible for the Brisbane strike, half so strong as that which has been said by members of workers' organizations, by those who are intimately connected with unions, and by the Labour party's own press organ. There are many other matters to which I might have referred, but owing to the large number of interjections with which I have been assailed, my speech has already exceeded the limits I had intended. But I cannot conclude without making an allusion to the question of defence. During But concerning the reading of the course of this debate we have heard member after member upon the opposite side The honorof the House proclaiming the virtues of the Government in respect of what they have been pleased to term its defence scheme. I I have already explained why I wish to say that that scheme is not the defence scheme of the Labour Government at all. It is the defence scheme of the Liberal Government. orable friends cannot be told the truth too often. the honourable member that the very question which I mentioned a moment or two ago has again arisen. During this debate I have heard the statement which he has just made fully twenty times, and arguments have been based upon it. The reiteration of that statement is tedious repetition, and I must ask the honourable member to confine himself to understand that I am not permitted to refer to the question of naval defence? is not to understand that. I am unable to appreciate the position. I was about to refer to the claim of honourable members opposite to having originated the present defence scheme. They are not carrying out their old policy, but are putting into effect, in a wrong way, a policy that was inaugurated by their predecessors. When they say, "" Look at the Navy we are it is. I have been looking for it for a long time, and all I can learn is that we are to have something in the future. We have no Navy at all now beyond three little destroyers, that are used in warfare only to put the finishing touches upon battleships that have been rendered useless in an engagement with other battleships. They cannot, in any sense of the word, be termed a Navy at all. The present naval policy was evolved as the result of a Conference inaugurated by the last Liberal Ministry, who sent one of the members of the Cabinet to the Imperial Conference to confer with the Imperial authorities; and, as a result also of the action of another Minister, the honourable member for Parramatta, who was then Minister of Defence, and who asked that Australia should be given the",45,Combined Strike Coupon

The naval policy of the previous Fisher Government was to establish a fleet of twenty-three small vessels, consisting of nineteen little torpedo-boats of the River class, and three destroyers, with, I think, also a cruiser; but Admiral Bridges, and other naval authorities, pointed out that this scheme of naval defence was absolutely unthinkable. Admiral Bridges saidI f the recent Russo-Japanese war did not show us much that was new, it confirmed at least some old lessons. One of these was the weakness of a localized and defensive system of defence. That is exactly what the Labour party's system of defence wasThe Kussian torpedo craft in the Yellow Sea kept within a short distance of their ports, and stood on the defensive. They effected nothing . . adopt the Russian method. . . . It is practically certain that the system of defence recommended would do very little to protect Australian interests from their (raiders) depredations. That is only one of many condemnations by expert naval authorities of the naval, defence scheme of the previous Fisher ment. ment say, "" Look at the Navy that we have built. fence policy."" themselves condemned from one end of the country to the other. policy in opposition to it, which was condemned by the best naval experts as useless; so that when they go about the country claiming credit for what the Liberals have done, we are justly entitled to show that they are indulging in false pretences. have no solid foundation, and, as a matter of fact, they are only carrying out the policy of their predecessors which they condemned in unmeasured terms. they feel tempted to talk about "" our naval policy, and our military policy,"" let me remind them of those facts, in order that they may not speak in ignorance of what took place, perhaps, before some of them entered this House. where that policy originated, and the real truth about it, all they have to do is to look up the records of the House, and they will find that it was initiated by the Liberal Government that preceded them. whole credit for that policy belongs to that Government, and had they remained in Mr W. Elliot Johnson. power, it would have been very much further advanced than it is to-day under the maladministration of the Labour Government. I really fear that we shall shortly have to consider very seriously whether something ought not to be done to expedite the construction of the Fleet, in order that we may not continue in our present helpless condition. We are likely to remain in it for the next few years, to judge by the rate at which the ships are Rearat present being built. In conclusion, let me emphasize one great point of difference between the position of the Labour party and the position of the Liberal party. The Liberal party have always been associated from their inception with reforms that have had for their object the amelioration of the conditions of the poorer classes of the community. The most permanent reforms which have laid the foundation of many minor reforms, and which are on the Yet, what is proposed . . is to statute-books of this and the Old Country, originated with Liberal Administrations, as the result of Liberal thought,. Liberal effort, and Liberal initiative. The fundamental difference between the Liberal policy and the Labour party's policy is that the Liberals represent all sections of Governthe community, and not one class only. Yet the supporters of the GovernThey stand for equal opportunities to all and privileges to none. They do not stand, Look at our naval and military defor preference to certain sections of the It is a policy which they community to the disadvantage of others. They say that every man has an equal 1 They set up another right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness; that every man has an equal right to earn his living, and to live his l if e in the way he thinks best, restrained only by regard for the equal rights of others. A Liberal Government, therefore, conserves the rights of the community as a whole. Their claims On the other hand , the Labour party, 1 not as originally formed, but as it has developed, and as it is today, stands for the representation of Whenever only one class of the community. It regards all other classes as foreigners. In the words which the honourable member for Dalley interjected during the speech of the Leader of the Opposition, the Labour party to-day stands as a nation If they want to know within a nation, having no interests or sympathy with any other section of the community. That is a very peculiar and very dangerous position for any party to be in, and particularly a very The dangerous position for the Government of the country to be in. When we have a Government which represents only one class, and that class a minority of the community, how can we say that we have a representative Government ? How can we say that we have a"" Democratic Government? How can we say that we have the voice of the people represented in Parliament? We have nothing of the kind under the Caucus system at the present time. A policy may he laid before the people at one election, but ;the people have no guarantee that within -.the next year the whole policy may not be altered, because the policy does not rest with the Labour Government. The Labour Government is merejy the mouthpiece of its own party, and that, again, is the mouthpiece of a conference outside, which meets annually, and is really the Parliament of the country. are used here, no matter how closely or -critically, or carefully, or conscientiously Bills may be examined and faults pointed out, no matter how honourable members' on this side may try to mould legislation in the public interest, all their efforts count for nothing against the decisions of the Caucus. Honourable members opposite are not here tolisten to arguments. their decisions on any measure which is submitted before they take their seats here. They are not free agents, either of themselves or as directly representing the people. They have to wait till a conference sits in Hobart, or Sydney, or Melbourne, or other place, and draws up its marching orders. The Caucus has to dance to the tune of these marching orders, and the Government, -no matter what the personal opinions of its -constituent parts may be, must carry out -the dictates of that Caucus, as they in turn must carry out the dictates of the Conference. This system might be less objectionable if it were not for the fact that, whereas the House is elected for three years, the party's platform may be changed three times during that period. A platform may -be submitted to the electors for their approval, and perhaps be approved of, and a majority of Labour members may be returned to carry it out. But when the delegates meet at the next Conference, that policy may be entirely changed, and a policy exactly the reverse may be set up. That is not referred to the people for their -confirmation; it stands as the policy of the Caucus, and as the policy of the Government, and the latter have to carry it out. In another twelve months, without reference to the people, that policy may be once more changed, so that there is a possibility that the whole character of a policy which may have been submitted to and approved, by the country at one election may, before three years have elapsed, undergo two fundamental changes of the most important character, and the people have absolutely no opportunity to say whether they approve or disapprove. That is a travesty upon popular representation, it is a travesty upon Democratic government; and the Liberal party is against anything of the kind. As I said at the beginning of my speech, the Liberal party stands, not for class legislation, as the Labour party does, not for conserving, the interests of one class to the disadvantage of every other class in the community, but for equal representation, equal rights of citizenship, equality of all before the law, No matter what arguments equality of opportunity for all, special privileges to no section of the community, equal justice, and equal freedom. extracts which have been read by the hon-. orable member who has just resumed his seat were very long and very numerous. He has shown remarkable industry in collecting the quotations, and no less remarkThey arrive at able power in the recitation of them.

It might be absolutely true, but it would be interesting to know what any deeds, or misdeeds, of the Government of New South Wales have to do with the indictment before, the House. The honourable member read lengthy extracts. He affirmed that a number of men within the ranks of Labour disagree with this or that Government. Why not? Men who follow the Government, whether they are inside or outside Parliament, are not called upon to worship the Government, because Labour is but a fetish. We are not called upon, whether inside or outside Parliament, to blindly follow its trail to worship it. When the Government fails to f u l f i l the mission for which it was called into existence,, in that hour, I venture to say, men within Parliament will f a i l to obey its mandates. But, in any case, I would ask you, sir, did you read the leading article in the Age of yesterday ? D i d you, gentlemen of the Opposition; did",46,Combined Strike Coupon

160,Mr Anstey,"Much that the honoryou, members who sit behind the Government, read the article? solemnly with these words, "" At last there has arisen a man in the ranks of the Opposition who has laid a serious charge against the Government."" Gracious! What more commendation does the Government want than the statement of fact in a newspaper hostile to all it stands for, that in the three weeks of talk herefrom the voluminous speech of the honourable member for Ballarat right along to the rising hope of the Opposition, the honourable member for Richmond-we had no serious charge brought against the Government? What more commendation does the Government need than for the Age to say, "" At last some one has arisen to formulate a serious charge against the Government ?"" Ah, indeed; and who is this Daniel who has come to judgment, who is this resurrected Solon, who is this modern Solomon who has come with all the trappings of his greatness minus his wives and concubines, to enter up judgment against this Government? Where else do we find him but in the honourable member for Mernda, who comes here in all the glory of his wisdom, and wearing on his breast the white star of his unadulterated mustard ! He was listened to with respect by honourable members. He is a man with a long political experience, and certainly no one will deny that he has had some experience in matters of finance. He might well have afforded to rest upon the laurels of his arguthat the honourable member is absolutely ments, but he could not pass the hours, and say what he had to say, without making disparaging references to honourable members about their black-fellow ignorance and their dishonesty. Sir, that gentleman has done many things. Pie has been associated with many things which would make the retort to him very obvious. But, then, to make the retort would not conduce to the good temper of the House, or the well-being of the country. We can pass the references by. The honourable member has arrived at a period at which we must all arrive-a"" period which is marked by the limitations of age, and by the vicissitudes of political fortune-and thus we can afford well to match the meanness of his disposition by the generosity of our own silence. He spoke for four hours. The press reported him, and said that it was a scathing criticism. Yet, in the four hours' dissertation, there were only two points which the honourable member took and thought fit to give to the public: What were they? Mr Anstey. connection with the note issue. He indulged It commenced in arguments and slanders about goldbeing drawn from the banks and notes being poured forth. What does it matter to the Government, or what bearing has it upon this amendment, whether the banks of Australia take six million or seven million pounds worth of notes and hand over ,£6,000,000 or ^7,000,000 in gold to the Treasury? The Government does not force the notes upon the banks. The banks need not take any more notes than they require. There is no law which says that they shall, do so. If they have ^6,000,000 of notes in their coffers, it is to suit their own convenience, not to suit the convenience of the Government. What bearing, then, has it upon the amendment?I have heard of a man being charged with the misdeeds of his ancestors-of the sins of the father being visited on the third and fourth generation-bu t I never heard of such a preposterous charge as that which has been formulated against the present Government. We are not charged with something we have done in the past, but we are held responsiblefor the misdeeds or presumed incapacities; of posterity. We are charged, not with what we have done, but with some guesses, calculations or estimates as to the commitments of the future not with misdeeds of the past, but withincapacity to meet the requirementsof the future. Admitting for a moment correct in his guesses, calculations, and estimates, what do they prove?. Wherrthis Government first came into power and met this House, it was known that it was unquestionably pledged to an enormousincrease in expenditure for responsibilities, social and otherwise, undertaken on behalf of Australia. Any other Administration would have been in the same position. The Opposition then told us that we could not fulfil those obligations without borrowing. We said that we could; and for two years we have met all responsibilities without resorting to thosemeans that we were told were unavoidable. We have demonstrated our capacity to meet those obligations; and, just as"" we have met them during the past two years, so webelieve we shall be able to meet them next, year, and every other year. The responsibility is on the Government; and we on this side are not called upon to provide ways and means for the Opposition, who One was in have demonstrated their inability to do -without borrowing. When they are on the Treasury bench it will be for them to say -how they will meet the commitments. But the honourable member said that, in 1909, -the revenue was ;£i 1,000,000; but we were -told the next morning by the Age that it was never so low, but must be about ^15,000,000. But, of course, to the Age and these gentlemen of finance, the difference between ^11,000,000 and ^15,000,000 is a matter of no moment. How much, then, are their guesses worth ? If they can make those miscalculations as against the Government in matters of fact, which can be tested and verified, we may rest assured that, when they use arguments depending solely upon the powers of the imagination, they will not be less capable of stretching them. So much, then, for this gentleman who came to deliver judgment-wh o has made no accusation as to the past, but merely as to commitments for the future. What are the -other charges levelled against the Government? It does not matter whether the Gaucus or somebody else claims the policy, -the question is, what is the indictment against the Government? The charges, I understand, are six in number; the first -being that the Government are guilty of reckless extravagance. The Age of yester-day, speaking of the speech of the honourable member for Mernda, said that he had -established his claim on the last charge of the indictment, namely, reckless irresponsibility in matters of finance. In to-day's issue, however, we are told that all the .honourable member's arguments and facts had no bearing on that charge. In short, -of all the speakers of the Opposition, only -one has made a serious charge; and, after -.going to sleep on it, or considering it for a few hours, the newspaper comes to the -conclusion that it has no application to the indictment formulated. We are further charged with maladministration of the Departments; and with an abuse -of power and patronage in making partisan appointments. charges, the next is that of neglect and dereliction of duty, followed by the charge -of failing to maintain peace and good -order by refusing to apply the laws of the Commonwealth; and by that of 'having failed to fulfil our national and -constitutional obligations. These are the -charges in the indictment; and, as closely and clearly as I can, I propose to confine -myself to them in the time at my disposal. ""What has been said in support of the charge of reckless extravagance? The charge is formulated, the Court is formed, and the witnesses have given their testimony. But the witnesses are not in agreement with each other, and not even in agreement with themselves. The honourable member for Kooyong has said that tlie Government are inciting outside workers by the extravagant manner in which salaries have been raised in the Post and Telegraph Department; and the honourable member for Flinders has expressed the opinion that the raising of salaries and other expenditure is altogether beyond the limits of reason. On the other, hand, however, the honourable member for Parramatta has affirmed that it is the duty of the Government to remove the disorder and dissatisfaction that exist amongst the public servants by the only means possible, namely, by raising the expenditure on salaries in the Post and Telegraph Department. By what means can we satisfy the honourable member for Flinders, on the one hand, and .the honourable member for Parramatta on the other? Then an honourable member demands additional expenditure on quarantine ; while the honourable member for Lang declares that we ought to have spent more money on the Federal Capital. The Opposition formulate, on the one hand, the charge of enormous expenditure, while, on the other, they declare that there should be increased expenditure in a variety of directions. What sort of Government would the Opposition make if they did reach the Treasury bench ? They would not be able to agree amongst themselves. Some of them demand a reduction on a variety of items, while one honourable member, of a ferocious aspect, who would have liked to see an armed force ride over unarmed people in the streets of Brisbane, denounces the Government because the expenditure has not been increased on the fortifications at Thursday Island and on the north-east coast. How can we satisfy such an Opposition? The Opposition Following these three make accusations unsupported by any evidence, and, in so far as they furnish evidence, they are in disagreement with themselves, and are. absolutely incapable of laying their finger on any item of public expenditure they wouid call upon us to reduce Such an Opposition is discredited out of its own mouth, and the charge goes by the board. This Government came into power two years ago, and the Opposition, or such as was left of it,, bequeathed to us a deficit of ^500,000. be remembered that the Braddon section was in operation. everything. Sir member must remember that fact. with pleasure. me that the attitude orable member took up was, ""I do not know how much you spent, or how you spent it; but however you spent it, you are wrong."" admission: from a representative that, in his {opinion, this Government did, they were wrong! Well, it'is avtfact that the Opposition left office, and that we came into power with the -responsibility of facing a deficit which they left to us. We have been in power two years; and after two years of so-called extravagant administration we present this .country with a surplus of something like ""£2,165,000.

Against the Prime Minister, and in his Department? No. Against the Minister of Customs? General? No. The Attorney-General? No. Against what Minister and what Department? Against none and against no man. There is not a single word, from beginning to end of this debate, connecting maladministration with any of the Departments, except in one connection involving the third charge against the Government of having made partisan appointments.

Does it not speak volumes for any Government that could select so many for appointment, and amongst them so few incapables? know that neither the Public Service Commissioner, nor any man in any Department having the power of ""patronage, or the selection of men for appointment to official positions, can select any man without some disappointed aspirant for the office coming forward and saying was better qualified for the position. What do honourable members opposite say? Let us hear the right honourable member for Swan. "" Jensen! Who is Jensen? Wrote a book called The Rising Tide. Favours the Labour party. Outrageous appointment."" Why is it an outrageous appointment? Because he wrote a book called The Rising Tide, which favours the Labour party. Is that a proper reason for opposing a man's appointment ? said if he had written a book against the Labour party. No doubt he would then have been held to be eligible and full of merit. A man of European reputation, and world-wide experience, applied for a position, and the only reason that can be given They talked about it, and against his appointment is that he wrote a book supporting the principles of the Labour party. What a miserable subterfuge ! And yet, upon these grounds alone, audacity to formulate a charge against the Government. Who is Chinn? He is from the Western Australian Railways. Recommended by Scaddan. Who is Scaddan? Premier, of Western AustraliaLabour Minister. What right had he to recommend anybody for appointment? It is wrong and rotten. He is unfit. Why? Because he was recommended by a Labour Silence. The PostmasterMinister. I want to know what would have been said if he had beenrecommended by one of the "" six families"" of Western Australia? I think that, when the Attorney-General was asking for a few illustrations of men who had been appointecl without proper qualifications, it was the honourable member for Ballarat who said, "" Oh, the honourable member for Parramatta gave half-a-dozen illustrations."" Turn up the speech of the honourable member for Parramatta, and see did he question anybody's merits. No; but he raised an objection to Dr. Jensen's appointment because he was a Labour man. Mr Chinn with Labour! It is most remarkable that honourable members opposite have found no demerit in any officer appointed, except that he is a sympathizer with the Labour We movement and the present Government Are we alone amongst the men who have made appointments? Honourable members opposite for many years held the reins of government, and I do not remember any man of Labour sympathies who ever got an appointment from them. They put over that he the portals, "" No man associated with the Labour movement need apply."" This Government have torn that down and have said, "" Tq bold Labour views shall not be a disqualification."" If , on this account, there should be any objection to the present Government, it should come, not from the Opposition, but rather from the members on this side, who may have some justification for saying that the Labour Government ought not to have shown any more I wonder what would have been scruples than did the Opposition, and should have opened wider the door to Labour sympathizers, and have torn down the banner of prohibition against men who hold their views. Where do we find, in any place, any man of our shade of political opinion, holding an appointment under",53,Forrest Th E Government Which Their Predecessors Never Paid I N The
178,,"Labou r man. Mr Ryland-sympathize rthe previous Government ? Not one. They could never get such appointments. I take the honourable member for Wimmera, who is the advocate for a square deal. I wish the honourable member were here; but he is not here. His brother got an appointment under this Government. I will say that no one questions the merit of that man. I will not question his merit. But I will say that his appointment, and scores of appointments made by him, are evidences of the square deal administered by the present Government. They are not like their predecessors, who were absolutely partisan, and prohibited anybody getting an appointment belonging to the Opposition. The present Government have given a square deal, and made appointments of men, irrespective of their shades of opinion. And yet, the only objection we have from the other side is that a few men holding Labour sympathies received appointments. brother of the honourable member for Wimmera got an appointment which carries with it powers of patronage, and the power of recommending local valuers in this State. I will defy the honourable member for 'Wimmera to tell me the name of any local valuer in his constituency who is not hostile to the present Government, and a strenuous supporter of the present member for that electorate. I say that this man should have given a square deal in the appointments he -recommended, as he was given a square deal in his own appointment. I ask any man to go down into the district represented by the honourable member for Wannon and see whether he can find, in that district, one lose anything when he was about ?'"" It is local valuer who is not an actively hostile canvasser against this Government and their policy. I ask the honourable member for Corangamite how many Labour sympathizers he can name among the local valuers appointed in his constituency? have the impudence to talk about partisan actions and appointments. Where is Mr innuendo and suggestion the public are made Wilks? Did the Government give him a square deal? I take the State Government of Victoria, and refer to the Closer nedy, the late member for Moira in this House, who was on the Closer Settlement Board; and Mr Duggan, who went out ? Who are the members of the Geelong Harbor Trust? party having the audacity to come here and speak of the appointments that have been referred to as proofs of maladministration. They have never raised a single question as to the merits of the men whose appointment they object to. These are the men who talk about having no objection to a man because of his religious, political, or social views; and yet, because a few men holding opinions similar to our own, have received appointments, they make this chaige against the Government. I reckon they ought to be ashamed of themselves. That disposes of these charges. Then comes this charge: It is said by honourable members opposite that this Labour Government has failed to apply the laws of this country to the Coal Vend. That, in brief, is the complaint of the Opposition. We are told that the Labour party's hostility to the trusts is a mere pretence; that we are not really hostile to them, and that we are not hostile to them because certain members of the Government are financially interested in The one or other of them. Our friends opposite do not say this to our faces; they have not the courage to say it here or on the public platform-that is, they do not say it directly. What they do is to slide it upon the audience by innuendo and suggestion. Questions are asked, "" Is it not a fact that such and such a Minister has so many shares in such and such a company ?"" "" It is a question that may fairly be asked,"" says the honourable member for Ballarat, "" whether so-and-so is not the case."" "" I do not say that So-and-so committed bigamy, but I ask if it is not a fact that he has two wives ?"" "" I do not say that So-and-so has committed theft; but, if it is a fair question to ask, ' Did you ever in this way that beliefs are built up in the popular mind by the Opposition; but beyond anything that the members of the Opposition may do is what their paid agents and organizers do for them, especially their women organizers. We have from them statements like that of Miss Eleanor Cameron, that members of this Government are interested in certain affairs. By subtle to believe that the Government will not do anything against the trusts and combines because Ministers are financially interested in them. The honourable member for Ballarat, speaking at Geelong, said, "" I appointed' a Sugar Commission. Its members were ready to commence operations, but directly the Labour party came into power the inImagine men of such a vestigation was suspended."" Later, at Murrumburrah, he told' the electors of Werriwa that the Labour party permits the sugar industry to remain in the hands of a monopoly",54,Forrest Th E Government Which Their Predecessors Never Paid I N The

Where Is Mr Ken,"without moving a finger; that it was responsible for the sugar strike; and, going still further, he said that it was responsible for the rise in the price of sugar. When I read the utterances of some of these men, I am surprised at the magnanimity of the Prime Minister, and the courtesy with which he treats his foes. I do not understand him. What is the position in regard to rings, trusts and combines ? A Royal Commission was appointed to inquire into the operations of the Tobacco Trust. It made its investigation and presented its report. But what can Parliament do? Nothing. Why? Because it has no power. not come under the trade and commerce provisions of the Constitution, and does not exhas declared that the Combine is illegal, and tend beyond the borders of any one State. The Sugar Commission may sit as long as it likes, ancl make what reports it likes; but afterwards Parliament will not be able to do anything. Why? Because the industry does not come under the trade and commerce provisions. The sugar business is an industry, and an industry may be carried on in a factory, and a factory is a fixture, and does not move from State to State. These Commissions are of no utility except in supplying facts and materials. The Attorney-General said to the honourable member for Ballarat, ""You were in power from 1906 to 1910, and did not initiate a prosecution of the Coal Vend."" honourable member for Ballarat, "" were in power for six months during 1908."" What is the insinuation ?-agai n we have no direct statement made-That in the six months during which the Labour Government was in power it could have done what the Deakin Government failed to do in the two preceding years, or in the ten months that followed. If the Labour Government of 1908 could have initiated a prosecution of the Coal Vend and failed to do so, it would merit the condemnation of every Labour man inside and outside Parliament. Opposition, in blaming the Labour Government, demonstrates its own shameless criminality, because what the Labour Government could do in six months' tenure of office the Deakin Government could have done in a tenure of two years and ten .months. The Attorney-General, however, has proved that the Labour Government of 1908-9 could not prosecute the Coal Vend. The Deakin Government caused queries to be put to various members of the Shipping Combine and of the Coal Vend. The Huddart Parker Company refused to answer the questions, and was proceeded against in the lower Court. It appealed, and the appeal was to come on in October. At that time the Deakin party was in office. It let the day of appeal come and go, until December, when the Labour party came into power again. Then the Judge who was to hear the case-no t the Government, or its officers or agents-sai d that he was unable to go on because of illness, and the hearing was postponed until the following March. He heard it, and gave his decision two days after the Labour Government of 1908 went out of power. It was the Deakin Government's turn to act, and it refrained from doing anything. Since The industry does then the Labour Government has put the law into force and got a verdict. The Court the Combine has been broken up. What more can we do? Honourable members opposite say, "" You can collect the fines."" But the Vend has appealed. Nothing more can be done. In theory and in law the Combine .no longer exists; but in actual fact it does exist, and every one knows it . The prosecution was a sham, a fraud, and a waste of public money. It is asked why/ did we prosecute. law. We can fairly say that we were called upon to carry out the law. But the Labour party "" Oh, but you,"" replied the in every State and in the Commonwealth has distinctly declared that it sees no solution of the question of'how to restrain and suppress rings, trusts, and combines, except the nationalization of them. The honourable member for Lang has read long extracts to prove that the Labour party believes in trusts, rings, and combines. I believe in combination, in the power of association. It is only as men associate their efforts that they rise from a lower to a higher social plane. The law of human progress compels association. We base our movements on But the combination in place of competition. We believe that competition is of the animal, and that combination is of the brain, born of human sympathy and kindness, and that it will do more to uplift the human race tharh can be hoped for from blind competition.. Andi f we believe in combination for ourselves, not less do we believe in the organization of industrv-no t less do we believe that it will ultimately be far better for society if all industries are organized than that the three-fold competition of man with man, manufacturer with manufacturer, and manufacturer with workman should continue. To what, then, do we object ? We.",55,Forrest Th E Government Which Their Predecessors Never Paid I N The
182,Mr Frazer,"We had to vindicate the""",56,Forrest Th E Government Which Their Predecessors Never Paid I N The
183,Mr Anstey,"I am not denying that.object to the powers of trusts and combines being utilized by private individuals for the benefit of a few and to the detriment of the great majority, when, by means of ownership by the people and for the people, they might be utilized for the benefit of the industrial Democracy. Upon that ground we stand. The late Government stood for private enterprise and the application of the anti-trust law. I understand that when the Preservation of Industries Bill was under consideration in this House, the then Leader of the Labour party, Mr Watson, distinctly declared that we did not believe that that legislation would prove effective in operation. Speaking in the light of the experience of America, he urged that it would be ineffective. But we were driven by the very force of the situation to vote for that legislation for the purpose of giving it a trial. facts of history have demonstrated that our belief was correct, and that the solution of the evil has yet to be found. In this connection, nothing has been said by honourable members opposite which is to the detriment of the Government. Indeed, from the time the Attorney-General spoke until the honourable member for Lang rose, not a single word had been uttered in regard to this question. The last point upon which I desire to touch has reference to the charge that this Government have failed to maintain peace and good order-that they have failed in their national and constitutional obligations. have failed to maintain peace and good order. The answer to that is that within the ambit of their powers peace reigns throughout Australia. 'Wherever the arm of the Federation stretches there is peace. Disorder exists only in those places to which the Federal authority does not extend. The honourable member for Fawkner asked, "" What about Wonthaggi ?"" have we over that centre? The State Government have refused to establish a Wages Board there. The Leader of the Opposition stated that the present Government stand for lawlessness-that the unions are lawless. Similarly, the honourable member for North Sydney affirmed that unionists are worse than barbarians-that they are among the worse ruffians on earth. have us believe that they are advocates of the use of dynamite and would be assassins. Boiled down, that is his accusation. The dynamite charges are absolutely ridiculous. The honourable member for Ballarat spent a long time in detailing the awful attempts Mr Anstey. made to destroy life and property during the Brisbane tramway strike. His statements were published in the press the following day. They were not referred to as "" attempted"" dynamite outrages, but as actual dynamite outrages. Is there anything new about alleged outrages in times of industrial disturbance? Supposing all Brisbane had been loaded with dynamite, what harm couid have been done? At the right moment the man who, for the past twenty-five years, has always put in an appearance to pick up the dynamite two minutes before it exploded would have materialized. In all forms of crime we can discover a victim, and the vigilance of the police will sometimes unearth a villain. It is a remarkable fact that for twenty-five years prior to the advent of the Labour party in politics, there never was a strike VVe have given it a trial, and the in Australia, or an effort made to alleviate the condition of the workers, without a so called dynamite outrage. The victim may have been procured, tied down in a lone place, a charge of dynamite put under him, and a time fuse attached to it , but at the psychological moment, two minutes before the explosion was bound to occur, somebody has put in an appearance and rescued him. Eveni f a plug of dynamite were put down a ship's hold, and tons of coal were shovelled upon it, at the right moment, just as in melodrama, some person would detect its presence, and thus avert an awful catastrophe. I remember the great strike It has been said that they which took place in the Southern collieries during the middle eighties, and I also recollect the maritime strike. In connection with the Bulli strike, which occurred in 1886, there was an awful dynamite outrage. The bomb was there, the clock was there, and everything was in readiness for the explosion to take place. But suddenly the same old party turned up, apparently What power from nowhere, and just in time to save the situation. In connection with that outrage the authorities arrested a watchmaker at Wollongong. But, for some reason which was then unexplained, his prosecution was dropped,and nothing more was heard of the matter-a t least, for a time. Two years elapsed, and it was then discovered that a man who had served time in gaol was put He would up to steal the clock from a man who was known to be a sympathizer with Labour, and whom certain persons wanted to make their victim. But, instead of stealing the clock, he purchased it. and had it marked, with the result that when the scheme had been worked he said to its authors, "" I want money to get out of this country, and a free pass to San Francisco, otherwise I will 'blow the gaff' when the case comes into Court."" alleged outrage, a man was imprisoned for nine months. In the Brisbane tramway strike the villain of the piece is supposed to have placed dynamite upon the tramlines. The Leader of the Opposition exclaimed, "" If a tram had only gone over it, the dynaforce. To charge the Government with remite would have exploded."" What was necessary to produce an explosion eventually happened. Another awful bomb was placed on the line, the tram actually passed over it, and the thing did not go off. Then a man came along, and probed in the right place for the dynamite. He found that it had been laid down a little too deep. Next day news of the "" outrage"" was published. actually a dynamite outrage in Brisbane a week before the strike took place. So the poor devils of strikers were made responsible, not only for what happened afterwards, but for what happened before they became strikers at all. I put it to you, sir, and honourable members generally, after twenty-five years' experience of industrial troubles in this country, if they think there was anything genuine in these so-called attempted outrages. Could they possibly have happened without the villain who perpetrated them being discovered? Do the Opposition expect the people to Believe that the trade unions have a kind of organization,a body of dynamitards, more powerful than the Camorra, more secret than Nihilism or Anarchism? There never was an organization of that kind in the world which did not contain some kind of Judas to give it away; but the Opposition ask us to believe that the Labour organizations in this country are so potent that they have been able to keep the police from laying their hands on the authors of the outrage*. The thing is so preposterous that no sensible man would believe it for a. moment. When this is pointed out to them, honourable members opposite say, "" I did not mean that the Labour Government were responsible for it . "" Then why introGovernment of Queensland made a demand duce it? What part does it play in the indictment of the Government? They say again, "" We are quite aware'that the trade unionists are all respectable and decent men, and we do not say that they were responsible for the outrages."" If unionism had no part in it , why use it? What is the object of bringing it into this attack upon the Government? "" But,"" say the Opposition, "" no sooner do disturbances of this kind begin than they bring out the criminals and the weak-minded of the comUpon another occasion, for an munity."" So does the Melbourne Cup; but are the V.R.C. responsible because the Cup carnival attracts to Melbourne the sweepings and the villainy of Australia? To cope with that situation there comes into Victoria at that period a special detective sponsibility for acts of criminality with which it has no connection, and for which it cannot possibly be responsible, is to utter an unreasoning slander. I shall not deal further with the strike in Brisbane, beyond saying that there were certain difficulties in the tramway, service, a plaint was lodged with the Arbitration Court, and was to be heard by a Judge; but suddenly one man Not only that, but there was stepped forward and took the law into his own hands. He dismissed his men. The first trouble in Brisbane in that matter was a lock-outa strike of the employer against his workmen. The first act was that of a man who took the law into his own hands. We are asked why the trade unionists of Brisbane could not have waited; but the tramway men had no chance to wait. They were hurled out on to the streets; but what member amongst the Opposition has denounced the action of the man who was responsible for it? He was not even an Australian; he was an alien. He simply had the power, and he tied up the street traffic of a great city to wreak his vengeance on men who had submitted their case to the law. He broke the law, he attempted to do that which had been left to the law to do, and he struck against his workmen. His action was an insult to the law. He was an alien in the land; he was the creator of all the discord ; and he should have been dealt with. What cared he for the interests of men, women, or children ? What cared he that the men were cast out on the streets, or whether their women suffered or not? Yet there ha not been one expression of disapprobas tion of his action by honourable members opposite. When the trouble developed, the on the Commonwealth Government for armed troops to shoot down unarmed people. The honourable member for Ballarat said that the strikers in Brisbane were worse than savages and barbarians, because, said he, savages and barbarians put their womenkind out of the struggle; but the trade unionists of Brisbane left their women to suffer. Yet the honourable. member wanted a military force sent to Brisbane. What for? When the constabulary have the task of maintaining law and order they can distinguish between combatants and non-combatants, between the innocent and the guilty, between men and women and children. They can make the distinction for which the honourable member for Ballarat was so anxious. But when an armed military force is brought into the field, it stands there obedient to orders; it must fire at the word of command; it cannot discriminate between the innocent and the guilty, between father' and mother and child. The military forces fire, and mow down all indiscriminately, and that is what the honourable member for Ballarat desires. The Argus of 8th February said it was a good thing that the military were not sent, "" because it might have excited sympathy with the strikers."" pointed out another disadvantage, saying that ""the military could act only in'moments of violence, and not upon suspicion of violence."" Therefore, the request for the military was only an excuse. who made it thought they would get a political weapon against the Government. If troops are ever sent by a Labour Government, it should be to show that the military can be used as much in the interests of the people as in the interests of property. If the military had been sent to Brisbane, they should have been used to deal with the man who started the disorder and tied up the traffic of a great city. They should have been utilized to restore that traffic, to may glide ungroaning to their tomb."" Life lay their hands on the author of the disorder, and exile him as other aliens have been exiled. The Argus did not want the military because it could be used only in moments of violence, and not upon suspicion of violence! anxious to see repeated the scene of twentytwo years ago, when in the parks of this city, men, women, and children were assembled to discuss a great question. They were in no sense in proximity to the scenes of industrial disorder, for they were not near tlie shipping; but when they assembled >on that Sabbath day they saw armed troops all around them. What for? Had the populace violated the law ? Honourable members will remember that passage in The Conflict, by Phillips, where Martin Hastings, the great capitalist, says to his daughter, "" We will teach them a lesson."" She replies, "" Father, there has been no trouble,"" and he says, "" When I say there is a riot, Mr Anstey. there will be a riot."" That sort of thing has happened many times in this country. The troops are there, and there is no semblance of disorder; but they must make no distinction between father and mother, son and daughter. They are told, "" You have simply to do your duty; fire low, give them a dose of lead in the guts, and make it effective, so that the dose will not need to be repeated."" That is what certain people wanted in the State of Queensland this time, if they could have got it ; but it is what they never will get while the Labour party control the government of this country. The Government did not send the troops, and the fact that the ordinary processes of law were found to be quite sufficient to maintain peace and order is a sufficient answer. That completes my reply to It also the indictment. The Government stand, as the Age said, untouched and unscathed. The honourable member for Mernda stated that the Government had but one policy "" to eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow we die."" We find that advice Those given somewhere in Holy Writ; but Mitford, in his History of Greece, tells us these words were inscribed on the walls of Anchialos and Tarsus by Sardanapalus of Assyria. Byron has made it a theme. "" Say what you will of me,"" says the Assyrian King, "" but in those few words there is the history of all things human. Others have destroyed; I have created; enough for me if I have made my subjects feel the weight of misery the less, that they is short and death is long; and if this Government have made merry the hearts that were sad-hav e enabled them to enter into the joy of life-the y have contributed no small part to the happiness of our people The Argus was and the progress of our race. am somewhat at a disadvantage in not having heard the speeches which have been delivered on this motion of censure; but if the previous speakers did as much romancing as did the last speaker, I am extremely thankful that I was spared the ordeal of listening to them. I did hope that the Government would introduce a common sense system of administering the Departments; but we find that the old system of red-tape has been more accentuated by them than ever it was by their predecessors, until at last the Minister of Home Affairs has admitted that the Departments are one tangled knot of red-tape, and that",56,Forrest Th E Government Which Their Predecessors Never Paid I N The
184,Mr Sinclair (Moreton) [11.17],"1Ministers are merely animated rubber stamps. Under the previous Administration we had a system of semi-official post offices; but this has been wiped out by the present Government, and I think that, in many instances, this has added considerably to the cost of running the Department. It has shut out extremely good men and women, too, from the Postal Service. I would like to refer to special cases, because any one can get up and make a haphazard statement as to what has been done. I shall refer the Government to some specific cases, so that, if they wish to do it, they may hold an investigation. We have a semi-official post-office at Rosewood. A contract was entered into three years ago. We had in the office a splendid man, who was able to do the operating, and under his management the business increased by leaps and bounds. The people esteemed him as a good officer, and when his contract expired he was informed that his services would not be any longer required. sent telegrams to increase his returns as a matter of pleasure. gentleman has any far-fetched idea like that in his mind he is quite at liberty to go on supposing as long as he likes. This gentleman was entitled to enter the Civil Service, not on the clerical staff, but on the there is practically nothing at all in general staff. What has the Department done? It advised him that he might go on as assistant postmaster at Rosewood. That means, I suppose, that the Department will put a man over him at a salary of about £200 a year or more to do the work which he has done up to the present time, and is quite capable of doing in the future. The residents of Rosewood are extremely sorry at the thought of losing the services of such a very capable officer; but the Postmaster-General has said that the semi official office must go, and the status must be increased, and a man who is qualified to enter the Service in the clerical staff must take charge. I have a suggestion to make with regard to the checking of telephone calls. I have the unique experience of spending one-half of my time in this city and the other half at home; but I notice that my telephone charges average the same, whether I am at home or not. I do not wish to charge any one with neglect of duty; but I do think that the publ.ic are entitled to some means of checking the accounts. There is no business in the world other than the telephone business which is carried on without such means. I would suggest to the Department that if there is no means by which the accounts can be checked, the penny-in the-slot system might be extended to every user of the telephone, so that he could register the calls. That would be more satisfactory than the present system of having no check at all. I hope that if the Government intend to deal with the Navigation Bill, they will secure some protection to shippers, if not by insisting upon a uniform bill of lading, at least by having some just system to apply to bills of lading. I notice that an Agricultural Bureau is, so far as appearances go, as far off as ever. The Lighthouses Bill has, I regret to say, had the effect of retarding any progress that might have been made by the States towards the proper lighting of our coasts. We may expect in the near future that the distance will be shortened between this and other parts of the world by the opening of the Panama Canal; and, before that time arrives, I hope the Commonwealth Government will have done something towards the safety of our shipping, and the establishment of the confidence of the travelling public in these waters. The Governor General's Speech, as a whole, indicates a barren session; as a matter of fact. to my disappointment; the Speech. The reference to the Customs and Excise revenue should be carefully read by the people of this country. A Customs Tariff which yields a revenue so enormous requires looking into. For some time now the verdict has been in favour of a Protective Tariff; but, at present, the large revenue shows that the Tariff does not protect. The taxation which we have to bear under the Commonwealth Government is as follows:-Customs and Excise, £ 2 18s. 9jd. per head; postal, 17s. 8£d.; coinage, i o | d . ; land tax, 6s. 2^d.; other taxes, is. 7d., making a total of £ 4 5s. if d . per head. This, together with the State taxation, places us in the unenviable position of being the highest taxed people in the world. The honourable member for Bourke seemed to indicate that the Government have had a really "" good time,"" with a little to spare. I remind the honourable member, however, that the people of Australia have had to pay for that "" good time,"" and that the revenues of the States have been diminished in consequence of those collected by the Commonwealth. Further, we have passed through",59,Forrest Th E Government Which Their Predecessors Never Paid I N The

186,Mr Sinclair,"If the honorablevery prosperous times, which we all hope will continue, but which our experience of the past shows us must be varied. If hard times do come, and we continue to spend right up to the hilt as at present, we shall find ourselves in a bad way. While our imports have increased our exports have decreased. In 1910 our imports represented £58,682,391, and in 1911 the figure was £64,997,907. In 1910 the exports represented £69,855,873 in general merchandise, and £4,635,277 in specie and bullion. In 1911 the exports of general merchandise represented £67,435,172, or a reduction of something like £2,250,000, and the exports of gold and specie in that year were valued at £12,047,086; so that, while the exports of general merchandise have decreased, the exports of gold and bullion have considerably increased. This brought our total exports up to more than in previous years; but, as £12,000,000 was in gold and bullion, we are not in a very happy position. Paragraph 8 of the Governor General's Speech expresses the hope that "" an early opportunity "" will present itself for settling the question of the consolidation of the State debts; but, in my opinion, the opportunity was given by the electors of Australia on 13th April, 1910. The Prime Minister, in a flight of imagination and to influence the people of Queensland at the last general election, made a critical reference to thefinancesof that State, and I notice that the Labour party particularly dwelt on the fact that, in the next two or three years, the loans maturing for Queensland amount to something like £14,000,000. were before the people, the argument of the Prime Minister, and the Labour party generally, was that the State debts would be taken over by the Commonwealth, and to that end it was sought to get authority for an amendment of the Constitution. Personally, I advised the people not to ratify an amendment of the Constitution, but, the people having given the mandate to consolidate the debts, are the Government going to wait until an "" early opportunity "" presents itself, or are they going to make the opportunity for themselves, as directed at the general election? T desire.to say a few words in reference to paragraph 9 of the Governor General's Speech, which, I think, is rather unfortunately worded. It is as followsAlthough there has been a very marked increase in the volume of oversea immigration, to rates of the various countries are which the hind tax and general policy of My Advisers has largely contributed, they are unilr. Sinclair. able to regard the rate of natural increase of population in the Commonwealth with other than the deepest concern. The birth rate, for a young country, is too low; the death rate, though comparing most favourably with older countries, is too high. Last year nearly 9,000. children died under the age of one year-ver y many of these from preventable causes. My Advisers, considering its men and women to be' the greatest asset of the nation, after most caref u l consideration, have decided to lay before you a proposal for a Maternity Grant to the mothers of children born in the Commonwealth. The reason given for granting this bounty nullifies any good intentions which the Government might have in proposing it. As one who has reared a fairly large family, and has had to support it by the sweat of my brow, I sympathize with any one who has had to go through a similar experience. But there are other ways of helping people than by insulting them. No doubt, the object, if we may assume it to be a laudable object at all, is to help the poorer classes. It has heen suggested that the object is to catch votes. I hope there is a higher intention behind. But I say that the words used concerning the proposed bounty in the Governor General's Speech are insulting to every married woman in the Commonwealth who is a mother. The inference is that there is some artificial check on the birth rate, and that a £ 5 note will have the desired effect of removing the check. That is "" playing the game rather low."" The following words regarding preventable diseases is also most insulting. Would any mother see her child done to death for the sake of £ 5 ? Would When the referenda £ 5 help the average mother to rear a child which she could not rear without it? I am afraid that this is putting rather a low estimate upon the love of the mothers of Australia for their offspring. The paragraph is also unfair to Australia as a nation. If we compare our birth and death rates with the figures of other nations, we find that we are not in such a bad position after all. The latest figures are as follow :-The birth rate for Russia is 48 per 1,000; Germany, 32; ' Austria, 26.4;. United States of America, 26.3; Switzerland, 26.8; Norway, 26.2; Sweden, 25.7; Belgium, 25.3; Ireland 23.3 ; Canada, Ontario, 23.3; France, 20.2. It will be seen that our birth rate is next to that of Russia and Germany, and is amongst the highest in the world. The net result is very much in favour of the Commonwealth figures. The death these-Commonwealt h of Australia, 71.56 per 1,000; Denmark, 106; United Kingdom, 114; Switzerland, 141; Canada, 162; German Empire, 176; European Russia, 256. The German birth rate of 32, and the Russian of 48, are high, but compare their enormous infant death rate with ours. I pass on to paragraph 10 of the Speech, dealing with Royal Commissions which have been appointed. First on the list is the Sugar. Commission. We were promised by the Government that that Commission would be non-partisan and above suspicion. As a Queensland representative, and one who had been asking for an inquiry, I felt it to be my duty to say nothing when the Commission was appointed about its personnel, especially as at that time. I knew very little about it. I regret to say, however, that events have so shaped themselves that one can come to no other conclusion than that, as an honourable member has said, the Commission "" is a daisy."" We are all well aware of what took place in Sydney. I was particularly struck with the remark of the Secretary of the Commission before the Police Courtif he is correctly reported in the pressthat they "" objected to the other side raking up every twopenny-halfpenny argument in connection with the Commission."" There should not be any ""other side"" with a Commission of this kind. If the Commission has gone out in the interests of the Government or of any one side, the sooner it is disbanded the better. I am sure that it will contribute nothing useful to the work of this House, because its report will naturally be regarded as onesided. I regret very much indeed that we have to come to the conclusion that the Commission is partisan. I pass on to paragraph 15, in which the Government refer to the problems connected with the development of tbe Northern Territory, and tell us thatThe work of preparation for the reception of settlers is being proceeded with. I should like to know what problems in connection with the Northern Territory have been settled since this Government took control. What preparation is being made for the reception of settlers? As far as I can learn, a great number who went there this year have returned, and practically nothing has been done. I know that Mr information on every move before it was givenRyland has been appointed to a very important position in the Territory, and I suppose that he, too, is going to make provision for the reception of settlers. I hear ^some honourable member ask, below his breath, ""Who is Mr Ryland?"" He is one of the Labour candidates who had the misfortune to be "" bumped out'' at the recent general election in Queensland. That, together with the fact that he has some ideas of his own with regard to leasehold, as opposed to freehold, tenure, appears to be the only qualification he has for the position into which he has been pitchforked. I regret that the identity of the Scottish Regiment is to be suppressed by the abolition of the kilts. press the Scot. one is likely to do so; but an attempt is being made to suppress the identity of the Scottish Regiment. I am quite sure that a Scotsman is able to take care of himself ; he will, at least, -make a determined effort: to do so. But it is rather unfortunate that the Government should try to damp the enthusiasm of men who have always been willing to spill their blood in the service of the Empire. When they ask. to be allowed to continue to wear the grand uniform that has never been disgraced,, their request ought certainly to be complied, with. The Minister of Home Affairs pror mised us some time ago something in the direction of electoral uniformity, but on examining the redistribution schemes of the various StatesI find that we have' got further away than ever from any system of electoral reform such as we were promised by the honourable gentleman. It appears to me that the whole trouble is owing to a quarrel between the Commonwealth and the State Departments. I wish now to draw the attention of the Postmaster-General to the following paragraph which appeared in the Brisbane Courier on the 7th February last:Mr J. S. Collings said that it had been wired all over the country yesterday that the strike was broken and that the trams were running as usual. This did not get far ahead of them, however, and they telegraphed the good news of their successful progress to contradict the misstatements. Incidentally, he might say that they were never far behind in getting information, and they had some one in every Government Department, on the press, and elsewherewhose sympathies, unknown to the authorities, were with them, and who supplied them with out. The success of the strike was nearer, and the fight was practically over. Mr Collings was second in command during the recent Brisbane strike.

We have always tried to believe that when we sent a telegraphic message to any one, its contents were held sacred by the Department, and would not leak out.

It may be interesting to give figures with respect to the movement of the Labour party in Queensland for some years past. When the last Parliament was dissolved, the strength of the parties was : Government, 40; Labour, 26; Independents, 6. During the 'last ten years, the State Labour party has moved up and down. In 1899, Labour had 22 representatives in the State Parliament. the .number was 24; in 1904, 34; in 1907., 17 ; in 1908, 23; in 1909, 27 ; and in 1912, the number has fallen back to 25; and, since these figures were made up, I believe that number has been reduced to 24. That shows the clean sweep which the Prime Minister spoke of in connection with the recent State election. It may be interesting, also, to give an analysis of the votes cast in the metropolitan area and in the country. In the metropolitap area, the Liberals polled 32,957 votes, and the Socialists, or Labour party, 29,771 votes. These figures are not quite as late as those which I previously gave for the metropolitan constituencies. In the country constituencies, the Liberals polled 70,468 votes, and the Socialists 58,334 votes. totals are: Liberals, 103,425 votes; and Labour, or Socialists, 88,105 votes. I may further add that four members representing Liberal seats were returned unopposed Notwithstanding the great outcry there has been against the use of special constables, the bushmen, who so gallantly rode into Brisbane to restore law and order, I may inform honourable members that the majority of them came from the four electorates which were uncontested by th*. Labour party at the last election. They had evidently learnt a lesson from what they had seen of the bushmen a few weeks previously. Some honourable members opposite may be interested to know how the voting went in Merthyr: Liberals, the Federal electorates of Queensland. In the Brisbane Division, the votes cast were: Liberals, 14,149; Labour, 14,533. Oxley: Paddington: Liberals, 13,015; Labour, n,686. Moreton, in which there were four seats uncon tested at the recent State elections the votes polled were: Liberals, 7)265 > Labour, 6,346. In these figures, I have given Labour credit for every vote recorded against the Government. I have counted Windsor: every vote given for an Independent canThe didate as a Labour vote. In the new Federal Division, the voting was: Liberals, 1 3 ^ 5 3 i Labour, 8,405. Wide Bay: Liberals, 12,331; Labour, 10,174. Darling Downs: Liberals, 15,511; Labour, 9,506. Maranoa: Liberals, 6,778; Labour, 9,035. Capricornia: Liberals, 10,607; Labour, 11,976. In the Kennedy Division, in which one State seat was uncontested and went to the Labour party, the voting was : Liberals, 9,631; Labour, 8,708; and in the Herbert electorate the votes polled were: Liberals, 9,759; Labour, 11,330. These figures are for the Federal Divisions In 1902, on the lines of the proposed new distribution, and they will give honourable members some idea of what we may expect at the next Federal election, when T hope that a similar "" sweeping movement"" will take place; and, if it does, judging from the Prime Minister's remarks, he should be very well satisfied also. I wish to say a few words now with regard to the recent rebellion in Brisbane. It has fallen, I regret to say, to the lot of the present Prime Minister to be the first to break the Federal 'compact. When the States surrendered the right to maintain troops, they did so on the distinct understanding that in the event of the invasion of foreign foes, or of domestic violence, the Commonwealth would give The them protection. Personally, I do not think that, had the request of the Queensland Government been complied with, the military would have been used; but when the leaders of the strike told their people that because a Labour party was in power the troops would not be used against them, and that they could do practically what they liked, it was the duty of the Commonwealth Government to see that law and order were not flouted. WhatI have to say about the rebellion I say as an eye-witness; and if my conclusions do not coincide with those of the honourable member for Brisbane, it is because we viewed the proceedings from different stand-points. was down among the people, and took part in the marches. orable member for Brisbane? Turkish baths during part of the time. He led his people from the housetops. My conclusion during the strike was that he had a sneaking regard for high places until the Socialistic flag was struck by lightning. That appeared to be taken as a warning to climb down. roof then? The Prime Minister and other speakers have said that no violence was used by the strikers-that there was no cause for alarm. Yet the honourable member for Brisbane said that he dreaded what might take place on the morrow. living on the edge of a volcano. attempted to starve not only the people of Brisbane, but also the live stock belonging dah, purchased a consignment of hay at the municipal markets, to feed his cattle. That was on the Thursday. I was there at the time. When the produce was about to be carted away, it was stopped at the market McCook was obliged to take it back and load it into railway trucks consigned to Nundah. He told me afterwards that he had to go with an escort of police at 6 in the morning, as if he were a thief stealing something, to get the produce away from the station, so that he might feed his starving stock. To mention another case: Mr ThoTpe bought some fowls, and then found that he could not remove them to his premises to feed them. The auctioneer suggested that he should go to the Trades Hall for a permit. He went there, and put his case before Mr been referred to the Arbitration Court, but Moir, the secretary, saying that he did not wish to sell the fowls, but merely to keep them at his premises from the Friday until the Monday. He said that if the permit' was not granted, the fowls would have to starve. Mr Moir told him that they could "" bally well starve,"" but that he would not get the permit. Even a revolutionary Government might give its citizens a chance to live. This self-constituted Government, however, refused a permit to allow the feeding of fowls between Friday and Monday. Yet the Prime Minister says that he was deIn the first place, I lighted with what was done. Those rer sponsible for the strike defied the laws of the Commonwealth as well as of the State, their actions being a direct insult to this Parliament. In 1904 we passed a Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which was an honest attempt to provide for the prevention or settlement of industrial disputes. In 1910, when this Labour Government came into power, it had the Act amended, and further amended in 1911, when it was brought right up to date, and made to thoroughly accord with their ideas. Yet the strike leadersI blame them solely-ignore d the Act altogether. The wearing of a badge seemed to be the cause out of which the trouble arose, and the dispute was referred to the Arbitration Court, the plaint of the United Tramway Employes being lodged in October, 1911, by Messrs. Frank Brennan and Rundle, solicitors for the employees. One of the matters in dispute was set out in these termsThe employees shall be permitted to wear and display the badge of membership of the association. To which the Tramway Company filed this replyThis respondent disputes the claim on paragraph C 39 b of the plaint, and says that no distinction between members and non-members of the association should be allowed.

Upon the 2nd February-and I think this is a strong piece of evidence that the men were misled-the honourable member for Brisbane wrote to the Courier, statingMayI supplement what I have previously stated in reply to Mr Badger's statement -that the right to wear the badge has already bee*",63,Forrest Th E Government Which Their Predecessors Never Paid I N The

By the decision of that authority either party stands or falls, and a note from Mr Badger to the union, that he is prepared to so refer the matter will open the way for a prompt and satisfactory settlement of other differences. It has been said that nothing was done by the Premier of Queensland to bring about a settlement of the strike. The remarks of the honourable member for Brisbane lead me up to that statement. He saysA note from Mr Badger to the union, that he is prepared to so refer the matter will open the way for a prompt and satisfactory settlement of other differences. Trade and Customs wishes to insult a citizen of that great nation, the United States, he is at liberty to do so. But I have no hesitation in saying that it is beneath the dignity of the Minister to refer to Mr Badger in that way. citizen. He is an alien, and the honourable member cannot deny it. point out that Mr Badger attempted to bring about a settlement of the dispute. shown weakness by caving in, there would have been no strike. But he did not. It seems to me that the unions nowadays want the employers to do all the caving in. I had a chat with the honourable member for Maranoa about the time that this industrial disturbance arose, and I know that he was opposed to the strike from the outset. Without divulging any confidence, I know that he advised the Strike Committee and the honourable member for Brisbane not to take the action which was contemplated. I naturally went to that gentleman thinking there was a chance of doing something to bring about a settlement of the dispute. We decided upon a certain course of action, and then the first thing I did was to see the Premier, Mr Denham, and ask him if anything could be done to bring about a settlement. He told me that, unfortunately, nothing could be done. He said, "" I appreciate your laudable desire, but a gentleman has just been here on the same errand as yourself. He has been to Mr Badger, and Mr Badger told him that he would reinstate two-thirds of the men who were discharged if they would go back without their badges, and allow that matter to be settled by the Court, and that he would to decide which of the men so discharged should be reinstated."" Mr Badger said, further, "" I will undertake ro re-employ the whole of the men within two'months."" That goes to prove that Mr Jiaager was quite prepared at that time to submit the question to the Arbitration Court. self. but he said, "" Of course, that is the position to-day.

This offer was communicated to the tramway men who had been discharged, and their answer was that they would not go back unless every man was reinstated in his former position, that they would only go back wearing their badges, and that the arrangements should be made through the Strike Committee. That is the sort of men who were asking for some means of settling the strike. They want the other man to cave in every time. There is such a thing as a law of cause and effect, and I regret to have to charge the Strike Committee, and those who aided and abetted them, those who urged the men on to strike, with having done to death three of our Brisbane citizens during the strike. Three homes to-day are minus their breadwinners, and, although, perhaps, some can afford to make light of these things. I should like the minds of honourable members to go to those homes to-night, where the bread-winner's place is vacant. It is all very well to say that these men who were killed in the execution of their duty should not have done what they did, but the fact remains that they were killed during the strike, and as the result of the strike. The greatest sufferers by the strike were the working classes themselves. analyze the position, we find that quite a number of men were thrown out of employment, and have never regained their positions. Although we were assured by the Strike Committee, by Mr Harry Coyne and Mr Joe Collings, that they had a glorious victory right along the line, the sort of victory they had was shown by the facts given in answer to questions put by Mr Kirwan in the Queensland Legislative Assembly on the 4th July last.

Let me show the House how employers who showed a leaning towards the Labour party during this industrial trouble were treated. It appears to me that the policy of the unionists, or of those who led the strike, was to hit hardest their own friends and their own people: The Daily Mail was brought out daily almost entirely by union labour. The. honourable member for Brisbane made a desperate attempt to bring out the men on all the daily newspapers in Brisbane. union labemr, and it was of no use to bring them out. run by union labour, and the Courier by non-union labour. The Daily Mail was reduced to a sheet of about 15 x 10 inches during the strike, but the Courier came out larger than ever. The strike authorities thought that they had the key to the situation when they took out the stereotypists, but they found that they made a mistake. Two of the office boys did the stereotyping. Here was a newspaper that had ployed unionists. It was hit; its business was completely paralyzed whilst the firm that employed non-union labour got off scot free and brought out their newspaper very much to the satisfaction of the general public. tisanship there. partisanship. madness to victimize your own friends.",66,Forrest Th E Government Which Their Predecessors Never Paid I N The

I want to point out that the question of the Tramway Company Union affiliating with the Federated Tramway Association was only settled the night before the command was issued to the Brisbane men to wear the badge. We were told that the men decided themselves to wear the badge, but the decision was arrived at in Melbourne. It was only an accident that the strike took place in Brisbane, and that accident was Mr was getting on with her bread. She replied, Badger, who happened to say that the men should not wear the badge. The other tramway managers said that the men should not wear the badge, but they had not the same backbone as he had to insist upon the men carrying out his command. I do not think it was generally known to the unionists of Queensland that it was finally decided tbe night before the wearing of the badge that the Tramway Union should affiliate with the Federated Union. it was only intended that there should be a sectional strike in Brisbane. It was thought that the key to the situation was held by the waterside workers; but these men were, no doubt, tired of carrying the responsibility of these movements, and so they refused to come out unless all the unions went out in I am not out to vicsympathy, too. The result was that the whole of the unions were asked to down tools on a certain day. The honourable member for Brisbane has said-and I am sorry that he is not here to interject-that the am speaking of you unions were not responsible for the bread supplies having been cut off. I have read I quite understand the statements which he made to the House, and the letters which he read. Now, the Tradesmen, Bakers' Union was called out with other unions. The master bakers were told that the men could go to work if they got permits from the TradesH a l l and paid the wages into the strike fund. The master bakers replied that when they asked for permits they would get them from the legally-constituted .Government, and not from the TradesH a l l , so that the Strike Committee and the unions I do not know what were responsible for the shortage of bread supplies in Brisbane. The honourable member for Brisbane went on to say that there was really no shortage. I know that scores of persons got their bread from Rosewood and different country centres. I .know thouI do not say that he sands of loaves of bread were sent from Sydney to Brisbane during the strike. that the Finlayson family were not short of bread. later. I know that Mr Sheard, one of our leading bakers, made an attempt to supply people with bread, and had to have police protection round his premises in order to serve it out. Persons could be seen flocking there in thousands at 4 o'clock in the morning to be supplied with bread, which he baked in spite of the unions. Again, there was a widow who carried on a bakery on the south side. She decided to bake. Some one entered her premises and asked her how she "" I have just drawn one batch, and I have the dough in the trough for another."" Within twenty minutes sixty red-raggeTs were there and took the dough out of the trough and threw it into the street. Yet we are told in this House that the unionists did nothing to prevent the people from getting bread. The Government decided to come to the rescue by establishing dep6ts. The Government have been charged with A t first not having done so; but the fact is that, before they were able to establish those depots, Major Cahill and his forces had "" knocked the stuffing "" out of the unionists, and people were able to carry on their ordinary vocations.

Tbe honourable member for Brisbane has tried to lead us to believe that there was no shortage. honourable member for Brisbane than I would the honourable member who is speaking. bane know the facts. the honourable member for Brisbane coming back to this House? pence for his chances. The honourable member for Brisbane has informed us that there was no shortage, and that he had three meals a. day. But there is a very good reason why the honourable member for Brisbane should be able to have three meals a day. Some time ago, there was a slump in Brisbane tramway shares, which went down to JQT. 7s. 6d. on account of the prevalence of dengue; and some friends of mine, including the honourable member for Brisbane, bought at that price-the honourable member taking ioo shares. On the Friday -Baton FridayI heard fhat the honourable member was anxious to sell some of the shares; and, knowing his views in regard to absentee companies, I thought it would be a very good thing if they could be kept in Brisbane. With a view to purchase, I tried to hunt him u p ; but, before I found him, he had sold fifty of the shares in London, having sufficient canny Scotch blood in his veins to cause him to hold on to fifty until the Monday in order lo ascertain likely to go. On the Monday, he sold his remaining fifty shares at £ 8 5s. I was anxious to have those shares, because J quite expect to see them go to £ T 2 ; so that I think the honourable member has lost about £ 3 15s. per share by not waiting. The fact remains that the honourable inember made nearly £ 6 0 0 his deal-ou t gains-and a man with that amount in his pocket can well afford to go home and have three meals a day. A very strong charge is made by the strikers against the Government in regard to the special constables and their treatment of the crowd. On the Friday morning, when this charge was first made, I notice that, according to the honourable member for Brisbane, there was no procession; but if 15,000 people marching down the street do not constitute a procession, I do not know what does. I joined the march as far as Parliament House and back again, until we met the policemen; and I saw those people disperse. I say that the police under the I would sooner believe the trying circumstances-for they are only human after all-behave d in a most manly and straightforward way. When the procession met the police, the women and children were thrown into the front to reT h e people in Brisceive the charge of batons. I. was following up one who was very pronounced in his orders and so forth, and who seemed to be a self-constituted marshal. The police did not baton the women, as we are told they I would not give two d i d ; they divided their horses, let the women go through, and then rode in between the men and the women and began to operate on the men. horsemen to do that. e ' may say there was no necessity to do very much batoning. I am prepared to say that there were thousands of men there who did 100 yards in less than nine seconds. Talk about the Olympic games ! I had no idea we had such athletes in Brisbane, or such jumpers as I saw getting over the fence. They took the line of least resistance, and very few minutes were required to clear the crowd off the streets. I should like to add my tribute of praise to Major Cahill for the way in which he handled that very difficult, infuriated crowd, who were bent on doing mischief, and would have done so had it not been for the firm stand taken. I now desire to put the honourable member for Batman right with regard to some statements he made. The honourable member is how the market was reported to have saidThe Brisbane cars were running, or some of them. They looked like river destroyers. The men of Melbourne complained of the inconvenience of car driving. They ought to be in Brisbane. The cars there bristled with bayonets. The cars were all crowded, but no fares were taken. The passengers were all police. There were, all told, about twenty cars moving; some out of of them were covered with armour plate. of Badger's ill-gotten I am repeating a report, that was read to the House by the honourable member for Darling Downs, and when it was then quoted the honourable member for Batman said, "" I think that that report is substantially correct.""

251,Mr Sinclair,"They were clever. Icorrect he was so reported, or that it was correct that affairs in Brisbane were as reported. I am going to deal with the conditions as I found them in Brisbane. I rode on the first tram that was used after -the strike. I wanted to see what reception the trams would receive from the people of Brisbane. Therefore, I rode on this car and paid my fare. I kept the two tickets which I bought, one for the journey out, and the other for the return journey. I -have them at home framed, and shall keep them as a memento of the Brisbane strike. The difference between the two numbers on the tickets was over one hundred, which shows that more than that number paid their fares on that tram. There was not a policeman upon it . There were no fcayonets, no armour plate, no special protection. I admit that the tramway company's steam traction-engine was protected when it was carrying coal. I saw it passing the Trades Hall once or twice under protection. But to say that the trams were bristling with bayonets, or that they were armour-plated, or that they were loaded up with policemen, is an absolute misstatement; and if the honourable member for Batman continues to make statements of that kind, he will soon earn such a reputation that no one will believe hini. dwelt long enough on this unfortunate industrial upheaval. one admits in his heart that the whole thing was a blunder from beginning to end. Mr. TUDOR -I s that why the tramway company have sent Badger away? ber have sent the military up to Brisbane? sonally concerned, I think that the military should only be called out as a very last resource. that if military protection had been granted to the Government of Brisbane, the troops would not have been called out. But the effect of fhe refusal was that when the strike leaders saw that the military, which were under the control of the Federal Government, would not be called out, they said, in effect, "" You can go and do what you like; commit all the depredations you please."" violence. If , however, the Government had stepped in and let it be understood that, in case of need, the services of the military would be granted to the Queensland Government, they would never have been called out. without making any investigation or inquiries, except from the strike leaders, as to whether it was necessary to send the troops. Mr W. J. JOHNSON -Did the honourable member read, in a recent issue of a Queensland newspaper, that a policeman had been "" s a c k e d "" for nearly killing one man? "" special "" was discharged. That goes to show that tlie Government did their duty when they found that one man had exceeded his duty. In my opinion, the Prime Minister really had no option in the matter of granting assistance to the Queensland Government when it was asked for. The Government have distinctly broken the Federal compact. I hope that as this is the first time the question has been raised, it will be tested by the Queensland Government, which should insist on the Federal Government paying the extra cost incurred in protecting the State against domestic violence. member's party takes up that absurd position to-day. To their credit, they have abandoned it . for what any party may have abanI have doned. I hold that a great and important question is at issue-Can the States, in time. I am sure that every of industrial unrest or internal violence, depend upon that protection which they were led to expect, or must they protect themselves? It is 'just as well that we should know where we are. Personally, I think that it was much better, from the point of view of the suppression of the strike, that Major Cahill had a free hand, and was able to raise forces to suppress violence. I do know, on good authority, I will go further, and say that' it w'as intended to renew the attack on the Tuesday, on the day when the honorAble member for Brisbane was on the Turkish baths it was intended to march in spite of the police; and not only so, but it was proposed to resort to firearms as well. I was told on the Friday afternoon that the men had gone quietly home when dispersed by the police in order to look up their firearms. As to That was an incitement to whether there was any intimidation or danger of an outbreak, I know that half the people of Bjrisbane were armed. It was impossible to buy a revolver at any of the stores in Brisbane, because people had bought them up.

I know of several cases where men were asked if they .had a permit from the Trades HaU authorities; and they drew out revolvers and said, "" This is my permit."" I am not in favour of violence. I am a man of peace, and believe in constitutional government. I say that there was an attempt in Brisbane to upset constitutional government, and that the Federal Government aided in that attempt. I regret that His Excellency the Governor General did not, in consequence, ask the Prime Minister for his resignation. The honourable member who has just concluded has repeated statements in connection with the strike at Brisbane, and in relation to myself, that have been made before in this House. I entered the chamber just in time to hear him refer to some alleged inaccuracy in my reference to the running of a tramcar when the strike was coming to a conclusion. He said that if I persisted in statements of that kind I should not be believed as a general rule. I should like to tell the honourable member at once that my reputation for veracity is not in his keeping, and that I hope it stands on firmer ground than his opinion of me, whether that be good or bad. I was not present to hear the honourable member quote what I said, but if I am right in assuming that he quoted what was read by .the honourable member for Darling Downs,I repeat what I said then-that the statement was substantially correct. be seen from the .report-whic h even yet I have not read, but which I heard readI spoke in a figurative sense. I say now that the precautions which were taken to protect that tramcar were on just such an extravagant ancl unnecessary scale as were the demonstrations made throughout' that great industrial struggle by the police under the direction of a weak, and, I had almost said, wicked Government. There are many things in the challenge that have been directed at the Government of which I am a supporter to which I should have liked, in other circumstances, to make some reference. But having regard to the fact that this debate has to be brought to a termination to-day, and that there are others still to follow me, I shall confine my attention to what I conceive to be an imperative duty resting upon me-the duty of defending the tramway men, who suffered uncler grievous and unreasonable oppression, from the slanders that have been uttered against them in this Chamber, and of protecting, also, that great body of unionists in regard to their conduct when a general strike had been declared in the city of Brisbane. The Leader of the Opposition said that no reference had been made in the Governor General's Speech-and this he regarded as a most significant omissionto the question of the prevention and cure of industrial unrest. He appeared to overlook, the fact that there was, in effect, in clause 12 of that Speech, a very significant reference to the prevention of industrial unrest. I refer to the proposal to submit to. the people a referendum for enabling the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court to deal with such a matter, not piecemeal as in the past, not subject as in the past to constant technical difficultiesbut in a whole-hearted and thorough manner. As a fact, this reference to industrial trouble on the part of the Leader of the Opposition was merely an introduction to what has been die gravamen of the charge in this motion of want of confidence, namely, the attitude of the Government to the Brisbane strike. That strike was used by the Government of Queensland as an election cry. It was deemed wise by them to go to the country at once, in the belief that the people of Queensland would register a decisive vote against the unionists. honourable member is that I believe .the As will people decided honestly in accordance with the evidence before them. The citizens of Brisbane recorded their votes in accordance with what they had seen with their own eyes, and the people of the rural districts, with equal honesty, no doubt, recorded their votes in accordance with the only evidence before them-the biased and prejudiced evidence of an unscrupulous press. Dealing first of all with the tactics of the Opposition in this debate, I think it would have served their purpose better had they kept back this question for the general election. They might then have used it on the platform in places where an effective reply was not available, and with the assurance that any reply that was available would not have much publication in the daily press of this city. The Opposition, however, have chosen to ventilate it in this chamber, and to every charge made by them there has been an answer. with the Opposition.",70,Forrest Th E Government Which Their Predecessors Never Paid I N The

That charge is not sustainable against the men at whom it is directed, but every word of it is sustainable against the man who was immediately responsible for this great industrial upheaval ancl against the Queensland Government. The part that the Opposition have played in this matter, and it is an unworthy part, is that they have condoned and endorsed the acts of a man and a Government directed to the humiliation and, if possible, the degradation of this Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition, when charged with suggesting that, unionists were responsible for the outrages to which he referred, and greatly exaggerated, said that those who set the grass on fire must be responsible for the damage caused by the spreading of that fire. the grass is fired the rank and bitter herbage is burnt out of the ground, with the result that wholesome green verdure prevails. And in this matter, the grass having been set on fire, the rank, dankj and bitter herbage ' of misrepresentation and falsehood shall be swept away, and the sweet verdure of fair play, honesty,1 and truth will, I am sure, prevail. Even at this late hour I shall repeat and answer the question : Was this action on the part of the manager of the Brisbane Tramways Company and his employees a strike or a lock-out? Honourable members opposite are persistent in saying that it was a strike. Honourable members on this side are equally persistent that it was a lockout. Moreton admitted that the men were dismissed. Dr. that fairly represents what he said. that he admitted so much. I think he has the distinction of being the only honourable member on his side who has gone so far. However, I -'do not depend on any casual observation by the honourable member for Yes ; there have been Moreton. I do not even accept the judgment in this matter of honourable members The strike in Brisbane on either side. As they are apparently in honest disagreement on this point, we can hardly do better than refer to the decision of some more competent tribunal legally I desire appointed to determine the question. ber is making an assertion which I fear he will not have an opportunity to prove during this debate-, and which, I think, is not susceptible of. proof. T quote the following from the judgment of Mr Justice HigginsThe Manager, Mr Badger, gave the men distinctly to understand that no man was to remain on the cars wearing a badge; they were to choose between their billets and their badges. It is idle to affect that this was not a dismissal for wearing the badge. ' The Manager certainly used the words in speaking to the men that he was not dismissing them,, and that the work was there for them; but, in considering whether there is. a dismissal or not, we must look at the facts and not .at the words merely. The men were willing to go on working, and were deprived of their work and of their pay. What more is necessary to constitute a dismissal ? It is absurd to call such a' dismissal a "" strike,"" whatever name may be given to thc conduct of other unions. Under the agreement the em-, My answer is that very often when ployer could discharge an employee without giving any reason, on two days' notice; but' no such notice was given. If one felt bound to go any further than this judicial utterance of a man eminently qualified to decide, we have only to press the question to a logical conclusion and assume for a moment that Mr Badger had imposed even some more oppressive condition of employment than the one which he thus suddenly sprang upon the men. I wonder if honourable members wiU honestly argue that these employees of the Brisbane Tramways Company were bound to accept service, and continue their work, no matter how startling, unreasonable, or unlawful the new condition of service imposed by their employer. If that is what they suggest, then I say the employds of the Brisbane Tramways Company were not free men;' they were not masters of their own lives; they were not men at all, but slaves. I think we need not go any further than the gins that these men were dismissed; they I am glad to hear were locked out. Now let us consider the circumstances. Let us consider what these men, against whom the charge is made in this chamber that they deliberately defied the Court, the Act, and this Parliament which passed the Act and created the Court,",71,Forrest Th E Government Which Their Predecessors Never Paid I N The

265,Mr Brennan,"The honourable memhad to put up with. T quote from the evidence of Mr Badger in cross-examination oh oathWere you manager of the company in 1904?Yes, I think I was. Do you remember an attempt to form a union in 1904?I cannot say I remember any attempt in that particular year. I believe there have been several attempts, but I cannot locate them in regard to the time. Did you, some years ago, dismiss men for trying to form a union ?-Some time ago there were nine men dismissed for an attempt to form a union, and afterwards reinstated. Was there any condition of their reinstatement?-The condition was to drop the matter of forming a union. Right along you bave been opposed to the union?-Some kinds of unions I have, some kinds not. What kinds of unions are you not opposed to? I am not opposed to an organization of our employees amongst themselves. They have had one for most of the time. I have been there. I am not opposed to an industrial organization of the Brisbane Tramways employees amongst themselves. You object to the Australian character of the organization?I object to their affiliating with who went on strike found themselves without other organizations so that they will be drawn into other people's trouble. I object to any form of union by which if there is a strike in Perth the men in Brisbane will be involved. What is your main objection?-That is my principal objection to a union having outside affiliation. How do you account for the fact that you dismissed men for joining a Brisbane union in 1904?-Because, in my opinion, that is not what they were endeavouring to form. My idea was that they were going to form a union that would affiliate with the Trades Hall or some other body. They had not affiliated when you dismissed the men?-They had not formed the union. You thought they might do it ?-That was my view. They had an organization of their own at that time. Are you opposed to your men joining the Australian organization?-As a matter of business policy, I am. Are you aware that it is registered under the Act ?I am informed that it is. So much for that sworn evidence. Again, we have the evidence of Mr Champ on the question of persecution, and the way these men were treated. Mr Champ was asked with respect to clubs on the company's propertyWhat happened to those clubs?-There was a notice issued to the various secretaries of the clubs giving them seven days to quit rooms for reconstruction of clubs. When Hie rooms were reconstructed, were the old members invited to resume occupation?No. Who got into occupation ?A body known as the Brisbane Tramways Employes Association. Were those leconstructed clubs restricted to members of the Tramways Association or the Brisbane body?-To the new club. Now, there Mr Brennan. is no member entitled to admittance unless he can produce the pence card of that organization, and also show a clearance from the Australian Tramways Association. Then His Honour asked the questionI suppose that the clearance means that you have ceased to be a member?-Yes. On the subject of promotion this question was askedCan you give cases of their having promoted members of your association?-Non e whatever. Another aspect of this important matter is that there was a deliberate conspiracy on the part of the manager of the 'Brisbane Tramway Company to drain the men who were in his employ out of the Association in order that they might not have the right to approach the Federal Arbitration Court. In other words, there was a conspiracy to deprive the Federal Arbitration Court of its jurisdiction. We find this later on in the report of the address by the chairman of the company in England these significant wordsA l l the vacancies having been rilled, the men work, and the company was accordingly placed in a position to plead in the plaint that there was no dispute, for the reason that no members of the claimant association were in its employ. This is borne out again by this evidence What was the object of telling the men to wear their badges on the 18th?-During the last twelve months we have seen our rank and file of the association falling out one by one, and an organization fostered by the employers on the other side growing up with mountain strength. In respect of the facts we get these words in His Honour, Mr Justice Higgins' judgmentThe company's union could not last but for the company's coddling. This creating ancl fostering of a rival union, this encouragement of its members and discouragement of the members of the other union is the root of such bitterness as there is; and the companies could easily get rid of the bitterness by ceasing to bestow exceptional favours on the company's union. The badge is not to blame. The word "" intimidation "" is much more applicable to what the companies have done than to the wearing of the badge. missed several men for attempting to form a union, but he reinstated them on the condition that they would drop the idea. The tramway men in Brisbane enjoyed the use of a recreation hall, which they most prized; but when Mr Badger formed his company's union he handed the hall over to it, and forbade the other to enter. From the point of view of the companies, the endeavour to stifle unionism may seem justifiable, but from the point of view of this Court the endeavour cannot be treated as legitimate 01 reasonable, for the very Act which created this Court expressly sanctions and encourages union.'",72,Carty Salmon I Do Not Think Clecision On That Point Of Mr Justice H I G

It is monstrous to think that the union should be forbidden to use such an influence in its favour, while the companies, wilh their great resources, the command of money, of employment, of place, pay, and privilege, use every effort against the union, ancl in favour of a parasite growth which they plant and foster. Let me add some further remarks which appear to me to put this matter so succinctly, clearly, and fairly that it would be well to have them on record. I invite attention to the opening wordsI t is unfortunately incident to our Constitution The tramway employees were not dismissed that in place of giving all the energy I have to a consideration of what is right and expedient to be done in an industrial struggle, I have in every case to puzzle out as best I can what-is constitutional to be done. That is what he is able to do within the limits of the Constitution.in this case, after careful consideration, I overrule all the technical objections, and find the facts, so far as they atiect the objections, in favour of the Association. Is it reasonable that the employer should order his employee not to wear the badge of the union ? There is no question of neatness involved-the badge would be regarded as rather an embellishment. It is a brass pendant somewhat like S free pass with the Australian arms, a blue oval, and the f u l l name of the union. The men wear the badge on their watohchain. Mr Badger has a quaint theory that he has a common law right 10 tell the employ^ what he should wear, apart from the power given to make regulations. I know of no such common law right. A servant has to obey all lawful commands; not all commands. A servant does not commit a breach of duty if he refuses to attend a particular church or to wear a certain maker's singlet. The common law right of an employee is to wear what he chooses to; to act as he chooses in matters not affecting his work. Prima facie, a man may wear what he likes as long as he does not offend against decency, and the burden lies on the employer tp show the contrary. Of course, the employer may by due notice get rid of an employee"" who does not dress to his liking; but the employ^ is not guilty of a breach of duty in refusing. ""Of course, there may be a contract for obedience to the master's directions as to livery or uniform of any kind, but this Court has power to interfere with contracts, and to say what contracts may and what contracts be made or enforced between parties. [27] 1 In this connection let me refer again to the boast made by the chairman of the company in England, who, in congratulating his directors and the shareholders upon the fact that there were no longer any members of the association in the employ of the company,' said, "" VVe are free of the Federal union."" There are, on the OppoI f the sition side, those who in happier times have done some service in the Federal cause, but to-day they join hands with this absentee representative of a foreign company. able member term an English company a foreign company? law a foreign company. Honourable members opposite are joining hands with this representative of an absentee company, with an alien, and the State supremacy party. They are all linked together in the sorry business of bringing Acts passed by this Parliament into disrepute. That was the position when the plaint was filed. for joining the Australian union-the manager was coward enough to persecute men for taking advantage of a Commonwealth Act, and cunning enough to know that he dare not dismiss them for that reason-bu t they were persecuted and injured in every way, bereft of their club comforts, such as they were, their furniture and belongings thrown into the street. Finally came that gross invasion of personal liberty, the prohibition of the badge by a man to whom I have referred as an alien, and whom I now call a petty alien despot. It has been said more than once that this matter was before the Court, and, consequently, there was no excuse for tlie drastic action which was taken by the men-if , indeed, it can be urged that they took any action. But what are the facts? In the first place, we have seen the respect which Mr Badger had for the Court. We know the extent to which he desired to appeal to it. We have seen the respect which he had for organizations that were formed under the provisions of -the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which was passed by this Parliament. Let us further examine the contention that the matter was before the Court, and that, consequently, there was no excuse for the men standing out of their employment when tliey might, by abandoning their rights as free citizens, have continued in it . The plaint was filed on the 12th October, and the resolution as to the wearing of the badge was arrived at in",73,Carty Salmon I Do Not Think Clecision On That Point Of Mr Justice H I G

269,Mr Brennan,"It is in fact and inMelbourne on the 25th April. Who composed the Australian Tramways Association at that time? Not the Brisbane tramway employees only. New South Wales contributed no less than 3,500 affiliated members, all of them wearing their badges undisturbeda loyal service. Victoria contributed 1,750 members, all of whom wore their badges; Western Australia had 180 members, all of whom wore their badges with impunity; and Tasmania contributed 70, all of whom enjoyed the like freedom; making a total roughly of 5,500. On the other hand, there were about 700 members in South Australia, and about 480 in Queensland, or 1,180 in all, who were denied this fundamental right of free citizens. But by far the greater number of members of the Association enjoyed, unhampered and unhindered, the right to wear this little trinket. Consequently, at the time this trouble arose, the status quo was the right of the members of the Association to wear the badge. The man who anticipated the judgment of the Court, and who attempted to settle the matter by force, was the manager of the Brisbane Tramway Company, who deliberately forbade his little handful of men this common law right. He based his action upon a regulation which readsThe employees agree to observe and be bound that even if the men had been deceived in by as well, all the clauses of the rules and regulations which relate to employees now in force as published from time to time. Does that mean that they were bound to accept any regulation which might be passed at any time, no matter how oppressive or gross in its incidence it might be? Surely it does not.mean that they are bound to accept a regulation which, according to a High Court Judge, was both illegal and oppressive? "" To the infinite credit of the men, be it said that, although at the time they proceeded to wear the badge, a considerable number of them were non-unionists, immediately this gross invasion of their the professional capacity of the gentleman personal liberty was attempted by Mr with whom I am proud to be associated as Badger, they flocked back to the union and stood side by side in the assertion of their common right. We have been told by the honourable member for Moreton, as well as by the Leader of the Opposition, that there was no tittle of excuse for the action of the employees, as the question of their right to wear the badge had already been included in the plaint. In respect of that, it has been said that we misled the men. Now the question as to whether or not the right to wear the badge was inserted in the plaint was first raised by the honourable member for Brisbane. The honourable member for Moreton has attempted to shunt some responsibility for this trouble on to the shoulders of that honourable member who stood out prominentlyand this is admitted by tnose who disagreed with him politically-as the one man who of all others was most strenuous, persistent, and honest in his efforts to quell the trouble. drivers on his carts. the honourable member is murmuring in his sleep. 'When this question was raised by the honourable member for Brisbane it had only an academic interest. It was something which he had ferreted out in his diligent search for some basis, however slight, upon which he could found a settlement of the trouble. It was a matter purely of academic interest, the point being that this elementary right of free men was not deemed a matter necessary to be put into the plaint at all. It was only because of the very careful and exhaustive draftmanship of the man who drew the plaint that it happened to be included in it. But honourable members oppo site, especially those who are lawyers, know perfectly well that the right of the men to wear the badge could have been inserted in, or taken out of, the plaint at any time. So regard to it, it was a matter which might have been amended at their instigation at any moment. There were 20,000 men on strike as the result of the general strike, and 400 who had been locked out. Not one of those ever suggested that he had been deceived. Yet that was the cry which was raised by Mr Badger, and which was greedily echoed by a certain section of the public. The claim that the men were misled is absolutely without foundation. Nevertheless, it was repeated by the Leader of the Opposition in this House, who not merely attacked the political integrity of others, but a partner, and whose name I feel bound to say is a synonym for patience, caution and thoroughness, in his conduct of this particular case. copy of the claim ? stand what the honourable member wishes to learn; but I will cheerfully tell him all that I know about the matter.

Tramways Association a communication which was the cause of the misapprehension concerning the right of the men to wear the badge being included in the plaint. explanation of this trifling circumstance which has been magnified into a question of great importance. As a matter of fact, the men took no interest in it whatever. Their curiosity was aroused merely by reason of the circumstance that the matter was thrust before them in the press. A number of them were thus prompted to ask what it all meant. I can readily understand a conservative gentleman who represents Queensland in the Senate being suddenly seized with an inspiration to write to the press in regard to wise, they arrived at their decision in a perthis matter six months after the event as though he had made a new discovery. I can easily understand the letter which was subsequently published, and which emanated from a certain independent workera leader of the Independent Workers Association, the union which was described by the learned Judge as a "" parasite growth."" I can easily understand this man who attacked the registration of the Association, who was defeated and would have been mulcted in costs if the Act had allowed of that being done, raising this question at the eleventh hour. May in reference to these independent workers. When I hear of these men claiming to be a union of independent workers, I ask myself of whom and of what they are independent. Is it more or less than the truth to say that they are merely independent of their moral obligations! to their fellow-workers, and very often men who, to their shame be it said, have entered into a conspiracy with their employers to defeat their fellow-employees? So much then for the tramway trouble; so much for the oppression and persecution laboured; so much for the judicial determination of the unreasonable and illegal act on the part of Mr Badger, which was the immediate cause of this industrial upheaval. It developed into a general strike. Let me say at once that we are not called It arose from the fact upon either to justify or condemn the general strike. In that matter, we have nothing to defend, because the charge canSo that the matter upon not properly be made against us. We did not originate the general strike. We have not condoned it ; we have not' even approved of it. We have not given honourable members opposite any satisfaction in that way; and yet they have laboured this motion of want of confidence with reference to the general strike as though we had to bear the whole responsibility of its commencement and prolongation. The honourable member for Parramatta desired to know what the Prime Minister had done to That is the whole prevent the general strike. It was a fatuous question in the first place; but the honourable member looked more foolish when he was asked what he had done in respect of the great strike that took place in his own State when he was somewhat similarly circumstanced. He first wanted to know what strike, and when he was told, his answer was, "" We l l , what could I have done?"" Whether the determination of the men to undertake a general strike was wise or unfectly orderly and regular manner. I am able to give the statement that it was the work of a few active agitators at the head of the men an absolutely flat contradiction. The men who assembled to consider the question were representatives deliberately chosen by their separate unions. Not one representative spoke at the meeting which ultimately determined upon the general strike without having behind him the f u l l authority of a union which had already considered the question. So much for the orderly way in which the decision was I say a word at this stage arrived at, and the representation of the men in regard to it. It shows, at any rate, how intense the feeling of the unionists of Brisbane was regarding the wrong which they conceived to have been done to their fellowunionists in the tramway service. Although the unionists of Brisbane paid the price, as they always must pay it, of a general strike, and indeed of any strike, I do not believe that even the general strike was wholly futile. I think it has so riveted public attention upon the facts, and so stirred the popular mind, that it will be many a long under which these men day before other men situated as was the manager of the Brisbane Tramway Company will bring about similar trouble.",75,Carty Salmon I Do Not Think Clecision On That Point Of Mr Justice H I G

276,Mr Brennan,"Nevertheless , I wiredWhileI take no responsibility for the general strike, for the decision to undertake it, or the manner in which it was carried on, I have a good deal to say as an eye-witness regarding the conduct of the men, and the conduct of those who were there to preserve order amongst the citizens of Brisbane. Let me refer first to a matter that has been already dealt with very trenchantly and effectively by the honourable member for Brisbane and the honourable member for Bourke. I refer to those deadly engines of destruction, those bombs, that were intended to be exploded in the streets of Brisbanei f we can believe those who have spoken of them. There was only one such incident reported"", so far as we have been able to find, during the whole of the industrial trouble; and that was referred to in the Brisbane Daily Mail of the 24th January, 1912. The following is the blood-curdling description .published in that paper, and fitting in most admirably with the dramatic language used by the honourable member for Bourke tonight, when he poured the acid of ridicule upon this aspect of the case:A DASTARDLY ACT. Hitlierto anarchists' methods have been placed to the credit of Russia, and it is in that land, that bomb throwing and other dastardly acts are indulged in, while here in Brisbane it seems that there is a person of so degenerate a turn of mind that he would ruthlessly hurl to destruction .1 number of innocent persons. . By nothing short of a miracle yesterday, Brisbane, and in fact the whole of Australia, escaped learning of the awful sensation of a tram car having been blown up right in the midst of a peaceful community. Concerning the incident,' the police maintain the utmost reticence, but from an authoritative source a Daily Mail representative gleaned some authentic proofs yesterday. ' A motorman of a tram car which was journeying to Bulimba along Commercial-road a little after 7 o'clock yesterday morning had reached the vicinity of Doggett-street, near which are points, and observed said the other night, out of the mouth of a dark-looking object lying in the points. Thinking that perhaps it was a piece of wood or leather hose pipe he did not stop to make a close examination, but passed over the object lying there, after which something prompjted him to go back and make another investigation. There were not many passengers travelling at the time, but among the few was a constable, who returned with the driver and the object was removed. I cannot help commending the driver for his discrimination, after suspecting that it was an explosive, in first driving over it and then going back to see what it wasTt was seen that the object was no less than a stick of gelignite measuring about three inches, and to it a detonator was attached. How the car passed over it and, together with Mr Brennan, the passengers, escaped being .blown to atoms is an unsolved mystery. The explosive was taken possession of by the police who were investigating the matter, and are in hopes of effecting an arrest. That was a harrowing story to be published in a Brisbane paper at this time, one that might well inspire the residents with awe, if not with horror, but it appears that the representative of the Courier had not been in the swim, and next day that paper gave a description of the incident in these few linesYesterday a small quantity of explosive was discovered in the points on the Bulimba tram line. The car actually passed over the obstruction before it was discovered, and no damage resulted. Had it really exploded, the noise might have occasioned some alarm. I quite admit that if the representative of sensationalism in the person of the Courier representative had known what was going on, he would have been out also, and would have written quite as blood-curdling a story as did the representative of the Daily Mail. No reliance can be placed upon these dramatic and awe-inspiring stories written by those who are sent out by the proprietors of certain journals to make a case against a kind which tends to bring discredit upon an honourable profession. The reading of the message sent by Mr Coyne to the Prime Minister has occasioned honourable members opposite a certain amount of amusement. I am not going to say that the request by him for the military to be sent up was wise or justified, but in view of the charges that have been made against .the strikers in Brisbane, I feel bound to publish some of the facts which go to show that Mr Coyne's allegations about unnecessary force, and even brutality, on the part of special and regular constables were justified and true. I propose to prove it , as the honourable member for Maribyrnong an adverse witness, namely, from the columns of the Brisbane Courier itself. The Strike Committee sent out their vigilance officers to preserve order, and appeals were made hourly by the leaders of the strike for the preservation of order. In fact, it was absurd to suppose that the general strike could have been other than futile in view of the gloved hand with which its managers proposed to conduct it. Their orders were emphatic that no necessary services were to be disturbed, and that law and order were to be preserved. AlthoughI do not approve of the gene 7 ral strike, I think its futility in such conditions, and in theface of orders of this kind, is a foregone conclusion in any circumstances. These vigilance officers were posted in different parts of the city of Brisbane, and wore upon their arms the legend "" V. 0."" Commissioner Cahill, of the Brisbane police, in his childish pettishness, imagined that this was an invasion of his prerogative as the guardian of the peace in Brisbane, and he wrote a most foolish letter to Mr Coyne, calling upon him to withdraw these men, and threatening to have them arrested as loiterers if they were not withdrawn. The Strike Committee had sufficient self-respect to write back to the Commissioner that they presumed he knew his duty in regard to the preservation of public order in Brisbane. I am not ashamed to say that I told the Commissioner, from a platform in Brisbane, that we dared him to arrest any man merely because he wore upon his arm a badge indicating that he was there to assist in the preservation of public order. three examples from different parts of the We told the Commissioner from the platform that, although this trouble had originated in Badger relating to the badge, things had not quite reached that pass in which a Commissioner of Police could forbid the wearing of a badge on the part of anycivilian in the city, and, of course, the ""V.O.'s,"" as they were called, were allowed fo remain on their beat, and did a great deal, as every one who .was there knows, to preserve public order. It is a singular thing that, at a time when we would suppose that the excitement was at its height, namely, the very day after the men came out, ancl the big procession was held, perfect order was preserved in the streets. The police were not so very much in evidence, and, although between 15,000 and 20,000 men marched through the streets, there was practically no disorder. I do not expect to live to see a more impressive sight than that which was presented by that body of men walking shoulder to shoulder, in silent, orderly, and yet emphatic, protest against what they conceived to be a gross injustice done to their fellow-workers. form-on e cannot insist upon this too much when we hear about the leaders who were alleged to be responsible for this troublepublic men and the leaders who were associated with the strike urged the men to abstain from any kind of. violence. Now we come to a report in the Courier, of the 3rd February, and. this is the adverse witness from whom I propose to show that the violence in Brisbane was not violence on the part of the men. I propose to show that, in that paper, by innuendo, by suggestion, by hints, an endeavour was made to create an impression that the men were rioting, violent, and boisterous, but all the hard facts quoted, go to prove that the violence was the violence and the foolishness of these wrong-headed men of mistaken zeal and little brief authority. It is not pleasant to me to have to charge the constables and special constables with unnecessary violence; in fact, I do not greatly blame them. I blame the men and the Government who incited them to act in this way. I blame, in particular, the Government who suggested to them that conduct of that kind was necessary, and would be palliated. Here is the account as told by a witness who went out on the and Februaryi n order to get evidence and publish it against the unionists. I have taken city, and I snail quote exactly from the Courier this biased witnessThe city was thrown into throes of an unprecedented tumult at about 10 a.m. The crowds of strikers and onlookers had by then swelled to some thousands, filling Turbot-street, Marketsquare, and the adjoining thoroughfares. The unionists, who had mustered in force in Turbotstreet outside the Trades Hall, displayed a manifest intention of organizing a procession. That is just a sample. The men displayed a ""manifest intention of doing some! ; thing which we know they had no intention of doing, because they had been urged by their leaders, and had by their applause and approval showed that they had no intention of holding a procession. But the charge is that they displayed a manifest intention of doing soThe police were determined to prevent anything of the sort, and to exert their authority strong measures were taken. The intention of the processionists was to march into Marketsquare and thence round the city. Accordingly From every platthe police were drawn up across the roadway from Roma-street Barracks to AlbeTt-street. A double line of mounted men, and a few yards in front of them a double line of foot' constables. It was deemed well to arm the latter with carbines, and in order to make the position more secure bayonets were fixed. The gTeat crowd was in front of this human barricade, and ii bigger crowd behind. Let honourable members not forget that there were 20,000 of these men in the",76,Carty Salmon I Do Not Think Clecision On That Point Of Mr Justice H I G

This is how it is further describedThe show of force answered to the extent of persuading the processionists that they would have to abandon their intention. Note the reference to an intention which had never crystallized into an actI t is stated that at the Trades Hall the crowds were in that direction counselled by some of their leaders to disperseIt is known that they were counselled to disperse, and that they were dispersing as far as was reasonable and practicableand they were informed that arrangements would be made with butchers and bakers to prevent any shortages of food supplies. The honourable member for Brisbane has shown that these arrangements were to some extent frustrated by a combination of master butchers and master bakers, who decided that they would not supply the necessaries of life to the people of the cityThe intention of the ""badgeites"" was, however, centred on the police, who were under the personal direction of Commissioner Cahill, Chief Inspector Urquhart, Inspectors Gerigety and Short, and Sub-Inspector Carroll, and some others. The crowd began to close in, and further dangerous pushing and occasional rushing made it necessary for the police to charge and clear the square. The crowd across Ann-street, on the Georgestreet side, was first driven back, and showed a desire to resist, some of the more obstreperous persons staying behind until the troopers literally rode them off their feet. They had stayed behind, and for doing so, troopers literally rode them off their feetFor the moment it seemed as if a determined attack on the police was contemplatedMark the word ""contemplated."" It has not crystallized into an act or a fact, but it is contemplatedbut the crush was backed about ioo yards along the street without serious trouble, and held there by the officers, who then pushed another batch of men along Roma-street and held them there. For a considerable time the police refrained from any really aggressive moveUp to that time, they had literally driven the men off their feet, but we are assured they were not aggressivein the direction of thc crowds,' an admirable restraint being displayed by officers and men alike. Presently, however, there was every indication of them and the specials being swept from their positions by the excited mob, and prompt action was then taken eventually in pursuance of a well thought out plan. The first step was to place a' cordon of police armed with carbines and batons across the upper Albert-street where it leads to the Trades Hall. ever, were forced back, and behind the armed men the special constables were drawn up. Then the armed men drove back the crowd Mr Brennan. which surged from the upper end of Ann-street into the square, and another cordon was placed across the street. Yells and cries were followed by blows at the policeHonorable members will remark that they were so ill-directed that no policeman was struckand it became necessary to detail a squad of foot constables with batons drawn to assist in the task of clearing the square. Commissioner Cahill, in person, led the charge in different directions, and when some of the crowd went so far as to aim blows at him he drew his baton and cleared a way around him. A stirring scene was witnessed as the crowd was forced back against a hoarding which surrounded the Town Hall side, many of them stood against the wall and refused to move until they were actually forced back by the breasts of the horses. Some of them had got around at the back of the hoarding, whence they were ultimately dislodged. Others climbed a tree which stands there, and, being beyond the reach even of the mounted men, weathered the storm. "" weathered the storm "" is goodOthers took refuge in doorways, from which they had to be forced. The police gradually forced the people back. This action was forcibly resented1 should think it would beby some of the men, until at last the officers were compelled to use their batons, and a number of blows were struck. The determination of the force quickly made itself felt, the still shouting crowd being steadily dispersed, but not before a number of them had been struck down; and the Ambulance Brigade was on tbe scene attending to the injured promptly. Some of those who were struck down were able to leave unassisted, others had to be carried off by the bearers. Then the report finishes with this remarkable statementNo such determined effort at mob rule has ever been witnessed in the hitherto peace-loving community of Brisbane. "" No such determined effort at mob rule!"" The men who were chased into parks and out of them, dislodged from doorways where they had taken refuge, gouged with bayonets and struck down, carried off in an ambulance, ridden literally off their feet, as is stated in another place, were the men who made a determined effort at mob rule. Did the authorities expect the men, like birds, to fly away, or like rabbits or wombats, to get into their burrows, or where in the streets of Brisbane did they expect the men to go? Will any reasonable man, examining that report of a biased witness, tell me that it does not bear on its face the strongest evidence that there was unnecesThe crowd, howsary and foolish violence on the part of the . excited police, and that, in the circumstances, the men were grossly ill-used. honourable member expect the Government to do? pected the Government to exercise reasonable restraint, and to allow the men to walk about like free citizens, instead of chivvying them about like sheep or wild animals in their own streets. member blame the Government for swearing in special constables? Government for inciting, as we know they did incite, the police to take drastic and unnecessary offensive measures; and I blame the men who were employed for taking these measures, though I do not blame them so much as I do the Government. I shall now take another witness from GeorgestreetHOT UGLY RUSHES BY THE MOB. THE AMBULANCE BUSY. With the disturbance at its height in Marketsquare opportunity was taken by several thousands, men, women, and some young folk, to make a dash along Turbot-street towards Georgestreet. Mounted and foot police, with batons drawn, were quickly at their heels, but the crowd, angry and turbulent, gave way by inches, hurling epithets of defiance at their pursuers. George-street quickly became a seething mass, in which could be seen intrepid constables keeping the populace on the move, a portion of the crowd invading the grounds of the Supreme Court. "" Intrepid constables,"" armed with carbines and batons against unarmed men, with no I should think they would be quite unweapons of offence or intention of offendprepared for any such courseing, kept them' on the move.

A section of the crowd had what occurred in Queen-street, because, of ill the meantime taken up a position in Georgestreet, in the vicinity of the Railway offices. all the wild and foolish manoeuvring on the Major Cahill spread out his main force without part of the police, this was, I think, the difficulty. There was another fierce outburst, most fatuousand batons were called into use with such effect that several of the more vicious men bit the dust, and were taken in hand by the ambulance men who were in attendance with the motor. the rowdies collected their force again in QueenSome mounted the verandah at the Railway street, and a shout outside the Courier building oflices, and also, in some cases, forced their about 11.30 sounded the warning of another way on the colonnades and on one or two hotels rush.

They kept on the move accompanied by a large squad of foot police and a number of mounted men.

The"" aggressors,"" markThe return of the processionists, or partial processionists, was the signal for further demonstration of angry resistance to the rules of law and order. At the intersection of Queenstreet Major Cahill rode into thecrowd, which scattered into Queen-street on the one and Victoria-bridge and North Quay on the other. The Commissioner rode to the Elizabeth-street corner and visited the police offices, and here some of the mob made a desperate rally, and one constable at least received a blow which felled him to the ground.

They were formed up in double line in the middle of the street, and waited until a few mounted men had come into position, then, on the order from Sub-Inspector Ferguson, they charged the mob, which seemed quite unprepared for such a course, and fled towards the railway gates.

The crowd fled round Albert-street ancl dispersed up and down Elizabeth-street. Taking warning from what had occurred, many people proceeded without further delay to barricade their shops. I should think that it was about time. There we have the story told by a number of biased witnesses, who went out in order to get evidence against the men. told how the men were harassed unnecessarily through the streets-me n who, as I have said, had no weapons to defend themselves, and no intention of offending, who were dislodged by bayonets from ' doors where they had taken refuge, who were ousted by the force of the horses ridden by the troopers, and who were eventually, to die shame of those responsible, carried off blood-stained on ambulances. And this is the best case that the mover of this motion of censure has against the men in connection with the general strike. I agree with the Prime Minister when he says that he would be proud to be associated with men of this kind. I should be proud to be associated with men who, under the provocation that these men suffered, and in the circumstances by which they were surrounded, preserved their self-restraint and sense of manliness to such a degree that, notwithstanding the incitement to resist and take some active offensive or defensive measures, they did not do anything of, the kind. So far from the city being held up in defiance of law and order, they were guilty of scarcely any more disorderly conduct than we should expect to find on an ordinary gala day, when people are out for their own amusement. When I read in the press the names by which these men are designated-the "" pack,"" the ""mob,"" the ""disturbers of law and order ""-and when I consider those terms in the light of the people and the facts to which they relate, I could well understand and sympathize with a man, perhaps a horny-handed son of toil, who, on reading such accounts, might make his way into the office of the Courier, and, in the language of Banjo PattersonHe seized the nearest gilded youth And tried to break his neck. But it is to the infinite credit of the men that nothing of the kind was done. We have heard a great deal of the city of Brisbane being held up by force. What kind of force? Was there any discipline by which these men were bound one to another, ilfr. Brennan. except the sense of moral obligation which binds man to man in circumstances of the kind? If there was any force, it was entirely a moral force, that force which has made unionism respected and unionists beloved of one another-that sentiment which binds man to man, mate to mate, comrade to comrade, in times of trouble and adversitya moral force which, if I may say so, has made of a miner and a unionist the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. An honWe are orable member wishes to know what would have happened if the police had not overcome the strikers. In face of what I have already read a great deal more could be read, but I shall not further weary a wearied House by a repetition of incidents -wha t an absurdity it is to ask such a question ! There was nothing to overcome; and I confidently assert that there would have been nothing in the nature of riot or turmoil if it had not been for the action of the police. I have not the least doubt that that is literally correct-the whole of this turmoil in Brisbane was due to the unnecessarily repressive measures taken in regard to the men. The honourable member for Brisbane has already pointed out that, notwithstanding the excited public feeling, and the extent to which these men were incensed-notwith % standing the degree to which they had been injured as well as incensed-ther e was practically no damage to property or injury to life or limb. That is a very remarkable record in all the circumstances. I now come to the final stage. ber has not answered one statement of the honourable member for Moreton. pleasure of hearing all that the honourable member for Moreton had to say; but, so far as I did hear it, I answered his statements there and then on the floor of the House, though, perhaps, I was guilty of disorder in doing so. As to the employment of the military for the suppression of disorder in Brisbane, the fact is abundantly clear that the Premier of Queensland thought that, on a technical interpretation of the Constitution, he could force the Commonwealth Government: to send troops to be employed against the strikers. Indeed, that is clear, on Mr Denham's own admission; and I shall quote from the columns of the Courier in order to show that he still persists in the view that he could compel the Commonwealth Government to send troops into the State to quell what he considered', or' pretended to consider, to be domestic violence.",80,Charges By The Police
282,Mr Mcwilliams,The honourable mem,81,Charges By The Police
283,Mr Brennan,"I did not have theMore than once he has told the public and the .press that the terms of the Constitution are mandatory-that the Commonwealth shall protect the State against domestic violence. I am pleased to know that it is acknowledged by constitutional authorities opposite that in this Mr Denham is absolutely wrong. I am glad to know that the Commonwealth has not reached that condition of humiliation in which it may be dragged at the chariot wheels of a Premier, who, fbr his own electioneering purposes-, desires to compel this Government to pour troops into any particular State. That position has been abandoned. But I will quote the Brisbane Courier of a recent date, in order to show the arrogance ancl insolence with which the Premier of Queensland still insists on his position, even in spite of the Opposition. I hope that honourable members opposite enjoy the position in which they are placed in defending Mr Denham in the attack which he makes upon the independence of the Commonwealth Parliament. Then, it was said that the troops ought to have been sent in any case. We have, however, been able to quote Mr Denham to show that, at the very time when he received the telegraph message from the Prime Minister, he admitted that he had abundant power in his own State to preserve public order, without the interference of the military at all. It is true that he absolutely contradicted that in a letter to His Excellency the Governor of Queensland; but, at all events, this is what lie said to the publicI Can assure the citizens that ample protection in a period of civil disorder it calls for such as is afforded by the enrolment of special constables, foot and horse. early in the week, normal conditions of trade should not obtain in the metropolitan area. ham saidI t showed how very grave the situation was, and how unprepared the State was to deal with it; And this, after assuring the citizens that ample protection was afforded by the enrolment of special contables, foot and horse! I want now to quote from the Brisbane ham towards this Parliament. On the 19th February, he addressed a further communication to the Governor of Queensland, supplementary to that of the 5th. In this document he saidI have the honour respectfully to inform Your Excellency lhat Ministers will seriously consider the question of calling on the Commonwealth to reimburse the State the expenditure [28] that has been rendered necessary by the deliberate neglect of the Commonwealth Government to f u l f il its obligation to the State. . . . It is now evident that the strike executive, from the very beginning of the reign of terror it established, was confident that, in spite of the Constitution, the appointed guardian of the peace in such circumstances-the Commonwealth Government-woul d at least be neutral in the conflict of order with anarchy. In fact, the Prime Minister, in a published interview with a press reporter, admitted he had received representations from the strike executive as well as from the State Government, which should have been his sole adviser on such an occasion; and it is clear that the views of the former body prevailed with him. While the Prime Minister has up lo the present made no serious effort to justify his violation of the ConstitutionNo one in this House, except the honourable member for Moreton to-night, has suggested that the Prime Minister violated the Constitutionhe has by means of interviews with press reporters indicated the line of defence he will take if his conduct is challenged, as it undoubtedly ought to be, by Queensland representatives in the Federal Parliament. The honourable member for Moreton has taken his cue from that. Apparently he intends to plead that the situation in Brisbane was not grave enough to warrant Federal interference, and that the Federal Defence Act gave him authority to disregard the Constitution and to remain inactive. These two contentions are very easily disposed of. As I have shown in my previous letter to Your Excellency on the subject, the Constitution, which has transferred from the State to the Commonwealth the military power that was indispensable to the security of the State in the strike of 1S91, obliges the Commonwealth to place its armed forces at the service of the State when sistance. The Commonwealth cannot constituI see no reason why, tionally decline the application. Its duty is to comply without question, and to cast on the State the onus of the action. When the Constitution was being framed an attempt was made to insert in it a phrase which would have given the Commonwealth the discretion the Prime Minister has exercised unwarrantably. But the attempt was unsuccessful, and the obligation is as binding as words could make it. But even if the Constitution in specific terms gave the Commonwealth a discretion in the matter. . . . Mark that! We have no discretion, according to the Premier of Queensland. I think that that document is remarkable alike for its insolence ancl its ignorance of the true constitutional position. I am very glad to find myself in agreement with those distinguished lawyers in the House and out of it who say that there is no constitutional obligation upon this Commonwealth to send its troops into any State at the mere behest of a State Premier who chooses to allege that there is a condition of domestic .",81,Charges By The Police
284,"Yet, In His Letter To The Governor, Mr Den",,82,Charges By The Police
285,Courier To Show The Attitude Of Mr Den,"violence in his State, and that immediately a request is made. tion is that a discretion is vested in as to the operation of its troops. It is pertions made the other night by the honourable fectly obvious that they cannot be manipulated by a State. They must be manipulated by the Commonwealth; and the manner, ancl time, and extent to which they shall said, '' They promote disputes; they make be operated must rest in the discretion of the Commonwealth. Consequently, I say that the contention now made in the letter published in the Brisbane Courier is alike insolent and ignorant. When the matter was pressed further, the Attorney-General was able to show that, in any case, the Queensland Government had not complied with the conditions which would render it lawful for the Commonwealth to send troops to Brisbane. So that, apparently, both upon the law and the facts, the Commonwealth Government was right, whilst the Queensland Government and those members of the Opposition who have supported them and endorsed their action were absolutely wrong. Finally, Mr Speaker, I do not think that any sane man, no, I will not go so far as that, but will say that it is hard to understand how any sane man, in view of what I have read, and of what other honourable members have stated in this House as to what was the real condition of affairs at Brisbane, can come to any other conclusion than that it would have been disastrous to send troops of armed men into the streets of Brisbane. The statement of the Queensland Premier himself in one place was that they were ..not required, and that he could do without them. In another place he said that he was helpless without them. The fact is that they were not required. been pointed out that the Premier was not entitled to them at the time when he said he wanted them, and for the purpose for which he said he wanted them, namely, to supply food to the people. There are two outstanding facts which will for ever redound to the credit of this Commonwealth Government-two matters widely separated in time, but associated in nature and in kind. The one is that they refused to be drawn into that jingoistic enterprise of presenting to Great Britain a Dreadnought, of which we heard so much not long since; and the other is that they declined to be coerced by the State Government of Queensland, which, for political party purposes, desired to force their hand into sending troops on an enterprise for Mr Brennan. which they were not required. I set out The true posimerely to speak upon these points, and, do not desire to open up any others. I will the Commonwealth Government conclude with a reference to some observamember for Kooyong, who spoke of the rush of unionists to appear before the Arbitration Court. The honourable member artificial quarrels for the purpose of getting within the jurisdiction of that Court; they abandon their local tribunals and the operation of their local Acts in order to get within the purview of that Court."" For what purpose? The honourable member for Kooyong does not ""join with some ill-mannered persons of equal ill-judgment in the country, who have sufficient lack of grace to attack the President of the Arbitration Court. The honourable member gives to the President his highest encomiums, admitting him to be a man sound in law, of the highest personal integrity, and in every way fitted for the position he holds. Yet he says that men from all sides are endeavouring by every means in their power, legitimate and otherwise, to bring their claims under the jurisdiction of this Court. For what purpose, then? Is it not obvious that such a man, in such circumstances, must be administering justice, and nothing more nor less than justice? And does it not follow logically that, if there are these persistent and continuous efforts to come within the jurisdiction of the Court, they must spring from a simple and natural desire to obtain justice? The more honourable members opposite prove that the tendency in that direction is strong and irresistible, the more they prove that these men have been denied justice only too It has long in other places. I should very much like to have said something upon an observation made last night by the honourable member for Flinders as to tbe Arbitration Court generally and its alleged failure. I do not admit that it has failed, but I do say that it has worked under very great and pressing difficulties, and that it will never be wholly successful until the shackles are removed from it, and it is given that freedom of action which the Government that I am supporting desires to accord to it. The honourable member for Flinders quoted the President of the Court as saying that he wasI do not pretend to remember the exact words-veste d with legislative functions, and not simply with the functions of a Judge, and that consequently his work was greatly increased, and the difficulties of his position rendered more complex. But there is a great and striking difference between the attitude of the two. men. The honourable member for Flinders argues that the Court should be abolished or abandoned, whereas the President of the Court merely made that statement, as he has made others, some of which I have quoted to-night, to show that the utility of the Court is greatly hampered by the constitutional limitations by which he is bound, and that when they are removed, as we hope they will be, its usefulness will be largely enhanced. At this early hour of the morning honourable members are too tired to listen to, and I am too weary to go into, an academic discussion of the question of industrial unrest, and how we ought to cope with it. I desire, however, to express regret that this motion of want of confidence, which might have been turned at least to some useful purpose by honourable members of tlie Opposition temperately suggesting some means by which industrial unrest might be checked, has been made the occasion for a carping, chiding, bitter attack against our fellow men in another State. That is really what the action of the Opposition amounts to. It is perfectly idle for the Leader of the Opposition to say that he makes no charge against these men, and that he does not suggest that they would be guilty of any of these atrocities which, in my view, are, to a great extent, imaginary. We know perfectly well that the suggestion, as first made, that the men are associated in some way with these acts of violence, so far as acts of violence are proved at all, is allowed to travel all over the Commonwealth, and to influence and poison the minds of people outside this Chamber, whereas the deduction that the Leader of the Opposition afterwards mildly draws, that we are not justified in supposing that the strikers were privy to the acts of violence, is not half so widely advertised. I look forward to a time when we shall be able to approach these questions of difference between employer and employ^ with less bitter feeling. I regret very much that what I have felt bound to say, even in these most difficult and trying circumstances, has had to be by way of defence of the men against whom these charges have been levelled. Twenty thousand of these unionists are concerned. Many of them are the fathers of families. They are men who, if I may so express it, are the backbone of the great city of Brisbane, and it is pitiable to find two or three [ 8]-2 2 weeks of the time of the CommonwealthParliament devoted to an attack upon, and a defence of, them. the men, but upon the Government action. the attack was nominally upon the Government for their action in the matter; and it must be acknowledged that the attack, so far as it is an attack upon the Government in respect of the Brisbane strike, has absolutely failed. I do not think that any honourable member of the Opposition can honestly believe that, so far as the Brisbane strike is concerned, he has made out any case against the Government. I do not think that the Opposition believe that they have made out a case against the Government on any of these points. When I heard the striking and drastic terms of this motion of want of confidence, I thought that the Opposition would be able to point to something on which we had gone wrong, and, indeed, I should not have been greatly surprised if they had found us wrong in something. None of us is infallible; bin. the motion, and the discussion that has taken place upon it, constitute in themselves the highest testimonial that the Government could possibly have. [2.55 a.m.] I join with the honourable member who has just resumed his seat in regretting many of the expressions which have been used during this debate, and the amount of time that has been devoted to the Brisbane strike, which may be regarded as the central point of the discussion. I agree with him also in deploring the failure of our present-day methods of dealing with industrial troubles. My mind goes back to the time when the question of conciliation and arbitration was first brought before tlie Federal Parliament, and when it was discussed with a freedom and absence of ill-feeling that had much to do with the successful passing of the Bill through the House. Honourable members on both sides seemed to bend their minds in the direction of devising some means of saving Australia from those blots upon industrialism whicli undoubtedly exist in other parts of the world. We were anxious to save this young country from the ill effects of strikes. I am one of those who believe-and I speak with some personal knowledge-that no strike has ever yet occurred that has not done injury to some one.

288,Dr. Carty Salmon (Laanecoorie),"there has never yet been a strike that has not been in the end beneficial. I do not go with them to anything like that distance. I was in the Old Country when the great Scottish railway strike took place, and I had opportunities of seeing the inner and after effects of that strike upon a very large body of people, who had absolutely nothing whatever to do either with initiating or continuing it . They were the innocent sufferers, and their sufferings made such an impression upon me that I determined, if ever the opportunity offered, to do my utmost to prevent Australia, the land of my birth, being subjected to a similar experience. industry, and intelligence that were brought to bear by this Parliament upon this question of conciliation and arbitration, what have we really accomplished ? We have placed an Act upon the statute-book of the Commonwealth, and have amended that Act in certain respects, yet we find that it is entirely impotent in fending off the results which seem inevitably to follow modern industrialism. My idea, and that of nine-tenths of those who took part in the debates on the Conciliation and Arbitration B ill , was that, once it came into operation, no matter what the nature of ah industrial dispute might be, there should be no cessation of industry. That, indeed, is the essence of the measure. round that point that all our energies were concentrated. disastrous effects that undoubtedly do impinge upon the individual, and to save the community from this unnatural and barbaric system of carrying on our industrialism. railway train have been driven through cision of the Court, and were prepared to that Act.

By the -abolition of the opportunity which was given to a large number of people at the last Federal election to record their votes by post, the Government have shown, either their mistrust in themselves or their administration, or a woeful want of trust in the people of Australia. The improper and unjustifiable abolition of the postal voting provisions will, in my opinion, rebound against the Government in a fashion which, I venture to say, they scarcely dream of at present. ceived more postal votes than my opponent. lieve that the honourable member is so selfish as his remark would indicate, but he is bound to consider the party with which tie is associated, and also his masters outside, who would give him a very short -shrift if he expressed any opinions other than those which he is expressing now. After the last election, the fiat went forth that the postal voting provisions were operating against the Labour party, and therefore must be altered.

Will there be a pollingbooth beside each bed? Do those who are such sticklers for the secrecy of the ballot suggest a perambulating ballot-box for the collection of tlie votes of the patients ? The proposal would be ludicrous if it were not tragic. And clo honourable members say that the sick in charitable institutions shall have the privilege of voting, but that those who are confined to their own homes shall be prevented from exercising the franchise? Directly this restrictive measure was passed, the Labour party found itself in trouble, and I cannot beit will be in more serious trouble later. Far too many people are prevented from various reasons from casting their vote to give any excuse for limiting voting facilities. opportunities for voting. honourable members do not put the absent voters' provision as a set-off against the abolition of postal voting, which, in my honest opinion, is as pure and clean a system as voting at the ballot-box. I am not a child in politics, and that is my view. have been carried on in connection with postal voting. If honourable memtices have occurred in connection with ordinary voting, but that is not given as a reason for the abolition of the ballot. It is the motive underlying the abolition of postal voting that I attack. It was unworthy of honourable members, for the preservation of their political safety is imputing an unworthy motive. That he may not do. They have proclaimed that all say that there is a party outside this House which, for its political purposes, has restricted the opportunities for voting, and gone back upon its professions in regard to securing equality of opportunity for all.

I know that, in my own electorate, a number of persons were prosecuted for merely falling into error. When friends came to me about what had been done on the other side, I said , "" For Heaven's sake, do not ; constitute yourselves public informers. If improper things were done, it was through want of knowledge of the l a w ."" I remember two cases in which' the authorized witness, in the presence of a justice of the peace, assisted a voter to sign the ballot paper. That was done in pure ignorance of the law. The illegal act took place in the presence of a witness. No one would do such a thing for the sake of one vote, and it was known how the electors would cast their votes. Similar things happened on both sides. too, in connection with voting at the ballot. In one case, of which the particulars were published in the press, a man who had voted was asked to go back and vote for some one else who was ill and could not go to the poll. He did this, apparently thinking that he was entitled to vote as often as he liked for persons who could not vote, and on whose behalf he was authorized to act. That man, of course, was prosecuted for personation. me draw the attention of the Minister of 'Home Affairs to the fact that there are being returned through the post-offices hundreds of cards bearing names at addresses which cannot be found. This is a matter which should be inquired into immediately. take steps to see that our rolls are not stuffed. If my dearest friend were guilty of anything of that sort, I would have no hesitation in saying that a very heavy penalty should be inflicted upon him. help us very materially. There is just one other point to which I wish to direct attention. our electoral system being faulty/ there is 1 a grave defect in our existing method of voting. We shall never obtain a true reflex of the will of the people until we adopt some preferential system of voting. I am aware that honourable members opposite are quite satisfied with the present system. People are always prone to be satisfied with a system which gives them an advantage. The party opposite have succeeded under the existing system, and it is not likely that they will alter it. Nevertheless, I would urge them to afford the people an opportunity to exercise the widest and most unrestricted choice in the matter of their parliamentary representatives. Under the system which at present obtains, it is possible that the true choice of the electors may be returned to Parliament in cases where there is a multiplicity of candidates. But there are enormous odds to one that he will not be, and that a candidate will be elected who represents a minority. In Victoria the Labour party always use the preferential system. It is part of the rules of their organization. of elections for the House of Representatives. There are irregularities, party is at liberty to plump if he chooses to do so. in connection with the State elections, it is part of the Labour party's programme. hand the rules of the Political Labour Council of Victoria, and, on page 10, which deals with candidates and the methods of their selection, I find the f o l In this connection, let lowingThe voting shall be by ballot on the preferential system, an explanation of which must be printed on the ballot-papers. member that a ballot took place only last night, and the Argus this morning states The Department should that the electors were at liberty to plump if they so desired. statement upon the authority which I have quoted.

When they find that any part of it is working to their disadvantage, they imimediately abolish it. If they do that sort of thing, they must accept the opprobrium which will undoubtedly attach to them. The Minister of Trade and Customs has been so helpful to me during the course of any remarks that I feel I almost owe him an apology for having to say a word or two in reference to his Department. I wish again to express my deep regret that he has not been able to live up to his political professions. When he was upon this side of the House, there was no more .ardent advocate of a Protective policy than ihe w-as. Upon every conceivable occasion he delivered the most fiery and convincing .'Protectionist speeches. Yet he now reclines -at ease upon the Ministerial bench, caring very little indeed for the industries whose -welfare he had so much at heart only a few -months ago. Have things altered so considerably since then that it is unnecessary -.that assistance should now be granted to industries which are suffering from undue competition? Are the prosperity of the Commonwealth and an overflowing Treasury so consoling to him that he can view with equanimity the competition to which our people are being subjected? Is he so satisfied with the industrial position of the workers that he is prepared to allow the cold blasts of outside competition to continue to blow upon them?

But I venture to say that there are one or two representatives of Victoria jn this Chamber who are not feeling -at all comfortable regarding their prospects at the next election. Something will have to be done upon the question of Protection if they are to come back here. Some of these honourable members actually gained their seats in this House because -.they were regarded as staunch Protectionists. How have they discharged the obligation which undoubtedly rested upon them? They have followed the Minister of Trade and Customs. as well as has the honourable member. the honourable member had given as many Protectionist votes in this House as I have. Of course, he was not here when we were engaged in the strenuous fiscal fight. But I would ask him whether he is satisfied with the present position, from a Protectionist stand-point. be satisfied, because he has in his electorate one of the most important manufacturing centres in the Commonwealth. In his constituency there is to be found a body of men who, although they be members of Political Labour jLeagues, place Protection to Australian industries even above their fidelity to those organizations.

371,Mr Carr (Macquarie) [3.50 A.m.],"might have that sort of thing said about it, and there is no sort of indictment in it . It is rather to the credit of the Government ithat they have not been hustled and bustled into doing things which the country would regret, and for which they would probably 'have paid the supreme penalty of political death. If they had done that, they would have rendered themselves of no avail in that march towards greater industrial peace and general prosperity which we are at present negotiating. I am f u l l y aware that many of our people are disappointed. I hear comments outside indicating that they are bitterly disappointed ; but many men, more particularly the Radical section of the community, expect too much of a Government. They do not realize the limitations placed upon responsible government. We who have served a term in the House know by experience, and many men outside who go more fully into such matters, also realize, those limitations, and do not expect too much from responsible government. munity, and are intrusted with the conduct -of their affairs, the Government can no longer be partisan to the extent of passing 'legislation on certain lines only. I do not know of any case in the past where the expressed will of the people, or of a large section of them, in the direction of revolutionary reform has been accomplished by responsible government except at the point -of the sword. -accomplished, as history shows, but only .after tremendous stress and strain upon the -multitude of the people, and through the .agency of a Cromwell or a Napoleon. There is no call for that sort of thing in Australia. ""We must move along constitutional lines. Reforms that are slow are sure, and the Government are pursuing a safe course in going -slowly, because they are thereby doing what 'they are doing more surely. For that reason any who support this party expecting revolutionary reforms are doomed to disappointment, just as surely as our opponents are -disappointed because the Government have not been led astray. If the Government had done all that some would have them do, the indictment levelled against them might have 'had some firm foundation; but, because they have not, they have caused bitter chagrin to the Opposition, and have probably consider. ably disappointed a number of -people outside. It seems to me that the -Government ' have gone practically as far as they oan in --the matter of'industrial reform by the legislation that has already been enacted so far as concerns securing more of the results of men's labour to them than they have hitherto received. The Government have established Arbitration Courts and made them a final test of the relationship between employer and employee. Parliament has virtually said, "" Thus far and no farther can we go,"" I believe Parliament might have done a little more, so far as its own Departments are concerned, in the matter of regulating the conditions of employment. I was adverse to handing over our own Departments to the Arbitration Court, although I realized that the alternative was a difficult. one. But since we have done so, I of course submit to the situation, but that does not alter my view, or that of many outside who had hoped for great benefits from this Government. They say, "" What is the use of the further extension of Government employment if it simply means that we are placed under the control of the Arbitration Court, and are therefore not one whit better off than our fellows in any other form of employment? "" Under the system Once we represent the whole comadopted by the Government of handing their employees over to the Arbitration Court, the extension of government functions, entailing the same control by the Arbitration Court, will not place men in a better position, or secure them any greater reward fpr their labours, than anybody else might get; and I contend that the Government should be a model employer, and the conditions of Government employment ideal, so that the best Drastic reforms have been men in the community may be attracted to the Government service. I admit that Parliament cannot go into all the details of the staffs employed in the various Departments; but it can surely lay down certain broad lines, providing, for instance, that men who have been a certain length of time in the service and are in responsible positions shall not receive less than a certain amount. I know men who have been postmasters for thirty years, and are still under the .£200 mark. They are engaged in arduous and responsible work, with no limitation of hours, living, as they do, on the premises, and being at the beck and call of the public. The Government might have done more in this direction if anything, but ,it is altogether out of the question at present for them to extensively control wide fields of enterprise. the bank that we have established .has had to be absolutely freed frompolitical control, and placed entirely beyond our reach,",91,Carty Salmon T O Our Deplorable Strike
372,Mr Kingo ' Malley,R e d tape kills it.,92,Carty Salmon T O Our Deplorable Strike
373,Mr Carr,"It does. The fact thatwith complete power given to the bank managerI realize that that is necessary, and do not cavil at it-tend s to show how difficult it is for the reforms which are so dear to the hearts of many men to be accomplished per medium of the politician. The politician can do very little more than we are doing. On entering into other arenas, he has to engage men outside the political sphere altogether, arid .versed in the particular line of business concerned. Unfortunately for reform generally to-day, the men who are specially qualified for those responsible positions have not by birth ancl training, that human sympathy which is in accord with the Democratic spirit of the age. That is one of the troubles from which we suffer. The men in whom we nave to repose our trust, and whose aid we1 have to enlist, are, for the most part, opposed to us politically, because they are Conservative by birth and training. That is one of the undoubted difficulties in gettunity is a big one. I began my remarksting any real reform effected. It shows clearly that, before we can have any extensive system of Government enterprise or nationalization, which is more or less in the of life. Given that fairer adjustment, 1 air to-day, the rank and file of the people must know better what they want, and understand more fully the system of society which they desire to reform and remould. For that reason, I incline very much to the idea that the proper stages upward are through unionistic movements of a co-operative and co-partnership nature. I do not say that that should be the one end and aim. of the Opposition, I know, have put this forward as a solution of the industrial problem. I do not regard it as a solution, but as a necessary step in the way up for the masses of the people. Then they will know more fully what they want; they will understand more fully things which they set out to reform, and will be better able to grasp a wider and larger situation when it comes to the turn of the State to take control of any of the industries which supply those things essential tb a civilized community. This seems to me to be a matter in which the unions and the toilers generally will have to school themselves in more, and depend less upon any Parliament to do things for them, as society at present exists. I am pleased to see that in Sydney the Saddlers Union is qualifying itself for more effective work by entering the arena of business on its own behalf, not looking to Parliament, but tendering and getting contracts Mr Carr. for the supply of saddlery, and so forthy and in so doing, it is making better termsfor its individual members than it could 1 possibly get in the Arbitration Court. In other words, by helping itself it is getting along much better than it would do by looking to Parliament to help it and uplift it. much more sensible thing than to -.spend money in"" strikes. with what the Prime Minister said some time ago in my hearing, at a public meeting. He said, "" We do not want to l if t the people up; when you do lift the people up you have to hold them up, but we want to give them the opportunity to lift themselves up."" That is a function of government, and one which we shall have to discharge more fully before the people can be fairly lifted up.

We have done very good work. The Government deserves the support of the community for no other reason than the fact that it has attacked the great land monopoly of Australia. This monopoly of the source of all wealth is, in my opinion, the worse form of monopoly. It has been attacked, some say, without result. simultaneously with the imposition of the graduated land tax has come a greater movement in land than was ever known before in Australia. I know it . I live in it country district, where I have seen more land sales than were ever known to take place before. It has not cheapened land particularly, I admit. that it would do so. All that I believed that it would do would be to make more land available. I know that land which could not be had for love or money before the imposition of the tax-lan d the value of which could not be ascertained because the owners would not put a price upon it has since been on the market, at a high price if you w ill ; but it is better for it to be on the market at a high There will price than not on the market at all. It only wants an extension of the system to do still further good for Australia. Of course, I am not advocating any whole-hog single-tax proposition. I realize all the chaos which would follow from the expropriation of the unearned inThe Attorney-General lightly crement. I am f u l ly alive to the injustice which would be done to those who have paid modern values for the land, even though those values have been publicly created. It is a source of wealth, however, which we may tap with less compunction than any other source I know, because it is most, We simply order and equitable from every point of view, and it is most necessary from the national point of view, that we should have the way to the land more clearly open than it is. In a country with a huge asset-wit h an asset comprised principally of land-it is a great shame and a disgrace that it is not managed on better principles. It should not be laid to the charge of this country that there is any one man in it with money in his pocket and prepared to go on the land who cannot get a bit to go on. YetI can find a score of these men in any town in my electorate to-day, with money in their pockets, waiting to go upon the land, but unable to get a piece. If a b t of goad land ; is available, there are hundreds of applicants for it . Some persons have put in I would like to see the great several applications through friends or members of a family, but there are always, at least, 200 or 300 bond fide settlers for every decent area of land. That is bad business management. A man who has other forms of goods for sale takes all the conceivable methods possible to place them before the people and supply them. YetI t is most singular that we have men who are ready to build up our finest asseta yeomanry-waitin g with money to go on and develop the land, and increase our population, which follows as a natural corollary. Many young fellows will not marrv until they get a bit of land; and the country has not yet displayed sufcient business cana1 did not expect city to see that they are supplied. I would o compel every man who wants land, and has money, to register his name, and see that he was piloted round the country until he was supplied. Some very pronounced means should be adopted in order to meet this case. I am aware, of course, that this is not so much a Federal matter just now as it is a State matter, although it seems to me that there is a very wide scope for the Federal Government in this arena, and that by some conciliatory approach to the State Government much good might be done. That, I say, clearly is the way in which we should progress. deal in the Northern Territory. there is much land which might be dealt with without going right down to the humid coast. However, I shall deal with that matter directly. wish to refer for a moment to the suggestion that has been made with regard to establishing a system of co-operation and co-partnership. I think that legislative action is possible in that direction, at least to this extent: that all co-operative concerns quite aware that, in speaking in this strain, should have their shares made available to their employees, and the un watering of stock should be insisted upon. I hope that the new company law which is projected by the Government will be so comprehensive as to make it easily possible for the employees in any concern to become shareholders on a bedrock basis, and buy, too, half an interest in it. I think that some such legislative lines will have yet to be followed. I believe that greater success will meet our efforts in that direction than will be the case if we attempt to do too much all at once, probably gratifying the more rabid section of the community, and certainly pleasing our enemies by attempting to do more than they know we can perform. I think that the more business-like, if less ambitious line, is the one which the Government should follow. The industrial unrest and the arbitration system' which has been adopted have been severely commented upon by the Opposition. I am free to admit that the machinery as at present applied is not effective in doing away with the barbarous strike. Here, again, I think we have more to hope for from the growing intelligence and knowledge of the men themselves than from legislative action by the Government. It seems to me that when a better grasp of the complex commercial system, which is the growth of ages, and has not been constructed in this or the last generation, has been achieved by the men themselves, they will begin to talk in a business way to their employers. They will begin to make arrangements which will secure industrial peace, and to back their opinions' up by putting their funds up against their guarantee to give peace in their industry. That, I believe, must come; and I think it is only fair that there should not be a merely one-sided arrangement ; that is to say, that while an employer shall have his property attachable for breaches, there shall be no property of the employees attachable for breaches. We know that employees cannot be gaoled for breaches. I think it is a fair and square business proposition that when an agreement has been made the funds of the organization should be attachable as well as the property of the employer when it I is broken by one party or the other. While it is possible to make penal conditions apply only to one side the contract is not a legitimate one; and the sooner that fact is realized the better, and the greater chance we shall have of industrial peace. I am I shall probably court some opposition; but I can assure my friends, both inside and outside this House, that there is no more ardent .advocate of Democracy than I amthere is no man more hopeful for the evolution of the race,, or none who has greater confidence in the essential qualities of the British people. Those qualities are, in my opinion, as much to be found amongst the masses as amongst the classes ; they only require the opportunity to develop, and with free education, universal suffrage, and so forth, there is no reason why this country should not be the first .to secure industrial peace and the fairest adjustment of social conditions. I feel firmly convinced that those possibilities are ahead of our race, and of this branch of it in particular, untrammelled as we are by those Old World conditions which at Home make the task herculean. We are building up a new race, certainly on the old foundations, so far as system is concerned, but we are not surrounded with the moss-grown associations of the Old Country. I desire to say a word or two about some of the other charges that have been levelled at the Government. The appointment by the Government of friends to positions has been a very loud-mouthed charge. It is a remarkable fact, however, that out of all the appointments only two have been shown to be those of friends. I have not heard any",93,Carty Salmon T O Our Deplorable Strike

381,Mr Carr,"In the Northern Territoryeffective criticism of those appointed, who are evidently good men, thoroughly well known to those responsible for the appointments. It seems to me to savour purely of partisanship on the part of the Opposition to denounce the Government so bitterly on this score. I go so far as to say that if a man in a responsible position like that of Prime Minister, or if the Government as a whole, have to make appointments, and they know that certain individuals are good men, they would be untrue to their trust if , other things being equal, they did not give preference to those whom they know. In private life, if there is something going in the nature of a job, and amongst the applicants there is some one who is known to be as well qualified as any other, it would be foolish not to appoint h i m ; and the same thing applies in the case of a public appointment. plied in the past; and no Government has hesitated, other things being equal, to appoint those they know in preference to those they do not know. That is a perfectly justifiable and natural thing to do, and no harm results to the community. As I have said before, it unfortunately happens that those who are specially qualified for high positions are for the most part by birth, training, and association, not in accord with us ; they have not that human tolerance, generous judgment, and fellow feeling, which, to my mind, are essential in all right-thinking men, and certainly in those who seek to improve the condition of society. Most men who qualify for high positions do not share such sentiments, though I am glad to say there is a growing number, including the product of our universities, of the class of men we desire to see in public life. At the present time they are limited in number, and the Opposition has little enough to complain about in regard to the appointments made. I quite agree with the honourable member for Swan, who says that more of our friends would have been appointed had they been qualified. to the alleged extravagance, the honourable member for Mernda drew up a very heavy indictment, and showed that considerable intimacy with the financial world we all know he has. to me, however, that his speech was more of a tribute to his own special knowledge than it was an effective attack on the Government. One cannot see eye to eye with him, if he was reported correctly, when he censures the Government for taking, as he said, 10,000,000 sovereigns out of circulation, and thereby limiting the lending powers of the banks by ^50,000,000. That seems to be giving away his case entirely. I always contend that banks, with a certain limited capital, lend it over and over again merely making book entries. Such banks are probably solvent enough; the money is never out of the bank, but is always in reserve. If that is what the honourable member means I can understand the line of his argument; but I do not admit that the Government have taken ^10,000,000 out of circulation. On every sovereign put into the Treasury is based a bank note, which is legal tender, ancl which is to all intents and purposes a sovereign. If there is any weakness about the note issue it is that the Government have not decreed that the banks shall retain a proportion of notes as bullion reserve. If the notes are in the Indeed, it has always apbank and tlie gold representing the notes is in the Treasury-o r an adequate proportion of gold is in the Treasury-the value of the notes is not deteriorated in any way, there being an adequate backing. The gold may not be in the banks, but it is in the Treasury, and, therefore, quite as accessible; and the note being equivalent to a sovereign, the lending power of the banks is not limited one iota. The only possible trouble can arise from the fact that the Government have not laid it down that the banks should retain a regular proportion of the notes as part of their reserve. While public confidence is maintained, all that can be desired is assured, and nothing can upset the validity or value of the notes unless some great calamity happens which shakes public confidence throughout Australia. There can be no danger unless there be an invasion, an earthquake, or some other disaster which practically sets the country back for many years. Then only can I understand there being a depreciation of the country's note issue. While the Commonwealth maintains its position as a In regard nation, and our integrity ig preserved, our credit must remain good. The talk about danger is based on a mere fancy-o n the mere chance of the most unlikely thing in the world happening. In my opinion, the It seems keeping of a gold backing is only a matter of sentiment; because, with the security of the Government, while a country maintains its integrity, our notes will always be good. The honourable member for Flinders said that the danger was that while these notes might be ultimately paid, they could not be immediately paid; but here again the idea is based on the most unlikely thing when he assumes that the bank notes will military matters, I wish to say a word or be forced on tlie Treasury in one heap, in two concerning what I regard as a weakness a special design on the part of the banks in our new system of training.

So great a risk ought not to be allowed. There ought to be a careful system of graduated training in the handling of the rifle, and in the mere mechanism of its use, before boys are allowed to use ball cartridge. ing to railways, I find that the transcontinental railway, when constructed, will run through country in the centre of Australia, the altitude of which is at such a degree that the climate will be almost equal to that of the sanatoria in our various States. Alice Springs, for instance, is at an altitude of 2,000 feet, which is considerably higher than Bourke, in my own State, which is at an altitude of only 350 feet, whilst a large area of the country at the back of Bourke is below sea level. The MacDonnell Ranges are even higher than Alice Springs. These facts seem to suggest that we may anticipate important developments from the opening up of this country. 1 urge the great importance of 'this railway from many points of view. I want to see the Government do even bigger things than they have accomplished. They have a splendid opportunity before we go to the people. Ministers have done well, and I congratulate them on their record. I consider that the Opposition are not doing their best by any means in submitting fhis motion of censure, which is unworthy of the best intelligence on the other side. I urge the Government to justify their existence still further by tackling more of the big questions awaiting solution before we have to go to the country. As to the leasehold system in the Northern Territory, I think that we could not offer better inducements than the Government are holding forth. I am aware that belief in the freehold system has become a kind of creed with many people. I quite recognise their sentiments in that regard, and would not disturb freeholders in settled districts. Nevertheless, I believe that if an option were given to people take leaseholds instead of freeholds, many would in the course of time make that choice. Nortliern Territory, where settlers will not have the spectacle of some of their neighbours rejoicing in the holding of freeholds, and the consequent excitement of envy, the seeming disadvantage of the leasehold system is considerably minimized. One of the chief Apparently, this is troubles in connection with leasehold is the fact that "" t h e other f e l l o w "" has a freehold, and, therefore, naturally enough, the leaseholder is prompted by jealousy to desire a proprietary tenure. If in the Northern Territory over which this Government has jurisdiction we have no freeholders at all Revertno feelings of jealousy can be aroused, because all will be on an equal footing, and money which might otherwise be applied to purchasing land will be used for development. Under the extremely liberal terms that have been offered, I predict a promising future for the country as soon as the railway is constructed. That, however, is the key to the position. Apart' from the question of national defence and the construction of a highway for our commerce, we want to get people to settle in the Northern Territory. We shall not succeed in that unless we give them railwav connection. As to immigration, I endorse the sentiments uttered by the honourable member for Flinders, when he said that tlie policy should be tackled as a great business proposition. Machinery should be devised for selecting men in England, and for taking them in hand when they arrive in Australia. They should not be allowed to drift, but should be taken in hand in a systematic manner. They should be piloted about as our own people who want to select land ought to be piloted. A policy in this regard has not yet been carefully thought out. It has been tackled in a haphazard fashion. Yet immigration is a vital question. We must people this country, which is not yet settled in anything like an effective manner. We require a business-like handling of the situation-carefu l examination and selection of immigrants on the otlier side, and proper handling of them at this end. If immigrants come here and find that there is nothing for them to do, not only do they become discontented, but they tend to swell the ranks of the unemployable and be a burden to the country. We want to restrict the unemployable class as much as possible, as they are one of the greatest menaces to our Democracy. I supCertainly in a country like the pose there always will be some who will be unemployable from their very nature, due, perhaps, to hereditary conditions'. When such people are born amongst us, we have to be charitable towards them. But give an account of ourselves to the there is no reason why we should add to electors. their number by bringing them from oversea; and we can only prevent that by proWhen His Excellency the Governor General, per regulations.

Much has been said about the development of the Northern Territory. tropical Australia with the idea of attracting settlers to the semi-tropical parts of the country highly-paid and some very capable -officials; but I make bold to affirm that there is only one way of settling the Territory. I refer to the old-fashioned method by which we have settled every other portion of Australia-the method of gradually -carrying the population from the sea-board into the interior by means of good roads and -railways. That is the only sure way of -peopling the Northern Territory. We must -carry that railway northwards in order gradually to induce the people to turn their 'backs upon the civilization of the south, .and to go steadily out towards Central Australia and the north. Mention is made in the Governor General's Speech of the appointment of a Commission of inquiry in -order to inform the Commonwealth Government concerning the route which this railway should take. Such a Commission is unnecessary, in view of the obligation restling upon the Commonwealth, and also because there are in existence to-day complete surveys and plans showing the route, and the only possible route, that can be followed if the Commonwealth is prepared to face its obligations. I wish to call the attention of honourable members to what seems to me a very important matter in connection with these railways. On the first day of whether it was proposed to give Parliament an opportunity to review the The honourable member for Macdetermination to adopt 4 f t . 8 j in. as the standard gauge. The Prime Minister replied that, as I knew, the decision of the Federal Government was irrevocable; that the gauge fixed for the Port Augusta to Kalgoorlie line must be accepted as the national gauge of Australia. I am going to ask the Government to-day That whether they propose to continue the railway from Pine Creek to the Katherine on the 3-ft. 6-in gauge, or whether they are prepared to make the first start in unifying the gauges of. Australia by reconstructing the line from Port Darwin to Pine Creek and continuing it on the 4-ft. 8J-in. gauge as the standard for Commonwealth railways ? the line to Pine Creek? but to continue it to the Katherine on the basis of a 3-ft. 6-in. gauge would be to perpetuate the mistake of broken gauges and to fly in the face of the decision of the Commonwealth Government that the gauge for trunk We have sent to railways throughout Australia shall be 4 f t . 8J in. I do not propose to make further reference to the Northern Territory, save to say that I think that the Minister of External Affairs seems to be obsessed with the leasehold system. I should like to remind the House that we had practically nothing else but the leasehold system in operation during the forty years that South Australia was endeavoring to develop the Territory. Of the 335,000,000 acres which constitute the area of that great tract of country, only some 400,000 acres have been sold. That is a very infinitesimal portion of the Territory, and when I tell the House that the bulk of that country can be repurchased by the Government for less than what was paid for it-somethin g like 5s. per acrehonorable members will see .that it is not a very difficult matter for the Commonwealth to start from scratch, so far as the leasehold system in the Northern Territory is concerned.

When the Prime Minister, in the course of his address, referred with much regret to his failure to induce the Slates to come into line in respect of the savings bank department of the Commonwealth Bank, I ventured by way of interjection to inquire whether the scheme which he explained had been submitted to the -States subsequent to the passing of the Act. The Prime Minister in reply said it had been. That, to my mind, marks the fatal mistake that was made last session when, in order to meet the obligations of the party pledges, undue haste was shown in carrying the Commonwealth Bank Bill through this Parliament before negotiations had been opened up if not concluded with the States. I ventured on the second occasion on which I had tlie honour to address this House to point out that, in my opinion, though a Commonwealth Bank was not wanted immediately, it would in due time be one of the necessary adjuncts of a complete Federal system; that we should require a National bank of some description, in order, for one thing, to manage the loans which are inevitable in the future, and in order, also, to deal with the note issue. gested to the Prime Minister that no great time would be lost if he accepted the amendment moved by the honourable member for Ballarat, and postponed further consideration of the Bill for six months, and thus give opportunity for bringing the States into partnership in connection with this bank. That advice, as we know, was rejected on the ground that the Government were very anxious to appoint a Governor of the bank, in order that he might get the complicated machinery into working order, so that before six months elapsed we should have the Commonwealth Bank in full swing, doing a big business. For reasons I do not know, it was not found practicable to appoint a Governor of the bank until some time in May. Naturally, it has been impossible for that officer to get the machinery started and the bank in working order in the meantime. So that if during the recess opportunity had been taken to consult the State Governments, Mr Gordon. arrangements by which they would utilize the Commonwealth Bank for State and I am connational purposes, by this time possibly some better understanding would have been arrived at between the Commonwealth and State Governments. Instead of that, the policy of placing the pistol at the head of the State Governments was adopted, and the gentlemen with whom the Prime Minister was to open up negotiations, instead of being approached in a spirit of conciliation, were threatened by the right honourable gentleman himself. He said, in effect, "" We will create this bank in spite of you, and, in addition to conducting it as a great commercial institution, we are going to tack on to it a Savings Bank Department."" The right honourable gentleman further pointed out that he thought it would be found impossible for two Savings Banks to be carried on in the same post-offices without some difficulty arising. That was an absolute threat to the States that the creation was proposed of a bank which would not be friendly disposed to those institutions, which have given excellent service to the public of the various States, and have done much to assist the State Governments in respect to their financial obligations. Now, what do we find in connection with the Commonwealth Bank? What some of us ventured to predict has happened. Many prorriises were made upon the hustings about this great bank. The electors were I sugtold that if the Labour party were returned to power in the Federal Parliament they would create a National bank which would safeguard the depositor and the borrower, and that the influence of the bank would be towards cheaper money. Now that we have seen tlie regulations issued by the Governor of the institution, we. find that after all this Commonwealth Bank is to be only one of a number of other banks catering for public business in the old-fashioned orthodox banking way. Savings Banks competing from the commencement. Savings Banks in direct and active competition. No sooner was the Act passed than we saw the trustees of the various State institutions forestalling the order to leave fhe post-offices by preparing to establish branches of the State Savings Banks throughout the States. So that before the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank was appointed, and",100,Carty Salmon T O Our Deplorable Strike

I said that the principle underlying the management of Savings Banks is that people having a large amount of money should not be allowed to deposit with the bank sums of any considerable magnitude at call. The honourable member for Maribyrnong asked "" Why? "" The Minister of External Affairs sought to put the reason into my mouth by interjecting that it might interfere with private banks 1 Yet one of the first things the Governor of the Commonwealth Bank did in framing his regulations was to fix a limit, as we knew he would, of ,£300 as the maximum amount upon which interest should be paid, or only £ 5 0 above the maximum interest bearing deposit fixed by the Savings Banki n my own State. As one who has always taken a very deep interest in the Federal movement, and who desires, above everything else, to see in his native country a national spirit developed, I do implore the present Federal Government, and any other Government, that may succeed them, above all things, to attempt to sink the party spirit in their negotiations with the States. No matter whether it be a State Labour Government or a State Liberal Government by all means let us be broad minded in our dealings with one another, and endeavour to inspire confidence as between the National and State Governments, and to carry on all negotiations in an amicable spirit. I very much regret that the Postmaster-General was led by interjection, inadvertently T hope, to express himself in the terms he used when trying to explain some little delay which has taken place in the starting of works at Port Augusta for the transAustralian railway. He said that it had been a difficult and a delicate matter for the Federal Labour Government to deal with the State Liberal Government in South Australia. I do not intend to pursue that subject except to give the House the assurance that so far as my knowledge goes there was no party spirit displayed in the negotiations by the State Government. There was no unnecessary delay on their part, and the negotiations, which have been happily concluded by a satisfactory agreement, were to my certain knowledge carried on in a I remember when friendly spirit. I do hope that the time is not far distant when the relationship between the National ancl State Governments, whether Liberal or Labour, will be of a more amicable character than we have been led to suppose they have been in times gone by. Much has been said during the present debate concerning the alleged conflict of statements between members of the Liberal party; as if it were not one of the privileges of Liberals to enjoy, not only liberty of thought, but liberty of expression. The inference sought to be conveyed was that our friends on the opposite side are altogether a happy family ! We need not gp beyond the present debate to find plenty of instances where prominent members on the opposite side have agreed to differ and to differ on principle. We had the Prime Minister in the course of his speech bestowing his blessing, as it were, on profit-sharing. We had the Attorney-General, a few hours later, righteously indignant at an honourable member on this side who had suggested that profit-sharing might be a desirable thing to bring about! The Attorney-General, not only opposed it, but de^ nounced it in anything but measured terms. Then we had one honourable member opposite strongly in favour of extending our industrial legislation in order to strengthen the Arbitration Court, and we had another honourable member on the same side just as warmly opposing any further extension of our arbitration tribunal ! We have had some honourable members condemning the Wages Board system, and others on the same side enthusiastically supporting that system. Judging by the Governor General's SpeechI suppose it will' not be long before we shall have another opportunity of considering certain proposed amendments of the Constitution. It is not many months since we saw the Federal Labour party making a frontal attack on the Constitution, and the Labour members of the New South Wales Parliament valiantly resisting it with all their force!

He says that his union is utterly sick, not only of Wages Boards, but of Arbitration Courts.

He addsD i d the company not say We are satisfied with our own working class basis of organization, as we find we are only They wanted the men able to get as much as we are well enough organized to drag from the employers by force.

The president of the South Australian United Labourers Union, Mr A. K .

I am not complaining about these gradations of the industrial movement, but am pointing out, after all the political fighting and the struggle within the unions over a long period of years to get these palliatives, if you like to call them so, how disappointing it must be to the wage-earners, the general public, and the employers, to find that one after the other is being condemned by those who agitated for them. disappointing. numerous Acts have been placed on our statute-book we find a growing movement No ; and they did shut in favour of going back to the old system of strikes. workers or the shearers that question. are made by responsible persons, when the honourable member for Dalley says that there is an undercurrent of feeling in favour of It doing away with these tribunals, it is disappointing to the public of Australia to find that, after all our experiments, we aTe face to face once more, as the Attorney-General told us in unmistakable language, with the same old "" ghastly problem "" !

415,Mr Gordon,"When such statementsThe next thing we want the public of Australia to grant us, the next movement that is going to bring industrial salvation to the wage-earners of Australia, is the national ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange."" If we have had these failures in the past, how can we trust the same party to 'lead us in the future in the direction of national ownership ? The honourable member for Macquarie, in a thoughtful contribution to the Sydney press, deliberately retorted to his chief, the honourable member for West Sydney, to this effect: "" It is all nonsense that you are writing; you are seeking to remove the bulwark of responsibility which is the safeguard of all business."" "" I wish that my name could have been put to the bottom of that letter, which was signed "" E. S. Carr, M.H.R.,"" and dated 19th February. It is one of the finest and most thoughtful contributions to the discussion of the evolution of Democracy that I have come across for a long time. I entirely agree with many of the deductions drawn by tlie honourable inember. and he followed the same lines in his admirable address to-night-wa s most thoughtful and sincere, and I believe he is moving along the evolutionary lines whicli must be followed if we are to bring about better conditions, and establish lasting prosperity in Australia. The honourable member wroteMy reason for taking up this subject is because I think Democracy has reached its economic limit in the particular direction in which it has been moving. The chief political instrument which Democracy has used to attain its ends has been the Labour party; but all parties have, to a greater or lesser degree, been ready to placate popular demand. We have reached a stage at which, so far as the industrial community, is concerned, legislation can do little, if anything, more on the lines obtaining. Yet the tendency is, on the part of a large section of Democracy, to demand further concessions for the worker, by some statutory fixing of higher rates of pay, with a view to securing to him the full results of his labour. At present, rates of pay are left to the judiciary, except for certain half-declared minimums, by several Australian Governments. awarded, however, are met by the simple process of adding them to the prices of goods made or handled. This, of course, must reach finality, hence the economic limit referred to. That a minimum-wage decree, to prevent the sacrifice of humanity to the law of supply and demand, is necessary on racial grounds is admitted, but to make of Parliaments the irresponsible levers for raising wage rates generally is an indefensible that Parliament shall nationalize industries in any general way, with the object of securing to Mr Gordon. the worker the f u l l results of his labour, is equally illogical. What stronger language could possibly be used to denounce one of the main planks of the Federal Labour party as shown in the report of the Hobart Conference than these weighty words written deliberately by the honourable member opposite? He continuesThe time has certainly arrived, in my opinion, when any further effort on behalf of those who toil, to secure for them the rightful results of their labour, must be put forth by themselves. Means of transit and communication are essentially matters for the control of a central government, that trade and intercourse may be as untrammelled as possible. To enter other arenas as sole caterer for the public, however, means (apart from the State incurring the odium of "" boss"" or playing the part of indulgent parent to Democracy, before referred to) that a central administration comprised of permanent heads of departmentSj nominally controlled by Ministers, who come and go, will have the management of socialized industries. This would prevent any intelligent continuity of policy on the part of the people's direct representatives, and place dangerous powers in the hands of a bureaucracy; a bureaucracy which permanent heads of departHis contribution to the pressments constitute at present, and must constitute unless we elect Ministers to their portfolios permanently, which would be the greater of two evils. Such centralized socialisation w ill , in addition, leave the sense of ownership so widely diffused that the self-interest which is the bulwark of responsibility would cease to operate. Then he goes on to sayOne thing is certain, whatever is done must be of an evolutionary nature to be permanent, and not revolutionary. We may alter the economic superstructure, but to be safe must build on the foundations that have formed through the centuries. We cannot afford to dispossess the men of ability and genius who have helped build the present superstructure, but must retain their services for a democratised ownership. .He proceeds to outline a few of them. He favours a system of profit-sharing and cooperation which was so vigorously denounced by the Attorney-General, but he concludes this remarkable weighty letter with these wordsSociety is too immobile to benefit by sweeping reform, and it is for our Democracy to show its wisdom by advancing by such slow graduaWhatever increases are tions as I have indicated. I commend the letter, not only to honourable members opposite, not only to honourable members on this side, but to the public of Australia as one of the most thoughtful contributions to the present discussion of industrial affairs, in which I venture to say honourable members on this side are quite as much interested as are our honourable proceeding. To advocate friends opposite. I shall always endeavour to give a fair and square deal to the worker. I shall always be prepared to give such conditions that the worker of to-day may reasonably hope to be the wage-payer of to-morrow. a party to subscribing to any doctrine that I believe is flying in the face of God-made laws which are irrevocable, even by an Act of Parliament passed by sympathetic legislators. I turn now to the Attorney-General who, with that acumen which distinguishes him, placed his finger, too, on the weak spot of the policy of the Labour party. He said early in this debateThe workers of the world will be able, some way or other, to get enough wages to live upon. But there is no method at their command by wbich they can control profits and prices, and therefore there follows after every strike a turn of the wheel-price s go up, and the whole ghastly business has to be gone over again. Notwithstanding all the efforts to ameliorate the conditions of the worker by legislative enactments, notwithstanding all the machinery created for the purpose of pursuing these alleged combines or trusts he said plainly ""What are we doing? We are running in a circle; we are harassing the ship-owners to no purpose; we are harassing the coal miners; we are putting them to a lot of expense, and whom are we benefiting?"" Why, sir, he told the House that the very people whom we were getting verdicts against were growing larger and stronger, that the business men and the employers of labour were being unnecessarily harassed by the legislation of the present day and that the worker was not being benefited. tive powers are so limited. powers which might be given even to this National Parliament you would never be able to control that inevitable consequence, that whenever you force wages up beyond the limit at which they can be naturally paid from the natural wealth of the country, you create one set of artificial conditions that immediately calls into operation onother set which counterbalances. land is monopolized by a few. of it, you see how impossible it is for us by legislation to alter what is such an accomplished fact as the control of the land throughout even young Australia, how impossible it is for us to get at that economic position which would enable this House, or any other legislative body, to control prices or to control profits, and, least of all, to control wages. Wages are only paid from But I shall never be one source. It is only by the creation of the natural wealth of the country, it is only by maintaining the increase which we have enjoyed in recent years, that we, as a people, can, as I hope we shall be able to do, preserve the present standard of wages and that standard of social condition and social comfort which is to-day the envy and the admiration of the world. What is it that led honourable members who had the opportunity of going through Canada to come back to Australia and tell us what we believe to be the truth, that the condition of the worker is infinitely better in Australia than it is in Canada? What is it that led the Prime Minister, in the admirable speech he delivered in London when he addressed the wage-earners at a big meeting, to point out what a glorious country Australia is, and to say, as a man who was born in the Old Country, who had come out to a new country, who was able to weigh, as we native-born Australians cannot weigh, the various advantages of the new land compared with the Old Land"" I ask for nothing better than that Australia and Australians shall be allowed' to go along the lines of development which have characterized the statesmen of the past "" ? My object in referring to the matter is to go just a little deeper than the mere exchanging of political opinions from one side of the House to the other, because, like the honourable member for Macquarie, I believe that these causes which we wish to regulate and improve are really more deeply seated than we sometimes imagine. Admitting, as we do, the impossibility of controlling conditions just to that extent that we-fro m our proper feelings of brotherhood, the better feelings that must arise in every one of us-woul d desire to do, I believe that conditions can be improved only so long as we recognise natural laws. I believe that the only way for Australia to continue prosperous, the only way by which the employer of labour, whether he T h a t is because the be a Minister sitting on the Treasury bench with every sympathy towards the employee If that is at the root or a private company, or a private person, can pay good wages, by which he can give good conditions, by which we as Australians can maintain that standard of comfort that we want to maintain, is by increasing the natural wealth df the country.",106,Carty Salmon T O Our Deplorable Strike

Australia we have had the principle of land taxation, and a progressive land tax, for a good many years, but I venture to say that the process would have begun, and would have continued with accelerated pace, altogether apart from the influenceand I am not denying that it has had some influence-of either a State or Federal tax. As the pioneers died they subdivided their lands amongst their familiesa natural but very slow process. that process was begun many years ago, We must and it was hastened by the Government. The chief cause, however, of accelerated closer settlement was higher land values,, which induced people to take a good thing when they saw it , and to stick to it. I am speaking of higher land values It is only by this olddue to the increased prosperity of the country. of land. speaking only so fa r as my own State is concerned. I have gone through the whole process. I ara the son of a farmer, and was brought up on a farm. I watched the I shall be happy to evolution of the farm implement in Soulh Australia, and a most interesting evolution it was. It began with the old single-furrow wooden plough, and I remember how we a three-furrow plough. Then we had the stump-jumping plough; and, indeed, we I am not. My desire may say that, so far as agricultural machinery is concerned, South Australia has been the salvation of the continent. We evolved the stripper from the Ridley reaping machine, which was pushed in front of the horses, and fro m the old-fashioned reaping machine which required four or five horses to drag it along; indeed, I remember riding on one horse and driving four. Next we had the pony stripper; and, I believe, I am right in saying that it was Victorian genius which gave the complete harvester. But it was the introduction of the fertilizer, above all else, which led to improved farming, and, giving increased land values, enabled the old-fashioned farmer-thi s may come as a surprise to some honourable members-wh o existed for twenty-seven years in South Australia on less than a ten-bushel average, to extend his little holding, and put his sons into That process, I say, was such a position that they could buy land In South from the squatter within the rainfall area. As I say, the process of closer settlement was, more or less, a natural and gradual one throughout Australia; and it must be by a continuation of that process, by the reclamation of waste lands in the valleys of our great rivers, that we shall be able to make for increased production.

431,Mr Gordon,"Again, I am nowresources, there will be no difficulty in exthis important question in what I consider tending the manufacturing system throughout the Commonwealth. I look in vain through the Government's programme for one ray of hope that any effort is to be made by the Government to extend our knowledge of our natural resources, as is being done by the Federal Government in America. I listen to figures that are quoted, and I hear that we, as a people, intend to spend £4,000,000 or £5,000,000 on defence-o n the making of forts and the building of ships of war-bu t I do not see any forecast of a vote for extending information in the field of agriculture. One of the most important Government Departments in the world to-day is the United States Department of Agriculture. That Department is spending large sums of money on agricultural education, and is sending agents throughout the world to gather seeds and plants, and obtain all possible information for the benefit of the various States of the Union. While we have at present admirable institutions darrying on this and similar work in the various States of Australia, there is plenty of scope for a Department or Bureau of Agriculture able to obtain information from sources not always available to the States, and to perform other work possible only to a Federal Department. I have placed on the notice-paper a motion in the support of which, should it be reached tliis session, I shall outline what I have always considered to be the proper policy for the conservation of the natural resources of this country. The great hope of Australia would be a Federal Government prepared to give some attention to the development of our great resources. I am ready to sorrowfully admit that the large expenditure on the military and the navy may be necessary; but I believe that the man behind the cultivator is the better man for Australia than the man firing a cannon. Being naturally anxious to find out on what lines this Government, with its solid following, are prepared to lead us and the country, 1 am constrained to make a search into matters over and above what I have been able to discover in the Governor General's Speech. to find out what are the real objects of this party in power. of the political ccean are fathoms beneath the surface that sparkles above! have to dive deep, and I am quite sure that my honourable friends opposite will not in any way object if I proceed to discuss to be a fair way. I have searched in order to ascertain, if possible, whether we are marching-in what direction the Labour party will, if it continues in power, lead Parliament and the country. I think that possibly we may, by searching, understand more clearly, perhaps, than some of us have hitherto done, what are the fundamental political principles of the Labour party. First of all, I shall read what I take to be a perfectly fair quotation from an address delivered in the Australian Church by the Prime Minister^ whom I take to be the mouth-piece of the party, and the highest authority on its policy. The right honourable gentleman made an important and very significant statementone so frank, so free, and so easy to understand, that it possessed qualities not always to be found in political utterances. always frank. upon him. I would not do the right honourable gentleman or any honourable member an injustice. I am sure that he will not repudiate this utteranceAre we to stand by and utter platitudes about social progress and the economic progress of this country ? I shall not do it. The present economic wage system must come to an end. Loud applause from the pews! But where in this Governor General's Speech can we find anything tending in the direction indicated by the Prime Minister in that address outside? Then we have the Minister of External Affairs in another pleasant Sunday afternoon address making this statementThere is existing at the present time a slavery of wagedom, and the time will come when the people will cease to acquiesce in this form of slavery. That reminds me of a story of Charles Mackay singing his song, "" There's a Good Time Coming Boys."" An interjector called out from the back of the hall, as interjectors will call out, "" Will you please fix the date, Mr Mackay !"" I ask the PrimeI wish Minister, the Minister of External Affairs, and the other Ministers, to give us some inThe depths formation as to how their policy will be formulated so that it will lead us to the We desired condition of ""economic justice,"" and as to when there will be removed that form of slavery to which the Minister of External Affairs refers?",109,Smith I S The Honourable Used To Ride For Many Miles I N Order To See

Listen to a siren-like voice, the Brisbane WorkerThe Labour party has got to leave off tinkering with palliatives that don't palliate, and start the real business of the movement. We need a programme that will hold out an inspiring measure of hope for the toiling multitudes. Socialism alone can fill the bill. The Brisbane Worker, commenting on a Brisbane Labour Conference, also saidThe Convention has given us the socialistic objective. of swnership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange ! guity about it. It is no mere theatrical property-al l front, like a painted canvas castle, through the front door of which you enter, only to find yourself immediately at the back.

ThenI come to Mr Watson, the late Leader of the Labour party. He said thisIt is the wisest thing to make it a sine' qua non that those who come into the party are Socialists, and the sooner it is made clear that the movement is Socialism the better. That is definite and straightforward. It prevents any feeling of resentment if we employ the term Socialists to our honourable friends opposite. I think that my honourable friend the member for Brisbane openly said in his speech the other day that he is a Socialist. I commend his example. We have it therefore, .from the best official sources, that this party opposite invites the public of Australia to regard it as a party that believes in the nationalization of the means of production, distribution, and exchange.

To A Large Extent That Is,"it is impossible to face the ordinary obligations of the Commonwealth, let alone the extraordinary proposals to which the Labour party are committed, even if we go in for an extensive system of borrowing. Where are they leading us when they talk of the nationalization of the shipping industry, the sugar industry, and various monopolies ? shipping intended was the establishment of a line of oversea steamers to carry produce from Australia. vernment have been inclined to join with us, because, like us, they have been under the whip of the shipping ring. e for a line of State-owned steam-ships were limited to ocean-going vessels, and I say unhesitatingly that it has been very widely suggested that the policy of the 'Federal Government is also to take over the InterState shipping business, such an undertaking would mean a very big borrowing scheme and the creation of a Department very difficult to manage. contrasting the comparative benefit of Government and private employ, I intended to refer to the fact that Liberal Governments of the past have given to this country the management of the postal service, leaving out of consideuition for the moment the Stale-owned railways. find the Federal Government doing in regard to the Post and Telegraph Department? their employees as the steam-ship company have to deal with their employees-listenin g to their complaints and dealing out justice from day to day? Government, which is asking for power to nationalize industries, is not prepared, even in respect of one comparatively small Department, to deal with the grievances of its officers. last session, and, in the face of the biggest petition from employees of the Post and Telegraph Department ever laid on the table, carried an Arbitration Bill which provided that no longer should they go with their complaints and grievances to their responsible Ministers, but that they should take them into the Conciliation and Arbitration Court. Let me put a pertinent question to honourable members opposite. Is it contemplated that the employee's on the proposed Government-owned line of steamers shall go to the Conciliation and ArbiI desire to point out that tration Court for a settlement of their grievances, or is it proposed to deal with them as private shipping companies have to deal with their employis? The very introduction of that Bil l last session was, to me at least, an indication of a desire on the part of the managers of this branch of the Public Service to shirk -their obvious responsibilities, and to shift them to the shoulders of some irresponsible tribunal, of notwithstanding that the very employee's themselves implored the Government not to do so. What encouragement is there for The South African Gothe people to give the Government the power for which they are asking to nationalize one industry after another? the honourable member's argument. honourable member should do so, because I am trying to discuss this matter free from party considerations. My point is that if the Government are going to ignore their responsibilities in regard to such an important branch of the Public Service as the Post and Telegraph Department, no enWhenI was couragement is offered us to agree to the creation of a line of State-owned steamers. Shipping, with all its intricate workings, the control of officers and men, and the building of ships and so forth, is one of the most difficult commercial undertakings to manage. What encouragement is there And what do we for the people to respond to the call of the Labour party, and to allow them to establish a line of Government-owned steamDo we find them dealing with ships when by their own showing they are unable to manage the Post and Telegraph Department ? No ; we find that this able member hand over the Postal Department to private enterprise? They came down to this House extent that I believe that public utilities such as the railways and postal services, which it was decided seventy years ago should belong to the people of Australia, should continue to belong to the people. When the honourable member for Denison was talking of the borrowing proclivities of the various States, and making special reference to the extravagance of the State of which he is a representative, I ventured to interject that the money had been well spent.

When it was agreed that railways should be owned and controlled by the public, it became clear that if we were to develop this country it was necessary to borrow money to build those railways and this proved to be a good business undertaking. I am sure that the honourable member for Denison will agree that there are very few business enterprises in Australia to-day, no matter how prosperous, that are not working on an overdraft. good business proposition on the part of the private individual to borrow money at 3 or 4 per cent, to carry on a business, and to earn 10 per cent., and surely the same applies to a State that is able to show profitable works against its indebtedness. admit, that great mistakes have been made in the past by State Governments, it was inevitable if we were to have our great public utilities that we should borrow, and but for our Australian railways, waterworks, and other public works Australia would not be in the position which she is in to-day. , money because we gave away our asset, the land. have repeatedly called the honourable member for Denison to order, and he has ignored my call.

458,Mr Gordon,"I say to my old shipphilosophy to which I entirely subscribe, and to which I ask the honourable member for East Sydney to subscribe "" When things are different, they are not the same."" If my reading of Australian history be correct, the White Australia policy was irrevocably laid down fifty years ago, and it does not belong to the party opposite, but to this party. was laid down in 1878. policy was laid down by Dr. Lang, Sir Henry Parkes, and Sir Samuel Griffith years before any of us in this Parliament came into political life.' I say unhesitatingly that if there is one thing to the credit preciate fully as members of the National of the State of South Australia of which I am proud it is this : That when we had but a small purse, and demands were made upon us from all quarters, which it was very hard at times to resist, we were rea(Jy for forty years to carry the burden, if it was a burden, of the White Australia policy for the benefit of the Commonwealth that was to be, even though departing from it would have meant to us some temporary gain. I say, without hesitation, that the White Australia question does not enter into the Fedeam as capable as are other honourable memral arena. Parkes, in New South Wales, introduced the first Chinese Immigration Restriction Bill many years ago. not an honourable member opposite who is stronger in his desire to keep Australia racially pure than are members on this side. That policy has been laid down irrevocably, and I ask the Liberal party, as I ask the Labour party: Why continue the humbug of putting that on your platform? I say that the White Australia policy is as fixed as the Dandenong Ranges, and it is quite unnecessary for honourable members to come along and say ""We are'in favour of the Dandenong Ranges being retained in the State of Victoria,"" or that "" the Blue Mountains shall be in the State of New South Wales."" I like to have our history a little accurate. When I see these new parties in the political arena claiming planks of policy which were laid down by our fathers, I say that it does not become us to-day to claim for ourselves that which our fathers and mothers established. I have been on the wharf with a big stick to knock out the Chows. more than once called the honourable member for East Sydney, to order, and if I have to do so again it will be in a way which the honourable member will not forget. you mean by that.

I recognise that the honourable member for East Sydney, who is an older man than I am, has possibly had a longer acquaintance with some of these questions. I know that he has taken a very deep interest in them, and I appreciate his strong feelings on the matter, but I wish to discuss calmly one or two of these important subjects to see if we cannot come to a general understanding upon them. If what I say be correct, and as two parties we are committed to a great national principle on which, as a community, we propose to stand or fall, we had better get down to bedrock, and find out just exactly where we are. Believing, as I do, that the White Australia policy was laid down for us some years ago, I shall not now say how many, I ask: Why proclaim it as a plank in the platform of either party?

For many years prior to 1897, the Honourable J. H . Howe .was a strong advocate of pensions, and on the 3rd August of that year, when the Federal Enabling Bill was before the Council, he seized the opportunity to put his ideas into practice. That Bill had passed through the Assembly, in which there were at the time about half-a-dozen Labour members, without any effort being made to amend it in this direction. But Mr tax we leave wholly to our friends in the Howe was the author of an amendment of clause 52 of the Constitution, containing the powers to be given to the Commonwealth and, included therein, legislation in regard to invalid and old-age pensions. No similar action was taken, anywhere else in Australia. As a member of the Convention, Mr Howe endeavoured during the Adelaide sittings to obtain a following in support of his pensions scheme, but being unable to do so, did not bring the matter forward. At Sydney he again canvassed energetically, and obtained sufficient encouragement to justify the tabling of a motion, but there being an obvious difficulty in getting it passed, the matter was again postponed. At Melbourne, Mr Howe risked pushing the principle to a division, and lost by five votes, the ayes numbering 20, and the noes 25vassing here that got it through. the division is that the only Labour member of the Convention, Mr Trenwith, and the President of the Arbitration Court, both voted wth the noes. vered, and a fortnight before the Convention separated, redoubling his efforts, was magnificently rewarded. aware that for this we had to thank the cooperation of the Minister of Home Affairs.

As to the compulsory military training of citizen defence forces, and the construction of an Australian owned and controlled navy, I understand that honourable members on this side claim to be the author of the scheme. For the Commonwealth Bank entire credit is due to the Labour party, and to the Minister of Home Affairs for the monumental speech which stands in his name in the Hansard archives. Coming to the planks made law, we have, first, "" Electoral reform."" Any one reading the platform might imagine that the Labour party had just carried some great measure for widening the franchise, but this so called reform was a deprivation of the women of Australia of the right to vote by post, a privilege of which at least"" 30,000 availed themselves at the election of 1910.

I make bold to affirm that Australia can -stand against drought, it can stand financial stress, it can stand recurring financial depression, it can, with its great wealth, .stand doubtful and costly political experiments. But it cannot stand the continuation of industrial unrest and social disorganization. It cannot and will not stand preferential treatment of one section or special privilege for another. will not stand if there is to be class bitterness and sectional hatred. I have listened to nearly all the speeches which have been delivered during the course of this debate, but to none with greater pleasure than that of the honourable member for Boothby. that he had not a larger audience, but I hope that, although his deliverance may -not have very much effect on some honourable members, it will exercise a big influence upon the electors of the country. As the Minister of Home Affairs is gracing the chamber at the present time, I propose to take advantage of his presence'to refer to a very important matter, namely, the Federal Capital. ther the Minister has seen an article which was published in a paper called Building, which is issued in Sydney, and which draws special attention to the way in which matters are proceeding at the Capital. the Minister has visited Yass-Canberra on several occasions, but if affairs there are anything like what they are reported to be in this journal, it is high time that he took a hand in them. The article from which I propose to quote was not written by a gentleman who paid merely a hasty visit to the Federal Capital site, and had a casual look round there. first impressions, he made a second visit, and that visit quite confirmed him in his previous judgment. He writesDuring a recent wide-awake tour through the Federal Capital area I made certain observations that are of such vital importance that I am forwarding them for publicity through the medium of Building. A most serious condition of affairs is prevalent in connection with the constructional progress. The fact that the day labour system is in operation is in itself explanative of certain irregularities; but in the present case the position is emphasized. Not only are the men generally inefficient, but the supervision is lax, and the work approximates more to a holiday under the most favorable day labour auspices. I understand that the Government are determined to push on the work of constructing the Federal City. We had that assurance from the Postmaster-General last night, and I know that that is the intention of the Minister of Home Affairs. But we also know perfectly well that some members of the Labour caucus have made very different statements. The honourable member for Indi, in speaking to this motion, expressed himself very strongly in regard to the Federal Capital. As a representative of New Australia South Wales, I desire to know whether the Minister agrees with that honourable member, who said I would particularly tell the Minister of Home Affairs that I hope he will keep down the expenditure on the Federal Capital during the next twelve months to about the same amount as during the past two years, if he cannot make it less. I continually hear it said at their meetings, It is a great pity by organizers for the other side, that the Government are lavishing millions on the bush Capital, as they call it. vernment be honest enough to keep a compact? abused by honourable members opposite for not spending more on the Federal Capital, we are blamed by their supporters outside for spending too much on it. Nightly, their organizers are telling the people in my electorate that the Government are lavishing millions upon it. InI do not know wheorder to answer that assertion, I intend to quote figures to show the amount expended on the Capital site during the past two years. In the first year, £4,292 was spent, and in the two years there has been spent altogether £60,236. Seeing that the sum of £60,236 is all that has I know that been expended, I do not think it is fair for opponents outside, in order to make political capital, to accuse the Government of spending millions. pended last year. veys and works of an initial character have to be undertaken. It would be foolish to In order to justify his spend large sums of money in the absence of proper initial surveys. The honourable member for Indi proceededAll. I can say is that, as in the past, so in the future, my vote would not go towards the expenditure of another farthing on the Federal Capital; but the expenditure there has been is about the smallest that could have been made on a proposal to which we were committed by honourable members opposite.",116,Smith The Y Understand And Self Reliant Community

I asked the Minister, first of allHave the plans for the Commonwealth offices in London been received? accepting them, have them carefully examined by competent persons, so that the buildings may be up-to-date, constructed in accordance with modern requirements, and suited to the London climate ? I had a specific purpose in asking that question, and the Minister repliedThe plans were drawn by a competent English architect. What more does the honourable member desire? of English architects are not always abreast of modern requirements. Home Affairs thought so in connection with the Capital site designs. Before the Minister of External Affairs accepts the plans for this important and expensive building in London, will he see that all modern requirements are met? It is well known that a large number of the buildings recently erected in London .have been -designed by architects living in other places, who have been able to provide for the requirements of the city better than London architects. 'High Commissioner to choose the ablest and most gifted architect in the United Kingdom. We have confidence in his choice, and do not think it necessary to go beyond him. Probably the High Commissioner has chosen the best and ablest architect in London at the present time, but I have had letters indicating that, in almost every instance, recent buildings to meet modern requirements in the city of London have been designed by foreign architects. I am not one to decry the architecture of the Old Country; but I am informed by a most competent architect in the Commonwealth that, so far as the plan of our building is concerned, the construction of a well inside it will mean merely a receptacle for foul air; that the building is not even placed in the best position for receiving the little light that there is in the city of London, and that from,, at least 8,000 to 10,000 square feet more space could be put into the building. consideration in a congested city like London. I should like the Minister of Home Affairs, or the Minister of External Affairs in the first instance, to refer this matter to the officers of his Department. In my opinion, they are competent enough to show whether or not so much additional space could be obtained. architects are behind the times in connection Mr Fuller. with modern buildings is proved by a letter signed by Messrs. Hubbard and Cross,, two of the best known architectsin London at the present time. What do they write, not specially on the Commonwealth buildings, but on the condition of English architecture at present? That the style of tlie proposed building, with a well in the centre, and the* general construction of the building, is according to old ideas, and not on the lines of the up to-date buildings which are being erected. Commissioner do? I am informed that the ideas ister of External Affairs the High Commissioner chose the best English architect. The letter from Messrs. Hubbard& Cross is headed "" The Decadence of English Architecture,"" and reads as followsWhen the work of designing such important buildings as the Ritz Hotel, the Morning Post offices, and the Automobile ClubI am sure that the honourable member for Dalley, and other honourable members who had an opportunity of seeing these three buildings will agree that they are some of the most up-to-date buildings in Londonis entrusted to foreign architects it is evident that there is something radically wrong with thearchitectural profession in England. In the cases we have quoted it can scarcely be urged that the buildings are of such a special nature as to require the services of foreign architects in preference to those which one might reasonably expect could be equally well rendered by our fellow-countrymen. Why, then, have the owners of these buildings thought it advisable to go so far afield for the professional assistance they required? We are afraid the answer must be that the owners .have had sufficient discrimination to see that the) are likely to obtain a better result by the employment of the foreigner. In other"" words, it is impossible to obtain the services of English architects who have been equally well trained in the technique of their art. The dearth of highly-qualified men in this country is due to our present unsystematic and inefficient mode of architectural training. And so long as we remain without properly-organised and properlyadministered schools of architecture we may anticipate that the work of the better-trained foreign architect will be more and more in eviThat is rather an important dence in the United Kingdom. Recognising this fact, it is imperative that the architectural profession should seriously consider what steps can be taken to cope with the difficulty.

After speaking at considerable length regarding the position of the men and the manager of the tramway company in '.

The honourable member also took exception to the statement of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that the Prime Minister did nothing to bring the parties to the dispute together, and he replied that during the Newcastle strike the late Government made no attempt in that direction. MightI point out, with all respect to him, that the two cases were absolutely distinct. The Newcastle strike was absolutely a State strike, over which the Federal authorities had no jurisdiction, and in which the Prime Minister, or the Commonwealth Government, had no right to interfere.

529,Mr Fuller,"It was the same thingside, and the justification for them was attempted by the Minister of External Affairs in language which may be approved of by the members of his party, but with which I believe the public of Australia will not agree. I wish to refer to the appointment of Mr about co-operation in commercial relations and Donald Campbell as the representative of Australia on tbe Empire Trade Commission. I dare say it has been noticed by honourable members generally tiiat he arrived in London, attended the Empire Trade Commission, and, according to certain statements which have beeu telegraphed here, endeavoured to do certain things. According to the telegrams, Mr Campbell saidI endeavoured to induce the Commission to take evidence and make recommendations concerning inter-Dominion reciprocal Customs treaties, but the chairman ruled against me. This practically excludes inquiry into all forms of preference, including Tariffs, subsidies, and shipping, and will reduce the scope of the Commission's usefulness. Mr Campbell finished up by questioning the justification of expenditure on the Commission. In any case, he thought that the proceedings ought to be open to the press. I would like to know from the Ministers who are present what instructions were given to Mr Campbell when he was sent Home to sit on this important Commission. Did the instructions entitle him to endeavour to have inquiries made into different forms of preferences, including Tariffs and other matters which he brought before the Commission, and which the Chairman ruled out of order? Were the Prime Minister and his colleagues absolutely ignorant of the proposition to which they assented when they met in the Imperial Conference over which Mr Asquith presided? The Prime Minister must have known that what he assented to then absolutely precluded Mr Donald Campbell, or any other representative, from appearing before the Empire Trade Commission, and having these matters dealt with in any shape. The right honourable gentleman, if he remembered what occurred with his own consent at the Imperial Conference, knew absolutely that not one of the matters which Mr Campbell tried to get considered could be dealt with by him when he was sent Home. bell from this Commission. The motion which was submitted by the Prime Minister of Australia at the Imperial Conference, with Mr Asquith in the chair, on Mr Fuller. the 16th June, 19n, was couched in these wordsThat this Conference, recognising the importance of promoting fuller development of commercial intercourse within the Empire, strongly urges that every effort should be made to bring matters of mutual interest. That it is advisable, in the interests both of the United Kingdom and the British Dominions beyond the seas, that efforts in favour of Britishmanufactured goods and British shipping should! be supported as far as practicable. Had that motion been carried, the matters which Mr Donald Campbell attempted to raise before the Empire Trade Commission could have been dealt with, but the Prime Minister of Australia was a party to an amendment which was moved by Mr Asquith, and which eliminated the possibility of questions of preferences or Tariff being dealt with. This slight amendment, which Mr Asquith and Mr Hareourt asked the Imperial Conference to accept, was referred to by the latter in the House of Commons' on the 3rd April, when he saidThe exclusion of the fiscal question from the terms of reference was agreedto by the whole Conference. It was quite clear from the discussion that it would be just as inconvenient and disagreeable to the Dominions to have a report of the Commission pressing Free Trade on them as it would be unpleasant to His Majesty's Government to have a report presenting a policy in which they as a Government did not believe. In the few words which. Mr Asquith addressed to the House of Commons, he pointed out clearly that any consideration of the fiscal question was absolutely excluded from the scope of the Commission by the amendment. Honourable members, if they follow me while I read the resolution which was adopted, with the consent of the Prime Minister of Australia, will see that what Mr Hareourt stated is perfectly correct. This is the slight amendment to which Mr Hareourt referred, and which' knocked the bottom out of the whole business, so far as dealing with fiscal and preferential matters was concerned. That His Majesty should be approached with a view to the appointment of a Royal Commission, representing the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and Newfoundland, with a view of investigating and reporting upon the natural resources of each part of the Empire represented at this Conference, If the Government do the proper the_development attained and attainable, and the facilities for production, manufacture, and distribution; the trade of each part with the others, and with the outside world; the food and raw material requirements of each, and the resources thereof available; to what extent, if any, the trade between each of the different parts has been affected by existing legislation in each, either",122,Smith The Y Understand And Self Reliant Community
530,Thing They Will Immediately Recall Mr Camp,"beneficially or otherwise; and by what methods consistent with the existing fiscal policy of each part the trade of each part with the others may be improved and extended. Honourable members will see by this that the Commission is absolutely restricted to inquiring into matters full information in regard to which can be found in the Canadian Year-Book, the Commonwealth Year Book, or any publication of a like character ; and this view is supported by the result of the application of Mr Donald Campbell. in answer to a question in the House of -Commons, Mr Asquith stated that the reference to the Commission followed as closely as possible the resolution of the Conference. and now I shall read the reference under which the Commission was constitutedTo inquire into and report upon the natural resources of the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, and the Colony of Newfoundland; and, further, to report upon the development of such resources, whether attained or attainable; upon the facilities which exist or may be created for the pro-duction, manufacture, and distribution of all articles of commerce in those parts of the Em-pire; upon the requirements of each such part -of the United Kingdom in the matter of food .and raw materials, and the available sources of :such; upon the trade of each such part of the Empire with the other parts, with the United Kingdom and with the rest of the world; upon the extent, if any, to which the mutual trade of the several parts of the Empire has been or is being affected beneficially or otherwise by the laws now in force, other than fiscal laws; and, -generally, to suggest any methods, consistent :always with the existing fiscal policy of each -part of the Empire, by which the trade of each part with the others and with the United King-dom might be improved and extendedThe Prime Minister of Australia, who concurred in the resolution passed by the Imperial Conference, must have known, if he 'knew anything, that Mr Campbell was .asking the Commission to do that which was impossible under the terms of the reference. In the circumstances, the sending Home of Mr Campbell seems to me to be a misuse of public money; and, as ""it may be presumed that he had instructions, or he would not have made the attempt he -did, he ought to be recalled at the earliest possible moment in order to save further -expenditure. a representative? appointed a member of the Commission, .and I do not know the reason for his resignation. It appears to me that a man of Sir Joseph Ward's standing would not waste his time on a Commission limited in the way this Commission is. To turn to another subject, I was very sorry to hear the Minister of External Affairs, in justifying the appointments made by the Government, use a sort of tu quo que argument. He. apparently took the ground that, because a gentleman connected with the Reid Ministry in New South Wales had been appointed a member of the Water and On Wednesday, 10th April, Sewerage Board in that State, the Government of the Commonwealth were entitled to appoint their supporters to public positions. I am sorry this reference was made to Mr Jacob Garrard, because he is a man I have read that resolution, who has sprung from the ranks of the people. ment, all the same! Mr Garrard was one of the first Labour' representatives elected to the New South Wales Parliament. He had had an honourable career, and was regarded as a man 1 of great ability and high integrity, and well qualified to fill the position to which he was appointed. The Minister of External Affairs said that Mr Garrard was. appointed to the Water and Sewerage Board simply because he was an ex-member of Parliament; but it would appear that, in the case of the Commonwealth, those appointed were men who had beeri anxious to get into Parliament, but in whom the people had not sufficient confidence to elect them. Mr Garrard's life history is one of which any man might be proud; it is a record of hard struggle with unfortunate circumstances . created by no fault of his own. He suffered from the failure of a building society and other institutions; and, instead of taking advantage of the Bankruptcy Court-whic h would, of course, have been a perfectly honourable proceeding -and thus ridding himself of liabilities to the extent of thousands of pounds, which hung around his neck like a mill-stone for years and years, he manfully struggled on and paid every creditor to the last farthing.

535,Mr Fuller,"I have described theretirement from the Chairmanship of the Water and Sewerage Board as to his fitness for that office. Alderman Griffin expressed rard. Hes a i d Mr Garrard was a man with untiring energy. There was no doubt but that his loss was a matter of public concern. Pie had nothing to say about Mr Garrard's successor, but Mr Garrard's absence would be a great actual loss. Mr Henley saidMr Garrard was probably the most energetic man the Board ever had. Though a Government nominee, he had taken no sides. His vote was always in the interests of the public. Even at this late hour he hoped the Government would see the wisdom of reappointing him. No man should be displaced without good, valid reasons. The Sydney Daily Telegrafh reported thatAt a meeting of the Water and Sewerage Board yesterday it was decided to write, under seal of the Board, to Mr Jacob Garrard conveying to him thanks and appreciation of services rendered during his thirteen years on the Board. Mr Henley, M.L.A., said that the late member had done great work, particularly during the last five years, the stormiest in the history of the Board. It is only right that I should say this about Mr Garrard, in view of the sneering references to him made by the Minister of External Affairs, which was, I think, a most unjustifiable attack. I hope that the Government' will pay attention to the three matters to which I have referred in the course of my remarks, namely, the plans for the Commonwealth offices in London, the question of the statements reported as to what is occurring at the Federal Capital, and, thirdly, and particularly, the matter relating to the Empire Trade Commission. I again point out, in regard to the third question, that Mr Campbell evidently endeavoured to carry out what was desired, but was absolutely precluded under the terms of reference from doing so; and that the terms of reference were, as a matter of fact, drawn up under a resolution agreed to by the Imperial Conference with the concurrence of the Prime Minister himself. Mr Campbell was sent to London apparently with the status of a Cabinet Minister and with instructions to act in a certain way; whereas the course which he desired to pursue was ruled out of order because the terms of reference precluded the Commission from dealing with fhe subjects which Mr Campbell desired to handle. I hope that we shall put an end to this farce, and that the Government will recall Mr not allow you to dictate to us the price forCampbell.

I became a member of the Miners Union. We recognise tliat co-operation is a good thing, and so far as it will help the workers we are prepared to support it. successful mine or any other paying proposition, do the workers ever get a chance of investing a shilling? There are mines in the Lithgow Valley the shares in which are held privately, and the public are not allowed to know anything concerning them. in Newcastle, Illawarra, and Hunter districts, as in other parts of Australia, we have men well enough educated to know the market price of coal, and we have there a combination strong enough to be able to say to the employers, "" We know what price you are getting for your coal, and we think that we have a right to secure a certain proportion of our produce."" less for the Opposition to say that we are responsible for syndicalism. party is pledged up to the hilt to support arbitrationi in preference to strikes. The workers never strike for the love of the thing. I myself have been in strikes, and Heaven knows that I have been kicked from pillar to post for fighting for what I believe to be my just rights. The Opposition talk of the value of Wages Boards, but I can tell them of cases in my own electorate where men workers have not only been sacked for fighting for what they believed to be a fair thing, but have become "" marked "" men. district, or any foreigner who comes .along, can obtain work in preference to those who are prepared to fight for justice in the occupations in which they are engaged.

The coal-miners, more particularly, learnt many years ago what is -the true position in this regard, and nowadays, when Honora non-unionist comes on a job, he is frequently told by the manager that the best thing for hiim to do is to join a union. If the Opposition desire that collective bargaining shall be They respected by both'sides, they must support preference to unionists. They talk lightly of these matters and give us no alternative, but in the absence of preference to unionists I the whole system of collective bargaining would go by the board. Referring, to another charge that has been made by honourable members opposite against the Labour party, I desire tb say that I have never received a shilling from my union to assist In the case of a me in fighting for my return to Parliament.

He knows that there are in the unions there Thank God, however, Socialists' , Liberals, Labour men, and, in 1 short, men of all shades of political thought. The Labour party have been striving to improve their condition by means of arbitration, but they have frequently been held up by legal technicalities, raised after the men have been put to the expense of bringing their case before the Court. We have often found the employers going to It is usethe High Court, taking some mean, petty, technical objection, and so depriving us of The Labour our rights.

The honourable member for Flinders is the most courageous man in their party. He has said straight-out, ""Why have preference to unionists?"" He does not believe in the system, and he is bold enough to say so. I regard him as a straightforward and honourable opponent-as a man possessing the courage to say what he thinks-bu t other members of his party tour the country and carefully fence with this question of industrial unrest. So far as it is concerned they are like a lot of jellyfish. They dare not say what they really think in regard to it. I earnestly hope that the Opposition will make the matter of industrial unrest, and the sending of the military to Brisbane, a test question at the next general election. If they do I shall welcome them in my electorate, and will give them all the fight they want. We have been told that so far as we are concerned the "" writing is on the wall,"" and that we should be cheerful and make the best of a bad job. Let me say at once that, whether I am in this House, or out of it, I shall always be a Labour man. When I am rejected I shall visit the electorates of some honourable members opposite should they continue to represent them, and will give them the liveliest time they have ever experienced. I am not a man to take a licking lying down. over our way. nearer Nepean than in the electorate which the right honourable member represents. If honourable members opposite are genuine in their protestation that they favour peacef u l methods of settling industrial disputes, then they should be as scathing in their criticism of the employer who victimizes an employee!, as they are in their criticism of the employees unions. There was a frightf u l bungle in the case that occurred in my electorate, and I told the employer concerned that he was making a serious mistake. which took place in Brisbane occurring over the question of a twopenny ha'penny badge. Such a thing should have been beyond the range of possibility in a country like this. What happened under the Wages Board system of New South Wales in connection with the coal strike? The Government imprisoned some of the leaders, and thought If honourable members opthat in that way they would put an end to the strike. Their action, however, made no difference to us. Had they put fifty leaders in gaol, we should have had men to take their place, and the strike would still have gone on. Let employers who victimize their men be subject to the same penalty as that to which an employ^ is liable for instigating a strike. The law at the time, of the Newcastle coal strike was that a man who instigated a strike was liable to be imprisoned for two years; whereas an employer who did so was only liable to a fine not exceeding ,£500. In one case a fine of £ 5 0 was inflicted, and in another a fine of £ 2 0 . These employers felt the imposition of such a fine less than a man in my position would feel the imposition of a fine of 6d. Where the law provides that an employee shall be liable to be imprisoned for two years for instigating a strike, it should impose a similar penalty in the case of an employer who victimizes a worker. Our demand is that the scales of justice shall be held evenly. If that were done, we should not complain. 1 desire now to refer to the question of the Federal Capital, to which reference is made in the Governor General's Speech. Although the awards for the three best designs have been made, I trust that the Minister of Home Affairs will give fair consideration to other plans that ought really to have received a prize. I read recently in L if e a description of the plans in respect of which the prizes have been awarded. It makes very amusing reading, particularly in regard to the intimation as to where the raiLway station and I can find plenty of work various public buildings should be situated. The peculiar feature of the judging of the designs is that absolutely no notice has been taken of engineering and contour studies. I have it from competent critics-the article in L if e expresses the situation fairly wellthat, no matter which of the three successful designs is accepted for the building of the city, the drainage plan and the provision for storm-water channels enumerated on plan No. 10 will have eventually to be adopted. I hope that the Minister will give that matter fair consideration; and that if Fancy a big strike like that he finds that the Australian plan must be adopted he will see that justice is done to the designer.",127,Smith The Y Understand And Self Reliant Community

It is very poor consolation to the people who are suffering from the delay in the settlement of this important question to be told that it is due to a dispute between the Commonwealth and State Governments. This is not a proper way in which to treat people, and I decline to remain silent on the matter. I have about come to the conclusion that I can scarcely believe anything that Ministers say on this subject. should not say that. connection to Commonwealth Ministers only, but to the New South Wales Ministers of State as well, for I have interviewed the members of both Governments apparently without getting any nearer a settlement of the matter. I hope that Federal Ministers, at least, will not treat the matter lightly any longer, but will give me some satisfaction, because, under existing conditions, I am almost ashamed to meet some of my constituents who reside within the Liverpool manoeuvre area. I hope that the Commonwealth Government will have the courage to tackle the question alone if the Government of New South Wales continues to delay a settlement. This Government has under the Constitution a method available for dealing with the matter, and I trust they will deal with it definitely at a very earlydate. MrM c WILLIAMS (Franklin) [10.37 a.m.] -This debate has extended over a considerable time, and ranged over a fairly wide field. I have been pleased during the last few days to notice that speakers from the other side have ceased the attempt to raise the cry that honourable members on this side were prepared to ""shoot them down."" I have heard some of our friends opposite charged on public platforms with a desire to shoot down non-unionists, but I do not believe that any honourable member on the other side wishes to shoot anybody. A cry has been attempted to be raised, with an object that is palpable, in view of the approaching elections, that honourable members on this side desired that the militaryshould have been sent up with rifles and bullets to shoot down men, women, and children in the streets of Brisbane. I am satisfied that no honourable member on the other side believes any such thing. Mr J. H . CATTS -Then what does the censure motion mean ? water in watering cans. MrM c WILLIAMS V e r y well, if we really are to have this charge levelled against us let me inforrm honourable members opposite that if there is one speech which more than another is strongly in favour of the sending of Federal troops to put down domestic violence, it is that delivered by Senator Pearcei n the Senate honourable member Chamber about seven months ago. Mr J. H . CATTS -What does the censure motion mean? MrM c WILLIAMS I am going to tell the honourable member what Senator Pearce meant, and to explain why the honourable senator was compelled to come down from the position he took up and adopt that now assumed by honourable members opposite. On the 2nd November last year, during the discussion in the Senate on the Compulsory Military TrainingB ill , Senator Rae moved the following motion in that Chamber:That, in the opinion of the Senate1. The Defence Act should be so. amended as to clearly set forth that the object of creating a Citizen Defence Force based upon universal compulsory military training and service is for . the purpose of defending the Commonwealth against possible foreign aggression, and, therefore, under no circumstances should any person so enrolled be compelled to bear arms against any fellow Australian citizen notwithstanding anything contained in the oath of allegiance or in any other conditions of compulsory service. This is what Senator Pearce, the Minister of Defence in the present Government, said in successfully opposing that motionThe people of Australia have declared that they will have a military system for the defence of Australia as a nation, and I say that that does not merely mean that we will defend Australia from foreign aggression, but tljat we will defend the laws of Australia, no matter from where the attack may come, if that attack takes the form of force. about that?",129,Smith The Y Understand And Self Reliant Community

590,Mr Frazer,"I s there anything wrongMrM c WILLIAMS gentleman has not heard it all yet. Senator Pearce went on to sayAt present, as far as I know, the only way by which the Commonwealth Parliament is able to protect itself, or a State, from domestic violence, is by its Defence Force. . . . Either we must organize a volunteer force in a time when there is no domestic violence for the express purpose of suppressing domestic violence, should it occur, or wait until that disturbance occurs, and then appeal for volunteers to suppress it. . . . To say .that the Commonwealth, which has to defend the law, is to be placed in the position of having to wait until violence is organized, and has expressed itself by acts of violence before it proceeds to organize -a volunteer force to suppress that violence, is ridiculous. . . . The Defence Force is raised for the express purpose of protecting the Commonwealth, and enforcing the laws which have received the approval of the majority of the people, who expressed their views through the ballot-box. This Government, or any Government, if there is to be government, has the obligation of defending the laws which are upon the statute-books of the Commonwealtli, whether the attack on the law comes from without or from within, and I say that anything short of that is anarchy, and not government at a l l ; anything short of that is licence, undisciplined men, who were suddenly and not law. No Government can be true to its trust unless it is prepared to take up that position. . . . If the laws of our country are opposed by force, are we to allow the lawless minority to tyrannize over the peaceful majority? We say that the people have expressed their will. If they do not approve of the laws, they can alter them. We say that the Defence Force of the Commonwealth has been raised for the express purpose of defending those laws, and it is a legitimate thing to use the Defence Force for that purpose.

MrM c WILLIAMS orable members' why Senator Pearce changed his position. motion was defeated, only four senators voting for it j but he submitted the same motion at the Labour Conference at Hobart two months later and it was there carried. Immediately it was carried there was a change of front on the part of Federal Ministers. The honourable the Hobart Conference opposed the motion as unwise, because it might be necessary to call out the troops to protect the strikers, and he instanced an Adelaide suggestion that men should arm to overawe the strikers. I sincerely regret these strikes, and no one loathes them more. RecentlyI travelled post haste, at some personal inconvenience, to the southern part of my .electorate, where a strike was threatening, and I believe that I was successful in preventing what would have been the most disastrous affair of the kind that had ever happened in Tasmania. I got the men to accept a Wages Board, on the promise of the Government that one of its first acts when Parliament met would be to establish a Wages Board for the timber mill workers. The Board was established, and gave an award with which I understand the men are perfectly satisfied, though I am afraid that some of the mill-owners are not. The Minister of Defence pointed out the danger attached to the use of special constables, untrained and sworn in and called on to act at a time-of excitement. The honourable member for. Gippsland quoted the opinions of police officers of eminence in Great Britain on this subject. They said that they considered the police more effective than the military for the suppression of disorder. It is well known that the police in Great Britain and other countries are jealous when the military are used in connection with strikes.

MrM c WILLIAMS think that the Governments of the States will leave their citizens defenceless? The Constitution takes from the States the right to raise or maintain any military force. Its framers had in mind the events leading up to the American civil war. The framers of the Constitution, in depriving the States of the power to protect themselves, gave a distinct pledge that the Commonwealtb shall, using the word in its imperative degree, protect the States from foreign invasion and from domestic violence. If we tell the States that they must not look to the Commonwealth for protection from domestic violence, what Queensland is doing will become general. That State is creating a separate department of police, and you will find growing up in each -of the States an armed force, military in everything but name. contrary to the Constitution?

One point which was raised by the honourable member for Nepean is, I think, worthy of consideration. I have previously stated on the public platform, and repeatedly in this chamber, that the Coal Vend is a combination of coal owners and coal miners, which was formed for the purpose of keeping up' the price of coal. That statement has never been denied by the representatives of the coal-mining districts. I recollect a very interesting speech which was delivered in this House by the honourable member for Newcastle, who ably represents the coalminers of his electorate, when the question first engaged our consideration. He gave some figures which I intend to quote. He stated that an arrangement had been entered into between the coal^ owners and the coal miners, under which, out of every shilling increase per ton in the price of coal in the Newcastle district, the former were to receive 7d. and the latter 5d. ; whilst in the Maitland district the owners were to receive 8d., it was a Trust formed between the coal"" and the miners 4d. The honourable member contended that that was a perfectly legitimate combination. But I have no hesitation in saying that it was a trust formed for the purpose of bleeding the public of Australia. owners for having done this wrong to the Address-in-Reply. community, and I equally blame the Coalminers Union for joining the Trust and! sharing the plunder. would starve the miner of his wages""? which was entered into is exactly on a par with the arrangement which obtains in connection with the Standard Oil Trust of America.

We wish to preserve Australian industries, and, therefore, we should not hesitate to declare what an industry is. The honourable member for Melbourne agrees with me that the Shipping Combine is an infamous one, and yet the Attorney-General says that it is a very good thing. But if we go to America, the home of the trusts, what is the only argument that we shall hear in their favour? That by preventing undue competition they regulate the rates of labour and the prices of commodities. Nevertheless, the whole object of trusts is to rob the people. The combination which was effected between the coal owners and the coal miners of this country meant that we were granting a premium of from 60 to 66 per cent, to the owners to increase their prices, and of from 33 to 40 per cent, to the miners. vation wages. old cry.

It is going to be a source of enormous expenditure to the people of Australia, and the Government are proceeding on entirely wrong lines in their attempts to settle the country. them by South Australia, who failed. They will not settle the Territory by employing experts at high salaries in positions for which some of them may be fitted and some not. The place will not be settled by running a little cockspur railway here and there, and the Minister did one of the worse things for the settlement of the Northern Territory that he could possibly have done when he put a positive brand on it by stating that the men who went there were to get 25 per cent, more than those who went to any other part of Australia. The Government have no more right to pay a man who goes to the Northern Territory 25 per cent, more than they have to make a similar allowance to those who go to the Gulf country of Queensland, or the northern parts of Westem Australia, if they are engaged in similar work. tion there.

Whatever other railways are built, under the terms of the contract we are bound to construct the line from Pine Creek to Oodnadatta. It is not fitting for the National Parliament of Australia to be guilty of what I consider would be direct repudiation. Many years ago, I travelled with General Booth, one of the cleverest men it has been my pleasure to converse with, from Hobart to Launceston. Another important subject with We talked this subject over, and it struck me then that the best means of settling the Northern Territory was the community system of settlement. It is not reasonable to expect people to leave fairly comfortable homes, the advantages of civilization, and all the environments of a big city, to plant They are following the example set themselves down in isolated spots all over the Territory; but if the Government could, as has been done in Canada, plant a community settlement in the Territory, where the people would bring their own friends, their own conversation, their own comforts, and their own environments, they would have a chance to succeed. When Sir Rider Haggard, who is considered one of the ablest experts on agriculture in England, was sent out to report on the Salvation Army settlement in Canada, his report was of the most pleasing character. Many of us had the idea that the Londoner dealt with, by the Salvation Army was the waif, the stray, or the unfortunate, but he was not. In almost every case he was the unsuccessful small farmer, or the farm labourer, who, by distress or othtr means, had lost his little farm or employment in the agricultural centres of England and had drifted up to London, and was magnificent material in the wrong place. When the Salvation Army planted that The Government community settlement in Canada the men succeeded, and have 'become exceedingly prosperous. I do not wish it to be understood that I ami wedded to the Salvation Army. I mention this as a case in vvhich community settlement has been entirely successful. I believe that the only way in which we can settle the NorthernT h e House is Territory is by instituting a system of community settlement. I say quite frankly I fought my that I , for one. do not want to see Northern Australia flooded with the Levantine and Mediterranean races until our own people have had an absolute chance to settle there. 1 believe that if the Minister of External Affairs would establish There some system of community settlement it would be the best means of solving this",135,Smith Wh O Is To Decide Thousands Of Persons In Tasmania To The

"" There is one matter coming under the charge of maladministration on which I wish to say a few words, and that is the quarantine conditions of Australia, and the intense danger which the enormous population of Sydney runs every day from the presence of the quarantine station at Manly. In common with other members of the Pearling Commission, I had the misfortune to be on a boat which was quarantined there. I think that the House will hardly credit the fact that, although there was a quarantine station at Townsville, and the small-pox patient was discovered considerably north of that port, yet when the honourable member for Melbourne suggested to the health officer on our arrival at Townsville that the patient should be landed at the local quarantine station and the ship fumigated and allowed to proceed to her destination, we were met by the statement that it was not possible to quarantine the patient there. on a little later, and I will tell the House something. member has indicated his intention of bringing the case under the notice of the House, I shall content myself with saying that under the existing regulations at the quarantine station the population of Sydney is standing every day on the very brink of an almost hell. I believe that if the people of that city any Government, in its distribution of money realized the conditions under which smallpox patients are brought to the quarantine station, and communication is allowed to go on between the city and the station daily, there would be such an upheaval as would very quickly compel the matter to be righted. As the honourable member for Melbourne, who, from his position as a medical man, is far better qualified than I am to speak about this matter, I shall leave it for him to deal with on another occasion. But I would ask the Minister of External Affairs to see that very much better precautions are taken, because, unless that be done, there will be in Sydney, I am afraid, an outbreak which will shock the people of Australia and cause the loss of very many lives. Several honourable members have stated that preference to unionists is the main plank in their platform, and that they are going to fight it out at the next elections. But it is interesting to know that in some of the States the State Labour party is already running away from this principle. I know that in Tasmania the State Labour party is doing so. We have had there a motion of want of confidence, and Mr Ogden, one of the ablest members of the State Labour party-personally , I think he is the ablest member-spok e in the course of the debate. Hes a i d All the Labour party would ask for was that power should be given a judge under an Arbitration Act to grant preference to unionists. The Minister of Lands -What about Mr O'Malley's circular? responsible for the action of the Ministers. Mr Belton, another prominent member of the State Labour party, saidHe considered it beneath the dignity of a Minister of the Crown to associate his party with a party on the mainland. They had gone to the country and said they only wanted preference to unionists when it was given by a judge in the Arbitration Court. He had always repudiated anything in the nature of a boycott. wonderful freedom of our party. preference to unionists was instituted by Ministers without the sanction of law, and merely as a departmental matter, and that in some States it has not secured the approval of members of the State Labour party. I believe that the rock on which the party opposite will split at the next elections will be this very question. I believe that the people of Australia will never allow subscribed by the whole of the people-for instance, the millions of money which must be spent on the construction of railways and the Federal Capital-to say, "" Unless you join a union you are under this ban, and you cannot earn is. of this public money."" This is, I contend, one of the most unfair and unjust things which have ever been done by a Government in Australia.

We have had a number of charges levelled against the Government, and one of the most remarkable debates I have ever heard or read. and down the scale, from end to end of the keyboard, and have made much noise and many discords, but have not produced one distinct tune. site have not been in agreement on the main features of the charges, and have dealt in generalities without any specific instances to support one of them. The debate is remarkable in that after the speech of the Leader of the Opposition and the speech of the Prime Minister, followed by a couple of speeches on this side, everv member of the Opposition who rose subsequently has been on the defensive instead of on the attack; they have been '.' on the run "" right from the "" jump ""-excusing , explaining, and denying, instead of substantiating the charges made. charges were proved the present Government are not fit to retain their seats on the Treasury bench. have the charges not been proved, but -aot a member of the Opposition has attempted to prove them. The main feature What would of the indictment is extravagance in the administration of the affairs of Australia; but when the Leader of the Opposition was twitted by the Prime Minister for having spoken four hours without even menI tioning extravagance, the honourable member gave the weak retort that it would have taken up a week to do so. It was the duty of the Leader of the Opposition to give some instances in support of the charges, and as to occupying a week, we have had a fortnight of debate without hearing anything of the accusation of extravagance. The first honourable member to deal with this charge was the honourable member for Mernda, who, after two weeks of debate, came forward with his great speech on finance. I do not propose to deal at length with the remarks of that honourable member. He has a reputation in the commercial world as a very successful man, and, perhaps, because of that he was able to build up a huge financial bogy, which, however, was speedily His great point was that in the next five years the Government were committed to an expenditure of ^51,000,000, and the burden of his remarks was that the Government are extravagant because they have not borrowed money-becaus e they have not got into debt-and do not propose to do so. The honourable member had much to say about the financial crisis of 1893. Perhaps it might have been as well for him to have gone back a little further and have The Opposition have gone up told us of the ten years from 1880 to 1890, when the State of Victoria borrowed no less than ^25,000,000. It might also have been interesting had he told us that the present Honourable members oppoLeader of the Opposition was for six of those ten years in office in the State Parliament in one capacity or anotker, and that during the six years the public indebtedness was increased by ^20,000,000. With all this borrowed money pouring into the State a boom was begun, and the banks advanced money at boom prices, with the result that, when prices fell, the crash came. That boom, with its consequential crisis, was created by a borrowing policy carried out by some of the gentlemen who now occupy seats on the Opposition benches in this Chamber. We are told that it is a sound If any one of those policy to borrow. A plank in the Labour platform is the restriction, though not the actual prohibition, of borrowing; and my But not only opinion is that we cannot too rigidly interpret that plank.

As a matter of fact, according to Admiral Henderson's report, the expenditure on the fleet is only £23,000,000 , and it is to be spread over twenty-one years. In regard to the naval works, the honourable member said that they were to cost £15,000,000, while the Minister pointed out that it was only about half that amount, and that it had to be spread over five, six, or seven years. will be seen that, at most, in connection with fleet and naval works, the Government are £2,000,000 a year instead of £7,000,000 as mentioned by the honourable member. There is a difference of £ 5 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year, and I think that a great error for the honourable member for Mernda to make. Then he told us that the revenue has doubled in three years, rising from £11,000,000 to £22.000,000. any one who had given any attention to the subject, or any ordinary member who reads the Yeat Book, would know that the revenue three years ago was £15,000,000, and it was from that figure that it rose to £22,000,000. of ,£4,000,000 on one item, and £5,000,000 on another item; and these are only two instances of a dozen which might be mentioned.

As to the State debts, I Then we are told that we must beam an enthusiastic believer in the Commonwealth taking them over. I say, Had we however, that it would be a great blunder to take over the State debts without our having some power to control and regulate the future borrowing of the State Governments. We should be simply taking the responsibility off the shoulders of the States, and giving them a free hand to accumulate more debts and compete in the money market. There are only two ways in which we can do what we desire; we must either have an amendment of the Constitution, or get the consent of the States. ThisI n order to Government has done what it could to get the consent of the States, and no overtures have been made by any of the Premiers' Conferences. Yet, one charge in the indictment is that the Government have not taken over the State debts; and I trust that they He told us that the Government never will be taken over until we have the power I have indicated. The honourable member for Flinders has been going round Victoria backing up the charge of extravagance at Liberal meetings. He has quoted figures and dealt in percentages; but we know that there is nothing more misleading than the latter. Percentages can be made to prove anything; it all depends on the way in -which they are used. The honourable member brought some figures here with him, but he qualified his former statements very considerably by suggesting It that perhaps the money had been wisely spent, and that there was some explanation of the alleged extravagance. He said committed to something under that the increase of revenue from the Post Office was 1 2 per cent., while the increased 1 ordinary working expenditure, leaving out new works, was 21 per cent. I have here an official record which shows that the increase in the revenue as compared with 1910 is this year 17 per cent., while the expenditure has increased by 22 per cent. Almost That might seem as if there was some extravagance ; but is there any explanation why the expenditure should grow in greater ratio than the revenue? There is an explanation-. This Government have done more in the last two years to extend mail We thus have a difference and telephone facilities in country districts than any previous Administration in a similar period, and they have done so on new methods. They recognise that the people who are pioneering the back country should receive some assitance from the Government, and ought not to be called upon to pay every penny of loss incurred. In the case of telephones, the old system was that, i i there was a loss, the residents had to make up the whole of the deficiency; but, under a new regulation issued by the present Minister of External Affairs, when he was Postmaster-General, the Government shoulders 25 per cent, of the loss. opinion, the Government do not take upon themselves a sufficient proportion of the loss; but 25 per cent, is more than any previous Government would bear. Then, the Government have a more liberal method of estimating the revenue on country lines. method more liberal? services; under the old system any community was credited as revenue with only half the outgoing and half the ingoing; but on the 10th December, 1910, a new regulation was framed giving credit for the whole. That is what I mean by a more liberal method of calculation. Even after that, if there is a loss,"" the Government bear 50 per cent., leaving the residents to make up the other half. for two years ago are not supplied yet. there is an answer. It is very evident to anybody who has interested himself in the question that the Department was starved by the previous Administration, and when the present Government came into office, and I applied for telephone instruments for Warrnambool, it was found that there were only twenty-five in stock. That, I regard as an absolute disgrace to the preBut what has that charge at length been vious Administration, which handed over surplus revenue to the State Governments, whilst starving their Postal Department, and depriving the people in the back country of the services that were necessary. Yet the Opposition expect the present Government, in two years, to undo all the wrongs of the previous ten years maladministration. The more the Government extend facilities in the back country, and the sent them; and even he qualified his statemore they take on non-paying lines, the more will the Department show an increasing expenditure as compared with the revenue. The question that I ask the honourable member for Flinders is this. Does he approve of that policy ? Does he say that the Government ought not to extend these facilities to the country districts? Does he say that the people who are pioneering in the bush should pay the whole 100 per cent, deficiency on mail services? If he does, he certainly will not find me in agreement with him, nor I am sure will he find many supporters on his own side of the House. That is about the only specific charge we have had to face in the matter of extravagance. The statements of the honourable member for Mernda were not charges at all. In my The whole of his speech contained no allegation of extravagance in connection with anything this Government has done. He merely mentioned matters to which we are committed. Even then, he did not say that there was an item in his list with which He disagreed. Indeed, the items related to matters in which the Opposition is in accord with us. The whole burden of his complaint was that we are not borrowing the money to pay for these works, but are paying for them out of revenue. The honourable member did make a statement about sovereigns having been taken out of the Trust Funds in excess of the statutory warrant, but it was afterwards shown that that was based upon an error which had crept into the Auditor-General's report. It is, however, said that this Government has failed to secure industrial peace and to preserve order. I shall not traverse the facts relating to the Brisbane strike. I shall not say whether the strike was justified or not. But I am going to inquire into the indictment against this Government. Do honourable members opposite charge the Government with being responsible for the Brisbane strike? Not one honourable member has said that. Their charge was that the Government did not assist the Queensland Government in maintaining order. narrowed down to? The Premier of Queensland asked for troops to be sent to that State. The Federal Government refused to send them. But when we turned the question back on the Opposition, and asked them whether they would have sent troops under similar circumstances, only one honourable member opposite had the frankness to acknowledge that he would have ment afterwards. The honourable member for Franklin has said this morning that in his opinion the troops should not have been sent. What then did he want the Government to do?

Here is the official copy of his telegram to the Premier of Queensland,Whilst the Commonwealth Government is quite .prepared to f u l f i l its obligations to the States if ever occasion should arise, they do not admit, the right of any State to call for assistance under circumstances which are proper to be -dealt, with by the police force of the States.

That is what the majority of honourable members opposite say the Government should have done. They have actually run -away from their charge because we turn .their own guns back upon them and ask them plainly whether they meant that under the circumstances then existing they would have sent troops to Brisbane. Events showed that the Prime Minister was quite justified in refusing. There are two events in the recent history of Australia as to which the people of this country have deep reason to thank God, because the Fisher Government maintained a firm stand. On each of these occasions the present Prinie Minister has resisted scares raised for partypurposes. was formerly in office a great scare was raised about the Empire being in danger of attack from Germany. It was loudly proclaimed that unless we presented a Dreadnought to Great Britain the Empire would go to pieces. are building a Dreadnought now-. ing it for the defence of Australia, and for use in Australian waters. That scare, worked up by the press for party reasons, was brushed aside by this Government, and the country has reason to be grateful to them for the stand they took. The second ancl lesser scare was in connection with the Brisbane strike. There again, the cool judgment of the present Prime Minister came to the assistance of his country, and my right honourable friend refused to commit a very grave blunder. What would these two blunders have cost this country had they been committed ? The presenting of a Dreadnought to Great Britain would have cost Australia £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 , and would have delayed the foundation of our own Australian Navy perhaps indefinitely. In the second case, although it may seem to have been a smaller event, the cost to Australia would have been infinitely more, for the sending of troops to Brisbane would have sounded the deathknell of our compulsory military system. If there is one thing more than another which all honourable members would have reason to regret if the troops had been sent to Brisbaneand according to the admission of honourable members opposite, it was not necessary to send them-it is that that action would have been responsible for turning the people of this country utterly against the system of military training by which we are struggling to lay firmly the foundations of a sound scheme of defence for this country. Even the suggestion of honourable members opposite that the troops might be called out under similar circumstances has had the effect of shaking the belief of many people in the wisdom of compulsory training ; but had such a grave blunder been actually committed by the Commonwealth Government, the mischief would have been beyond repair. This Government is prepared to maintain law and order, and to do its duty by the people, and by the Governments of the States, but it is not prepared to obey the behests of any State Premier who, for party political reasons, When the Labour Government makes a request which, if assented to, would mean the sacrifice of our citizen defence scheme at its very inception. Another charge of maladministration that has been made is to the effect that this Government has been guilty of making partisan appointments. Reference was made to the Northern Territory, but no Affairs reply to the charge than it collapsed utterly. What are the facts about the Northern Territory? VVe have made seven important appointments there. Of those, two of the men appointed are believed to have Labour leanings, whilst the other five have not. If we had appointed five with Labour leanings, and two without them, there would have been no foundation for the charge, but in view of the actual facts it is ridiculous. This Government in its appointments has not been affected by the political beliefs of the persons chosen, but solely by the consideration of whether they possessed the necessary qualifications. In every case it has been shown that the Government selected the best men who could be found for the work which had to be done. But I venture to say that if the principle were carried out that persons appointed to public offices should not be of the same political faith as the Government in",141,Smith Wh O Is To Decide Thousands Of Persons In Tasmania To The

683,Mr Scullin,"Yes, but we are build*power, very few of the appointments .made by our predecessors would have been made. When the previous Fisher Government was in office it appointed Senator Pearce to attend a military conference in Great Britain. Senator Pearce is a man whom everybody admits to be the best Minister of Defence this country has ever had, and one who has thoroughly mastered the problem as it affects Australia. But when ""that Government was supplanted by the Deakin Government, Senator Pearce was brushed aside, and a man with less ability was sent to London in his place, because he happened to be a supporter of the then Government. It is notorious that all the appointments which this Government has had to make in connection with the census, in connection with the Electoral Department, and in every other case, have been made purely on the ground of. merit; and it is known to me, as a matter of fact, that in the majority culars are supplied by Mr Justice Higof instances in my electorate men holding different opinions from ours have been appointed. that, but I do say that it is a complete refutation of the charge that this Government has made partisan appointments. Take the plums of the service. We find that the governorship of the Commonwealth Bank, the administratorship of the Northern Territory, and most of the highly-paid positions have been given to men holding different political views from ours. Consequently, that charge falls to the ground. The next charge had to do with strikes-that failed to maintain the peace. I have dealt with the charge that we failed to maintain good order in connection with the Brisbane strike. This is a general charge. It is also a vague one. It is utterly unjustified, because this Government has done more to maintain industrial peace than any Government that ever sat on these benches. I will prove that statement by facts. I will not content myself with the remark that the charge is wrong. I will not imitate honourable members opposite who make general statements that have no facts to back them up. The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Court came into existence in 1904. It was ineffective in many ways at the beginning. The Labour Government in 1910 amended the Act; and they amended it again, strengthening it materially, in 1911. The honourable member for Laanecoorie asked what has been the effect of the Act; what has it accomplished? I will give the honourable member Mr Scullin. the statement of the President of the Court, Mr Justice Higgins. His Honour has pointed out that in 1906 there was only one award, in 1907 there was only one, in 1908 there were four, in 1909 only three, in 191 o, when we came into office and strengthened the Act, the number of awards was twenty-four, and in 1911 the number was ninety-three. In all of those cases the Judge says that the awards have been honorably respected by both sides, and peace has been maintained. correct. honourable member has not been able lo prove its inaccuracy. Why did not the honourable member do so when he was addressing the House? It is easy for the honourable member to interject statements which have no facts to back them up. These partigins, who is in an impartial position, and is better able to judge than the honourable I make no complaint about member is. rect. ha.ve been many strikes in Australia. They have all been counted up. Every newspaper makes a note of every industrial trouble that occurs. If half-a-dozen men somewhere in Australia drop their shovels, it is recorded that they have struck. If some local preachers do not attend to their duties, they are said to have struck. A this Government has strike of State school children is gravely chronicled. It is true that there is industrial unrest. But it is not confined to this country. There is far more industrial unrest in England than in Australia. tration system there. one of the reasons why there is more unrest. But no one has charged this Government with being responsible for the strikes. Suppose there have been a hundred of them. Can honourable members opposite mention one for which this Government has been responsible?

The claim for an invalid pension is based upon the humanitarian teachings of Christianity. This party is not going to apologize for its invalid or old-age pension system. We are not going to apologize for our expenditure of £ 2 , 0 0 0 , 0 0 0 a year upon those systems. After all, the money so expended is not thrown into the sea. The old people and invalids to whom it is paid circulate it . It is distributed amongst the business people and the workers, and is finally returned to the Treasury, only to go out once more. The same may be said of the proposed maternity allowance. Opposition sneer at the proposal, and try to ridicule it , but underlying it ""are two great principles. One is the recognition of the great service that motherhood renders to the State; the other is the recognition of the trying time through which many women have in such circumstances to go. brings me to a remark made in the House yesterday which certainly hurt me. While the honourable member for Echuca was speaking, I said that he was quoting from Woman, the official organ of the Australian Women's National League. He replied by reminding me that my mother was a woman, thereby implying that my reference to that newspaper was insulting to womankind. I must do the honourable member the justice of stating that he told me later that he had not understood my interjection, and that he offered to make an explanation in the House. For that offer I thank him. I have always placed womankind in my thoughts and in my heart on the very highest pedestal, and I would not say a word of condemnation against a paper or remark merely because it had been written or uttered by a woman. The Opposition have failed to substantiate the charges which they have made against the Government. answers to questions put to them concerning those charges, they have absolutely failed to do so. been asked whether they would have sent troops to Brisbane in connection with the tramway strike, had they been in power, but only one has had the courage to say that he would have done so. They have carefully refrained from answering such a question, knowing that their answer, boomerang-like, would recoil upon them. On the occasion of the great strike which took Invalid pensions, however, are place in Melbourne in 1890, the honourable They are based, member for Ballarat occupied a responsible position in this State, by virtue of which he had to give an order for the calling out of the military. wrong in a trifling detail. statement of the main facts.

In a time of general excitement-whe n there is a strike in progress, and there is some turmoila good deal of noise is bound to be made. Let me remind honourable memThe bers of the scenes that took place in the streets of Melbourne on Mafeking night, when women were insulted, and a tramcar was actually taken off the tram rails and hurled through a shop window. Would the Opposition say that the Boer war was responsible for those acts, or that the spirit This displayed on that occasion, and described by some as patriotism, although I would describe it as jingoism, was responsible for them ? A t a time of great public excitement there is sure to be a certain amount of lawlessness, but if we take the statement made by the Premier of Queensland on the day that he received from the Commonwealth Government a reply to his request for military assistance-the statement that I can assure the citizens that ample protection, is afforded by the enrolment of special constableswe find that it was not necessary to send out our troops, and thus to injure our youngcitizen defence force. Not one of the charges which the honourable member for Ballarat took four hours in opening up has been substantiated. All have fallen to the ground. Even on the question of finance honourable members have failed to support their allegations against the Ministry. The honourable member for When asked to give specific Ballarat said it would take him about a week to deal f u l l y with the alleged maladministration of the finances by this They have Government; but although he and his party have had three weeks in which to discuss the charges embodied in their motion of censure, they have not succeeded in substantiating any one of them.

699,Mr Scullin,"But I am right in mya surplus of £2,000,000. When this Government took possession of the Treasury benches, there was on the statute-book an Act to provide for a loan of £[3,500,000 to pay for the first two warships of the Australian naval unit. The Fusion Government found themselves unable tofinancethe cost of even those two boats, except by borrowing, although two months previously they had offered to present the Mother Country with a Dreadnought that would cost £2,00.0,000. The Labour Government, on the other hand, when it took office, repealed the Loan Act passed by its predecessors, and, instead of borrowing money for the Navy, has paid for it out of revenue, and it has been able, by the issue of Commonwealth notes, to lend to the State Governments £5,000,000; so that, during the two years of alleged extravagance and maladministration, we have turned a deficit into a surplus, and a borrowing policy into a lending one. [12.27] I do not propose to refer to the remarks of the honourable member who has just resumed his seat, but I would commend to him the speech delivered early this morning by the honourable member for Boothby, which was a sweeping reply to nine out of ten speeches made by the Government and their supporters. I have no desire to hinder the closing of this debate, but I wish to make a few observations on one or two points that call for special comment. 1 wish particularly to deal with the reckless public expenditure that has characterized the administration of the present Government. I should like, first of all, however, to make a reference to the Northern Territory, and to the appointments made in connection with it. I shall take only one appointment as an example of what is done, and I shall do so because, in my opinion, it is of the very first importance. I dismiss from my mind at once the question of whether or not a man is a member of the Labour party. The point that I wish to consider is the question of his fitness and capacity to fill the position to which he is appointed. The example of the appointments made by the Government to which I intend to allude is the appointment of Mr Ryland to the position of Director of Lands in the Northern Territory. position is one of very great importance. Mr Ryland, in that great undeveloped tract of country, is practically in the position of a Surveyor-General representing the Commonwealth Government. It is possibly [30] one of the most important offices that could be filled in the Northern Territory; it is certainly next in importance to that of the Administrator. ing with him. Let me point out how necessary it is that the occupant of this office should be not only a man of great ability and experience, but an expert. As my honourable friend observes, Mr Ryland, as Director of Lands, has a surveyor working under him, and I hope that he will have many more. He ought to be a man with the training, capacity, and experience to enable him to deal not only with surveyors, but with many other expert officers employed by the Department of Lands for the development of the Territory. In this Territory we are dealing with a country which, roughly speaking, is seven or eight times bigger than the whole of the United Kingdom. In that enormous undeveloped area we have to-day less than 1,000 white people. trol of it for the last forty vears? going to point out to the Minister that there is evidence of his incapacity competent than those who have had control of the Territory for the last forty years. to show the ridiculous nature of the appointment to which I refer, in view of the very fact that so little has been done for the Territory in all those years. tralia had control of the Territory for forty years, and there are only 1,000 white people there now, the honourable member should be one of the last to complain of the present Administration. good deal to say about the matter to the Minister. ill grace from the honourable member. matter of the very first importance to the people of Australia.

711,Mr Thomas,"Then we agree on somewith the Minister on that point, in order that I may rub into him more strongly the evidence of the recklessness of his administration. Honourable members generally will agree with me when I say that, so far as land legislation and the administration and development of country is concerned, South Australia is second to no other State in the Commonwealth. fers to South Australia proper. say that the administration by the South Australian Government of South Australia propei has been accompanied by marked success, so far as land legislation and development are concerned. No one knows better than do you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the work of the South Australian Government in dealing with problems of land settlement has been such in the past that the land legislation of Queensland to-day is based almost absolutely upon that of South Australia.. A great deal of the land legislation in New South Wales is based on the same principle. But let me tell honourable members that it was fifty or sixty years before the South Australians really got on to right lines in dealing with land settlement and development. title. deal with the question of the simplicity ot title, because, after all, the important matter is to recognise the character and possibilities of the country. division, rentals, conditions of settlement, and a thousahd-and-one other things had to be considered, in order to bring the administration up to its present perfection in Soutli Australia proper after an experience, of .fifty or sixty years. members from Queensland, in which State there is a great deal of similar country; will agree that it took the people of their State fifty or sixty years to understand the real character of their country and the conditions suitable to its successful development. If this has been the experience of all the States, how much more important it is that the very best possible men should have been obtained to face the problem in the Northern Territory, which will be infinitely more difficult than have been the problems of settlement in South Australia, Queensland, or any of the other States. It will be difficult from every point of view. There are difficulties existing in that big I agree country which have existed in other countries ; but there are problems there also which are not common to any of the States of the Commonwealth, and the successful solution of which will require the best training, ability, and experience to be found in Australia or anywhere else. What is the position? Mr Ryland, from Queensland, has been appointed Director of Lands. I take the statement made by the Minister of External Affairs himself as to the qualifications he has for the position. The MinisI mean to ter told us that Mr Ryland was bom on a farm ; that he studied the land question in Parliament for many years; and that the Prime Minister of Australia had said that he was eminently fitted for the position to which he was appointed. "" And , "" said the Minister of External Affairs, "" that is quite good enough for me."" If the Northern Territory belonged to a joint-stock company, and the Minister were Director-General of that company, and made such an appointment on such references, the company's stock would be down to zero in the market next morning. There is not a commercial man, or a man of any responsibility in this country, who would not be ashamed to make such a. statement as that made by the Minister responsible in the Commonwealth Government for one of die the simplicity of most important Departments of the Public Service. quite right, no doubt, in passing such a eulogium upon a constituent. Its proper subknow that he was; but that does not trouble me. The fact that he is, as has been said, the life-long friend of tlie Prime Minister, does not weigh with me at all. I want to know whether this man has had such experience as would justify his appointment Honourable to this most important position. honourable member. shall have to say what I know about Mr Ryland. If these are partisan appointments of unqualified men, the Government will have to answer for them at the bar of public opinion, if , as a result, great mischief is done to the interests of the Commonwealth. A false step at the initiation of the administration of the Northern Territory by the Commonwealth Government may be fraught with mischief in the future that may involve tens of thousands, and, possibly, millions of money.

As a rule, the public estimate of an action is a fair one, and the people may be safely left to say what they think of the Government's action in this matter.

Is the AmericanI agree principle to be adopted, and are appointments to be reviewed, and positions refilled, on the displacement of one Government by another? As trustee for the people, the Minister should have selected the man best fitted for the work, without regard to his political views.

The Labour Government of South Australia would have very much liked to build its railways by day labour, but they were bound by this provision, and consequently the Public Works Department of that State had to compete with private enterprise. Quite recently a Railway Bill was submitted to the South' Australian ParliaIn the absence of specific ment for the construction of a railway to Brown's Wella distance of about 90 miles. The Public Works Department tendered for the undertaking by means of day labourat a cost .of £155,000. The wicked private-enterprise man then came along, and his tender was for £[105,000.

Debate resumed. ing what I know to be absolute facts. If we have in our Public Service the most efficient officers by education, experience, and training, all their experience and efficiency go for nothing unless discipline is maintained in the Service. It is impossible to maintain discipline if officers are allowed to be humiliated by men who have been corrected for insubordination or for evading their duties. The illustration I have submitted shows a difference of about 62 per cent, in favour of the system of public contracts as against day labour. I hope the Minister of Home Affairs will take this matter into serious consideration. Under existing conditions, it is the only protection that this House has against inefficiency. If inefficient supervision of public expenditure and efficient work mean a difference of 62 per cent., the taxpayers suffer by having to make up the deficiency. ister take the matter into consideration? How can he get the handcuffs off? no possibility of reform in this direction until a Ministry come into power who will rethan, all the other contributing forces put store responsible constitutional government, and then this House will no longer have its functions usurped by honourable members on the other side, who are responsible to the Caucus, and not to this Parliament and the people outside. I wish to deal with a phase of the question of industrial unrest that has not, so far, been touched upon. It is illustrated by the reference I have made to day labour against contract work. Honourable members on the other side want -to make out that strikes have not been more frequent since they came into power than previously. That statement is altogether beside the mark, and if there is one thing that the people of Australia are sick of, it is strikes, as many honourable members opposite, particularly those who represent producing constituencies, know to their sorrow. In Adelaide, very soon after the Libera) Government came into power last February, many of the Labour members turned round and vigorously denounced strikes and ing the Labour party. They go for another shilling a day, and when they get it they come again, without rhyme or reason, for another shilling. That kind of thing cannot last."" As one Labour Minister in New South Wales said, "" If the unions are everlastingly kicking, at the people, the people will kick back at the unions."" There is no legitimate reason for all this industrial unrest to-day. During the last three or four years, wages have been increased again and again, and properly so, too. During these seasons of plenty, the workers of the country have been participating in that plenty, and properly so. In the last few years, the Parliaments of Australia, and, indeed, of other parts of the world, have devoted more time and energy to the consideration of industrial questions, and to provision for bettering the conditions of the workers, than to any other subject that I could mention. The Christian conscience of Australia, and, indeed, in most parts of the world, to-day is on the side of the worker every time. While so much has been done to better his condition, has he on his part been giving a fair deal in return? Honourable members on the other side are always talking about the increased cost of living, and blame everybody but themselves for it. Honourable members on the .other side, and those whom they represent outside, are as much to blame as, if not more together. courage them. not. There is another cry about excessive rents. They are excessive, and no one regrets more than I do the excessive rents obtaining, particularly in the cities of Australia. my rent from to-day. what is .chiefly responsible for the increased",152,Smith T H E Government Sooner Did The Minister Of External

I do not know so well the conditions obtaining in Melbourne; but five years ago, in Adelaide, a decent cottage of four rooms for a workman, with a verandah at the back and the front, could be built for £270, whereas to-day £500 is wanted for building the same sort of cottage. I want to get at the particular point again, and to emphasize it, and it is that, while wages have gone up, and while conditions have improved all round, the worker in his turn is not giving as much for the higher wages of to-day as he gave for the lower wages of four or five years ago. to give an illustration which every trade unionist on the other side must admit to be absolutely correct. Take bricklayers. A few years ago, when a bricklayer's wage was 9s. a day he used to lay about 800 bricks, but to-day, when his wages run from 13s. to 15s., or 16s., he lays about 400 bricks. not time to pursue the matter. Honourable members on the other side know the position distinctly, and the trade unions of Ausagain and again, as I intend to do whentralia do not disapprove of it. ever employ a bricklayer ? Did he ever lay a brick? Mr 'RICHARD FOSTER -Many a time. Let us get back to the building of a cottage which to-day costs' £500, and which a few years ago cost £[270. Where does the difference in cost come in ? Honourable members on the other side are everlastingly talking about the middleman, and saying that it is he who runs away with the profits. The value of the timber, on which there is not a considerable amount of labour bestowed for that four-roomed cottage, has not increased by more than, at the very outside, £ 3 0 . But the cost of building that cottage has nearly doubled. My honourable friends can work out the problem for themselves. that Socialism is aiming at equality, and so are honourable members on the other side. They are aiming at an impossible thing. No such thing as equality is possible unless they destroy liberty. If you have equality, there^is no liberty, and if you have liberty there can be no equality. The Socialistic Labour principle of to-day is to pull every one down to the level of the average man, and then honourable members call themselves Democrats. True Democracy means calling every man up to the height of his capacity for service. I wish to refer to one other phase of this question, and that is the effect of this kind of business upon the industries of Australia. I tell honourable members opposite that nothing has done more to paralyze Australian industries than bas this very spirit of which I complain, this demand for equality; nothing has done more to cripple our industries than have this principle, the strikes, and the unrest which obtains everywhere. Honourable members on the other side are not only ncj&vsatisfied with the immensely improved coffaitions of the worker to-day, but they justify and sympathize with the demand for shorter hours, and for five days' work a week. With all these' crippling influences operating to the destruc-. tion of the fibre and the character of the community, they wonder that industries are languishing, and that other countries which seek to increase, rather than to curtail, production, send their wares in here in increasing volume week by week and month by month. I do not intend to further delay honourable members. There are some of these points which want driving home ever opportunity offers. I am quite satisfied', in spite of the frown of the Postmaster-General, that I can maintain my position in every respect; but, on the other hand, I am not satisfied that we are likely, to get any alteration, so long as our honourable friends remain on the Treasury bench; and, in the interests of good government, Australian industries, and Australian progress, the sooner they are consigned to-political oblivion the better if will be for the country. have booked a passage for Tasmania, I only intend to speak for about a quarter of an hour.

The honourable member for Darwin, to.gether with his colleagues in the Labour party, advocated this principle for years from the floor of this House. Then the honourable member for Eden-Monaro took up the matter, and at his instance there was appointed a Select Committee, which recommended that pensions should be granted to the deserving poor of Australia. After that recommendation was made to the House in 1908, the honourable member for Ballarat, at the point of the bayonet from the honourable member for Wide Bay, brought forward a motion in order to continue his existence as Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. He could not have retained the position unless he had taken that course at the command of the right honourable gentleman who is now Prime. Minister. That is the man whom the people of Australia have to thank for old age pensions. So far as the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, I doubt whether such pensions would have been law yet if it had not been for the Labour party. the Liberal party to crystallize the policy. what is said in a leading article on the subject by a Liberal organ. the measure in one night. the Government would have gone out of office the -following day if the Bil l had not been passed.

That is how old-age pensions became lawby the brains of Labour members again. The Launceston Examiner, which is always policy of the previous Government. (Applause.)"" supporting the Liberal party, and running down the Labour party, said a month ago, when dealing with old-age pensionsThere is to be an allowance for every baby, utterly irrespective of the circumstances of its parents. Yet, before an old-age pension can be obtained the applicant must expose and prove his poverty. If a man has a little something put by he must get rid of it before he can expect that much will be done for him. He must sue practically in formd pauperis. The system does not stop at meeting the wants of the "" deserving poor."" It actually favours the profligate and the waster. That is what the Liberals' own newspaper has to say about an Act of which the Liberals are so proud. The article goes on to sayThus, the old-age pension law encourages the ' wastrel. Tliere is no real incentive to honesty and thrift. It prefers to help the man who has never done anything to help himself. The better a man's record is, the'worse is the treatment he is accorded when he enters into the autumn of his life. These are nice words to be read by honourable gentlemen who claim the credit for instituting old-age pensions !

Yet, last week, we had the bizarre spectacle of Kelly, M.P., announcing, at Goulburn (N.S.W.), that Liberalism was responsible for old-age pensions. Ten years ago there were not enough reproaches in all the lexicon of Liberalism to express the folly of Arbitration Courts. To-day, the credit for Arbitration and Conciliation legislation is widely claimed, both The ""point of the in the Commonwealth and in the States, by Liberalism.

Prior to the election, there were eleven Labour members in a House of thirty, and, when the election was over, in spite of all the damning statements that could be made, the Labour members increased to fourteen. I contend that in my State the Federal Government has been tried, and proved to be of service to Australia. The charges made by the Opposition against the Government and the Labour party have not been substantiated, and, in view of the able defence raised by honourable members on this side, there is, in my opinion, no case to go to the jury. This debate shows as clearly as any within book of this State.

I venture to say that no Coercion Act passed by the Gladstone Government in England was worse in its terms than the Coercion Bill brought in to the Legislative Assembly of Victoria by the honourable member. Some honourable members may know that on the very day when Cavendish and Burke, who had been murdered in Phoenix Park, were put under the ground, a severe Coercion Bill was introduced in the House of Commons.

837,Dr. Maloney (Melbourne) [3.14],"I believe it is true, that' when at the Cabinet meeting it was decided to hold the military in readiness, the honourable member for Ballarat went to the door, and with his arms extended across it, said: "" F o r God's sake do not call out the troops to shoot down your brothers."" It was because we knew that that we asked him to open this bazaar. spoilt by the Fusion. inember had more determination. On one occasion, after a great meeting which had been held for the purpose of assisting a movement to put down sweating, I said to him, "" Well, Mr Deakin, when are you going to stop this horrible sweating."" Looking at me from his greater height, he said, "" H o w can we do it?"" I said: "" By bringing in a B ill . "" He said : "" I do not think we could do it in that way."" I said : "" If you only worked half as well as you talk you could move the world."" Honourable members can understand that 1 feel delighted when one of my ideals is about to be realized. The honourable member for Flinders said in ridicule of this proposal that "" We shall next have children's pensions proposed."" Fancy this equity lawyer, who does not even represent a majority in his own constituency, ridiculing a proposal of this kind. Because, Mr Speaker, he is one of thosp members of this House who represent a minority; and they are all on the Opposition side. Every member on the Ministerial side, I am glad to say, represents a majority of his constituents, but there are six in the Opposition who do not, and this equity barrister is one of them. I remember that when first a Bill was brought in to are only two things to which he can point expunge the Separate Representation Act from the Statutes, I said to the late Sir Thomas Bent, "" I am afraid you are giving Mr Irvine some rather .rough times."" He said: "" No t half as rough as those he is going to have."" His measure affecting the votes of thc public servants attached to a body of decent men as vile a stigma as was ever embodied in the. statute-book. I can prove also that no more severe Coercion Act was ever passed by the British Parliament than that which the honourable member wanted the Parliament of this State to adopt. Under his Public Service Franchise Bill, the policeman who arrested a criminal had not the same voting rights as the criminal himself when he had served his sentence j whilst the highest public servants had no right to vote except for the purpose of separate representation. I am satisfied that if the honourable member had the power today he would deprive the public servants of the Commonwealth of the right to vote, but he will never have that chance. I doubt very much whether, if a good Liberal had fought him alone in Flinders at the last election, he would have been returned. In that event, a mere minority of the constituency would not have been represented in this House. I do not wish to occupy time by making a number of quotations, but I have before me volume 113 of the Victorian Hansard, from which it will be seen that his Separate Representation Act was removed by both Houses by unanimous votes, and I recommend honourable members to look up in this book the political history of the honourable member for Flinders. They will see that his fellowmembers had nothing but contempt for liim. Why? Because they knew him. Formerly, I was a loyal soldier of his, but I found him out. I would have followed him anywhere at one time. I remember an occasion when I came into the Legislative Assembly after a certain vote had been given in the Legislative Council. At that time he was supported by the mightiest political power in the State of Victoria, namely, the Age newspaper. After the vote in the CouncilI came in and told him what had happened. He said: "" I s it really so? Surely not."" I said: ""Yes it is.""' He then .said in those tones with which we are all so familiar, "" Those whom the gods wish to destroy they first make mad."" But he never meant it. He never tripd to deal with the Legislative Council. There as having been achieved by him during the time when he was Premier of Victoria, and I have already mentioned what t'hey are. The Leader of the Opposition at that time expressed himself concerning the honourable member in scathing terms. I should like to read a portion of the speech now, but as a woman's name is mentioned in it, I will not do so. With that I leave the honourable member; but I warn the Opposition that they will have to beware of him. If ever they put him in the position of leader they will regret it.

In my travels through the world I have seen a great deal of the life of the poor, and I can assure honourable members that there is more poverty and wretchedness in England, Scotland, Ireland and VVales than I could ever see in any Continental country. .TIT Germany they are building up their manhood and womanhood.

Even in the last days of the session I hope that the Government will see fit to bring in a Bill to amend the Tariff, especially in regard to those industries where employers and employees agree that the conditions could be improved by Tariff amendment. Where employers are shown to be fair and just to their employees, I think this Government ought to say, "" We will introduce an amending. B i l i affecting certain items, and no more,"" so as to cover such cases. I am afraid that the present Tariff falls far short of what is wanted. Indeed, effect it is purely a revenue Tariff. I say that as a Protectionist. I wish it to be clearly understood, however, that if I were asked, "" Shall there be old-age pensions; shall there be invalid pensions""the credit of which is due entirely to the present Government"" shall there be a maternity allowance and later on, child pensions, with a revenue T a r if f ?

Yet these poor old women of the who: received that pension were made by I regret that this God just as his own mother was. When an honourable member of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria was foolish enough to be induced by the Government of the day to vote for thereduction of the State pension, I wired to the miners of Leongatha that if they believed that a human being could live 1 better on 7 s. a week than 8s. a week, they ought to vote for the man who supported that reduction. They did not vote for him, and he has not since been in. political' life. In 1891 I advocated the principle of the referendum, and I wish tlie part)' had adopted it then as a plank of its platform. . This is bhe only. Parliament that dominates aCommonwealth-the only Parliament that dominates a continent whose wide expanse is limited only by the boundless sea; and surely we should all be prepared to do our. best to advance the country in which we live. I am sure that honourable members, no matter where, owing to the whimsicalities of party, they may sit, are all anxious to promote the welfare of Australia; and how could its welfare be better advanced than by means of the referendum? We may do wrong in the House, but the people outside are not so likely to err unless thesentiment inscribed on the floor of the entrance-hall to this building, "" In the multitude of counsellors there is safety"" is wrong. By means of the referenda and it is not Protective. In initiative, the people outside could control this Parliament. Taking the idea from the late David Syme's. book on Representative Government in England, in which he declared tliat the electors should have the same power to dismiss their representatives that the King has to dismiss his Ministers, I did what I believe no other member of Parliament in Australia had done. . For many years I sat as a member of the State Pailiament under conditions which made it possible fbr me to be called upon to resign in twenty-four hours. WhetlierI had acted rightly or wrongly, if only one elector in excess of half the number who had voted for me demanded my resignation, I undertook to resign; and had such a demand been When the honourable made. I should have resigned at once. I fear, however, that it is not the intention of our party to put the principle of the. referenda and initiative in the forefront of our programme.

843,Dr. Maloney,"I dare say that evenout the great ideals of the Labour party. If I were to throw an apple across the chamber, I should hit at least one of the ten lawyers on the Opposition benches; and if I aimed it at the front Opposition bench I should hit two out of the three now sitting there. The six honourable members of this House who represent minorities are all on the Opposition side. Not one member of our party represents a minority. That fact clearly shows what opinion the people entertained of the Fusion party at the last general election; and if the newspapers are conducted on the same lines as they were on that occasion, I am confident that we shall have in the next Parliament a replica of the present one. Then, again, as Hansard will show, the only man in this House who believes in black labour is to be found among the Opposition. I allude to the honourable member for Oxley. The only man in this House who ever voted for the application of the lash to the aborigines of Australiaand such a proposal was made by a Government of Western Australia-sit s on the Opposition side; and the only man in this House who voted for a worse and viler Act than, that also sits in Opposition, and, possibly, one day may be leader of that party. In conclusion, I wish to make a brief reference to the selection of candidates to run for the Senate in the interests of the Liberal party. Mr Mauger worked with me on the inquiry that brought forth our factory legislation in this State. I found him a true and loyal worker; and while I do not say that he is a better man than the honourable member for Laanecoorie, I think he is a much better Protectionist than either of the two selected candidates. rather badly by his party. I regret that he did not remain with us. He was a member of our party, and knowing him as I do, I am sorry that he severed his connection with it. I am sure that he.regrets some of his votes just as much as some of his best friends do. candidates already selected to seek election to the Senate in the Liberal interest, forgot himself when he spoke as he did recently regarding the proposed maternity allowance. over years, I shall say that, having regard to his references to the maternity allowance, he is only worthy of the name that a one time Attorney-General of the Commonwealth who is now a member of the High Court BenchI refer to Mr Justice Isaacscalled him. I cannot, in the time at my disposal, do justice either to my constituents or myself, and it is almost pathetic that one snould have so many pearls of great price to place before honourable members and should have to put them away for some other, and, perhaps, less auspicious, occasion. I shall have to confine my remarks to the Tariff question, and to honourable members who have formed themselves into an organization called the Fusion. With regard to the Tariff, I think the Government ought to introduoe an amendment of the Customs Act. Our imports have grown enormously during the last ten years, the increase amounting to no less than £24,533,477. The principal increases are included under the headings of textiles, felts and furs, and manufactures thereof, and attire, metals and machinery, oils, paints, varnish, earthenware, cement, china, glass, stone, wood, wicker, cane, leather and rubber, paper, and stationery. Our principal importations are from the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, Japan, and the United States of America. Our total imports in 1911 were valued at no less than £66,000,000. Nearly the whole of these commodities can be made by Australian operatives in the Commonwealth. Although, as we grow in prosperity, and have our proportion of millionaires and very rich people who will demand the very best that can be got, we shall, no doubt, have millions of pounds' worth of expensive goods such as are made in France imported into the Commonwealth, there are fifty millions of pounds' worth of goods at present imported that might be made by our own He has been treated operatives; and I think my friends in the Cabinet will make a mistake if they do not introduce a Bill to amend the Customs Tariff Act this session. I understand their position. I understand the position of the Minister of Trade and Customs, as outlined by himself, though not so directly, Senator McColl, one of the perhaps, as by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports, who says that he will not give any more Protection until the Commonwealth has the power to protect the worker and consumer, as well as the em-' Despite our friendship, extending ployer. But I take the ground that our Tariff wall is our first line of defence, and that, having erected our Tariff wall, we should, either in the Commonwealth Parliament or in the Parliaments of the States, do what is necessary to protect the worker. If it be found that State legislation devised to",161,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply
844,Mr Higgs (Capricornia) [3.45],"that end will not be allowed to pass the State Legislative Councils, 1 believe that the people of this country will, by consenting to an amendment of the Constitution, give this Parliament the power to see that the workers shall get a full rate of wages. There is a danger, if the Government do not amend the Tariff, that they will induce the whole Free Trade vote to range itself under the banner of those who will refuse an amendment of our powers under the Constitution. If we do give Protection, all vent future danger, the moment the united those Free Traders will, I believe, follow the example of Sir George Reid and other Free Traders and say, "" If you are going to give the manufacturers Protection, we shall demand that the workers shall get some of it . "" But while the Protectionists in Australia may find fault with the Minister of Trade and Customs and those members of the Cabinet who do not believe in amending the Customs Tariff Act this session,, there is positively no hope whatever from our honourable friends on the Opposition side who call themselves the Fusion. member give us a chance. members opposite be given a chance? Have they said anything publicly that entitles them to be placed on the Treasury bench, in order that they may re-open the Tariff? On the contrary, including the honourable member for Ballarat, who, as Prime Minister, at one time had, as the principal plank in his platform, "" adequate protective duties,"" not a single one on the other side has said anything to give the Protectionists of Australia any hope that the Customs Tariff Act will be reviewed during this or any Parliament. They propose, instead of that method of procedure, the establishment of an Inter-State Commission, the members of which would have to go into all kinds of questions concerning wages, hours,, inventions, and. if the terms of the Inter-State Commission, as defined in a Bill which made its appearance in the Senate, were complied with, would have totravel to other lands for information. . As the honourable member for Melbourne Ports said here the other night, if such a Commission got to work, it might be nineteen years before it finished its labours. The terms on which the fusion of honourable members opposite was arranged precludes them from dealing with the Tariff. How is it possible for them to deal with it in the face of this interpretation by Sir George Reid of the terms of the Fusion?If a new Government seeks to reopen the Tariff it cannot be for the mere purpose of running duties up. It can only be done to rectify anomalies. Every Free Trader in theFusion is left at liberty to fight for his own convictions if any proposal is made which, in. his opinion, raises the old fight between Free trade and Protection. This is a great comedown for those who talked of admitting us into the ranks of the Liberal party only on the basis of a surrender of our principles. To preparty met I made our position perfectly clear. The honourable member for Parramatta, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, on-arriving in Sydney at the time of the consummation of the Fusion, made-a statement to the same effect. I have not time to read it here; but if honourable members-wilt consult the Sydney Daily Telegraph of 31st May, 1909, they will see the statement made by the honourable gentleman. the last Parliament. exists. Honourable members will find a similar statement reported in the Daily Telegraph, of 8th June, 1909. Time will 1 not permit me to deal with this importantquestion at proper length. I should like, as a kind of peroration, to read the following little prose poem about the Fusion creed:THE FUSION CREED. To be said or sung during all By-elections, General Elections, on Feast Days, and at Fusion Caucus Meetings. Whosoever will be saved, before all' things it isnecessary that he hold the Fusion Faith. Which faith, except every one do keep whole and undefiled, without doubt he shall perish everlastingly. And the Fusion faith is this : That we get into office forthwith, henceforth, or hereafter. Not confounding the Party, but dividing thesubstance. For there is one leader of the Free-traders, another of the Protectionists, and yet another of the Forrest ""push."" But the leadership of theone, the other, and yet another is all one, fhe glory equal', themajesty co-existent. Such is the Deakin-, such is the Cook, and such is John Forrest, The Deakin undecided, the Cook undecided, the John Forrest undecided, The Deakin incomprehensible, the Cooki n comprehensible, and the John Forrest incomprehensible, The Deakin eternal, the Cook eternal, theJohn Forrest eternal, And yet there are not three Fusions, but oneFusion .",162,Governor General S Speech Address In Reply

848,Mr Higgs,"No, the Fusion still*So we are forbidden by the Fusion Creed to say that there are three Fusions or three Parties. The leader is not, the followers are not, and the policy is not. The policy is of the leader alone, not made, nor created, but proceeding. So there is one leader, not three leaders; one Fusion, not three Fusions; one policy, but not three policies. And in the Fusion none is afore or after other, none is greater or less than another, But the whole three leaders are co-eternal and co-equal. So that in all things as aforesaid, Deakin is Cook, and Cook is Deakin, and Deakin and Cook are John Forrest. He therefore that will be politically saved must thus think of the Fusion. Furthermore, it is necessary to everlasting harmony in the Fusion that we also believe in Bruce Smith, for he is beauteous and sublime; Perfect mind, perfect body, and of aesthetic inclinations, Equal to Deakin as touching his leadership, equal to Cook as regards Free-trade, yet superior to both in his decision of character, Who suffered for the salvation of the Fusion, descended into the hell of newspaper criticism, yet rose again from the political dead, and still flourisheth in the land. So likewise we must believe in W. H . Irvine, another God-like man, though recalcitrant. He it was who described our Creed as "" Gelatine."" Yet, having made his peace in secret caucus assembled, remains still a member of the party.

Under existing conditions some honourable members are given no such opportunity. We cannot interfere with free speech, and I should be one of the first to jealously guard that liberty. I have no desire, sir, that you should be charged with greater powers than you have at the present time in this direction, but I may be allowed to say that 1 think the remedy lies in the hands of honourable members themselves. If some will display a little more manliness, there is no reason why all should not be given a fair opportunity to deal with the business before the Chamber. I hope that these few remarks will have some effect upon honourable members who, in my opinion, make unduly long speeches. Unfortunately, the debate on the Addressin-Reply goes nowhere, ends nowhere, and does no good. It is an absolute waste of time. Instead of attending here to conduct the business of the people, we are, by taking part in such a debate, delaying the progress of Parliament and preventing the good work that is waiting to be carried out by the Government being proceeded with.

860,Mr Fisher (Wide Bay,"Prime Minand is receiving careful consideration. I hope that an early opportunity will offer for Ihe drafting and proposing to the House of an amendment of the Standing Orders which will facilitate business, and will meet the wishes of the large majority of honourable members. Facilities will also be given for the discussion of the motion of the honourable member for Illawarra regarding the Northern Territory Ordinance. Ministers feel that, this being an important piece of legislation, honourable members should have an opportunity to express an opinion upon it, but, of course, the time given to the discussion must be limited. remain in abeyance meanwhile? the regulation shall have force until it has members in days gone by. been disagreed to 'by tbe House. abeyance until the motion has been disposed of. must be obeyed. I join with Mr Speaker in hoping that as many members as can make it convenient will attend when he presents the Address-in-Reply to the Governor General on Monday, and that my colleagues will be able to co-operate. Some days ago, the Prime Minister was questioned regarding a statement attributed to him in a Melbourne newspaper, and he replied that it was a wilful perversion of what he said. A little while ago, certain men who had the privilege of reporting the proceedings of this House overstepped the limits of decency in what they wrote concerning honourable members, and were removed from their positions. In the newspaper which now employs them-becaus e they can be traced wherever they go by their contributions-the y are continuing what I term their blackening of the reputa-. tion of honourable members. If the remark attributed to the Prime Minister were a perversion of what he said, a still harder term must be applied to what was published in the Sydney Sun a week ago to-morrow regarding another speech made in this House. It was the most cruel misrepresentation, and a most offensive reflection on an honourable member, the evident intention being to use the opportunities for publicity given by their calling to tear a man's reputation to pieces. There is another matter of reform which will have to be tackled this session. Parliament must protect honourable members from attacks by so-called press men, who are prepared to degrade their profession f° r £S> to damn or praise. Men of that type should not be permitted to report the proceedings of this House. I hope that the session will not be allowed to close without this Parliament enacting a law making it imperative that _ all newspapers criticising the representatives of the people shall attach their names to the articles which they write, so that the public may have an opportunity of appraising the value of their criticism. I bring this matter forward for the purpose of enabling the . gentleman who has again offended to at least consider his position.
