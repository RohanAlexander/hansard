36,Mr Blakeley (Darling) [2.48],"Ijudicial control of industrial relations. There are many persons in the community, including numerous business people, who believe that the workers are entitled to a wage which will enable them adequately to maintain themselves and their families in food, clothing, and houswhich faced this Government when it ing. There arc also the mean employers -happily , they aro comparatively few in number-wh o are always endeavouring to evade awards, and frequently enter into conspiracies with their employees, the latter signing documents to the effect that they are receiving full award rates when they are actually receiving less. Again, there are a number of employers who believe that they can conduct their businesses better by round-table conferences and direct negotiation with their employees than by the recognized' methods of arbitration. But the workers of Australia tried the round-table conference method before tins introduction of industrial tribunals and arbitration courts. It was because they found it so unsatisfactory that they threw their strength in behind the movement for the establishment of industrial arbitration. Under the old conditions, it was impossible to secure standard wages and conditions. A long fight was waged before industrial arbitration became the accepted policy of this country, hut it has been so for many years. In these circumstances, it is deplorable that the National Government should join with the mean and contemptible employers and those who believe in direct negotiation in trying to break down this system which involves the fixation and payment of a living wage. We naturally look to governments to ensure that our citizens are adequately housed, clothed, and fed, but this Government has entirely failed in this respect. Its active opposition to the principles of industrial arbitration, as shown by its action in disallowing the determinations of the Public Service Arbitrator, has put back the hands of the clock by 40 years. Our industrial arbitraof properly trained juniors to step into tion machinery has made Australia ono of the greatest countries in the world, and it is distressing in the highest degree that the Commonwealth Government should endeavour so callously to smash the machine. It has been advanced in defence of the Government's action that the financial conditions of the country have made it necessary that money shall be saved, and that adults shall work for less than the basic wage. But the Scullin Government was confronted with a much more serious financial position than that assumed office. We had to meet a deficit of £20,000,000 in times when the business of our great public instrumentalities, such as the Post Office, was falling in volume every month."" At the same time, we had to find avenues of employment for the junior members of the Public Service. Notwithstanding the extremely difficult financial position, and the many redundant oificers in the Public Service, we decided to pay the juniors in the Service the adult wage as soon as they reached their majority. But immediately the Lyons Government assumed office, it took steps to discontinue that policy. The basic, wage has always been regarded as sacrosanct, but, unfortunately, the representatives of the employing class in this chamber do not so regard it. The Government issued a regulation which was entirely at variance with the policy of the Scullin Government. The Public Service unions thereupon appealed to the Public Service Arbitrator for the reconsideration of the whole subject. The Public Service Arbitrator has had a life-long experience in the Public Service, particularly in the Postmaster-General's Department, and was probably in a better position than any other man in Australia to deal with the case submitted to him. Evidence was placed before him to the effect that the circumstances of the country were such that public, officers who reached adult age, but could not be found positions for which the basic wage wa3 paid, would either have to work for less than the basic wage, or be discharged from the Service. I have on many occasions in this chamber pointed to the greatdanger to the Commonwealth Public Service of failure to maintain a supply the senior positions as these fell vacant. This, and many other aspects of the subject, were discussed before the Public Service Arbitrator by persons who could speak with authority. After a most exhaustive investigation, and a hearing which was not in any way hurried, the Arbitrator decided in favour of tbe public servants, and against tbe Government. He held that as there were many avenues in the Service, particularly in the Postal Department, in which juniors who reached adult age could be usefully employed, there was no necessity whatever for discharging them. The Arbitrator quoted a number of authorities in support of his finding. I do not propose"" to refer at any length to these authorities, for honbetter than nothing at all. orable members must, by this time, be well informed on the subject. I have moved this amendment as a protest against the action of the Government in applying sweating conditions to adults in its service. If the Commonwealth aud State Governments can disregard the basic wage, and all the well-established principles of arbitration, it will not be long before the whole system will fall to pieces, and the conditions of the so called good old days are reverted to. The Government resembles a petulant and mean-minded school boy who, in the sporting field, refuses to accept the decision of the umpire. The Government, in a mean and despicable manner, nullified the decision of the Public Service Arbitrator. words "" mean and despicable"" are unparliamentary, and must be withdrawn. . I shall say that the Government acted in an unmanly way, in that it sought by subterfuge to evade the responsibilities placed upon it by the people. Unfortunately, the Government and many of its supporters would, had they the opportunity, destroy our arbitration system and reduce wages in order to get back to the industrial conditions which obtained many years ago. The Government, by its action, has done incalculable harm to a large number of citizens. ringah-Postmaster-General) Many of those concerned have now The honourable member for Darling( Mr reached manhood, and although occupyBlakeley) has adopted the somewhat uning responsible positions in the Public usual course of resurrecting a subject Service are expected to work for £2 5s. which hasalready been discussed at great or £2 10s. a week. sack. member for Perth( Mr Nairn) might, with equal logic, contend that £1 a week is better than the sack.

By saying that £2 10s. a week is better than no wages at all the honourable member places himself in the position of an Arbitration Court judge. is sufficient for an adult, but that it is member has echoed the sentiments of employers of a certain type in Australia who say that half a loaf is better than no bread. Some employers contend that if they could lower their costs of production by reducing wages 10 per cent, they could employ more men. The honourable member for Perth who suggests that £2 10s. a week is better than nothing, is in the same category. Such a principle when applied to government departments becomes a menace to the citizens of this country. It has been said that these youths are single men. They are single to-day, but many of them may be the fathers of our future citizens. Unless they receive a wage sufficient to enable them to save money on which to maintain a house of their own, many must remain single or assume responsibilities which they will be unable to carry. I protest against the action of the Government in evading its responsibilities and in following the mean and contemptible course adopted by certain private employers who wish to reduce wages and to destroy our arbitration system. The Government's action in this respect merits the condemnation of the committee, and I trust that a majority of honourable members will support my amendment. [3-5]-length in this chamber.

He suggested that something unusual or illegal had heen done. moral. further said that the Public Service arbitration law had been infringed. The course adopted by the Government, which the honourable member characterized as subterfuge was exactly in accordance with the law. The act gives the Public Service Arbitrator the right to investigate the conditions of employment in the Public Service, but it also provides that his decisions shall not become effective until ratified by Parliament. This Government merely exercised its right to move to disallow a determination of the Public Service Arbitrator with which it was not in agreement. of the argument of the honourable member that the action of the Government was unfair or unjust, or in the nature of a subterfuge. Approximately 1,000 youths had reached adult age, when they were entitled to perform the work of adults if it were available, and to receive the basic wage. The Postal Department said that there was no adult work for these youths to do. Those engaged in commercial enterprises would not, in similar circumstances, have done what this Government has done. Distead of dispensing with the services of these youths and bringing on other boys to do what is boys' work, we allowed them to continue at the wages they were then receiving, on the understanding that they would be absorbed into the Public Service as adult work became available. If honourable members willstudy this matter free from party bias, aud consider the interests of these young men, they will admit that the Government acted in a reasonable and humane way. I have set out the salient points as succinctly as possible, and leave the decision of the Public Service Arbitrator providof the matter to the good sense of honourable members. I join with the honourable member for provides; in such cases, it would be Darling( Mr Blakeley) in protesting against the Government's action in this matter, notwithstanding the Minister's reminder that the subject has been discussed on other occasions. In my opinion, this question cannot be discussed too often, because once a precedent of this kind has been established, there is danger that it will be followed, because of the desire of the Governmnt and its supporters always to reduce wages and conditions of labour. It behoves the Opposition to be ever watchful, and to avail itself of every opportunity to focus public attention on this matter. A new sphere of thought is opened up by the suggestion that the Parliament should have the right to disavow a determination as to wages and conditions of labour made by a properly constituted authority. If the Government and its supporters believe that the Parliament should determine these matters, well and good; let the several political parties seek a mandate from the people. That disposes if the Parliament were to decide these matters. action gives the lead for the future determination of the wages and conditions of its employees by the Parliament. On other occasions members opposite have been insistent that Parliament is not in possession of all the information necessary to decide these questions; that wages and conditions can be determined fairly only by those acquainted with all the facts. They are prepared outside of this House to argue at length that members of Parliament are not competent to deal with these matters, but if the Parliament can be used to lower wages, it is time that the Constitution was altered to enable it also to increase wages, and to deal with the whole problem. It would appear that when outside these walls honourable members opposite express, different views from those which they advance within this chamber. So far as I am aware, Parliament has never vetoed a determination ing for a decrease in wages.

49,Mr Beasley,"The Government'sfound that honourable members opposite would not disallow his award. Even if the party now in power remained in office for a century it would never take steps to disallow the Arbitrator's award in order to increase wages; but, strangely enough, it will take action to do so when conditions are different. I am forced to admit that under the law, Parliament is entitled to veto the Public Service Arbitrator's determinations; but why was not the matter brought forward in this chamber, instead of in another place? Was it because the Opposition there was not so strong as in this chamber, and because less publicity was likely to be given to the Government's action? proportionately as strong in the other chamber as in this. honourable member admits that the other chamber has equal rights with this chamber?' The other chamber has its rights; hut one would naturally expect that a matter of such importance to the Postal Department would have been brought forward in the chamber of which the Postmaster General is a member. Instead, the Government took action iu another place, where the Minister in control of the department concerned could not himself be heard. ment had a reason for dealing with this matter as it did. The financial emergency legislation, which cuts across the principle of arbitration, opened the way for the Government's action. That legislation has been the subject of many protests by the people affected by it. During the last Parliament a committee was appointed to adjust wages and conditions of employment in various semi-public bodies, in order to bring them into line with the general reductions that had taken place in tine Public Service. The basic wage was not then involved; but I am afraid that I shall not be permitted to discuss that question now. The Minister said that he was prepared to leave the matter to the decency of honourable members. I of that belief. suggest that it might be considered in the light of the need for providing a Higgins did more than any of his suedecent standard of living for the postal workers concerned. The standard of living of those affected by the Government's action is a matter of vital importance to them, and for that reason I , and those associated with me, will use the forms of the House to focus attention on what has been done, with a view to restoring to these employees the conditions to which they are entitled under the award of the Arbitrator. [3.17] -Sinc e this item deals with the cost of arbitration in this country, I take it that honourable members are entitled to discuss the principle of arbitration, and the adequacy or otherwise of Opposition is the vote for the system to be successful. I am firmly convinced that the majority of the people of Australia still favour the principle of arbitration. Having had some experience of the system, I am still 100 per cent, in favour of a scientific scheme of arbitration, either to prevent industrial disputes or to settle them once they have arisen. I am also in favour of taking into consideration the economic circumstances of an industry when determining what wages and conditions shall operate in it. That principle has never been endorsed by those in control of industry; if it had been the principle of arbitration would be much more acceptable to both employers and employees than it is now. We have Obviously, the Governviolated the principle of arbitration by varying it according to the demand for workers. When the competition for jobs is keen, the employers take advantage of the Arbitration Court to force down the conditions in industry; at such times the principle of arbitration is satisfactory to them. On tbe other hand, when there is little competition for the jobs offering, the system is acceptable to the employees. The law of supply and demand should not govern the principle of arbitration. The first President of the Arbitration Court, the late Mr Justice Higgins, urged that the Arbitration Court should have what, in effect, were sovereign rights; he did not believe in outside influences interfering with it.",15,Attorney General S Department

When the late Mr need to-day is for some scheme which will Justice Higgins first directed attention to this phase of the industrial problem, this country was passing through an industrial crisis similar in many respects to, longer retain his dignity as a man and but not so acute, as the present one. Believing that the court was wasting much valuable time in the investigation of the -circumstances governing the weekly hours of labour in individual industrieswhether they should be 48 or 44-h e suggested to employers and employees that an attempt should be made to settle this question for a decade at least, at the end of which time it could be reviewed in the light of any changes that might have taken place in the meantime. Accordingly, he invited employers and employees from all over Australia to appoint representatives to confer with hiin, believing that if agreement could be reached industry would be saved hundreds of thousands of pounds yearly. When he had nearly completed this investigation, it became evident to the legal representabe swept away, and direct action take its tive of the manufacturers, who passed on the opinion to their representatives in Parliament, that he was about to give a decision in favour of the employees. Thereupon the then Prime Minister( Mr minimize the regard for the system of Hughes) instructed the judge that ho must not give a decision which would alter in any way the standard working hours for industry under normal conditions in Australia. Mr Hughes further intimated that Mr Justice Higgins must confine his attention to the cases then before the court, and part heard, in which two or three organiI t may be zations were concerned, that he could determine such questions as piece work rates wages, apprenticeship, &c, but must not give a determination affecting the standard working hour3 in industry generally. That was one concrete evidence of political interEvery thinking person in the ference with our arbitration tribunal which we would do well to remember in these days, when we hear so many protests from government supporters that there should not be political control in industry. My complaint always has been that governments approve of political control when it suits them, but are opposed to it if they believe that intervention would be against the interests of the people they represent. Clearly the settle this vexed question once and for all. When the late Mr Justice Higgins received that instruction from the Prime Minister, he declared that he could no continue in the position of President of the Arbitration Court. Accordingly, he resigned, and it is not too much to say that since that day our arbitration system has lost much of its attractiveness, although I am absolutely certain that the great mass of the people of Aus-. tralia are still anxious to continue it for the prevention of settlement of industrial disputes. In the debate on this item, it is, 1 think, fitting that we should review the system, and endeavour to ascertain the causes which have tended to weaken the regard in certain quarters for arbitration. I do not think there is one member of this chamber who would care to say, publicly, at any rate, that arbitration should place. Surely then, our purpose should be to make the system as sound and attractive as possible. I have just said that political interference has helped to arbitration by the people generally. But I do not agree with those who contend that Parliament should not define policies, because, at various stages in our evolution, parliaments have given a lead to our courts and other public institutions, and that power should at all times remain with the Parliament. Changes in the method of doing work necessarily demand alterations from time to time of the conditions of labour. Eailure to recognize this fundamental fact frequently leads to disaster, which could be avoided by the adoption of an orderly, progressive and scientific system for the control of industry meeting changes as they arise. Therefore, Parliament should, at the right time, give a lead to our courts. I suggest that that time has arrived, because all over the world employers and employees are facing the same fundamental economic difficulty. They are seeking to determine the number of people that can be absorbed in industry, the amount of individual service to be rendered, and the manner in which employment can be spread so as to make the income of all the people engaged in industry as nearly permanent and uniform as possible, in order that business and social conditions may be stabilized. Because of this inherent problem confronting all countries, there is definite need for a fresh policy to take into .consideration the economic determine the conditions of labour in industry; how we shall produce and distribute our bread and butter output-to put it in the ABO of the language of economics-so as to remove the cause of all the discord that exists in the world to-day because of the maldistribution of these necessary commodities. Therefore, I suggest that this Government would render a distinct service to the people of Australia if , because of the industry should be reduced. I suggest changes that have taken place during the last three or four years, and the present chaotic state of industry, it suggested to our arbitration judges that they should re-investigate our entire economic and industrial system with a view to discovering its faults, and working out a different and better policy for the future. Australia would then play her part in the world restoration of prices by increasing the purchasing power of the workers. This problem, I remind honorahle members, is also engaging the attention of the League of Nations. At the last conference, practically 90 per cent, of the time of the delegates was concentrated upon the evils of unemployment in all countries. Consideration was given to proposals for re-arranging the rewards for labour, and the number of hours to be Mr Uollmoay. worked in industry, so as to ensure a more uniform distribution of the available employment. This Government, while it is dealing with arbitration, should suggest to our judges the need for a similar investigation. The Attorney General( Mr Latham) has on many occasions intervened in arbitration matters, and I put it to him that he should now intimate to the Chief Judge and his colleagues that that time is ripe for such an investigation, to see if it is not possible to help the Government to lessen the number of unemployed in this country by a more even distribution of and a general increase in the wages fund, thus again making useful citizens of our unemployed, and improving the local market for the people who produce other goods. Not long ago, the Government of the day gave a definite instruction to the court that, in determining claims regarding wages and hours of work, it should circumstances of the industry concerned. That instruction has endangered the system. It was based on the representations of employers that, as industry was in a parlous condition, due to the depression, wages should be reduced. At all events, everybody in. Australia read the instruction in that way, believing it to be an intimation to the court that the time had arrived when the rewards of labour in that that was a wrong action to take.

He laid it down that any additional payment on account of extra skill or initiative should bemutually determined by the employer and employee, and said that his duty was to fix the minimum wage, which was not to be regarded as the maximum.

Employees generally do not regard with favour the suggestion that a judge should take into account the existing economic circumstances, hecause they fear the application of the principle in one way only. At one time. I assisted in the preparation of an agreement that was made between the .BrokenH ill miners and their employers. I then suggested the advisableness of taking into consideration the economic circumstances of that industry. At the time, the metal market was becoming more and more buoyant. The price of lead, upon which depended tlie profitable working of the mine, had reached a figure which made it possible to re-commence operations. It was likely that the metal market would remain buoyant for a year or two, and both employers and employees were anxious to exploit it. I then suggested that when the price of lead rose, the employees should receive a share of the excess profits. The proprietors agreed to that, and the practice was adopted for the first time in the history of this counrecently, making it possible for men to do try, and so far as I know, for the only time. the price became lower? drop the same principle should apply: hut the minimum wage fixed according to the standards observed by the court should not he interfered with. touched until a show shut down? member for Denison knows that there must be a minimum wage, and that it would not be profitable to employ labour below it. By a minimum wage I mean a subsistence wage, the taking-off board from which all other rates spring. No judge in Australia had favoured the reduction of that subsistence wage under any circumstances until that principle was interfered -with hy the present Bench; hut there has been agreement with the principle that when the economic circumstances of an industry improve some share of the extra profits should be distributed among the employees. If that were done, the employees would be willing to meet the employers when conditions became bad. The onesidedness of the arrangement has been responsible for the partial failure of arbitration. The Government interfered with the principle when it caused action to be taken recently to disapprove a determination of the Public Service Arbitrator. The whole of the business life of that gentleman had heen spent in the Postal Department, and no man knew better than he the surroundings and the circumstances of the Service. All the evidence that the Public Service Board could procure was submitted to him, yet he refused to make his determination conform to the overtures that that body made to him. Then this Governmentvetoed his determination. How can arbitration he expected to become popular if Parliament vetoes decisions that are considered unsuitable? If we want arbitration to be as popular as it ought to be, we must place it on a proper and a more or less permanent basis. The system should not be altered except when drastic changes occur, such as have heen taking place twice as much in a given period witb the expenditure of an equal amount of energy. If judges are slow to meet them, governments should suggest that the time has arrived for the altered conditions to prices be reflected in their awards. But so long as Parliament, hy vetoing decisions, makes the conditions worse than those fixed by the judges, the people cannot he expected to adhere loyally to awards of the court. is hardly an appropriate occasion for a second-reading debate on the subject of arbitration. I do not agree with many of the statements that have been made by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway). Probably, it would be wrong to blame a particular section, but I am astonished at finding so rarely in the balance-sheets of big companies reference to anything in the nature of an employees' superannuation fund.

There should be no attempt to undermine the court by the methods which the Government now seeks to adopt. the Attorney-General's Department administers patents and trade marks, this seems to be an appropriate opportunity to protest against the transfer of the central office of the Patents Department from Melbourne to Canberra. It may be possible to advance good arguments in support of the expenditure of £40,000 from trust funds, and £15,000 for the removal expenses of officers; 'but I ask whether this transfer would be justified at a time when governmental expenditure is being reduced in various directions, when wages are being cut, and when we are experiencing extreme financial stress generally.

The Patents Officei n Melbourne has a famous library which, I believe, was taken over from the Government of Victoria. experts in examining patents and designs, and it would be inadvisable to isolate the department by transferring it to Canberra, where is would be out of ready touch with the business community.

My objection is to the establishment of the head-quarters of the department in splendid isolation at Canberra. That would involve a large measure of duplication of activities. I had the honour of introducing recently to Senator Massy Greene, a deputation from all the officers concerned protesting against the transfer of the Patents Office from Melbourne to Canberra. I realize how great a convenienceir, is to the manufacturing world to haveready access to the Patents Office there. convenience to Melbourne, but not toSydney. honourable members from New South Wales still show a parochial spirit. There is an efficient patents office in Sydney, and there should be no complaint on the ground that the head-quarters of the department happen to 'he in Melbourne. Sydney and Melbourne are the two big cities of Australia. capitals-Adelaide, for instance? more than 6,000,000, over 2,000,000 reside in Melbourne and Sydney. The principal patent attorneys in Melbourne have issued a circular in which many interesting facts are made known, and, in my opinion, the claims advanced by them should be answered. Their circular statesEven if the entire rents, anticipated to be received or saved by the Minister for the Interior, are regarded as net receipts, it would require at least four years for the direct cost of removal operations to be paid off. These direct costs, however, are only a small part of the ultimate expense involved.

The transfer of the department from Flinders Street to its present site retarded the running of the department for two months, and the arrears have not since then picked up. Of the staff of 78, excluding cleaners, there are 43 officers holding property rights in their homes, and the prospects of selling are negligible at the present time, and even so property values have dropped 25 per cent, to 30 per cent., which would represent an approximate loss to individual officers of at least £12,000. Present values would not in many cases cover existing liens. Thu majority of Patent applications are of an involved technical character which frequently involve personal attendances by qualified Patent Attorneys for elucidation. If tliese facilities are removed, the work of the department will be delayed and increased by extensive correspondence and possible loss of rights by inventors, apart from heavy extra expenses to the latter, and since 1030 applicants' expenses have been materially increased by the imposition of additional Government fees. For example, the fees payable to the department for Patent rights for sixteen years, have been increased from £13 to £48 10s. Great numbers of interviews occur with the Chief Clerk, apart from examiners, in connection with application to the courts and numerous otlier matters, and by this means many matters arc disposed of with consequent curtailment of expense. Thu Patents Department at present is struggling to pay its way. If removed to Canberra revenue would be decreased owing to the remote situation, and many applicants would be placed in the position of having to employ professional assistance. The Trade Marks section of the department requires to be urgently consulted by all classes of traders when adopting trade marks to bo applied to new linos of goods, and business will be largely hampered by the absence of direct contact with this section. Finally, the greater the convenience provided for the lodgement and prosecution of applications, the higher the revenue, and furthermore, manufacturers, traders generally, and inventors outside Australia, will more readily interest themselves in this country with resultant greater flow of capital into manufactures in Australia. These facts are contained in a circular published by four of the leading patent attorneys in Melbourne, and have been approved by a fifth. They are the five agents principally concerned in the location of the Patents Office, and their protest has heen reinforced by that of the whole of the staff of the office in Melbourne. Mr White.

I am making this protest mainly on the score of expense. The removal of the central office to Canberra will necessitate the establishment of another office in Melbourne, and that w ill mean duplication. The litigious aspect also must be considered. Frequently patents are infringed, wittingly and unwittingly, and when legal action is taken in Melbourne or Sydney, the case is dealt with in the ordinary courts, but if the central office is transferred to Canberra, any case of infringement w ill have to be heard by the H i g h Court unless legislation is introduced to obviate that.

The revenue for the year 1931-32 amounted to £49,000, while the estimated revenue for 1932-33 is £50,000. The excess of revenue over expenditure for 1931-32 was £7,700, and it is estimated that for 1932-33 the excess of revenue over expenditure will he £8,400. The honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) expressed opposition to the proposed transfer of the Patents Department to Canberra. May I point out to the honourable member that when Canberra was established, it was never intended that the departments here should be a mere nucleus, with larger branches in the various capital cities. Rightly or wrongly, it was intended that this should be truly a national capital for Australia. It is reasonable, therefore, that we should of 35s. a week, will return £4,000 a year. continue to develop the city, and make it a national capital in every respect, but that cannot be done if we leave some of The Scullin Governthe departments in Melbourne. It would not be fair to the public in view of the money already spent here, uor would it be fair to these private citizens who have invested capital in Canberra. In Some honourable members seeking to develop Canberra as rapidly as possible, the Government is pursuing a sound business plan, and is rendering a service to the Commonwealth as a whole by seeking to obtain a return for the taxpayers money already spent. If all the Commonwealth departments were transferred to Canberra it is probable If the transfer was too costly that before long the annual loss now incurred on Canberra would be turned into a profit. In my opinion, it is the solemn We have been told that all the duty of members of this Parliament to further the interests of the National Capital, and, instead of talking it down and decrying it on every possible occasion, they should take up the cudgels on its behalf and defend it against those who, with little information, are prepared to condemn the whole enterprise. One of the best ways of helping Canberra to become the city it was intended to he is to transfer here as soon as possible all Commonwealth departments.

The acquisition in Melbourne of homes, assuming that 25 are taken over at a cost of £1,200 each, and the actual transfer expenses of officers can all be covered for the figure I have mentioned. There is in existence a trust fund which is established in connection with the taking over of the homes of those officers already transferred to Canberra, and that fund is in credit to the extent of something like £28,000 at the present time. fund will be used in connection with the proposed transfer.

The opinion of those who are personally interested can hardly be taken as a serious contribution to a debate on what is really a national undertaking. quarters of the Patents Office is in Melbourne, and has been for years. In Sydney there is a branch office which costs not more than £750 a year to run, and serves the needs of a city of 1,250,000 inhabitants. Therefore, the citizens of Melbourne can have little real reason for complaint when it is proposed to provide for them the same facilities as are now provided in Sydney. suggest that the business people of Melbourne will be as efficiently served by a department in Canberra as they are by a department located in Melbourne? When patents are accepted, copies of the drawings and specifications are made and sent to the various patents offices, so that inconvenienced by the removal of the the Sydney office at present is able to provide practically the same convenience to the public as does the Melbourne office, except that, for the hearing of cases, the parties have to attend at Melbourne. That, however, does not occur very often. Even then, the citizens of Melbourne who will have to attend hearings at Canberra will be no worse off than are those of Sydney or Adelaide at the present time. stock the Melbourne office with hooks and records, and this will entail additional expenditure. When I was Minister for the InteriorI received a letter from a prominent firm of patent attorneys in Melbourne, whom I admire for the national view they took of this question. They said that they were one of the largest firms of the kind iri the city, but they felt that the proposed transfer was just and reasonable. They had never had occasion to apply to the head office for information which the counter as is done in Sydney. firm. The firm was G. G.

105,Mr Archdale Parkhill,"Now, Australians are favoured at present in some such "" court"" cases by visits which are paid by the Commissioner of Patents to Sydney from Melbourne, and would be paid from Canberra to Melbourne similarly at intervals when an accumulation of special matters rendered it worthwhile. Nothing of that kind is done in any other part of the world, so that our privileges here would be so great that it might fairly be said tliat we in Melbourne had never lost our Patents Office at all, but merely that part of it which comother departments which must ultimately prised chiefly the examining and governing staff. That is the view of a firm of patent attorneys which operates on a large scale. It must be clear, therefore, that very little, if any, inconvenience would result from the proposed transfer. paragraph in the letter reads as follows:We do not presume to pass' any opinion whatever upon the cost of the transfer, as we do not know, and have no data to guide us; but it is cl°sr that some very wildly exaggerated figure, a have been mentioned in the press by those who are opposed to the transfer. not propose to do so on this occasion. It does seem that the depression in the price of houses in Melbourne would lead to a loss if pre-depression prices were paid for those houses by the Commonwealth, but it may be many years before these pre-depression prices return. Surely honourable members realize that the officers of the Patents Office who may be transferred from Melbourne to Canberra are in exactly the same position as officers of banking and insurance companies, or other large institutions of this country who may be transferred from one branch of their firm to another. Unless the officers of such firms are prepared to accept transfers they must retire. It must he remembered that a number .of the officers of the Patents Department who will he transferred are near the retiring age. In their case it is hardly likely that they will transfer their families to Canberra. doubtedly, prefer to retain their Melbourne homes and live in lodgings in this city until they retire. In their case,' certainly, there will be very little difficulty in regard to properties. A great many of the public servants who were transferred to Canberra years ago, came here very reluctantly. I was in very close association with many of them while I was Minister for the Interior, and I wish to say that no people in Australia are more worthy of admiration than the people of this city for the public spirit they have shown and the manner in which they have adapted themselves to their new conditions with the object of building up a worthy national capital. The public servants who have come here have shown a truly national spirit, and are entitled to the support of this Parliament and this Government, particularly in respect to the transfer of he located in this city, in seeking to build up in Canberra a truly Australian centre with a truly Australian spirit. wish to make one or two observations on Another the speeches delivered this afternoon by the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway), and the honourable member for Hindmarsh ( Mr Makin), in regard to arbitration. In my speech in the budget debate, I dealt at some length with this subject, and I do Both of the honourable gentlemen whom I have mentioned, re-echoed the sentiment which I expressed in my budget speech to the effect that if in a time of adversity it became necessary for every one to make sacrifices to share the general loss, then the principle of sharing should be followed in a time of prosperity. I do not think that any fair minded person can do other than agree with that view. But at that point I part company with my honorahle friends. They take the view that prosperity can best be shared by means of the arbitration system. I take the view that the arbitration system prevents the sharing of prosperity. From time to time our arbitration authorities have to deal with industrial affairs of very great complexity, and they cannot do more than lay down minima. But the degree of They would, unprosperity differs considerably in various industries. The courts cannot, there for, make a common rule which will apply equitably throughout the whole field of industry. If it is desired that the sharing of prosperity shall apply in good times to offset the necessary sacrifices in bad times, that can only be done effectively by the representatives of particular industries working it out for themselves, having regard to the economic circumstances surrounding their own industry.",26,Parkhill Able To Manage Well With One Patents
106,Mr Hutchin (Denison) [4.46],"II have vainly searched through the Estimates Department of Industry. Minister for Industry, a Department of Industry, and stationery headed "" Department of Industry""; any reference in the Estimates to this -department. I am advised that the expenditure inust be included in that provided for the Attorney-General's Department, and that is my reason for referring to the matter at this point. One would expect that the Department of Industry has some staff and incurs certain expenditure ; but apparently it is not so. This Government has been in office for nearly a year. There has been any amount of time and opportunity for the Department of Industry to give some evidence that it is at work. There is ample room for such a department. present circumstances of the country, it should be one of the principal departments of the Government. A properly organized Department of Industry should have a bigger job to do than the Postmaster-General's Department or the Department of the Interior. should be second in importance only to the Department of the Treasury. I know that there is a reference in the Estimates to the Industrial Registrar, but that officer is connected with the Arbitration Court, and not with the Department of Industry. In the circumstances of to-day, when our social order is so gravely overshadowed by the serious problem of unemployment aud when industrial changes of vast significance are taking place with great rapidity, the Department of Industry should be doing important work. Scattered through our organization of government arc four principal activities which touch things industrial and things social. First, there is the Development Branch of the Prime Minister's Department, and secondly there is the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. Surely these two activities should be operating side by side, for development depends upon and is inseparable from scientific and industrial research. These two activities could be associated with great advantage to the Commonwealth. The third important aspect of industry is that which is dealt with by the Arbitratween employees and employers. I have tion Court. These are three of the four Mr Hutchin. legs upon which industry stands. The for the vote for the fourth is connected with the great We have a problem of unemployment, and it surely calls for full-time consideration and a greater degree of concentration than ever but I cannot find before. It seems to me that this problem is not being faced as it should be faced by a National Parliament. Representatives of the Commonwealth and State Governments meet at odd intervals and, as the result of their deliberations, apply to the banks for money. Presumably when this is obtained it is spent in certain directions in the relief of unemployment. AlthoughI am a member of the Commonwealth Parliament, I do not know how the money is being spent, nor what impression the spending of it is making on the unemployment situation of the Commonwealth. In this respect I suppose I am in the In fact, in the same position as other honourable members of this Parliament. This is due to the fact that this Parliament is not facing this vital issue as it is facing other important administrative acts of the Government. I have, on previous occasions, offered the suggestion that the DevelopIn fact, it ment Branch, the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, unemployment, and other cognate subjects should be regarded in proper perspective with the other problems of the Government, and dealt with in a more effective manner. Certainly the problems of unemployment demand continuous concentration, expert skill, and wise handling. There is an insistent call for a proper organization to handle these problems, and I consider that they could be effectively dealt with by a well-organized Department of Industry. I hope that the Government will give careful consideration to this suggestion. In discussing the proposed vote for the Attorney-General's Department, some honourable members have criticized the operation of our system of conciliation and arbitration. There are others who believe in the total abolition of that system, and, like the honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin), advocate what he terms the get-together movement, or a system of round-table conferences beheard honourable members support this",27,Parkhill Able To Manage Well With One Patents
107,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [4.55],"system on several occasions, when, in order to holster up their arguments, they have stated what, in their opinion, are the advantages of round-table conferences. The honourable member for Denison has told us what has occurred in connection with companies with which he has been associated. I , however, have received information from a person conversant with the conditions under which one, at least, of the firms with which the honourable member was associated conducts its operations, the Zinc Company Proprietary Limited, of which my correspondent says the honourable member for Denison is still the industrial officer. He statesThis company procured exemption from the Arbitration Court on account of its so-called co-operative activities, and the Industrial Wages Board, which consists of five representatives of the company and five employees. This board lays down that the employees must be represented by men working on the plant while the company's representatives, although working for the company, are highly trained men. I am informed that two of the represeutatives of the employers on this wages board are men with trained legal minds furtherSo far as the conferences between the men and the company are concerned they are absolutely waste of time as no matter what proposals are put forward by the works committee they can only go to the general superintendent and any advantage to the men working on the plant is at nil times turned down by him. In March of last year the company had their Zinc Industries Wages Board called together for the purpose of obtaining the 10 per cent, reduction in wages. In putting their case, they promised that if successful to keep all their men employed but as soon as their application was granted, they at once put in the pruning knife and dismissed between 300 and 4.00 men besides introducing a cruel and unnecessary system of rationing. This system operated differently in the various departments, one branch being compelled to sign a form asking for a fortnight's leave of absence, while in another department men who had served the company faithfully for ten years and more wore dismissed for one month at the end of which they were taken on as. new hands, and thereby lost their continuity of service. This latter system was applied to two employees only as it caused such unrest in the department it was operating in that the company thought it wise to alter their tactics, and so introduced scheme, or round-table conferences have the yellow form compelling the men to ask for a month's leave of absence and this continued [53] in operation until the 22nd February of this year, when one of the men refused to sign the form. His reason for refusing to sign was that on the form is a space for giving the reason why the leave of absence was required, but the man himself was not allowed to give the reason. The company took upon themselves the right to do this after the signatures of the men had been obtained. employee of the company, and 90 per cent, of the information contained in the letter is incorrect. to disclose the name of the writer; if I did so, he would be victimized next week. The letter continuesI n connection with public holidays, they do not get paid for the public holidays. Instead the company has a system of bonus leave iu which shift workers get thirteen days and day workers nine days each year. This scheme works on a sliding scale, as for instance, one man who was dismissed for a month had been in the company's employ for seven months from the date of his previous holiday to the date of dismissal, and had lost live and a half public holidays for which he got four days bonus leave. Another case is tliat of a man who was dismissed altogether and who had been in the company's employ for five months and had lost eight public holidaj's for which he received two days' leave. The honourable member has frequently stated that this system has been operating most successfully, and that there have been no disturbances of the industrial relations between the company and its employees. states thatIn regard to the wharf work at Risdon, although the men work under waterside workers' conditions, they nre deprived of the "" smoko "" which is provided for both morning and afternoon. There was a dispute with the Amalgamated Engineering Union in 1922, when the company locked them out for six weeks. They also had a dispute with the carpenters and one on the waterfront. The dispute with the Amalgamated Engineering Union was over 44 liours. There is so much discontent on the job owing to the present tactics of this company, that the employees' representatives are talking about breaking the works committee up as it ia only a farce and there are very few men working at Eisdon who do not wish to be covered by the Arbitration Court. Evidently there is not unanimity between the employers and the employees in this instance, and, the so-called get-together not achieved the success which the honourable member has suggested.

113,Mr Ward,"The writer furtherknows anything concerning the methods adopted at such conferences is aware that it is the practice of the employers to tell the employees in offering certain wages and conditions to "" take it or leave it""'. Owing to their economic conditions, the employees are compelled to accept the terms of the employers, because they realize that there are hundreds of others ready to take their places if they do not. Much can be said in opposition to our present arbitration system, especially when it happens to be one under which decisions given against the men can be upheld by the Government, and when they are against them, can he upset. In looking through the items, it is rather amusing to find that large amounts are provided to meet the cost of travelling allowances. I take it that included in the item "" travelling allowances"", a large sum is provided to meet the travelling expenses of the judiciary. item is the honourable member referring? expenses of the members of the High Court Bench, the Arbitration Court judges^ and those associated with the administration of our bankruptcy law. I have been informed that the travelling allowances of the judiciary' are included in this item. Arbitration Court judges, when determining the cases brought before them, have frequently referred to-the fall Lukin and Mr Judge Drake-Brockman in the national income, and have told the 1 workers that they must be prepared to accept reductions because other sections of the community have suffered. They have talkedof thenecessity of "" equality of sacrifice."" Iask honourable members whether the members of the judiciary should not participate in this equality of sacrifice, which they continually insist should be applied to others. Last year, when effect was being given to legislation with the object of'balancing the budget, the reduce workers' wages they go into much Government suggestedthat the members of the judiciary should, in common with other public servants, agree to the reduction of their remuneration. The .Government, realizing that the salariesof the members of the judiciary are-protectedhy the Constitution; asked them whether they would voluntarily reduce their own remuneration. Many of the judges had not the decency to reply to tlie communica1 tions sent to them. Mr Justice Lukin, who has now been transferred to the bankruptcy administration, definitely stated that he would not be prepared to agree to any reduction, and I understand that Mr Judge Drake-Brockman adopted a similar, attitude.. These are some of the men. who speak of the need of accepting equality of sacrifice to workmen who are getting only £3 10s. a week, which is the basic wage now in New South Wales. I understand that the Chief Justice of the High Court receives £3,000 a year, and the other judges of that court £2,500 a -year. In addition to that handsome remuneration, they are each allowed £2 2s. a day as travelling expenses. Mr Justice Lukin, in addition to his remuneration, receives a pension from the Queensland Government of £1,000 a year. The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN ( Mr Riordan) I ask the honourable member for East Sydney( Mr Ward) to connect his remarks with an item in the Estimates. item of travelling expenses, which includes the travelling allowances paid to judges. These gentlemen are always anxious to apply the pruning knife to others, and' to recommend equality of sacrifice, and I submit that this is an occasion on which we can, in some measure, apply it to them by reducing-the amount provided to'cover their travelling expenses. As Mr Justice were not prepared to accept voluntarily the reduction of their remuneration, we have the right to reduce their travelling allowances. not travel so much. those concerned to decide.

This is the only opporitunity honourable members have to discuss this subject.

On that occasion preliminary arrangements were made for the more effective control of the traffic in dangerous drugs, which was all too prefrom the coca tree, the growth of valent at that time; but for various reasons, the nations did not agree to the reJava-hav e valuable medicinal qualicommendations of the convention as quickly as was expected. To-day 48 nations, including Australia, have accepted them. The illicit trade in drugs threatens civilization more as the years roll by. Its control in Australia is the work of the Investigation Branch, but because of its lack of numbers, the branch is not able to do what it should in that direction. In 1931, a convention was held at Bangkok, in Siam, to which many of the nations sent representatives; but, although the convention was held so close to Australia, no representative of this country was present. An agreement made at that convention for the manufacture and disposal of opium was later ratified by the 48 countries, including Australia, which were signatories to the' League of Nations convention. In my opinion Anstralia is not discharging her obligations to the world in connection with the illicit drug trade, hecause the branch whose duty it is to police that trade is overworked. opium traffic in China lies at the door of Great Britain. Mr E. E. HARRISON -In that case, Australia should fall into Hue with Great Britain in endeavouring to rectify the wrong done by our grandfathers. Let me draw attention to the activities turers in Persia, a country not far from Australia. The Government of Persia, having a monopoly of the manufacture of opium, transferred its business to a concessionaire, who was responsible for supplying a certain quantity of opium to Vladivostock. Eor some time the normal supply of opium to Vladivostock was about 250,000 lb. per annum, but in 1930 the concessionaire concluded a contract with his principals in Vladivostock for the supply of 900,000 lb. of opium. Honourable members probably know that opium is the foundation of certain well-known drugs such as morphine and heroin. Vladivostock appears to be one of the main distributing centres for the illicit drugs which are smuggled into this country. Morphia, morphine, heroin and cocaine, -the last named being produced which is confined almost entirely to ties; they are good friends but bad masters. The ruin caused hy their illegitimate use among civilized people is paralleled only by the damage they cause in less civilized communities, where the native population has followed the bad example set by the supposedly civilized white population. The figures I have given in respect of Vladivostock show a surplus of 650,000 lb. of opium entering Vladivostock through the agency of this Persian concessionaire, hut not all of that opium was consumed in the region surrounding Vladivostock, for the downtrodden population of that region could not afford to buy so much of this expensive drug. Vladivostock is the entrepot from which morphia, heroin and the other derivatives of opium are smuggled into Australia. Notwithstanding the menace of this illicit drug trade, our Investigation Branch, which is supposed to police the traffic, comprises only 27 officers. In my opinion, we are only playing with this danger, and while we are playing, some of our citizens are being ruined. Only within the last day or two we read in the Sydney newspapers of the arrest of two Chinamen in Sydney who had cocaine concealed on them. We do not know how many others engaged in the traffic have escaped arrest. Those enof the opium manufacgaged in smuggling opium into Australia do not trade in large quantities, and the work of the Investigation Branch is thereby rendered much more difficult, because small parcels of drugs are so easily concealed. Various methods of evading detection are practised; drugs are placed in the big ends of engines, in the soles of boots, and in the double bottoms and water tanks of vessels trading to Australia. The enormous profits made hy those engaged in the traffic compensate them for the risk involved. The drugs, which are. imported in a highly concentrated form, are sold to the unfortu-",31,Parkhill Able To Manage Well With One Patents
124,Mr Wakd,"The responsibility for thenate addicts greatly adulterated. The drugs act as a temporary stimulant; but, unfortunately, when their effect has worn off, the poor addict is left in a more depressed state than before. Other countries are making an earnest attempt to deal with this problem. The principal manufacturing countries of Europe are making a definite attempt to control the manufacture and distribution of drugs, and their example could well be followed by Australia. The last recorded figures show that the principal drug manufacturing countries reduced their production of drugs during the four years 1926 to 1930 by 68,000 lb. in the case of morphine; by 7,700 lb. in the case of heroin, and by 10,000 lb. in the case of cocaine. Their action was a most effective step in the right direction. Germany and France, which are among the principal drug manufacturing nations, made an even better contribution to the control of this traffic than the figures indicate, as is evidenced by the following table showing the production of drugs in those countries:1926. lb. Morphine Heroin Cocaine .. 4,400 .. 1,400 1926. lb. lb. Morphine Heroin Cocaine Despite all the care exercised in policing circumstances which I have related, it is, the traffic in narcotics and other drugs, I submit, the duty of all governments in the principal manufacturing countries Australia to take more active measures to have been forced to admit that during control this pernicious traffic. the period I have mentioned 4,750 lb. of morphine aud 4,000 lb. of heroin "" escaped "".

HARRISON I have not been able to obtain any figures to show that the illicit use of drugs is on the increase in Australia; but from inquiries which I have made from responsible and reputable people, it would appear that the habit is growing.

The Commonwealth Investigation Branch and the customs officials in New South Wales are doing excellent work to confine it to the firms which handle this class of trade, and I believe that the traffic in cocaine is now restricted to a number of reputable firms. There is, however, one matter to which I desire to direct attention, namely, the regulations dealing with the sale of local anaesthetics in Australia. As many of these anaesthetics contain approximately only 1 per cent, of cocaine, and are in a solution, the formula of which includes antiseptics and antidotes, the regulations governing their sale are a source of irritation to those firms which have to deal in the drug, and are unnecessary, as their sale is confined to doctors and dentists only. I am informed tliat this solution will not do harm; that although it might induce sickness in the person taking it, it is not likely to make him a drug addict. Therefore, the regulations might very well be rescinded. I compliment the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. E. Harrison) upon the interesting information which he has given to the committee concerning the extent of the traffic in drugs and the measures taken to control it. I disagree with the honorahle member for South Sydney( Mr Jennings) that 1 per cent, of cocaine in a local anaesthetic is not injurious. My view of the matter is that cocaine is most insidious in its effect upon the person taking it, so much so that doctors using it would do well not to inform their patients. We are all familiar with the known evils of the opium trade. On my last visit to JapanI saw, in one of the islands at which the vessel touched, opium being smoked publicly in a place licensed by the British Government. Gaming also was permitted there. We haA'e good reason to blush when we recall the history of the opium trade. Its introduction to China in opposition to the wishes of the Emperor and his advisers was the cause of a most awful war, in which thousands of men, women, and children suffered terribly. For man; years the profits from, the opium trade played an important part in balancing Indian budgets. Luckily those days are passing, and soon I hope to see traffic in opium completely abolished. The debates in the Swiss Parliament reveal the fact that England was rather dilatory in following the lead of other nations in putting down this pernicious trade, but I am glad to know that the Mother Country has seen the error of her ways, and that the crusade against drug traffic in all its forms is now being conducted on a wide front throughout the world. I hope that the Minister for Health( Mr Marr), for whom I have the highest esteem, will take up this matter, and see what further action can be taken to check the illicit sale of drugs in Australia. Deaths in this country from small-pox or the plague are comparatively unknown because of the measures taken to prevent the introduction of those contagious diseases. I remember only one case of death from plague in Victoria. This trifling mortality was due, in no small measure, to the excellent work done by the late Dr. Creswell, who, for many years, was chairman of the Victorian Board of Public Health. I should like to see the Commonwealth Health Department give more attention to the general health of the people, and especially to he more active in checking the awful drug trafficI know that a good deal of this class of trade is being carried on in Sydney.

In Queensland a State employee acts as Official Receiver, and in other States federal employees do that work. I understand that the New South Wales officer is over 12 years of age. Although he is not a Commonwealth public servant, he is being paid by the Commonwealth Government, and the rule of the Public Service relating to retirement at the age of 65 years ought to apply to him. I appeal to the Government to reconsider the case of those public servants on less than the basic wage who, since the deanomalies exist in the administration of cision of the Public Service Arbitrator was upset, have suffered a cost of living deduction under the last Financial Emergency Act. If the Government is determined to adhere to its decision not to allow the award of the Arbitrator, these officers should not have those extra pounds deducted from their salaries. Exemption should be granted also in the case of those who receive the basic wage, but have dependants. That is the case with married men. Whether married or single, if an officer over 21 years of age has dependants or receives less than the basic wage, he should not suffer the cost of living deduction recently made. sideration of the suggestion that the headquarters of the High Court of Australia it is to expect to make this city a really national capital.

The details of the proposal have only to be mentioned to show what a hopeless sacrifice would be involved. ringah-Postmaster-General) [5.52] The honourable member for Denison( Mr Hutchin) elaborated to some extent this afternoon views that he expressed on a former occasion. I undertake to bring them to the notice of the Attorney General. The question of holding sittings of the High Court at Canberra is being considered by the Attorney-General and the officers of his department. There are many difficulties associated with the matter, an important one being that of securing juries if public servants are exempt from acting in that capacity.

That is the only information I am able to give the committee at this stage; but I give an assurance that a record is being taken of the matters on which I am unable to enlighten honourable members, which will receive the attention of the Attorneyfrom the Secretary to the Department of General( Mr Latham). The honourable member for Perth also referred to the Conciliation Commissioner, Mr CoDeybeer. It is difficult to assess the value and extent of this gentlebers, as he should have had the informaman's activities, as they do not receive publicity; but I know that his predecessor, Mr Stewart, did most valuable work when he occupied the office, and I am informed that Mr Coneybeer is performing work that is of considerable importance to the community. The act provides for the appointment of conciliation commissioners, whose duty it is to endeavour to prevent industrial disturbances, and I am confident that the appointment of Mr Coneybeer is justified. the salary paid to the Public Service Arbitrator which, I understand, is approximately £2,200. Will the Minister enlighten me on the point? salary of the Public Service Arbitrator is £1,554 per annum. Proposed vote agreed to.

I gave details when I spoke on the subject during the budget debate, and, if I do not receive a satisfactory explanation from the Minister, I intend to move for a reduction of the vote. This year, when only £963,000 is to be expended on new works and 'buildings, there are 32 architects on the staff, while during the years 1926 to 1930, when the expenditure on new works and buildings averaged £6,533,690, the average numher of architects employed was 58£. In reply to my statement, the Minister for that a number of these architects were engaged on work for the Commonwealth Bank which is not shown in the Estimates. I replied that architects were doing similar work during 1926-27, to which the Minister responded that the agreement between the Commonwealth Bank and the Government had not then been entered into."" The committee should at least receive accurate information from the Minister. I have made inquiries the Interior, and find that the agreement with the bank was made in October, 1925, which indicates that the Minister was deliberately misleading honourable memtion at his disposal. I shall be glad to learn exactly what work was done for each of the years I have mentioned, so that it may be compared with the work that is contemplated during the present financial year. I question whether the retention of such a considerable staff is justified. I have no desire to select the architects for special attack. So far as I am aware, I do not know one of them. I merely desire to ascertain whether the department is over-staffed. At page 102, there is an item "" Telephone service, including installation, rent, calls, extension, repair and maintenance, £3,330,"" which /elates to telephone service provided in the federal members' rooms in the various States. Recently, in answer to a question, I obtained details of this expenditure, and, by calculating the aggregate number of honourable'members and honourable senators, I was able to determine the comparative expenditure for the representatives of the various States. I have not the exact figures of expenditure, but the comparison between New South Wales and Victoria is as 18 is to 12; between New South Wales and Queensland as 18 is to 5; between New South Wales and South Australia as 18 is to 2£; between New South Wales and Western Australia as 18 is to 3; and between New South Wales and Tasmania as 18 is to 1.

Moreover, the printed estimates do not reflect the total eApenditure hy the works and services branch of the department, as a great deal of work is carried out on behalf of other administrations, notably the Commonwealth Bank, the Repatriation Commission, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, &c. In addition, during the past two years, large amounts have been made available for unemployment relief works, which are not shown in the Estimates. With regard to works carried out for outside administrations, the department is being paid fees in respect of such expenditure amounting to 6 per cen't. on the cost of construction. During the year 1931-32, a sum of approximately £31,000 was received in respect of such fees, and the estimated receipts for 1932-33 total £18,000. In considering the staff required for a given amount of expenditure, attention must be given to the character of the works included in such expenditure. The programme of works for the current financial year involves an outlay of approximately £750,000. devoted to one building scheme, three or / four architects would be sufficient. An analysis of the programme, however, indicates that the major portion of the amount will be spent on a multiplicity of small works, additions, alterations, repairs, and maintenance, averaging in cost from £100 to £200. approximately 400 jobs of this character, widely distributed in the metropolitan and country areas throughout the Commonwealth, many of them being in remote localities. specifications, plans in many cases, and supervision, practically all of which must be carried out locally, thus requiring a relatively greater number of architects than if the work were concentrated in one locality. The technical staff of this branch has been closely reviewed by the Public Service Board and the department, and the position has been examined in relation to the standard rates of 6 per cent, and 10 per cent, charged by outsida authorities for the designing and supervision of works. After considering theSuch services cost of the works staff, as against thevalue of all services performed, it has been established that the staff is now on, a sound financial basis, and is profitably employed. In regai'd to the case of the two architects in South Australia, it is advised that the territory covered by the South Australia branch includes the Northern Territory up to Newcastle Waters. Apart from the completion of certain buildings at Stuart, and the ordinary maintenance items for South Australia and the Northern Territory, involving £15,000, this year's programme includes £3,000 specially made available from the unemployment relief funds for Commonwealth works; a further £1,000 in prospect towards the cost of new quarters for excise officers at Renmark, Berri and Reynella; and the Estimates provide £3,258 for three cottages for lighthousekeepers at Kingston, and £1,400 for new postal works. It is considered that there is ample work to justify the employment of the two architects referred to. It may be mentioned that the number of architects quoted by the honourable member as having been employed did not include temporary architects, of whom quite a number were engaged in the earlier years. If this were The services of these temporary officers have now been dispensed with. The number of permanent and temporary architects employed during the financial years 1926-27 to 1932-33, and the amount of salary paid, may be seen from the following table:' There are Financial Number of Yeiir.

From the information that I have given, the honorahle member will realize that he arrived at erroneous conclusions regarding this matter. The honourable member for Angas also complained about the cost of the telephone service at the federal members' rooms in the capital cities, particularly Sydney and Melbourne. I have not had time to analyse the figures; but it seems natural to presume that the Sydney and Melbourne figures would, on the average, exceed those of other States. At almost any week-end, numerous telephone calls are made from the members' rooms in Melbourne by members from Tasmania, South Australia, and Western Australia. Naturally, members make more long distance calls when they are absent from their own States than at any other time, and it is not surprising that the cost of members' calls is greater in Melbourne and Sydney, which are the two nearest capital cities to Canberra, than in any of the other State capitals. It should be remembered that the cost of members' telephone calls is mainly a matter of bookkeeping, the expense actually incurred by the Government heing very small. After all the majority of them relate to matters of public business. Possibly, in a few instances, members telephone to their relatives in distant States. It seems The Christmas season is approaching, to me that the total sum involved is not unduly large, and, as I have said, it is mainly attributable to calls made by members in the course of their parliamentary duties. It would be poor economy to prevent members from using the telephone service when dealing with matters of public importance.

One naturally concludes that architects are employed to do architectural work; apparently that is not so, and if other items are equally misleading it is impossible for a private member to criticize with assurance the expenditure of any department. plains why most members do not bother to analyse the expenditure, hut prefer to talk at large on general subjects. I give the present Postmaster-General( Mr Parkhill) credit for having, when in charge of the Department of the Interior, effected many economies, but a study of the figures suggests that the Scullin Government must have been exceedingly lax. 1 find that in 1931-32 the expenditure on new £832,622, and 49 architects were employed, whereas this .year the estimated expenditure is only £963,000 and 32 architects are employed. Apparently, although the expenditure this year is not considerably greater, the number of architects engaged has been reduced by seventeen. The figures for the last seven financial years have beenYear. £ 1020-27 1027-28 1928-2!) . 0,249,598 .. 58 1929-30 1930-31 1931-32 1932-33 Por the four years 1926-27 to 1929-30 the average expenditure was £6,533,690, and the average number of architects employed was 58£; yet this year, when the expenditure is estimated to be only £963,000, the number of architects employed is 32. I do not agree that the expenditure of £963,000 necessitates the employment of 32 architects, because in 1918-19 only nine architects were employed for an expenditure of £1,490,523, and, in 1919-20, thirteen architects for an expenditure of £1,598,188. I used to think that the statements issued by the Taxpayers Association regarding the overstaffing of public departments was so much eyewash, but the fact that, in a time of depression, although the expenditure ou new works and buildings has that decreased since 1926-27 by 600 per cent., the professional staff has not been proportionately retrenched, suggests that there is some justification for the criticism by that body. I do not' say that all government services are overstaffed; I know that some, including the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Office at Perhaps that exAdelaide, are undermanned. I am not satisfied with the Minister's explanation of these Estimates, nor with what he said regarding the public works to be carried out in South Australia. stated that the programme in that State includes three houses for excise officers, three cottages for lighthouse-keepers, and postal works costing £1,400.

One of them posed as a Nationalist organizer and the other as a Labour organizer, and by this means were able to capture 1,500 Labour votes in the divisions of Oxley and Brisbane, 600 being in Oxley. On Poppy Day, which occurred while the election campaign was in progress, one wore a poppy and posed as the Labour canvasser, while the other, garbed in black, represented herself as being the canvasser for the Nationalist party. They interviewed sick people who, in many instances, did not know who was standing for election, and did not even wish to vote. If it was found that the elector ""was really enthusiastic about voting, the interviewer posed as an organizer of the party which the elector supported. It may be contended that both sides indulged in this practice, but the Nationalists alone have sufficient funds to keep paid organizers at work continuously. They keep their lists up to date, and revise them when an election is looming. In this way they know who is likely to be .exercising postal votes at the next election. able to get right off the mark as soon as an election comes round, thus gaining an advantage over their rivals.

I am anxious to obtain this information because I know that these men are anxious to carry out their work without being harassed by these officers. We do not want a repetition of the slashing of wages and conditions that recently occurred in Great Britain. Mr MoNICOLL (Werriwa) [9.10] I cannot subscribe to the views expressed by the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), that the average Australian is a person who demands, desires, or acquires a form of discipline different from that exercised over British soldiers or sailors. From my youth, I have been associated with defence matters, and in recent years, in common with many other honourable members, I have had a full opportunity to judge and have had a close knowledge of the Australian under arms. It is ridiculous to say that Australians are not amenable to discipline or demand other conditions. That sort of talk has caused a good deal Honourable members have just had placed in their hands an explanatory statement of the estimates of expenditure prepared under the direction of the Minister for Defence. It is useless to place such a document in our hands just when the defence estimates come up for consideration. This step is in keeping with the action of the Government in bringing down three pages of printed amendments when the last Financial Emergency Bill was under consideration, and at the same time applying the guillotine. tice since the inception of federation. the less reprehensible. Included in those amendments was one dealing with a subject concerning which I wish to speak to-night, the reduction of the pay of the members of the Commonwealth naval, military and air forces. Perhaps this assurances that were given to me in connection with those amendments, but issued two days ago show that, in spite of the assurances then given, there have heen substantial cuts in the military, and air forces as the result of the passage of the Financial Emergency Act. In speaking on the defence estimates generally, I wish to refer to the salaries. On a previous occasion when I referred to the pay of the lower ratings in the Navy, I think that the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) and the members of his party agreed with me that when these men came ashore some of them were worse off than the unemployed man in the city who is in receipt of the dole and child endowment. I asked how discipline could be maintained under those conditions. I wish now to refer more particularly to the organization of the Defence Department. There are other honourable members ,in this chamber who are as well acquainted with the position as I am.

206,Mr Monicoll,"That makes it nonedeductions under the Financial Emergency Act, the secretary to the department receives £1,550, the ControllerGeneral of Munitions, £1,550, and the Defence Liaison Officer, £2,000, which is probably not subject to the deduction mentioned. The remuneration of these gentlemen should be compared with that of the permanent highly-trained specialists in the naval, military, and air forces. For instance, the admiral commanding the squadron receives £1,460 a year, the Chief of the General Staff, £1,163 per annum; the Air Commodore, commanding the Air Force, £1,085; the Adjutant-General, £920; and the Quartermaster-General, £960. The Base Commandant and commanders of divisions receive £8S0 per annum. If we are to have a defence force at all-and in view of the present condition of the world, thinking men and women agree that the present force should be increased-it is absurd to offer inadequate remuneration to the senior trained men. This is a matter which affects, not only the present occupants of senior positions, but also the younger men who will be required to take their places in the future. I am somewhat curious about the defence liaison officer at a salary of £2,000 per annum to whom reference has been made. I should like the Minister, who himself has a distinguished war record, to tell us who this defence liaison officer is, what military training he has had, what he does for his salary of £2,000 per annum, and how many such officers we have had in London. Certain officers of the Defence Department have, I understand, undertaken a course of military science extending over a period of two years. Are they military officers; what becomes of them when they return to Australia, and are they permanently available for service with the Defence Department? On page 119 of the Estimates, provision is made for the salaries of thirteen clerks in the central administration, and on page 161 for a further 81 clerks. Does each of these clerks carry in his lunch bag the baton of a future defence liaison officer, or that of some other high officer who should be a properly secondly, to increase its efficiency and trained naval or military expert? The Ordnance Department, to which I referred last week, is manned largely by Mr MoNiooll. civilians; and as they do not work on Saturdays, thsj Defence Department has actually to arrange its camps of training and bivouacs so as not to interfere with the civilians who issue the stores for the camps. Many units going into camp have to enlist volunteers from their own ranks to go into camp a day ahead of the main body in order to obtain stores on a day when the Ordnance Department is pleased to remain open. These positions should he held by enlisted men so that when the military requirements have to be met, they will be there to do the job. Provision is made for 30,000 officers and men to receive militia training. That is not a sufficient number. In the opinion of those who have heen watching the trend of affairs in Australia it would be a good thing if universal military training were re-established in the interests of our young men themselves. I have thought recently that the five honourable members sitting on my right, belonging to the Beasley-Lang group, would be the better for a period of compulsory training, so that in the event of war breaking out, their value to the country would be increased. wishes to use us as gun fodder. member would be sure of a permanent and comparatively safe appointment to the regimental concert party. There is a welcome increase in some of the votes. The sum of £10,000 is now provided for camps, and £5,000 for the maintenance of arms; but the increases are small in comparison with requirements. This is not a time when suggestions for raising salaries or increasing expenditure are popular. For some time we have done nothing but cut down expenditure; we have reduced even the pensions of invalids and the infirm. Our financial position may be serious; but we cannot afford not to increase our defence vote. Since a private member may not move to increase expenditure, I desire to ask the Government to do two things-first , to re-organize the Defence Department, and extend its operations. Not one of us wishes for another war, but we cannot shut our eyes to disquieting facts. In",47,Department Of Defence

Nor should we rely on help from the Old Country, to which we already owe so much, notwithstanding that at times that country is reviled by certain honourable members. I hope that the Government realizes the necessity for extending and expanding our defence forces to the fullest extent. If we are to have a navy or an army, there must necessarily be discipline, but often it is not easy to distinguish between services of this country. We have granted discipline and brutality. The remarks of the honourable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley) concerning HMAS. Australia remind me of a case of brutality which occurred on HMAS. Brisbane when that vessel was sent to the Pacific Islands to suppress some trouble on one of the islands. expedition the crew had good reason to complain of the quality of the food supplied to the men. One of them, a stoker, gave pleasure to officers and men alike by his bright and witty writings in the ship's paper until he wrote a few verses in which he complained of the quality of the food. His remarks were somewhat strong, but the treatment ho received was out of all proportion to the offence. After his case had been referred to in this House the captain of the Brisbane, for some unexplained reason, was returned to the British Navy. The stoker's offence did not justify his being imprisoned over the latrines in the tropics, nor should his wife have been deprived of the allowance to which she was entitled. When the vessel returned to Sydney he was placed in gaol, and from that day he and his wife and children have practically starved, because he' has been unable to obtain employment in his own country. If that, is discipline, as exercised in the navy, it is no wonder that enlistments are so few. Even now, I ask the Minister to see that justice is done to this young Australian. these things happened. his dependants have been practically starving ever since. been done, and the Government should endeavour to make amends. If we want to encourage Australian boys to join the navy, it should be an all-Australian navy as was the case previously. I have mentioned this matter in the hope that something will be done to compensate this man for the brutal treatment to which he was subjected. The department still holds money owing to him. Instead of subsidizing aero clubs, those engaged in the carrying of air mails should be assisted. No better training for a future war could be obtained than that gained in conducting the air mail subsidies to two air mail companies at the rate of £94,000 per annum. Of 117 aeroplane owners only 37 are subsidized. Only seven aeroplanes are owned by these two companies, which are drawing subsidies ranging from 200 per cent, to 1,000 per cent, on the contractors' gross earnings. On that During the last ten years the cost to the Commonwealth for the carriage of Australian air mails has been £20,000 per.ton. Eor this we have toblame the Bruce Page Government, which made these contracts. One company in Western Australia has benefited to the extent of £500,000. It is time that the whole of our air mail services were co-ordinated, so that, with the development of civil aviation, we shall also be building up an efficient air force for defence purposes.

Admiral Hyde has since informed me that, upon the vessel's return, he discussed are on loan from the Royal Navy, and these the matter with the senior officer of the ship, and has assured me that the whole story is a fabrication; that the ratings were quite happy, and did their work loyally and faithfully. It appears that there was some fear that, under the Financial Emergency Act, further substantial reductions of the pay and allowances of the lower ratings would be effected; but I am pleased to be able to state that, there has been no reduction since this Government took office. Unfortunately, certain reductions of pay and allowances were made under the regime of the previous Administration. made under the Financial Emergency Bill, which the Minister and his friends supported. honourable member conveyed the impression that such reductions had been made by this Government under its financial emergency legislation, and, as I have explained, they were not. Concerning -the references to RearAdmiral Hyde, the First Naval Member, all I need say is that he is Australian born, was specially appointed to, and received his early training in the Royal Navy, and after some years service in the Royal Australian Navy on loan, was transferred permanently to the Commonwealth service in 1912. He has served in our navy ifi peace and in war, has risen to the highest position which the Australian service has to offer, and may be trusted to uphold the best traditions of the Royal Navy, and of the Royal Australian Navy. Australia are not Australian-born. ber for West Sydney also referred to the personnel of the Royal Australian Navy. On this point I refer him to the explanatory statement on the Estimates of expenditure for this year prepared by the direcnew era of prosperity in Australia, so tion of the Minister. On page 4 of that document he will find the following information :Fulfilment of the policy of building up an RearAustralian personnel for the Royal Australian Navy is progressing satisfactorily.

Every one admits that the present state of our defence services is unsatisfactory; but, as I have explained, we are governed by considerations of finance. I am quite certain that the Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce) wishes to see the three arms of our defence system brought back to the excellent standard which they had attained in 1929, before drastic economies were made by the previous Administration. Unfortunately, that will not be possible until the financial position improves.

225,( Mr Mcnicoll) Referred To The Abolition,"sacred obligations which are imposed on ns to make our defence system adequate for our needs. With regard to the position of "" defence neglected opportunities which were avaih liaison officer in London,"" I would point out that the work formerly done by .senior ofiicers of the Defence Department is now being carried out by Mr Trumble. As honourable members are aware, it was necessary, for financial reasons, to return those officials to Australia. Mr Trumble, who has had extensive experience in an administrative capacity in the Defence Department, is being assisted in liaison work by junior ofiicers from the three arms of our defence forces. The honourable member for Newcastle ( Mr Watkins) again mentioned the case of an ex-naval stoker. He has repeatedly discussed this matter in this House since 192S, when the offence for which the stoker was punished occurred. then there have been two or three changes of government, and successive Ministers for Defence have examined the files. I also have done so, and I am satisfied that the procedure followed was the correct one. The ex-stoker was charged under the naval regulations with an offence to the prejudice of good order and naval discipline, his offence being the typing of poetry, the subject-matter of which was subversive to naval discipline. All the facts of the case are to be found in Mansard. The charge was investigated by the captain of the ship in the ordinary service way. The accused, exercising his rights, selected an officer to assist him, and also called and examined witnesses. The captain found the charge proved, and, under the authority vested in him by the Australian Naval Defence Act, he sentenced the stoker to 90 days imprisonment and recommended his dismissal from the service. The Naval Board reviewed the evidence, and confirmed the sentence, except that discharge was substituted for dismissal. The discontinuance of sustenance to the ex-rating's wife was a consequential penalty of the punishment of imprisonment or detention during which a rating may not be borne for pay. His discharge was ordered by the Naval Board in accordance with the authority -vested in it by the naval regulations. As I have said, the offence for which the -stoker was punished occurred in 1928, so it would appear that the honourable member for Newcastle, who now appears to be anxious to have the case re-opened, able to him for at least two years, during which time a Labour Government was in power. I know that at the time the Minister for Defence investigated the charge thoroughly, and I am convinced, from my own study of the files, that former Ministers gave this matter very careful consideration, satisfied themselves that the charge had been proved and that everything had been done in accordance with the regulations. the captain sent Home shortly after the inquiry was held? in the Australian Navy expired, and, in accordance with the usual procedure, he Since rejoined the British Navy. The honourable member for Newcastle also read a circular communication which honourable members have received dealing with civil aviation, and urged that our air mail services should be developed with a view to the training of air pilots for the Royal Australian Air Force. A sub-committee of experts appointed by the Disarmament Conference to draw up rules to govern civil aviation has included in its report a recommendation that the high contracting parties should refrain from requiring that civil aviation enterprises shall employ personnel specially trained with a view to their employment for military purposes. There must be a definite distinction between tlie two air services. The Government arranged for an interdepartmental committee to make a thorough investigation into all aspects of aviation matters in Australia, with a view to determining its future policy, and that committee has made its report to the Minister. He is now considering the question, .and at a very early date will bring the matter before the Cabinet, which will formulate a policy covering civil aviation generally, including the carriage of mails by air. Tho majority of our contracts or arrangements with the companies that carry air mails expire early next year, and the new policy will provide 'for a system that I am sure",50,Department Of Defence
226,Mr Watkins,"If that is so, why was",51,Department Of Defence
227,Mr Francis,"His term of servicewill meet with the approval of all honourable members. The provision for the development of civil aviation is £102,930, made up of subsidies for aerial mail services, £93,451; grants to aero clubs, £8,600; and miscellaneous services, £S79. For some considerable time a proposal to link ,up with Imperial Airways in an all-air route to Great Britain has heen discussed, and evidence on the subject has been taken by a committee in Australia. A proposition has been made by three Australian companies, two of which are at present drawing subsidies from the Commonwealth-Qantas and Westralian Airways Limited. The third company concerned-Australia n National Airwayscarried on for some time a satisfactory service between Brisbane and Sydney. These companies appear to consider that they are entitled to all the plums in connection with civil aviation in Australia. New England Airways took over the service between Brisbane and Sydney that was relinquished by Australian National Airways, and at present are providing a daily service between those cities. At no time has the Government been asked for a subsidy by this company; it has carried on the service purely and simply as a commercial venture. I do not wish to anticipate the result of the inquiry that has been conducted, but, considering the length of time that it occupied, it is difficult to understand why the rather vague statement was made only the other day that it is likely to be some time before the Australian public will learn the nature of the report that has been presented to the Government. I should like the Minister to allay the fear that was expressed by an honourable member, that civil aviation may pass into the control of the three companies to which I have referred, two of which are already well subsidized. There are other companies and concerns connected with civil aviation which deserve consideration. It is thought likely that the Imperial Airways route will embrace a subsidized service between Sydney and Brisbane. I suggest that in no circumstances should the New England company, which has carried on a daily service without leaning on the taxpayers of Australia, be pushed on one side and displaced by other companies, one of which unfortunately found it necessary to cease operations. The explanatory statement placed in the hands of honourable members tonight, dealing with the department's estimates of expenditure, gives one cause for a good deal of disquietude, and makes one realize how totally inadequate are our defence forces. I do not propose to go over ground already covered by the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. F. Harrison) in the very able speech that he delivered on the budget. Although that speech has received a fair degree of publicity, it should he distributed much more 'widely, because it was the utterance of a gentleman who is thoroughly acquainted with the subject. I commend the honourable member for having drawn attention to the very serious state into which our defences have fallen. Some honourable members may hold different views. One would expect, after listening to the puerile speech of the houorable member for West Sydney( Mr Beasley), who knows nothing about war, and has no intention of learning anything about it, that if an enemy invaded Australia, the honourable member would get up on a soap box and 33k it to return home.

If we Keep the survey ship in reserve, we shall lose a highly trained personnel, the like of which it is difficult to obtain. During the coming year, as well as in the future, at least one survey ship should be kept continually in commission. It is a very necessary portion of our naval work. The fact that it is beneficial to our commercial relationships should appeal to the militant pacifists in our midst. I understand that, after graduation, the cadets of Flinders naval base cannot all be absorbed in the Navy. They receive an excellent educational and naval training at the public expense, and if they canuot be absorbed in positions for which they have been definitely trained., they Bhould be transferred to some other branch of the Commonwealth Service to which they would be a decided acquisition. At their age they are f a r better equipped educationally than the average person admitted to the Public Service. I was perturbed to read in the explanatory notes the following paragraph, under the heading, "" Naval Stores"" Owing to the adverse financial position, it ""West Sydney( Mr Beasley), the Minister will still uot be possible to maintain normal stated that the lower ratings of the Navy stocks of naval stores, purchases of which will continue to be made on the present reduced basis.

Originally, that disturbance concerned only China and Japan, but it is extremely possible that other nations, possibly including Australia, w ill be involved. the comparatively minor incident of Serajevoi n 1914, which led to a world conflagration. It is quite conceivable that a spark may be dropped into the powder magazine of Manchuria, and that before we know where we are, we shall be involved in another tremendous conflict. In view of that possibility, it is alarming to read the comment to which Years of I have referred.

237,Mr Hutchin,"I am advised that of the Defence Department, more particularly because of the statement of the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. E. Harrison) that the Scullin Government of which E, as Minister for Defence, was a member, had wrecked the defence policy of Australia. slightest objection to :;:.y honourable member holding vici'"" ? d.i>-.rent from mine , < with regard to the method of defence necessary to maintain the safety of Australia, but I do object to any honourable member questioning the patriotism of others just because his political views differ from theirs. The honourable member statedBut through the policy of the last Government, a highly efficient force was converted of officers to keep in operation the same into a mere skeleton. That imposed a tremendous hardship upon enthusiastic soldiers and they felt the rebuff keenly. For reasons best known to themselves the members of tlie last Ministry had no sympathy with the profession of arms. That is not the true position. The honourable member for Bendigo may have persuaded himself that that was the attitude of the Scullin Government towards defence, hut I can assure him that one of the principal planks of the platform to which the Labour party is pledged, is the effective defence of Australia. When Minister for Defence, I spent a great deal of time, as the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White) knows, in visiting drill halls in the capital cities of Australia to ascertain how our youths were faring nnder the voluntary system introduced by the Labour Government, and to encourage them. I personally had nothing against the Defence Department; I wanted' to help it, and I wish, at this stage, to pay a tribute to a number of its officers, who worked hard indeed in assisting the Labour Government to make a success of the voluntary system. the present Government has not interfered with that system is evidence that it has not brought about the great disaster that was prophesied by the present Minister, the honourable member for Balaclava, and others at the time of its institution. the honourable member for Bendigo supports, is spending on defence even less than the Scullin Government spent. I find no fault with that, because of the need for economy. But the point Mr A. Green. is that the honourable member has raised no protest in this chamber against the action of the present Government in continuing the defence policy instituted by a Labour government. The honorahle member said that the defence forces had I have not the been reduced to less than 30,000 men. The Labour Government's aim was to have a defence force of 35,000 men. We consulted the Council of Defence, the head of which was Sir John Monash, who, I say with all due deference to other soldiers in Australia, was the greatest soldier that this country hasever produced. He helped us to framethe scheme of defence which exists to-day. and which has for its object the employment and training of an adequate number number of units as were then in existence. The honourable member also said that: the Labour party when in power seemed determined to depreciate the soldier. I challenge the honourable member to pointto any action on the part of myself or my successor, Mr Chifley, which would justify him in making such a statement.. The honorahle member further statedWe have been told that by giving a man. a rifle and a uniform he can be made an integral and useful part of an army. The attitude of the Scullin Government was illustrated by the "" p r u n in g "" of the liaison officers at Australia House. The"" pruning "" of the liaison officers in London was carried out on the recommendation of the Defence Department itself, and it is now fully recognized, even by this Government, that the duties which were previously carried out by those officers are now heing successfully carried out by a civilian who has considerable ability. The difficulty in thrDefence Department is that various technical officers hold divergent views as to the arm upon which the safety Australia mainly The fact that depends. One officer will say that the most important is the military arm, and of course the naval and the air force officers will contend that the respective services with which they are concerned are the most vital. I refer the honourable member for Bendigo, who has had considerable experience in military matters, This Government, which to the experiments which have been carried out by the air force of the United States of America under Mr Mitchell, an air force expert, who has claimed that warships are now chained to the beach because of the ease with officers was very different from that which they can be destroyed by aerial supplied by the honourable member in his torpedoes. Sir John Monash informed speech, and I leave him to reconcile his me that this dispute as to the importance arguments with the facts that I have of the different defence arms was taking presented. In the year 1930-31, the goplace in every country in the world. It vernment with which I was associated was even taking place in India at the reduced the expenditure on defence by time of his visit there.

Scullin Government, when it took office, General Hutton in Victoria under the was faced with a deficit of £20,000,000, voluntary system, and I well remember and with the prospect of a deficit of his saying that we should watch the £40,000,000 at the end of the Russians. To-day we are watching next unfortunately £700,000,000 on the European war. That that is now being carried out in that expenditure represents the major portion country. I have seen something of miliof our total debt of £1,100,000,000. tarism as we have knowu it in Europe, Because of the war expenditure, Australia and as we had a taste of it in Australia and other countries are now faced with during the last war, and it is certainly serious financial problems. Australia is a thing that we should avoid as far as the finest country on God's earth, yet it practicable. The honourable member for has 400,000 people unemployed.

241,Mr A. Geeen,"We may dismissHe also remarked that mine-fields had been laid off Gabo Island. I was not surprised to hear that German vessels had laid a few mines; not even Australia could have hoped to escape from the danger from that source. I know that enemy cruisers laid many mines in the China seas when I was there during the war: But if every man in Australia were armed to the teeth, and the expenditure on defence were ten times as great as it now is, such things would happen. The honourable member also observed that it was probable that in the next war, Australians would see bloodshed in their own country. That may be the honourable member's opinion, but the advice given to me by the intelligence officers was that there was only one nation within 5,000 of the required strength of in a position to attack Australia. Knowing the psychology of that country, I do not fear attack from that quarter. In any case, it would take that country six months to prepare for war with Australia, and our intelligence officers would be well-informed of any preparations of that kind. If it would take another power six months to establish a base in Australia, it would have to reckon with the British Navy. Seeing that it is not practicable for a foreign power to hold this country, I maintain that the present defence system meets our requirements under existing conditions, at any rate, I admit that an aeroplane from an enemy vessel could destroy the Sydney Harbour bridge, or drop bombs on the capital cities. That would be only a raid, which could not be followed by occupation. recognize that our first duty is to develop this country, and not spend money needlessly in providing for defence. New Zealand and South Africa are far more exposed to invasion than is Australia. I agree with the honourable member's statement that it would be nothing less than murder to send ill-equipped and untrained men into the field, but I do not admit his claim that Australia is the weakest link in the chain of Empire defence. The outlook in Europe may not be encouraging. too. Japanese have bitten off as much as they can chew in Manchuria for the next 30 years. The very fact that Australia has adopted the voluntary system of military training is a gesture in favour of peace among the nations. The Labour party has always opposed compulsory service. If this country were attacked,, every member of the community would beanxious to give his services in helping to repel the invader, and we should haveseveral months' notice of preparations for attack before an enemy could land here. The voluntary training system was rereceived with a good deal of enthusiasm; all the technical arms were fully recruited, but the response for the infantry was less satisfactory, and I understand that enlistments have declined since the Labour Government went out of office, although even now they are 35,000. In 1929 conferences of militia commanding officers held in all States recommended, in order to give a fillip to the voluntary system(a) increase the rates of pay for private soldiers substantially; (6) expedite the complete issue of the more attractive uniforms which it was decided to adopt when the change over from universal training took place; (c) ensure that camps of continuous training arc held annually. I believe that if all these recommendations were carried out we could quickly recruit the extra 5,000 men necessary for the defence of Australia. But the Minister has declared "" it is not practicable, under present financial condition's, to increase the rates of pay or the vote for provision of uniforms, but it is proposed to hold camps in lieu of bivouacs in ""We should 1932-33."" The committee will see that, despite the criticism that was hurled at the last Government by the Assistant Minister( Mr Francis), the honourable member for Balaclava ( Mr White), and others, when they have responsibility they continue the system which the predecessors of the present Government inaugurated. When I was Minister for Defence, I was advised that there was no likelihood of a war occurring within the next ten years; and judging by the present economic state of the world, there is little prospect of war on a large scale for at least two decades. Trouble may occur in Europe, but if it does I hope that Great Britain will manage to keep out of it and not risk a repetition of its experiences in the last",55,Department Of Defence

245,Mr A. Green,"The honourable membermatters which came under my notice when I held an official position, and which should not be discussed publicly. It seems -to me to be a poor foundation for a defence force to rely for immunity from attack on some psychological trait in the character of one's enemy. It would not be right for those charged with the defence of the country to take such a factor into consideration as a reason for neglecting proper defence measures. My statement that Ave are the weakest link of the Empire chain of defence has also been criticized by the ex-Minister. I am afraid that he is not in a position to dispute the truth of that statement; while I am in a position to prove it, and will do so at any time he feels inclined. Upon inquiry it would he borne out by practically every officer charged with the responsibility for defence of this country, no matter to what branch of the defence forces he may belong.. It is all very well to make gestures of disarmament to the world. former honourable member for Batman( Mr Brennan), at a conference in Geneva, publicly announced that Australia had led the world in disarmament. My experience of life has taught me that it is not safe to play according to the rules if you are playing against people who do not know the rules, and that it is not safe for a nation to become the sole disarmed unit in the world while other nations-as many are doing now-ar e increasing their armaments from day to day. To say that because we arm ourselves to protect our homeland we are likely to invite attack, is a statement hardly worthy of an answer. Most honourable members will agree with me that the man who has learned to use his fists keeps out of fights until the occasion arises when he must fight, and then he knows how to use them. He does not seek quarrels. He avoids fights because he knows the danger and trouble incidental to them, even though he prove the victor. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie accused me of being an advocate of compulsory training. I do not think that I used the term in my speech the other night. It is an expression I do not use. WheneverI am discussing that aspect of defence, I use the expression ""universal training "". The object of my speech was Mr E. F. Harrison. to draw attention to the fact that we in Australia were not in a position to defend ourselves. I said that the condition of our finances had a great bearing on the present condition of our defence forces. I said that system of training previously in operation in this country had provided us with an efficient force, but I did not recommend a reversion to that system. I believe it is possible to build up an efficient force under the present system of voluntary training; but we must have adequate reserves, and to have them, we must be prepared to pay more for defence. I do not propose to follow the honorahle member for Kalgoorlie into all his comments on my remarks. I have other reasons for speaking to this item, one of them being to correct an error into which the honourable member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) has fallen in more than one speech dealing with our defenders. On previous occasions, as well as 'on the The ex-Attorney-General, the present, he has made erroneous statements which have not been challenged because, perhaps, no one has had the exact information at his disposal. He said that the cost of training cadet midshipmen at Jervis Bay worked out at approximately £4,000 for each cadet. He then drew a parallel between that and the cost of training students in the so-called learned professions at a university. I remind the honourable member that the conditions are not parallel. In an institution such as the Royal Australian Naval College it is necessary to teach the same number of subjects as in any faculty at a university, but the classes are much smaller in comparison with the number who take courses in medicine or law at a university. The cost of running small classes is always higher than that of running fullsized ones. The honourable member said that there were 162 teachers at the college, but that is not correct. I tried to correct him by interjection when he was speaking, but I was informed that I did not want to hear the truth. I protest that I do want to know-the truth, and I have been at some pains to learn it. At the Naval College, besides a number of officers and civilians, there were lower ratings who did the ordinary work about the college, such as painting and repairs. Others were cooks, who prepared meals for tlie cadets and the staff, while others were at the college partly for health reasons, recuperating after coming out of hospital.. They were: not really connected with the college at all The figures quoted by the honourable member were, T 1 believe, supplied to him by the Defence Department, which was at fault in furnishing such information. The honourable member then spoke of the expenses of the Royal Military College at Duntroon. He -said that 69 staff cadets were under the charge of 98 teachers and others. I know that when that answer was furnished to the honourable member, there were eight officer"" instructors at the college. There were nothing like 98 others. In cluded among the "" others "" were persons who were allowed to ply their own trade such as boot making, hairdressing, tailoring, and the like persons', who by no stretch of the imagination could be put down as teachers. A consideration of these facts does not make the case quite so amazing. I believe that the honorahle member for Melbourne (Dr. Maloney) was misled in using the figures he quoted, and I htipe that he will not use them again. The Capital Cost of the Royal Military College was criticized by the honourable member for Melbourne, and has been referred to again this evening by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. Both honourable gentlemen put the figure down at £1,000,000 up to date, taking into account all expenditure since 1911. On that basis, a calculation has heen made to show how much it cost to turn out each cadet from the college. The number of cadets, alive or dead, was divided into the £1,000,000, but no regard was paid to the fact that during the war period 1,400 other officers were trained at the college. To train these, the staff frequently worked double shifts without any extra remuneration or expectation of it. Certain anomalies in the three arms of the Defence Force have been awaiting rectification for a long time, hut since no one has been in a position to voice the complaint nothing has been done. I refer to the unequal rates of pay of the three services. To illustrate the position, I shall take three equivalent ranks in the Royal Australian Navy, the Army, and the Royal Australian Air Force. A rear-admiral in the Navy receives, in active pay, £2,250^ subject to no reductions under the financial emergency legislation, and until three or four months ago he also received £134 per annum deferred pay. Theseamounts, with a lodging allowance, made his total pay £2,464 a year. This rate is fairly in accordance with, therates ruling throughout the British. Empire, although in the Royal Navy they are slightly higher and the allowances are definitely better. In the Army,, a major -general,. who is also chief of the : general staff and senior memberof the Military Board, receives £1,163 a year. A major-general who is also adjutantgeneral, but is not chief of the general staff, receives£891 a year. These ranks afford a fair indication of the relative rates of pay in the respective services. The age of the youngest incumbent in each case shows considerable disparity. In the case of the rear-admiral it is 55 years, in that of the major-general, who is chief of the general staff, it is nearly 59 years, and in that of the adjutantgeneral, it is 60 years. It will he seen, therefore, that at 60 years the adjutantgeneral of the Army receives £891, while at 55 years the rear-admiral, who is also chief of the naval staff, and has perhaps heavier responsibility, receives £2,464 a year. In each of the services there has been a different scale of examination for a considerable time. In the service to which I had the honour to belong, cadets who complete their preliminary course are examined for the rank of lieutenant, captain, major, and lieutenant-colonel before they may receive either promotion or increments in piy. In addition, it might almost be said that dozens of other courses of special instruction have to he taken by an officer during his career. In the Navy, examinations are held only for the ranks of sub-lieutenarit and lieutenant. Beyond the rank of lieutenant promotions depend upon reports on conduct and upon a certain degree of suitability and seniority. To continue the comparisons of pay, a brigadier draws from £752 to £891, the age of the youngest incumbent being 48 years, while an air-commodore draws £1,293, the age of the youngest incumbent being 42 .years. A captain in the Royal Australian Navy draws from £1,100 to £1,300, while a colonel, which is the equivalent rank in the Army, draws £661, and a group captain, the equivalent air force rank, draws £1,224. group, a commander in the Royal Australian Navy draws from £671 to £849, while his brother officer in the Army, a lieutenant-colonel, draws from £565 to ±'627, and a wing-commander draws from £672 to £930. Right down the scale the -same disparity is to be found. This has been a source of irritation to officers serving in the Army. It does not make for harmony when ofiicers in other branches of the service, younger in .years and subject to fewer examinations for promotion, draw in some cases .almost double the pay for their year's work. The age disparity is in every case -against the Army officer, and shows that the latter is nearly always five or «ix years older .than his brother officer -of equivalent rank in the Navy and Air Force; yet nothing has heen said or done with the object of correcting the anomaly. nations, because of the inroads which In these forces overseas vast changes 'have been made in recent years, with the -result that to-day it might almost he said honourable members of another statement that a group of officers holding equivalent made during the second year of the war. trank in the Navy, Army, or A i r Force receive much the same pay. I consider that some degree of equality in pay should be introducced into the three arms of our Defence Force, to avoid the irritation that exists at present.

Surely every honourable member will agree that the methods of warfare have changed as have conditions generally in our economic life. The basis of any defence scheme is largely economic, and.the question of private profit should be eliminated from the consideration of any scheme of defence. Let me give two illustrations. When the Attorney-General( Mr Latham) submitted his report on the recent Disarmament Conference, he said that the outstanding difficulty-if he had not said so we could have obtained the information from his report or from our general reading-wa s to define where schemes of defence began and ended. He said that it was almost impossible to determine the amount of expenditure that should be permitted to one nation as against other defence makes upon the ordinary industrial activities of a nation. I remind It seemed as if the allied countries would be wiped off the map, and Britishers were at their wits' end; we were all wondering what was going to happen. But Mr Lloyd George placed his finger on the cause of the whole trouble when he said, ""England is which then developed. Following upon",57,Department Of Defence

I thereupon urged that, instead of disbanding the staff, which we had scoured Australia to secure, the manager, Mr Crowe, should be allowed to make footballs, or cricket balls, or to do other work which could not come strictly within the category of naval or military requirements. machinery should be kept up to date, and the staff well trained, hut he added that the government of that day did not believe in governments engaging in trading operations. In other words, that Government would not do anything to encroach on the profit-making preserves, of the Fluid crsJane merchants. The Commonwealth clothing factory showed a profit from the beginning; it paid for the land on which it stood and for the equipment, and, in addition, it contributed to the general revenue from time to time. But because the government of the day did not' believe in the factory doing other than strictly defence work, it was proposed to close the factory. Representations were made that the management of the factory should be permitted to tender for the making of policemen's uniforms and helmets, uniforms for postal and tramway employees, &c, so that the staff, including the saildate, are not playing the game; they makers required for the making of aeroplane hangars, might be kept in employment, but the request was refused, because it was said that to do so would be to enter into trade. If those who prounless it is that he and his Nazi fess to believe in a scientific scheme of defence were in earnest, they would agree that the munition factory at Maribyrnong, the dockyards at Cockatoo Island, and the clothing factories in the several capitals, are all parts of a comprehensive scheme of defence, and they would allow the management to accept any work necessary to keep a trained staff fully employed. Mr E. J. HARBISON -I s that not now being done at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory? that factory going, the last Government tried to find work for the special machines installed there, and, after some time, it decided to make shearing machines at Lithgow. That was done only because there was no private firm in Australia prepared to accept the risk of making those machines. Shearing machines are still made at the Lithgow factory, but on the part of some who pretend that they want to provide for the defence of Australia there is a constant endeavour to take that work away from the factory. at the rate of nine a week. workshops are in charge of a first class management. It was the first factory in Australia to roll sheets of brass, but as soon as it showed that there was profit in the operation the work was given to private enterprise. The management is not allowed to make the factory pay, notwithstanding that it is a necessary part of an adequate defence scheme. I want our people to he self-reliant: I want Australia to have a real defence scheme, and that can be done only by having workshops properly equipped with modern machinery, and staffed with trained mechanics. Those who would deny the right of these workshops to maintain a trained staff by training apprentices year hy year, and would refuse to permit the machinery to be kept up to are not real Australians, and are not really concerned about the defence of Australia. What is it that makes Hitler appeal to the young Germans of to-day lieutenants are seeking to establish a system of State socialism in Germany? They are out to build up the internal position of Germany. They claim that too long has Germany expended her energies in sending goods overseas without any real concern for Germany itself, and they are now concentrating upon building up the nation from within. Their appeal is meeting with a ready response. Germany is not allowed to manufacture arms and munitions of the orthodox kind; but its people know that the methods of warfare are changing, and that, in future, technicians will determine the soundness or otherwise of any nation's scheme of defence. Consequently, Germany is training electricians, engineers, chemists, and skilled tradesmen, and has established a system of compulsory physical culture.",60,Department Of Defence

We must seek to make Australia worth defending hy providing full-time work, decent wages, proper education, and reasonable hours and conditions of labour. If we make Australia worth defending, every man will be willing to defend it. Our defence scheme is too costly for the results, achieved. defence necessitates intensive training, sO that the nation, if forced into a war, can conduct its operations on a scientific basis. trained men, or workshops equipped with machinery which, in times of peace, is used to promote peaceful development, and can, when the occasion arises, make implements of war. We should see that our defence scheme is established on such a basis. Mr E. J. HAKBISON (Wentworth) [11.20],I pay a tribute to the honourable member for Melbourne Ports( Mr in view of the fact that portion of Sydney Holloway), whose contributions to the debates in this chamber are always interesting and instructive. I believe that he is thoroughly sincere in all that he says with reference to our defence system, but I disagree with him when he says that we are spending too much upon it. I endorse his remarks with reference to the need for national workshops which could be devoted to defence purposes when the need arises, and I submit that we should make adequate provision for the training and equipment of our forces. Those of us who went through the horror of the Great War have no desire to take part in another, nor do we wish to see put into operation defence policies which may give offence to other countries and perhaps cause another conflict. however, essential that we should put our defences in such a state as to deter any foreign power from endeavouring to occupy our shores. [Quorum formed.] I should not have spoken in this debate but for the remarks of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) who, as an ex-Minister for Defence, should be able to enlighten the committee -upon the real state of our defence system. But before commenting upon his observations, I desire to compliment the honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. F. Harrison) upon his comprehensive survey of our position and his exposure of our impotence in defence matters. I cannot help thinking, however, that he did not give us the whole story-that he let us down somewhat lightly; I should like to hear him say exactly what is in his mind about the state of our defences, in the hope that it would awaken the people to the danger of .unpreparedness. TheA sound scheme of honourable member for Kalgoorlie made statements which, to me, appeared to be ridiculous and absolutely insincere. offensive remarks of the honorahle member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison) and ask that they be withdrawn. He has charged me with insincerity. Mr E. J. HARRISON I withdraw the remarks if they are offensive to the honourable member, but I hope to be able to prove what I have just said. As an ex-soldier the defence of this country is of some consequence to me, particularly Harbour defences is in my electorate. Members of the Labour party never tire of telling us that the party stands for the effective defence of Australia, but its more recent attitude to this important subject would lead one to believe that its ideas of the defence measures necessary to protect this country from aggression are, to say the least, somewhat humorous. I , in common with many other honourable members on this side of the chamber, take a serious view of our position. Recently, in company with the Assistant Minister for Defence( Mr Francis) and one or two other members, I had an opportunity to inspect the defences of Sydney Harbour. At South HeadI was particularly struck with the It is, inadequacy of the guns and equipment. I understand that the honourable member",62,Department Of Defence
250,That Cannot Be Done Without Mr A. Geeen,"I take exception to thefor Kalgoorlie, when he was Minister for Defence, also inspected the South Head Military Reserve with the object, I believe, of considering a proposal to make it a public reserve. If the present arrangeHe is one of those who would hold on to ments at South Head-the y are a travesty of what defence measures should be-ar e allowed to stand, the reserve might as well be handed over to the people for a public park. I asked the officer in charge how the range of the guns would compare with naval guns, and was informed that modern vessels would be able to stand off and blow South Head to atoms. Will honourable members believe me when I say that candles are used in the magazine for lighting purposes, and that the machinery used to drive the searchlights is so exposed that it could be put out of action by one shell? After inspecting South Head our party crossed to the other side of the harbour to have a look at Chowder Bay. ThereI was horrified at the conditions under which the men comprising the garrison were carrying on their work. The engineei 1 ing officer in charge has, under his control, a number of efficient machines, iathes, &c, but I was astounded to notice that the overhead shafting was supported from hangers which, in their turn, were supported by broken beams screwed together with bolts. The first question that I asked that particular officer was, whether the State factory inspectors allowed this sort of thing. He replied, "" Unfortunately for us, they have no jurisdiction. If they had, we should have been put through long ago."" I then asked why the beams were bolted together as they were; whether it was due to the fact that there was not a sufficient supply of timber. I was told that the amount of money available did not permit of decent joistings being put in. I then said, "" Where did you get all this broken timber ?"" and was told "" We simply tore up the floor, took out the beams, bolted them together, and swung them overhead "". The reply to my inquiry as to what supported the flooring was, "" We have rubble built under .the joistings to support it "" . This establishment is a travesty of a defence system for Australia. It reminded me of a song that was sung on the other side, "" We are a ragtime army "". Mr E. J. Harrison. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie argued that no army could land on the shores of Australia, because it would be prevented by the British navy. the apron-strings of the Mother Country. In the mouths of such people-the worse word is too good for the British navy in times of peace, but as soon as war threatens they expect it to get us out of our troubles. The honourable member also said that if any nation should dare to make an attempt to invade Australia, every man; woman and child would go to the waterfront to resist it. Presumably they would be armed with pop-guns, or would endeavour to prevent a landing by the use of hot air, a practice in which the honourable member is well versed. When an ex-Minister for Defence says that the defences of Australia are effective, his qualifications for that position ought to be investigated. I am pleased that in the present Assistant Minister we have a military man. Ho has given us the assurance that when the finances permit the whole of the defence system will he thoroughly re-organized. I may have peculiar notions in regard to those who should hold Cabinet positions; but I maintain that the defence system of this country can be properly administered only by a practical soldier, not by a theorist or one who has had no experience of warfare. Any man who endeavours to administer the system without possessing the requisite knowledge cannot do justice to Australia. Those who have practical knowledge of the subject should lay hare the sorry state to which our defences have sunk. If the Government were really aware of the conditions that exist it would not restrict the expenditure to such a miserly pittance as we find in these Estimates. I feel somewhat timid at obtruding into this debate after all the spare colonels, generals, admirals and commodores have taken part in it. The other evening, I suggested to the Government that it is useless to send delegates to the League of Nations and disarmament conferences, because wars are inevitable so long as the present economic system operates. That has been demonstrated to-night by the speeches of",63,Department Of Defence
251,Mr Ward (East Sydney) [11.35],"every honourable member who has had naval or military experience. Each bas said that we must prepare for war. If that be so, why should we continue the farce of sending delegates to disarmament conferences and the League of Nations-which , I understand, was supposed to be established to preserve the peace of the world? Australia is one of the signatories to the Kellogg Pact, under which a great many nations undertook, in no circumstances, to resort to aims for the settlement of their differences. Practical demonstration of our sincerity in sending delegates to the League of Nations and disarmament conferences, and in signing pacts which provide that the nations shall not resort to arms for the settlement of their differences, would be given by a substantial reduction of the defence vote. I agree with the honourable member for ""Melbourne Ports( Mr Holloway) that if we want an efficient army and navy we must give the people something to fight for, some interest in the conflict. Even military gentlemen will not contradict that assertion. If they were to go among the unemployed'returned soldiers and sugof another nation, the way is pregest their participation in another war, what measure of success would they have? Unfortunately, many of the men who were promised much when they were asked to fight, now have nothing to defend except the dole ticket. defend the honourable member. honourable member for DenisonI should lean on a rotten reed. If I were sure of the same protection as he had during his war service, I should be prepared to serve. Those who did the actual fighting in the last war are to-day in the ranks of the unemployed, existing on the dole. Honourable members say that it is unfortunate that the salaries of men in the army and the navy should have to be reduced. Who are the men who voted for that reduction under the Financial Emergency Act that was passed last year? They are the brass hats in this Parliament, the returned soldier members who, to-day, parade their wonderful concern for the defence services. The honourable member for Bendigo( Mr E. F. Harrison) xnentioned the salaries of admirals, commodores, brigadiers and majors-general, but said not a word about the pay of the lower ratings or the privates, who do the actual fighting. I was not old enough to go to the last war, but even had I been I should not have gone. That conflict was not caused by the assassination of a member of a European Royal family, as asserted by the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) to-night. We know full well that it was the result of conflict on tlie economic field among the various Imperialist powers. They are not able to settle their differences by negotiation or other peaceful methods, consequently they arm for the day when inevitably, they will have to resort to war. Take the position in Australia to-day. Japan is represented as being one of Britain's allies. Will the Minister, then, explain why his department is erecting defences at Port Darwin? Is it because the Government is afraid of Japan or some other nation attacking this country ? Whenever a trade agreement is entered into which interferes with the markets pared for a future war. The Ottawa agreement aims a severe blow at our secondary industries, in which capital of the United States of America is invested. Is it imagined that the capitalists of that country, who have their funds invested in our secondary industries, will remain quiet and allow us to shut them out of the markets which they have prepared for themselves ? There will be a continual conflict over the Ottawa agreement, and, when it is found to be impossible to settle differences on the economic field by peaceful methods, armed conflict will result. I shall refer to discipline in the Navy, which was mentioned hy other honourable members. 1 have in mind the case of one of the lower paid ranks who was involved in an ordinary brawl which took place on the mess deck of his ship. He was thrown into the vessel's prison, dumped ashore when the mainland was reached, drummed out of the Navy, and denied the deferred pay to which he was entitled.

Practically every honourable member who has spoken to this item went to the last war, and in consequence lays claim to some knowledge of defence matters. The inference is that those who did not go are ignorant on the subject. being so, Sir George Pearce, the present Minister for Defence, must be placed in that category. I was surprised hy the suggestion of the honourable member for Richmond( Mr R. Green) that the way to bring about efficiency in the Navy is to provide the officers and sailors with free liquor, so that, when visiting the Pacific Islands and other ports, they may appropriately maintain the dignity of the Navy. If that indicates a knowledge of defence, I plead guilty to ignorance on the subject. I should like an explanation from the Minister regarding the £300 which, he said, is paid to Australian officers in London, and I shall he glad if he can supply the number, name, and rank held by those officers in the Australian army, and what their duties are on the other side of the world. I should also like to know what are the duties of the liaison officer who is retained in London at an enormous salary. Now that honourable members opposite have acknowledged that Australia does not believe that the peace of the world will he preserved for long, that war is inevitable, and that Australia should prepare for it, I urge that we should end the farce of sending delegates overseas to disin being a citizen of this country. armament and League of Nations conferences. If it is"" desired to have an efficient defence force, we must first have our lines of communication secure. How can that be attained when we have an enormous army of discontented unemployed ? I say, frankly, no matter what the nation may be with which Australia comes into conflict, I shall not only not support the project, hut also advise our unemployed not to participate, as they would have nothing to gain hy doing so. Those returned soldiers who are out of work today realize the error they made when they Mr V'anl. I see no reason why publicity went to the war. As one honourable member has said, when the cry went out that the Empire was in danger and their patriotism was appealed to, those men willingly rushed in, saying, "" Give us a rifle, supply us with a uniform, put us on transports going to the other side of the world, and we will protect the Empire "". But those who controlled the situation said, "" Oh, no, we do not do things like that. We shall not give you a rifle and transport you free to the other That side of the world, but will loan you those articles and advance your fares overseas. If you are fortunate enough to come back to Australia, we expect you to repay us "". It is all very well for the honourable member for Wentworth ( Mr E. J. Harrison) to talk about "" our country "". He probably has some decent stake in it. What have the unemployed to protect? Give them homes, decent working conditions, and security for their wives and children, and there will be no need to appeal to their patriotism. Patriotism is the last refuge of the scoundrel. I happen to be an Australian of the third generation, not a foreign agitator imported to this country of whom honorahle members opposite express so much fear, and I play second fiddle to none insofar as being a real Australian is concerned. ProbablyI have a greater right to talk about ""Australia, our country,"" than many who have spoken to-night. I contend that the true Australian patriot is not the man who waves a flag, beats a drum, and urges somebody else to do the fighting when there is a war on, but he who seeks to l if t the living conditions of the people of Australia to such a high standard that he can justly take pride moveTliat the item, ""Secretary, £2,000"", be reduced by £500. I am confident that, if it receives proper consideration, my amendment will be accepted. After the application of the provisions of the Financial Emergency Act, the Secretary's salary is £1,560. The relative position of this officer to that of the principal soldier of the land, the chief of the military staff, has already been referred to",65,Department Of Defence

My proposal is to bring the chief of the clerical staff down to the same grade as the chief of the military staff. The history of the Secretary of the Department of Defence is not unknown. This officer was at one time private secretary to a former Prime Minister, the right honourable member for North Sydney( Mr Hughes). The succeeding Prime Minister desired a new secretary, so the old secretary was appointed to the High Commissioner's office and later transferred to the Defence Department. It is an anomalous position. The honourable member for Werriwa has compared it with the positions of military aud naval officers. Several honourable members, who have spoken to me about the position of the Secretary for Defence, have contended that the salary is much too high. I now suggest to them that it is of no use to talk and take no action. This Government was returned to office to reduce expenditure. The Minister for Defence (Senator Pearce), who is in close touch with the secretary of the department, has not seen fit to propose any reduction in his salary. If we believe that the salary is higher than the po""ition warrants, it is our duty to take the steps necessary to effect its reduction. salary of £1,200. That position is now tivedThat the question be now put. I Shepherd, the Secretary of the Defence Department, is a man of considerable experience, and I have a high opinion of his ability. His salary of £2,000 has, under the financial emergency legislation, been reduced by £450. This officer is not popular, mainly hecause he does necessary things without fear of the consequences. ability, he was selected by Mr bers, by referring to page 1081 of HanFisher, when Prime Minister, as his private secretary. He was subsequently appointed to the position of Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister, but the right honourable memher for North Sydney( Mr Hughes), when Prime Minister, was anxious to place in that position his own private secretary, and in order to do so proposed to appoint Mr Shepherd to the position of Secretary to the High Commissioner in London. Mr Shepherd refused to go to London in that, capacity unless he received a higher salary. The Prime Minister agreed to this,, and the salary was increased to £2000; Mr Shepherd remained in Londonf o r a considerable time, and upon his return was appointed to the position of Secretary to the Department of Defence. Mr Shepherd is a valuable officer, because he acts as a go-between between the Minister and the heads of the various arms of defence, each of whom considers his branch of supreme importance. I hope that the amendment will not be agreed to. Minister for Defence) [11.58] I ask the committee not to accept the amendment of the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn). Mr Shepherd is receiving a salary of £2,000 a year, which, is subject to a definite reduction under the financial emergency legislation. The position he occupies is an important one, and the work of Mr Shepherd has been rendered more difficult because of the reduction in the total vote for defence purposes. Prior to going to Great Britain, this officer was Secretary to the Prime Minister's Department, and, as such, received a classified at a salary of £2,000 per annum. When the position of official secretary in London became vacant in 1921, the Government of the day offered it to Mr oppose the amendment. Mr Shepherd at a salary of £2,000 a year. He accepted and held it until 1927 when he was transferred to Australia as Secretary to the Defence Department and took the place of Mr Trumble, who is now liaison officer in London at a salary of £2,000 a year. Mr Collins is also paid £2,000 a year. Both salaries are subject to deductions under the financial Because of his emergency legislation. Honourable memsard, of the present session, will see that a number of officers in the Public Service are receiving a salary equivalent to that of the Secretary to the Defence Department.

The honourable member for Perth does not allege that Mr Shepherd is not an efficient officer, nor has he given any reason in support of the amendment which he has moved. an officer of conspicuous ability, and is carrying out his work extraordinarily well in view of the difficulties with which he is confronted. His work is doubly trying because of the difficulties of administration brought about by the reduced sums made available for defence. I hope that, in view of the facts presented to the committee, the honourable member for Perth will not press his amendment. committee to reject it. Thursday, 27 October, 1932. [12.1 a.m.] I am given to understand that when increased rates of pay in the navy were granted seven or eight years ago, the claims of petty officers in the Permanent Forces were overlooked, but that when the last two redactions of public servants generally were made they were called upon to participate in them. If that is a fact, I suggest to the Governnow considering its recommendations. I ment that the position of these men should now be reconsidered. I feel disposed to support the amendment. As the honourable member for Perth( Mr Nairn) has said, we should be prepared to take action to overcome the financial difficulties of the country. Possibly the Secretary for Defence has sound claims to the salary which he is now receiving; but it is, to say the least of it, anomalous to grade a non-professional officer in the department much above the responsible heads of the various arms of the Defence Force. When the honourable member for Kalgoorlie ( Mr A. Green) requires information about the navy, he does not go to a sailor, nor does he consult a soldier about the army, and, presumably, when he wishes to know the state of his bodily health he asks a Inwyer to examine him. I was not at all '-ouvinced by the honourable member's remarks. the ministerial head of the department, he was closely associated with the present Secretary for Defence, and was probably impressed by that officer's worth.

The honourable member will be glad to know that provision has been made for the continuation of the hydrographic survey of the Great Barrier Reef. Owing to the limited financial resources of the country, it is not possible to commission the survey vessel Moresby for that work, but as the vessels trading on that part of the Australian coast are using, mainly, charts which were prepared by Matthew Flinders, the Government is anxious that this work should not cease.

Minister for Defence) [12.56 a.m.] I ask the honourable member to be serious. It is no light thing to move that an officer's salary be reduced by £500, merely in order to be consistent. The officer, who is at present carrying out the duties of Defence Liaison Officer, London, was head of the Defence Department for a* number of years, and rendered invaluable service to Australia during tlie whole period of the Great War. It is scandalous that at this early hour amendments of this nature should he moved without any information being placed before the committee to support them. Not one reason has been advanced to show why the salary of this officer should be reduced by £500. He has not been charged with incompetence; indeed I do not believe that the honourable member who moved the amendment knows anything at all about him. I hope that the committee will reject the amendment on the voices. Question-That the amount proposed amendment)-put . divided. (CHAIRMAN-MR . BELL . ) Ayes. . Noes. Majority AYES. Makin, N . J. 0.

Isi t a fact that at a Tariff Board inquiry held in Sydney some time ago, the board heard evidence which was directed to the remarkable difference in the prices of Australianmanufactured butter sold in the cities of the Commonwealth; also of the very low price at which similar butter was sold on the London market? 2. If so, will the Minister inform the House whether the Tariff Board reported on the facts to him? 3. If a report were furnished, did the board suggest that the import duty of Gd. and 7d. per lb. on butter should be reduced if the manufacturers and distributors of that commodity did not reduce their prices and make the price uniform in all cities of the Commonwealth? 4. Was such a suggestion made by the board in its report on galvanized iron duties? 5.

Excerpts from the figures submitted in evidence were set out in the board's report. 3. No. 4. The board's recommendation on galvanized iron did not aim at varying the relat i v it y of the local manufacturers' selling prices in the various States.

Will he asoertain whether Glass Distributors Limited announced a 2d per cent, reduction in the price of plain sheet glass following the recent alteration in glass duties? 2. Has the price of plain sheet glass since been increased to the original list price operating prior to 7th September, 1932, thereby depriving glass users of any advantage in price following the reduction in duties? 3. Is it a fact that Glass Distributors Limited is a price-fixing organization, and in pursuance of its policy has "" blacklisted "" a highly reputable firm, which has been established in Sydney for 80 years, because that firm sold Australian-made sheet glass below the list price fixed by Glass Distributors Limited? 4Will he state in what way the local manufacturer of sheet gloss has shown a lack of candour relating to the establishment of the industry and the departmental inquiries in connection therewith? I am now able to f u r n is h the honorahle member w it h the followin g information :1. Class Distributors Limited, Sydney, reduced tbe selling prices of plain clear sheet glass by 25 per cent, on 7th September, 1932. 2. On 4th October, 1932, Glass Distributors Limited cancelled the reduction so far only as imported glass is concerned, and further reduced the price of Australian glass by 8J per cent -makin g a total reduction of 33J per cent, on Australian glass. 3. Glass Distributors Limited fixc3 prices and claims to do so for the benefit of its members and recognized wholesalers of glass. It recently removed an old-established company from its list of wholesalers who receive a special discount of 10 per cent. The reason for this action was that the company in question was selling Australian glass at a lower juice than that established by Glass Distributors Limited. 4. As long ago as March, 1930, the manufacturers advised the department that the factory would be ready for production in August, 1930, but production did not apparently commence until January, 1932, and even as late as August, 1932, was not on a satisfactory commercial scale. Meantime, inquiries from numerous buyers had been received which could not be fulfilled and merchants and others were kept waiting many months for supplies. orable member for Ballarat( Mr. McGrath) asked the following question, without notice:Will the Prime Minister inform me whether tobacco planting machines fall within the definition of farm implements, and are therefore exempt from sales tax?
