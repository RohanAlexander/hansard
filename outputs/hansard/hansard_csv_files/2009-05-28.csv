Thursday, 28 May 2009 ----Petition: Medicare present a petition collected by the principal petitioner, Charles Edwards, with regard to the need for a Medicare office in the Pakenham community. I have only been in Pakenham for a very short 35 years, and have seen the community grow from 400 or 500 people to 27,000 people-one of the remarkable explosions of population that we have seen around the country in many seats such as mine. We have had huge growth patterns, particularly in outer metropolitan areas of our country. Previous governments and this government have acquiesced to provide services for those communities. They provide not only Medicare offices but they supply veterans’ offices, help for many other areas of their activities and of course they have Centrelink offices spread in a network right around this country. But in two locations-Moe and Pakenham-we do not have a Medicare office. The demographic of the community is not a lot different to the demographics of other electorates. It has pensioners, it has carers that need carer payments and it has people that need government services; but they need them where they can access them. You can say, ‘Well, they can get on public transport and do that.’ But as you know very well, Madam Deputy Speaker-being a Melbournian yourself-the public transport in outer areas does not always connect directly with the public service they need to attend. That is why we have Red Cross support to help older people to travel, which is a very important service. However, because of this massive growth of population, the lack of public transport and the fact that the service that is provided is at Fountain Gate some 20-odd kilometres away, there is a real case for this. I congratulate Charles Edwards and his wife for making the effort to get this massive number of signatures with regard to this very special need in the Pakenham area. The petition reads as followsTo the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives This petition of residents of Pakenham and surrounding district in the state of Victoria, Electoral Division of McMillan, draws to the attention of the House: (1) The lack of a Medicare Office in the Pakenham community and the hardship this imposes on local residents. (2) At the 2001 Census Pakenham had a population of 17,397 in 2006 that population had grown to 27,787. Since the year 2001, population growth within Pakenham has accounted for nearly 90% of the total growth experienced in Cardinia Shire. (3) There is a significant proportion of the population in receipt of pensions, carers’ allowances and parenting payments who need to access Medicare refunds in a more timely manner (4) The nearest Medicare offices are Fountain Gate and Warragul and with the increase in new housing estates in both Pakenham and Officer the demands on these offices will be significant.

Petition received. Holt Electorate: Diabetes retary for Trade) (9.32 am)-As politicians, we have the rare privilege of meeting many people from all walks of life. We particularly get to meet those who inspire with their courage and determination to beat the odds. TodayI proudly speak of one such person, an 11-year-old constituent of mine who lives in Cranbourne: Tess MacCartney, and her mother, Mairi-Anne. Tess and her mother came to see me last Friday to discuss her role as Youth Ambassador for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and to discuss her experience of juvenile diabetes. Prior to meeting Tess, I did not really have an idea of what type I diabetes was or how it could affect someone so young. What impressed me was how Tess described her own experience. I learnt a lot by hearing what happened, and what it would mean for Tess in the future. Tess told me she was diagnosed as having type 1 diabetes in November 2008. Her mum, Mairi-Anne, told me that Tess was ill last year with stomach aches, as well as being very thirsty and needing to go to the toilet a lot. Imagine Mairi-Anne’s shock one day going to a doctor to discover what had caused these health problems, and the next day having her daughter immediately admitted to hospital and being treated for a week. For many people in this situation it would be easy, given that this is a life-altering illnessan illness that, left untreated, can cause blindness, amputations and increased incidences of stroke and kidney disease-to feel despondent and without hope. But Tess has decided to become an ambassador to raise awareness about the symptoms of diabetes, as well as raising funds that can be directed towards finding a cure. She has organised fundraising activities at her primary school during diabetes month in May, and is doing her best to raise awareness about this disease by discussing the issue with members of the public in my electorate. Tess is now part of the ‘Remember me’ campaign, and has left me with a picture of her, which I now have on my desk in my electorate office, to remember her and children like her who are affected by type 1 diabetes. As a consequence of Tess’s visit to my office, I now know the insidious nature of juvenile diabetes. It affects close to 100,000 of our children. Type1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease, where the body’s immune system suddenly mistakenly attacks and destroys the insulinproducing cells in the pancreas. Without insulin, your body cannot turn the glucose from the food you eat into energy for your muscles and other cells of your body. I know that a lot of research is being done to determine what causes type 1 diabetes, and there is still a fair way to go. I know that talking to other people about your diagnosis might be hard, but it is very important to build a support network-through friends and family and at school, uni and work. Diabetes does not have to stop you or anyone from living a full and active life. You can be a professional athlete, like NRL star Brett Stewart; a singer, like Marcia Hines; or a politician, like Guy Barnett. I know this and many other facts about juvenile diabetes for one reasonthat is, a very brave little girl who walked into my office last Friday. MAIN COMMITTEE",125,Constituency Statements
269,Mr Byrne (Holt,"Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister and Parliamentary SecMayo Electorate: Defence Force related events in my electorate I participated in recently. The first was a visit a couple of weeks ago to the cadets in their regular training session down in Victor Harbor, in the southern part of my electorate. Twenty cadets attend once a week to do their training. They are a great group of young people, led by Sergeant Graham Coller and Sergeant Frank Cooper. They do a wonderful job each week in helping these cadets learn many skills-including drill, communications, first aid, navigation, orienteering and safe weapons handling. They are a lovely bunch of young people. It is a great thing for young people to do. It teaches them all sorts of skills. I am very supportive of what they do down there at Victor Harbor. Importantly, they learn how to become young leaders in our community. I pay tribute to this group of young people, and I urge more to get involved if they can. They plan next year to get over to Canberra for the ANZAC Day service at the War Memorial, which I fully support. I will help in their fundraising attempts to make that trip possible. I acknowledge the cadets down in Victor Harbor and thank them for a very enjoyable evening. The second event was this. In the week leading up to ANZAC Day, on Monday, 20 April, I was fortunate to be part of a defence medal presentation in Mount Barker-in the centre of my electorate-to seven Australians who had served their nation with pride. It was a great initiative of the former government to recognise people who gave that commitment to our nation. It was an enjoyable morning tea with the seven people who received the medal. Army Warrant Officer Class1 Carthew, who was from Keswick, helped with the presentation. Those who received the award were Darryn Maxwell, from Strathalbyn; Peter Simpson, from Strathalbyn; Richard Eylward from Goolwa; Lyn Gardiner from Yankalilla; Robert Schroder from Crafers West; Trevor Davis from Kersbrook; and James Kirk, from Macclesfield. They were all very proud. They had their families there. It was a lovely ceremony. It was a very well-designed and thought-through initiative that the previous government brought in, and I was very privileged to be part of that ceremony. Page Electorate: Dairy Industry Ms SAFFIN (Page) (9.38 am)-I am appalled that the United States has just taken a big backwards step towards protectionism, announcing its reintroduction of dairy export subsidies. This could lead to other countries blocking free trade. It could push prices down and distort the market. There are other ways to deal with need and adjustment. It might make them feel good, but it will distort the trade markets. The danger is that more will follow, like lemmings. This flies in the face of the G20 leaders agreement not to impose protectionist measures in the face of the global recession. We now have the EU and the US paying dairy subsidies. This further highlights the importance of concluding the WTO’s Doha Round, which would see the complete elimination of export subsidies-a process we in Australia are committed to. I know from direct contact with dairy farmers that many are experiencing some tough times due to the difficult and challenging economic climate. In my seat of Page, the dairy industry is a key industry. We are home to the longestablished and successful dairy cooperative Norco. Our dairy farmers over the past decade and even before have coped with and adjusted to many reforms. Some have been painful, but they have come through. The combined value of farm milk production from the Northern Rivers to south-east Queensland was 230 million for the 2006-07 period. Many farmers have MAIN COMMITTEE",126,Constituency Statements

ABARE forecasts further reductions in prices paid to farmers until 2010-11, after which it forecasts that prices will begin to recover. In spite of this, I know that the industry is optimistic about its long-term future. Importantly, two-thirds of dairy farmers still feel very positive about their future. In the Sunday Age of 24 May 2009 Alan Burgess said that the American subsidies will depress already low world prices. I agree. The headline was, ‘US kick in the guts to dairy farmers.’ I could not agree more. It felt like a kick in the guts to me when I read it, knowing all the dairy farmers in my area who toil hard for long hours seven days a week. I am pleased that our Minister for Trade and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry are running hard on this, protesting loudly and at the highest levels. All of us are going in to bat for our dairy farmers. I am also pleased to report that, after much detailed negotiation by the government, the Indian market for Australian dairy exports has reopened for the first time since 2003-a hard market to crack. I ask our US friends to rethink. This is not a friendly act towards our dairy farmers. Defence tute’s Defence budget brief for 2009-10 irrefutably confirms that the Defence minister is engaged in what can only be described as gross mismanagement of the Defence budget. The Defence white paper was spun as a panacea document. Goodness knows we waited long enough for it. Yet, after all that time, it was delivered with the least comprehensive Defence budget papers of the past decade. I quote from the ASPI report: There is a glaring absence of substantive information on funding, investment and reform. In the 2009-10 budget, there is a commitment to increase real Defence spending by a maximum of three per cent annually out to 2018 and by 2.2 per cent from 2017-18 to 2029-30. The coalition government guaranteed a minimum three per cent annual real growth. Yet the numbers are not what they seem. Defence’s total funding of $26.6 billion in 2009-10 shows an increase of 14.9 per cent, largely because of the $1.4 billion commitment to support our forces in Afghanistan. However, the increase in 2010-11 is only 1.45 per cent to $27.028 billion. After that, the funding level falls even further: $27 billion in 2011-12 and $26.337 billion in 2012-13. The ASPI report suggests that there may be some small element of good news contained in the muddled and disjointed white paper and companion reviews-that is, military numbers continue to grow. Indeed, that is good news, but then why is it that the Rudd Labor government is cutting the number of available places on the widely popular gap year program from 700 to just 600? The coalition government’s policy was always to increase the size of the program from the initial 700 to 1,000 available places. Additionally, internal Defence sources have advised that the Army will be slashing 1,000 continuous full-time positions that the reserve personnel currently fill, purely as a cost-saving measure. How can the Defence minister justify the loss of these positions when there is an ongoing shortage of military personnel? In addition, 50 per cent of regular army members in reserve units will be cut, severely limiting the continuation training of reserves. The reserves have done a lot of heavy lifting for the ADF in the past decade, particularly within our often volatile northern approaches. This is yet MAIN COMMITTEE",127,Constituency Statements

In conclusion, the incompetence of the current Defence minister has been revealed time and time again. It is directly and irrevocably harming Australia’s defence forces. How can the outstanding men and women in the ADF-and for that matter in the Australian public-have confidence in the future direction of Australia’s defence forces when the white paper and the budget papers are so scant on detail and so silent on what is to occur and what things will cost? This is just another smoke and mirrors campaign, resulting in a white paper that has no substance or credibility. The Australian people deserve a fulsome and detailed explanation of where their tax dollars are being spent. (Time expired) Melbourne Ports Electorate: Indian Students say that, of their 33,000 members in Victoria, 60 have been seriously assaulted in Melbourne. In one recent attack two Indian students were hit on their heads with a bat at Tottenham station. The youths who attacked them taunted them racially. In another incident Sourabh Sharma, an Indian international student, was commuting home on a train after a shift at KC when he was brutally bashed and robbed by six people. As the 21-year-old lay on the floor being kicked in the head and body, his attackers screamed racial insults. This is the latest in what police sources call an epidemic of attacks on Indians at western suburb train stations. These attacks are a disgrace to Australia. As an MP from Melbourne I am angry and ashamed that these things are happening in my city, which has always believed in cultural diversity. Part of the ambience of Melbourne is cultural diversity, and this is a direct attack on our pluralist way of life. These attacks are also potentially harmful to our economy and national interest. Education is our largest export industry. Its success depends on our ability to offer international students a safe and welcoming environment. India is a booming democracy and will play an important role in Australia’s trade, security and political future. I am pleased that authorities and people in Melbourne are acting swiftly to stamp out these disgraceful attacks. The Police-Indian Western Reference Group was established in January to help shield Indian visitors and residents, particularly students, from an escalation of nighttime street crime in the western suburbs. In fact, a team is being sent to India-unfortunately, there is a necessity for doing this-led by Victoria Police Multicultural Liaison Officer Victor Robb. It will tour five cities, including Mumbai and Delhi, next week and students will be briefed on what to expect when they come to Melbourne. Understandably, there has been extensive reporting of this thuggish behaviour on the streets of Melbourne. The Times of India ran one story under the title ‘Now, Indian students facing hell down under’. Kanan Kharbanda, a 28-year-old, lost his sight after one attack. He returned to India for medical treatment. Thankfully, he is back in Australia completing his studies. It makes you cringe to read in the Hindustan Times: One hopes that students pursuing degrees in Australia only have to worry about their academic results not their safety. The bogans initiating these attacks are undermining the strong relationship between Victorian universities and the international education system. They are undermining Australia’s reputation for pluralism. I am sure all members will support me in condemning these attacks. I urge MAIN COMMITTEE",128,Constituency Statements

Greenway Electorate: Railway Station Staffing plans by the New South Wales state Labor government to cut staff at railway stations in my local community and the effect this will have on not just commuters but also the disabled in particular. This will affect stations from Marayong through to Richmond-Marayong, Quakers Hill, Schofields, Riverstone, Vineyard and the other stations between Windsor and Richmond. The standard of public transport that the people of the Hawkesbury and north-west sector have to put up with is unacceptable, and now we have a state Labor government cutting valuable front-line staff because they cannot manage their state. This is just another example of the state Labor government failing the people of New South Wales and treating the people of Greater Western Sydney like second-class citizens. The many stations in my electorate that I have listed are going to be affected, including Riverstone and Windsor. I acknowledge the local papers, particularly the Rouse Hill Times and the Hawkesbury Gazette, for highlighting this issue. To give you some idea of what the cuts will mean, I will outline the impact on Windsor station. The New South Wales Labor government plan to, firstly, abolish the station manager position, thereby reducing the staff numbers at Windsor to one full time and one part time; secondly, delay the opening of the ticket office until 5.55 am; and, thirdly, design the roster in such a way that there are no staff manning the station on weekends. This will have a huge impact on commuters who use the station. The effect it will have particularly on the disabled is an absolute disgrace. During this week one of my team was at the station and a person in a wheelchair was about to board the train. Because there is quite a large gap between the station and the train, the staff need to put a platform out so that the person in the wheelchair is able to get onto the train. On the weekend there will be no staff. How will a person using either a walking frame or a wheelchair get on or off a train on the weekend, when there is no staff member there to assist them with the placement of the temporary ramp? They will not be able to. The gap between the platform and the train is approximately six inches and there is a six-inch step up to the train. This clearly demonstrates how out of touch the state Labor government are. Labor have ignored the needs of people with a disability and made changes which will isolate commuters with a disability even more. I call on the local residents to contact the state member for Riverstone, and I call on him to make representations to reverse this decision.

The CATE program endeavours to acknowledge and reward students who have demonstrated personal attributes and employability skills through a program of vocation based activities. They are activities and programs that are assessed by both the school and the industry sector. It is an industry based and assessed workplace experience. Occupational health and safety and senior first aid are part of the course, as are community and school based voluntary projects and activities, an employability skills audit, undertaking extensive career based assessment activities and interviews, a career path transition plan, an employment portfolio and CATE interviews upon completion. The CATE program is offered to students in years 10, 11 and 12. It is not designed to overburden students; rather, it is aimed to enhance their employability and their view of the world. It recognises student activities and the engagement that they have had to date. It acknowledges student participation in course placement and experience in part-time or casual employment, voluntary work and career planning.

After she had been swept about 300 metres, she managed to cling to a surf ski which was being paddled by a member of the North Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club. Other surf lifesavers also managed to make it through the break to reach her, but by this time she was exhausted. Club Captain ‘Major’ James Peryman, known as Jim, aged 24, was observing from the beach and realised the situation was critical. A member of North Cronulla’s champion R&R team and an accomplished swimmer with considerable knowledge of local surf conditions, Jim summoned another reel, line and belt team from the patrol and ran to the northern end of the beach. After a tremendously difficult swim, during which he strained against the weight of the line, Jim managed to reach Daphne. He took control of the patient and eventually the line began hauling him and Daphne back to the beach. He was assisted by another surf lifesaver visiting from Queensland, Frank Bergstron. Jim continued to hold Daphne until he disappeared under the water, his line weighed down by the massive amount of seaweed in the water at the time. Jim was last seen conscious with his back towards the beach, an apparent sign that he was still prepared to rescue Daphne. Daphne was eventually taken to the beach by another surf ski and was safe. During a lengthy haul-in, with increasing weight on the line, the linesman observed in the shallows of the sandbank a mass of seaweed. They raced to the scene and after frantically digging through the weed found the unconscious Jim Peryman. After numerous resuscitation efforts, Jim was transferred to the St George Hospital where the resident medical officer pronounced his death. MAIN COMMITTEE",130,Constituency Statements

He has been acknowledged now in our local community also with the naming of Peryman Square at North Cronulla and, most recently, at the dedication of Australia’s first national surf reserve on Cronulla’s beaches in Bate Bay. However it was not until this year’s National Surf Life Saving Championship in Perth that he was acknowledged by Surf Life Saving Australia. Thanks to the efforts of North Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club life members, Allan Cameron, Edward Larsen, Harry Brown and club patron Warren Rennie, together with the late Bill Marshall, patron of the Cronulla Surf Life Saving Club, in recognition of the fact that he continued to rescue at the risk of his own life, ‘Major’ James Peryman was awarded posthumously Surf Life Saving Australia’s highest recognition for bravery, the Meritorious Award Silver Medallion. Jim is one of 40 such recipients in the movement’s more than 100 years proud history, joining the shire’s E.

Hearing Services: Cochlear Implants Services and Parliamentary Secretary for Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction) (9.56 am)-Last week I had the privilege of witnessing one of the most impressive transformations that modern medical science can achieve. The member for Bradfield approached me some months ago about the issue of hearing screening for newborn infants and, in our discussions, in order to understand the issue and how we could improve the service across Australia, I asked whether he could arrange for me to have a look at an operation where cochlear implants were put into a little child. SoI attended the Prince of Wales Hospital where Dr Phillip Chang performed the implantation of a cochlear implant on a four-month-old girl who was profoundly deaf. It was with the consent of the parents, and I acknowledge the role of the member for Bradfield in arranging this. The cochlear implant is designed to allow people with profound deafness to hear sounds and communicate with the hearing world. Four months is the earliest that one can be fitted safely but, in terms of giving the child the benefit of hearing, the earlier the better. I then visited the Shepherd Centre in Darlington where children who have been fitted with cochlear implants are able to benefit from a four-year program to help them learn to speak and understand. They get the services of speech pathologists and auditory professionals. The idea is to ensure that when these children start school they are as well-equipped to learn and to reach their potential as children born with the ability to hear. To meet a four-year-old child at the Shepherd Centre, as I did, who was born profoundly deaf yet was now able to speak and identify syllables and words, was a beautiful experience. I watched a video of a young child exposed to noise for the first time, and that was also incredible. When the child’s cochlear implant was switched on there were the tears of the parents and the initial reaction, perhaps anger, of the child hearing noise for the first time. But MAIN COMMITTEE",131,Constituency Statements
275,Mr Shorten (Maribyrnong,"Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’sthen comes the understanding that the child will be able to hear. It was a very powerful experience. One hundred and fifty thousand people, both children and adults, have had cochlear implants since its invention and, as the technology improves, the implants are coming closer to the goal of replicating the sounds heard by the functioning human ear. The cochlear implant is the result of research in several different countries, but Australia has played a major and proud role in its development. Professor Graham Clark of the University of Melbourne was the creator and developer of the world’s first multichannel implant and is considered by many to be father of the cochlear implant. The issue which I pursue as a result of this visit is the possibility of screening newborn infants across Australia for deafness. Some states do it to 100 per cent; others states do not yet do it to 100 per cent. I do believe this is an issue worth further investigation and support. I would like to record my particular appreciation of the work of Dr Phillip Chang, who was the surgeon, and his very capable theatre staff including Dr Harry Koumoukelis, who was the anaesthetist. I also would like to record my appreciation of the work done by Michael Shepherd, the Chairman of the Shepherd Centre; Aleisha Davis, the Manager of Clinical Programs; and Anthea Green, the CEO.

I want to take some time today to address some of my own concerns about the appropriation bills and the budget that was brought down just over two weeks ago and indeed some of the concerns that my constituents have raised with me over the last fortnight. There is no doubt that the budget plunges this country into enormous debt. In fact, we can look forward to years of debt. With a budget deficit of $58 billion brought down, there is no doubt we have a debt bomb, and this country is going to pay for this debt for many years to come. The government wants to lay blame for the debt and deficit. This is a government who said they were going to stop the blame game, but they are back at it and have certainly started to point the finger. There is no doubt we live in difficult times and, yes, we are having a global financial crisis the likes of which we have never seen before.

All Australians will come to the realisation that one day the credit card debt that is being racked up at the moment is going to have to be paid. I believe we now have a legacy of reckless spending-a budget deficit and a debt that will take us well into the future. It is going to impact very heavily on our children and our grandchildren for decades to come. We have heard some very big numbers bandied around over the last two weeks, but I would like to put some of those big numbers on the table today to put some of that debt into perspective-what these numbers will mean for the future and what they will mean for every Australian in this country. The word ‘billion’ seems to slide off people’s tongues with little regard for its enormity far too often these days. However, the Rudd-Swan deficit is equivalent to $10,000 worth of debt for each man, woman and child in this country. It is a $58 billion deficit. People might say: what does this matter? It will certainly matter in 2012-13, when the annual interest bill paid by the Australian people will be $8 billion-yes, $8 billion, which is more than the Commonwealth spends each year on infrastructure and housing combined. High interest costs will mean less money for public services like hospitals and schools and less money to address the needs of an ageing population-and I will have more to say on that a bit later. It is projected that there will be more than one million unemployed Australians by 2010-11. Those unemployed will include someone in your family, a friend, your neighbour. Someone you know is going to lose their job. An extra 500,000 people have become unemployed since Mr Rudd was elected to office in 2007. Net debt by 2012-13 will be $188 billion, and that figure does not include the National Broadband Network-another $43 billion-or indeed the Ruddbank. Spending decisions since the 2007 election account for $124 billion. That is $124 billion spent in just 18 months. What a spending spree. In other words, two-thirds of the debt owed by taxpayers in 2012-13 will be due to spending decisions taken by the Rudd government in the past 18 months-spending that has not proven to be the economic stimulator that we were promised. This is classic Labor: spend like no-one is watching the bottom line. But let me say to the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and all Labor members of parliament: we are watching and we will hold you to account. The Australian people will not accept such a sloppy destruction of the nation’s balance sheet-a balance sheet that the coalition left in the black. A surplus was left to this government when we lost government in 2007. Mr Rudd was not elected with a mandate to destroy our economy. He was elected as an economic conservative, a statement that seems laughable two budgets into his term as Prime Minister. A lot has been said by Mr Rudd about our bottom line compared to the rest of the world. When the coalition were in government we made it our aim to be the best in the world. World leaders show the others how it is done, as the coalition did in the past. We went into the global financial crisis with a solid surplus, and Mr Rudd and Mr Swan, the Treasurer, have squandered the hard work of the coalition under John Howard and Peter Costello. I want to talk about how the locals of McPherson have been hoodwinked by this budget. Mr Swan announced in his budget speech: … $365 million towards a light rail corridor for the Gold Coast… Imagine my surprise to read in the budget papers: MAIN COMMITTEE The Government has made provision for a possible equity contribution of $365.0 million in 2009 10 in relation to the Gold Coast Light Rail project. Nothing but smoke and mirrors-‘a possible equity contribution’, if the Queensland Labor state government can find some private partners for the project. Mr Rudd wants to know what a coalition government would do to stimulate the economy. How about some infrastructure projects that deliver long-term economic benefits to local communities? TodayI would like to propose a project for the Gold Coast that I hope Mr Rudd and his government will consider and adopt as policy. This idea would stimulate small business and the tourism industry on the southern Gold Coast by funding the extension of the train line from Varsity Lakes, which is nearly completed, to the Gold Coast Airport at Coolangatta immediately. Consider this: we have an international airport located at Coolangatta that is not serviced by any transport other than private vehicle, taxi or tour bus. The Gold Coast is the sixth largest city in this country. It is ludicrous for international passengers to get off a plane and not be able to get any public transport from the Gold Coast Airport. In my view, there is still no plan to address these needs of the Coolangatta airport. The state government, which looks after public transport on the Gold Coast, has no plan. In the year to 30 December 2007, 850,000 overseas tourists visited the Gold Coast. I believe these tourists should be met with welcoming arms and easy access to our beautiful beaches, our theme parks, our stunning hinterland and our tourist spots. Instead they are stuck. I cannot tell you how many then contact my office to raise this issue with me. Small business would like to see the airport precinct developed more, with public transport as an option for those people arriving on the Gold Coast. On the subject of small business, it is my belief that this budget does not help the 2.4 million small businesses that drive Australia’s economy. Small businesses are the engine room of our economy, and the 15,020 small businesses in McPherson need a break. The government want to stimulate the economy. I say to the government: to stimulate the economy give small business a break. The Labor government want to keep unemployment low-well, encourage small business to hire and employ people. If you want to help small business, you need to see their cash flow grow. The small business tax break offered is nonsense because small businesses are under cash flow stress and they cannot afford to buy any new equipment and qualify for the scheme. Small businesses in my electorate are screaming for practical help from the Rudd government and it is falling on deaf ears. In particular, I have been contacted by dozens of restaurants that will be adversely impacted by the award modernisation process of the Rudd government. The Deputy Prime Minister’s Forward with Fairness IR policy has an ironic title given that it is completely unfair to lump restaurants and caterers with staff costs equivalent to those for hotels and casinos that stay open 24 hours a day. Award modernisation is just one example of how Labor continues to mismanage the economy and contribute to the unfavourable conditions currently faced by small business. Restaurants in my electorate-and many of these restaurants have been operating for many years servicing our community and the tourists who visit the Gold Coast-are predicting that labour cost increases of up to 20 per cent will inevitably lead to higher consumer costs and job losses. And dare I say that many of them have indicated to me that they will be closing the MAIN COMMITTEE front door. The coalition does not support any policy that results in increased unemployment and inflationary wage outcomes. Unemployment on the Gold Coast has doubled in the last 12 months, after reaching a record low under the previous, coalition, government. It was no fluke that the coalition government presided over low unemployment. Our policy supported small business to employ staff and retain them. The coalition recognised that small business is the engine room of our economy. Labor has missed the point once again with its present policies. It is enterprise that creates jobs, not government. McPherson residents have been let down by this government, and shamefully so. Not only have the Rudd government let down Australians; they have done it in a deceitful way, by giving with the one hand and taking with the other. There is no more obvious example of this than their blatant disregard for the health and well-being of older Australians. I welcome the increase in the age pension in this budget, which came after the Rudd government rejected calls from the coalition to increase the pension last year. Across Australia, young and old urged the government to recognise how tough it is for age pensioners, particularly single age pensioners, to make ends meet. Earlier this year I tabled a petition calling on the government to recognise just how difficult it is for age pensioners in this country. More than 7,000 people signed that petition calling on the government for an increase in the single rate of pension, and I am delighted that that has happened. However, it did take more than a year for the government to recognise how tough they were doing it. They ignored the stripping-off of clothes by our age pensioners in a Melbourne street and they ignored the legislation the coalition put on the table last year calling for that increase, so pensioners had to wait 12 long months to see that money come through, and they are not going to see that increase in their pensions until September this year. However, I would say, on a note of caution, to our senior Australians: they should be aware that the dismal state of the budget will affect them even with their pension increase. Australians will work longer, will retire later and will live on less under the irresponsible changes to superannuation in this budget. The superannuation co-contribution scheme has been cut by a third, from $1,500 to $1,000, and tax relief on voluntary super contributions has been halved. The coalition encouraged people to save for their retirement. Many will be shocked to learn that this Labor government is not supportive of people planning for their retirement. I am concerned that senior Australians will now pay more for their health needs, with this Labor government having broken their promise to leave the 30 per cent private health insurance rebate and Medicare safety net untouched. We heard from the Prime Minister, hand on heart, and the now Minister for Health and Ageing that they supported the private health rebate, and here we see in this budget-only their second budget-that they have attacked the private health rebate. Labor’s changes to the Medicare safety net will have wide-ranging effects on local residents who try to access essential services such as obstetrics, reproductive technology and cataract surgery. It is disappointing that, with our ageing population, the Treasurer has presented no plan as to how he will sustain the pension rise and balance the books for the future. MAIN COMMITTEE Self-funded retirees have received a slight reprieve, with the government quietly backing down on their proposed changes to eligibility for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card, and so they should. We strongly opposed these changes from the outset, and it is only because of pressure from the coalition and seniors groups that this government accepted that the proposal-the one they put on the table-was wrong. Now this measure, which was part of last year’s budget, has been quietly withdrawn. But they are not doing anyone a favour because while they give with one hand they take with the other, having made cuts to the private health insurance rebate. The 52,659 residents of McPherson with private health insurance will pay the price for the Rudd government’s sustained attack on private health insurance. The Rudd government hates choice and is pushing those who choose to provide for their health needs and that of their families onto the public health system. Another broken promise that will adversely impact on my electorate of McPherson is the NBN, the National Broadband Network-more aptly named the ‘nonsense broadband notion’. First Mr Rudd was going to spend up to $4.7 billion on the rollout of a national broadband network, providing fibre based services to 98 per cent of Australians. Now Labor wants us to believe in a plan to construct a $43 billion network, likely to require a taxpayer contribution in excess of $21.5 billion, to be rolled out to around 80 per cent of the population. But when is this to happen? The key elements of affordability and commercial viability to encourage a partnership with the private sector are the obvious missing details. In the absence of a business plan or cost benefit analysis, the Australian people need assurances that such a massive government investment is going to work. It is a risky plan. We need more details. The coalition are committed to ensuring Australians have universal, reliable and affordable access to fast broadband services. Where we differ from Labor is on how that is to be delivered. I would like to put on the record, in the few minutes I have left, a few comments about the aged-care sector. The Rudd government’s massive debt and deficit ignored a Senate report, a Productivity Commission report, industry leaders and its own National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission report when it callously overlooked the embattled aged-care sector in this year’s budget. I believe this government is not serious about addressing the challenges of an ageing population in this country. The Rudd government’s poorly targeted cash-splash handouts and reckless spending have come at a high cost to the aged-care sector, which has missed out as a result. Wayne Swan was quoted on 8 May as saying: … the federal budget will contain reforms to address longer-term structural problems caused by the ageing population. What he says and what he does are two completely different things. The Rudd government has completely failed to recognise the impact an ageing population will have on the aged-care sector. If Kevin Rudd were serious about caring for senior Australians, aged-care infrastructure would not have been excluded from the $22 billion infrastructure package and the two previous stimulus packages. It is disappointing that investment in the aged-care needs of an ageing population is not a Rudd government priority. Investing in local aged-care infrastructure would have provided long-term economic and social benefits and created vital local jobs. There were no reform measures in this budget to improve the availability, quality, flexibility and sustainability of aged-care services throughout this country. Under the current policy setMAIN COMMITTEE tings, older Australians will not be able to access the quality of and the choice of care they want and need. It was a discouraging budget from a consumer and service provider perspective. One comment worth noting was in Budget Paper No. 2. The Treasurer and the Minister for Finance and Deregulation stated: The Government will continue to consider the longer term needs of the aged care system, taking into account relevant recommendations in the final report of the National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission. We can only hope that the absence of major reform measures in the budget may reflect the timetable for the NHHRC report. The final report is due to be released in June. We know that baby boomers-people reaching the age of 65 in just over a year-will be looking for those aged-care services in the future, whether those services are delivered through an aged-care facility or at home, and we know the aged-care sector is under a lot of stress at the moment. The industry has said it and all those reports have said it. I think it is disappointing that in this budget we did not see anything for aged care for the next 12 months. We saw cuts in the budget but nothing to assist with the infrastructure needs of the aged-care industry and, indeed, for those people requiring aged-care services in their own home. Ms KING (Ballarat) (10.19 am)-I rise to support Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and cognate budget appropriation bills. These bills follow what has been one of the greatest economic challenges of our times. In building the budget, the Rudd government were faced with a considerable challenge: how do we develop a budget that supports local jobs now, a budget which invests in infrastructure in the long run, and a budget that is fiscally responsible? These are challenges faced by the Rudd government at a time when tax receipts have been revised downwards for the forward estimates by $210 billion. They are the facts of this budget. We have made some tough choices in this budget-choices that are in the interests of our nation’s future. We as a government have chosen to borrow responsibly to provide support for our economy at a time when investment is most needed. Almost 70 per cent of the Rudd government’s economic stimulus is going towards nation building, creating jobs today and building our nation’s infrastructure for tomorrow. This economic stimulus is going towards the largest modernisation of schools that this country has ever seen. It is building new road and rail links and investing in new buildings for hospitals and health facilities, and in higher education and TAFEs. Already in my own electorate I have announced $9.5 million in funding to refurbish 85 schools across the Ballarat district, $40.1 million for major infrastructure projects under round 1 of the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program, funding for 59 social housing units constructed across my electorate, $563,000 for Moorabool Shire, $425,000 for Hepburn Shire and $1.5 million for Ballarat City Council to build community infrastructure to improve the well-being of our community. There will be $2.2 million towards a community recreation facility at Creswick, $5 million towards the Eureka Centre for Democracy in Ballarat and some $5.3 million for 18 black spots across my electorate. That is to name just a few of the announcements that have been made. MAIN COMMITTEE In the face of this global recession, the government have chosen to go down the path of building our nation because we know that this downturn in the economy needs to be addressed quickly. It needs to be addressed in the most productive way possible, and that is by building our infrastructure, removing capacity constraints in the economy, training our people and ensuring that our children have access to 21st century facilities to learn in. All of this is so that when this recession ends we will be in the best possible position to grow our economy and grow it strongly. These are the circumstances that we are in today. Our gross domestic product is expected to fall by half a per cent in 2009-10, with a recovery sometime in 2010 or 2011. Unemployment is expected to rise to 8½ per cent by June 2011. Government revenues are expected to continue to decline dramatically. That is why we have announced a third round of stimulus measures, to support our national economy for the long term. But it is not all doom and gloom, as those opposite would lead you to believe. Our economy is facing this challenge in a much stronger position than any other advanced economy. A sturdy financial system, a strong public finance sector and early and decisive action mean that we are in a good position to come out of the other side of this global recession positively. I am proud to be part of a government that has acted so decisively instead of sitting on its hands and doing nothing. Our measures are going a long way toward supporting jobs and protecting families from the impact of the worse global recession in 75 years. I want to go to some of the measures in the budget. As part of the Rudd government’s budget, we have announced we will extend the first home owners boost for an extra six months and then phase it out. This extension has been announced to support jobs and to support those looking to buy their first home. I encourage those in my electorate who are in a position to take advantage of this, and the additional money on offer from the Victorian state government, to act within that extension period. There is no doubt that the first home owners boost has saved the home building and construction industry from significant job losses and injected much-needed funds into local economies. The real estate industry across the Ballarat electorate and those to whom I speak in property development have clearly told me that the first home owners boost has been a significant factor in sustaining their industry during this time of global uncertainty. I would also like to draw attention to our announcement, as part of this budget, to increase the small business and general business tax break from 30 to 50 per cent for eligible assets. At the start of May, the member for Rankin and minister for small business, Craig Emerson, visited the Ballarat electorate. We met with a large number of small business owners. The message from small business was across-the-board support for the original 30 per cent tax break. Over the past fortnight, I have had the pleasure of discussing the Rudd government’s commitment to increasing the tax break to 50 per cent. This is again a measure that is assisting small business but is also designed to keep cash circulating within local economies. I have no doubt that jobs in the retail sector in particular have benefited and will benefit from this initiative. One of the central focuses of this budget is strong investment in major infrastructure projects across the nation. The investment in infrastructure via this budget across the Ballarat electorate is frankly unprecedented. Let me run through some of the projects. As part of the budget, we have allocated funding to have work started on two key major road projects on the Western Highway-one at Anthony’s Cutting, the Djerriwarrh Creek intersection between MAIN COMMITTEE Melton and the town of Bacchus Marsh. We have also committed funds to start work on the Western Highway duplication from Ballarat to Stawell. These projects come on the back of the opening of the Deer Park bypass. The combination of these three projects alone will transform the Ballarat electorate into western Victoria’s regional network hub. At the previous election, members on this side of the House committed to removing infrastructure bottlenecks across the country. We are achieving this commitment through such measures. Not only will regions of the Ballarat electorate be more accessible to Victorians for tourism but local residents will find it much easier to travel to work and to visit family and friends. Combined with this efficiency, this sound investment in major road projects will significantly improve safety on our major roads. It is anticipated that the Anthony’s Cutting project alone will support over 500 jobs, keeping people employed and money circulating through local economies. Other measures have also been implemented locally, as part of this budget, to address road safety. In addition to these large-scale infrastructure projects, $5.3 million is going towards eliminating 18 dangerous black spots on local roads across my electorate, combined with funding for boom gates and other safety measures at six high-risk level crossings. The Rudd government has also been working with local councils to implement its infrastructure program. The Community Infrastructure Program has seen local councils across the Ballarat electorate receive funding from this budget. Community infrastructure projects that have had funding allocated are well underway. I have already opened the first of them in my electorate, at Paddock’s Creek Reserve in Gordon. I congratulate Moorabool Shire and the local community at Gordon on a wonderful job. On top of this, the Rudd government is also providing some $5 million to the City of Ballarat for the Eureka Centre for Democracy. We have committed $2.2 million to the Hepburn Shire Council for the Doug Lindsay Recreation Reserve. Other significant infrastructure projects include the $1.5 million for the Ballarat aquatic centre stage 2 redevelopment, which is just about to commence, and some $200,000 for the Trentham neighbourhood centre renewal. All of this is significant investment that is supporting local jobs and businesses through the current global recession. It will support jobs across building and construction but also across other parts of our economy as the workers employed in that industry spend their wages in our local economy. I also want to mention the National Broadband Network. We have committed to building a $43 billion superfast broadband network, an incredibly important piece of infrastructure for regional areas. The government has allocated in this budget some $54.2 million over two years to implement and establish the National Broadband Network. Across the electorate of Ballarat, I already have major stakeholders keen and interested in the rollout of the network and looking at how they can participate. Residents across my electorate are fully aware of the benefits of the National Broadband Network, the biggest nation-building infrastructure project in Australia’s history. I strongly support the rural and regional initiatives announced as part of the budget and look forward to working with Senator Conroy on how these measures will benefit the various parts of my district. I also want to touch on our Clean Energy Initiative: I support our investment of $4.5 billion in new clean energy initiatives. I welcome the introduction of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the changes to the national renewable energy targets. The Rudd government have MAIN COMMITTEE continually recognised our role in the fight against climate change. This has been reflected in our nation-building plan. It is important in local and regional economies that we take advantage of some of these measures to make sure that we grow green jobs for our future. As part of the budget the Rudd government announced $2.6 billion for tertiary education and innovation infrastructure through the Education Investment Fund. As part of that announcement, I was pleased to announce over $58 million coming into my electorate for the University of Ballarat. The University of Ballarat Vice-Chancellor, David Battersby, stated: We look forward to developing these projects … to add to the learning, teaching, research and industry strengths of Ballarat and its region. This funding is broken down into two major projects: $39.97 million for the university to rebuild its science and engineering precinct to establish a world-class regional learning, teaching and research facility, and $18 million for a manufacturing technology training centre for the University of Ballarat. The $39.97 million for the science and engineering precinct will fund a new three-storey building to enable both the science and engineering disciplines to collaborate and interact in a new multidisciplinary environment. Students, staff and researchers from the university’s mining, engineering and environmental sciences disciplines will all take advantage of this great new facility. The head of school, Dr Kim Dowling, emailed me on the announcement and stated: I am certain many people have thanked you for your support of the University of Ballarat but I wanted to personally thank you for your support of the School of Science and Engineering. The building project ($40 Million for the new Science and Engineering precinct) that was announced in the budget affirms that it is a great time to be in a regional University and this is a clear message of support for our work. There is much to do and I am sure we have some obstacles before us, but I have to say, it is a wonderful time to be in Science and Engineering. The $18 million funding to go to the manufacturing technology training centre at the University of Ballarat’s TAFE campus will provide modern training facilities, both expanding and enhancing diversity and delivery of courses in emerging manufacturing technologies across my electorate. The introduction of state-of-the-art learning technology will address an area of skill shortage in the region by providing job-ready graduates who are familiar with current industry practice. Both these projects are great news for the education sector across Ballarat as we work towards building first-class education facilities. But they are also good news for jobs. Not only will local tradespeople be able to get involved with the building of both these projects but by investing in projects such as a manufacturing technology and training centre we set up our local manufacturing industry for future growth. I also look forward to those opposite and senators supporting this funding for the University of Ballarat in these appropriations. I also briefly want to talk about paid parental leave; it is something which seems to have got a little lost in the post-budget debate. Another measure outlined in these appropriations is our commitment to paid parental leave. This is the first of its kind in Australia and it ensures families can strike a good balance between paid work and supporting their children. The investment is over $731 million over five years and will start from 1 January 2011. The investment will see 150,000 new parents eligible for an income while looking after their children. The Rudd government’s commitment to introducing a paid parental scheme in our country is something that I am very proud of, and is a significant moment in my time as a member of MAIN COMMITTEE parliament. For too long our country has dropped the ball in the area of supporting working families, and members on this side are wholeheartedly supportive of this initiative. I also urge those members opposite to support it. I have no doubt the member for Indi will support the measure, as I note in her speech to parliament on 10 March 2009 she stated: … the Labor Party cannot come up with any funding for a paid parental leave scheme about which it has built such high expectations. We have come up with the money in the budget and we have come up with a decent scheme. I certainly hope the opposition supports it. There are also a number of retirement income measures in the budget. Since the election I have spoken to hundreds of pensioners, as many other members of parliament would have. I have told many pensioners throughout the Ballarat electorate that I am committed to reforming our nation’s pension system. Let us make no mistake about this: there has absolutely been a need for change. Single age pensioners, in particular those who do not own their own home, are some of the financially worse off in our community. Despite years of talking about it in opposition, when in government the coalition did absolutely nothing. After 13 years in government they waited until they were in opposition, a position from which they can actually deliver nothing, to promise pensioners a pay rise-a meaningless promise. They made the promise knowing they would never have to deliver on it. The Labor Party has delivered on its promise. It is the Labor Party that shows it understands the plight of people in poverty and acts to try and alleviate that poverty. As part of this budget we are delivering on our commitment to pensioners. As of 20 September this year, full-rate single pensioners will be delivered increases of $32.49 per week, and full-rate pensioner couples will receive an increase of $10.14 per week combined. For the 15,000 age pensioners across my electorate, many of whom I have talked to about their pensions, this is welcome news. These pensioners across the district will now receive $336.68 per week instead of the $304 they previously received. As part of the budget we have also announced that the new annual carer supplement of $600 will be paid to people who receive carer payment. This payment will be provided to around 450,000 recipients of carer allowance, with an extra $600 for each person they care for. Some 5,000 carers across my electorate will benefit from these changes. These are just some of the income support measures that are happening across my electorate to support local jobs and to grow local economies. I have also outlined the infrastructure projects that are occurring. I would like to recognise the government’s commitment to guide the nation’s finances back to surplus. As I said earlier, the global recession has ripped some $210 billion in government revenue out of the budget. Two-thirds of the budget deficit is as a result of the decline in government revenues. Despite the claims of the opposition, the decline in government revenues is the single largest factor affecting the size of the deficit-a deficit that would therefore exist whether it was us in government or the Liberal Party in government. The Rudd government have put together a budget for the future of Australia. We will continue to work to uphold Australia’s AAA rating given by the Standard and Poor’s rating agency and maintain our nation’s strong financial position. The Rudd government’s decision-making through this budget and other major initiatives will see removal of significant capacity constraints that have been pushing down on our nation’s economy over past decades. Our investment in the long term MAIN COMMITTEE will ensure that we are in a much stronger position financially into the future. We are spending responsibly on those productive elements of the economy to ensure that we have strong growth into the future. It is not possible, given the need to provide financial stimulus to the economy and with the collapse in government revenues, to avoid deficit budgets. That is the untruth of the Liberal Party’s line. If you follow their logic, the only way that there would not be a deficit is to either dramatically increase taxes or to drastically cut government spending. Unfortunately, the opposition has yet to present which of these alternatives it intends to follow. The budget we have delivered is economically responsible. We have delivered a budget that supports jobs. It sets up our nation in the short, medium and longer term. Unfortunately, those opposite have taken a different view. They have decided to run yet another scare campaign-something that is very easy to do from opposition. We obviously managed to do that many times ourselves from opposition. It is clear that the opposition either does not understand what is happening with the global recession or is deliberately refusing to acknowledge it. It is clear that the opposition does not have a plan to support jobs in local economies. That was clear in the lack of any alternative fiscal policy in the Leader of the Opposition’s budget in reply speech. It included a lot of talking down of the economy and a lot of scaremongering, but it did not include an alternative fiscal policy. It feels like only yesterday that former Prime Minister John Howard was in the chamber telling us how, yet again, he would splurge the government’s boost in revenue from the mining boom. As a result of that poorly targeted investment in the past, we have seen increasing pressure on infrastructure bottlenecks, underinvestment in health and education and lack of support in the long-term sustainability of our nation’s jobs. There was so much they could have done in those 13 years with that massive amount of money. They all know that most of this deficit has been caused by the end of the mining boom and the global recession. Those opposite have clearly been outspoken in their opposition to the government’s stimulus plan and in their decision not to support many of the infrastructure building measures-opposing our investment in roads, rail, ports, schools and broadband. Those are all measures to support jobs and to grow our local economy. I challenge those members opposite and duty senators in my electorate who do not believe to visit some of the nation-building projects in my electorate and explain why they have not supported them. I challenge them, when they come to the openings of the school buildingsbecause we, unlike the previous member, will invite duty senators to openings-to explain why they did not support our local economy and why they failed to support investment in local projects. I rise here today proudly to support the budget. I commend these bills to the House. budget debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and cognate bills. We have heard many things in the two weeks since budget night. A budget is more than just a set of financial statements. It very much tells the story of a government at so many levels. A budget shows the competence of a government. A budget shows the priorities of a government and sets a window through which the public can see how their government is really performing. This budget of two and a bit weeks ago, coming halfway through this parliamentary term, has given the Australian people a much clearer view of the Rudd Labor government.

278,Mr Anthony Smith (Casey) (10.39 Am),"It is a pleasure to speak in this importantThrough this budget process the public are beginning to see the true Labor Party. At every level this budget has shown a government that is economically incompetent, a government that panics and bungles, and, most particularly, it shows a government obsessed with spin and silly language. It is obsessed with silly language to the point of comedy. The sad thing about it is that the only people that do not seem to see the comedy are the Labor Party ministers and their backbench. We just heard a 20-minute contribution from the member for Ballarat. I do not single her out; she just happened to be speaking before me. We could check later, but I think she uttered the word ‘decisive’ about five or 10 times-as they all do. It is as if they have been told that every sentence they utter must have one of the Prime Minister or Treasurer’s buzzwords and that somehow that will cover for their economic incompetence and bungling. We saw this begin before the government was elected, but we witnessed it plummet to new depths in the week before the budget. We saw the Treasurer and the Prime Minister talk seriously about temporary deficits for the next six years-six years being a temporary period of time! They persisted with this line day after day. As I have said in previous debates, it is lucky that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are not running a garage, where you dropped your car off and took the temporary car while your car was serviced. Imagine coming back every night for six years only to be told, ‘No, your car is not ready. Stick with the temporary car.’ The language before the budget and the response to it all around Australia, and, rightly, from the press gallery, should have been a warning to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that their obsession with cute lines and tortuous language was wearing thin. In a time of economic difficulty you expect a Prime Minister and a Treasurer to be candid. On budget night we saw something that was utterly amazing. At the end of the day, Madam Deputy Speaker, all of the budget papers and the associated financial statements come down to the budget bottom line. That is what they all add up to. When everything is said and done it comes down to one figure-the surplus or deficit. We saw the Treasurer on budget night stand up and give a 30-minute speech and not mention the budget deficit figure. This was remarkable at one level, but I have to say it was sad for the Treasurer. One day he will realise just what a ridiculous omission that was-thinking that not mentioning the budget deficit figure in the budget speech would somehow conceal it from the Australian people. Just in case that was some accident, the very next day, after the Treasurer had been questioned on budget night about why the figure was not there, we saw him still refusing to be candid and utter the budget deficit figure in a radio interview with Fran Kelly: Kelly: Treasurer, you didn’t say the deficit number in the speech last night. Are you scared of saying it out loud? Wayne Swan: No, I’m not scared of saying the deficit number. Kelly: Do you want to say it now? What is the deficit? Swan: We outlined it in great detail last night and it’s 57. Fifty-seven what? This is juvenile beyond belief. Fifty-seven what? We all know-$57 billion. That is what he is talking about. He is talking about dollars. He could not say it in his budget speech and he could not bring himself to say it the next day. Far from concealing it, he highlighted the economic incompetence of this government and its utter determination to do anything but level with the Australian people. In his own performance he shone a spotlight on MAIN COMMITTEE the failings of this government. Fifty-seven what? ‘$57 billion’ is what he was trying to say, but for those listening to Fran Kelly it could have been 57 hair dryers, 57 hard hats or 57 fluorescent vests-another obsession of this government. You would think that would be enough to make the tactics-obsessed Labor Party say, ‘Hang on-we’ve made a big blue here. We’d better change tack.’ But, no. The Prime Minister gave us a window to see where this was all coming from. It is quite obvious that this was the Prime Minister again at his manic best, because the Prime Minister embarked on a similar ‘don’t mention the war’ strategy when it came to government debt. In the week following the budget the Prime Minister refused to mention the level of debt and the billions of dollars in the one sentence. It was absolutely torturous to watch, and it reached a peak on the Lateline program. Tony Jones must have thought that he was interviewing John Clarke. It made the John Clarke interview at the end of The 7.30 Report look lame. It is something that we have never seen a Prime Minister do before. Tony Jones said to the Prime Minister: ‘What is the actual figure?’ ‘Well, Tony, I’m about to come to that when I go to the constituent parts.’ He refused to answer the question. Tony Jones followed up: ‘But all I’m asking for is one figure.’ Prime Minister: ‘I’m about to come to that. In the budget papers, we’ve been aiming to a gross figure of 13.8, which comes out at about 300.’ Again, 300 what? Jones: ‘That figure is $300-billion is that right?’ Prime Minister: ‘As I said before, 13.8 per cent of GDP as described in the Budget papers.’ Finally, in exasperation, Tony Jones said: ‘Is there a political spin rule which says the Prime Minister must not say that figure? Because it seems very hard to get you to say $300-billion.’ The answer to Tony Jones’s question is yes, there is a political spin rule and political spin dominates this government, at every level. This farce is continuing with the Prime Minister in his interviews. We saw exactly the same tortuous language when it came to whether he would admit he had broken promises. He has broken promises, solemn promises he gave, hand on heart, before the election; many of them. The first to stand out is the promise not to touch, in any way, shape or form, or to alter in any respect the private health insurance rebate. Kevin Rudd signed the letter in his own hand which said: Both my shadow minister for health Nicola Roxon and I have made clear on many occasions this year that federal Labor is committed to retaining the existing private health insurance rebates, including the 30 per cent general rebate and the 35 and 40 per cent rebates for older Australians. He said in a press conference: Private health insurance rebate policy remains unchanged and will remain unchanged. He is prepared to sign his name to a letter and break his own word. On superannuation, just a couple of weeks before the election, speaking on 4BC radio in Brisbane on 12 November, the Prime Minister said: There will be no change to the superannuation laws-not one jot, not one tittle. The day after the budget, the Prime Minister was interviewed by Neil Mitchell on 3AW, Melbourne, who began the interview by asking the Prime Minister: Will you apologise to the Australian people for directly breaking the promises you made before the election? these policy commitments. MAIN COMMITTEE that. We are not talking about the same thing. This is ridiculous, tortuous language. The Prime Minister now says he has not broken any promises because he did not make any promises before the last election. That will be news to the Australian people. He made policy commitments and in the Prime Minister’s crazy world somehow they are different. The Prime Minister wants the Australian people to believe that he did not make a single promise before the election, that he made policy commitments, and it is okay to break those. The Australian people are beginning to wake up to this. Australians are beginning to see a Prime Minister that is more worried about stunts than he is about the detail and about getting it right. They have seen a Prime Minister who will play with the truth and who will do anything to avoid levelling with the Australian people. We saw this in the imagery in the week after the budget: the Prime Minister in a fluorescent vest and hard hat, surrounded by fellow ministers. Whenever you see a fluorescent vest and a hard hat coming, you know the Labor caucus is on the way. It is pretty obvious that in budget week the Labor caucus were not issued with briefing notes on the budget. That has been very obvious this week. The member for Petrie copped some criticism because she could not say at a press conference what the budget deficit figure was. It might shock you, Madam Deputy Speaker, and it might shock my Liberal colleague here, but I felt sorry for the member for Petrie. She sat through the budget speech, and she did not hear the budget deficit figure. She would have sat through the caucus briefing beforehand for half an hour, and what we know from that is that the budget deficit figure would not have been released. When the Labor caucus members came to get their briefing material at the end of budget week for the budget sell in their electorates, they got a kit from Bunnings. They got a hard hat and a fluorescent vest. As I said the other day, when they appear at these sites they should also take a sign: ‘Danger! Reckless spenders in vicinity’. Only today we saw the extent-and this is just one example-of the bungling of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer say money needs to be spent so, therefore, there should be no scrutiny and there should be no care and responsibility for how that money is spent. We have seen today some more detail on an earlier story about the $40 million of the stimulus package and the $900 payments going to dead people and expats. We knew shortly after the release of the February package that the $900 was going to criminals-Kev’s cash for crims. And today we have the headline in the Herald Sun: ‘Dead lucky: PM’s $40 million gift to Aussies in the grave’. Money going from Australia to overseas does not stimulate the Australian economy. Now $40 million might not seem like a lot to the Prime Minister with the amount he is spending, but this is an example of the litany of mistakes that we have seen at every turn from this Prime Minister and from this Treasurer. MAIN COMMITTEE This budget is a budget that Australia has not seen before. It took 10 long years to pay off the $96 billion of debt that the last Labor government left this country. It took 10 long years and it was $96 billion. Now we have debt not seen in our lifetimes and it is at Everest levels. What the Labor Party and those opposite should be saying as they wear their hard hats and fluorescent vests is what the interest cost of that will be for taxpayers not just today but 10, 20 and 30 years into the future, because every dollar borrowed has to be paid back and the interest on that every year is something that will borne by the taxpayers of today and tomorrow. (Time expired) propriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and cognate bills, which are part of one of the toughest budgets that has had to be delivered in Australian history, certainly in the history of the Federation. I hear some snickering from the member for Mayo. He, of course, is part of that chorus of snickering that is taking place on the other side of the House. Looking at history, what does an opposition do? I am not asking what this opposition does; in the Westminster system what does an opposition generally do? As the name suggests, it opposes. But that is a bit of a misnomer. It really should propose rather than oppose, so I guess it should be called the proposition rather than the opposition. But those opposite have lived up to the term ‘opposition’ because it does not matter how constructive our ideas are, how necessary the budget proposals are or what the government puts forward, the opposition just say ‘no’-‘computer says no’; Malcolm Turnbull says ‘no’; the member for Mayo says ‘no’. They do not look at how times have changed. They do not look at the fact that the waves from the world recession have lapped on the shores of Australia. That requires different thinking. It is not like 3 March 1996, when Australia had changed significantly in the previous 10, 11 or 12 years under the Hawke and Keating governments. Significant financial reform had taken place that had a significant impact in the community. It is not like workers had forgone pay rises so that there could be significant workplace reform. It was not the Australia of 2009. Back when John Howard became Prime Minister, all the heavy lifting had taken place beforehand. Hawke and Keating had made significant reforms. I have 20 minutes and it would take me that long to go through all the significant reforms of the Hawke and Keating governments. Under the coalition, one significant reform was put forward, which I will acknowledge. It was basically an accounting readjustment: the GST. In terms of significant financial reform, when Peter Costello looks at his ledger he cannot name anything at all. I always give John Howard his due for three things. One is the fact that he got up and went for a walk every morning, even if he was busy, which is a good message to all Australians. If the Prime Minister is not too busy to go for a walk, then every Australian should be able to go for a walk, or do some exercise like riding a bike. He also brought in the firearm controls, which was quite commendable, and he did work hard for the country-so I acknowledge those three things. But the heavy lifting was done by the Hawke and Keating governments. As to significant reform in Australia, especially in the latter part of the term of the Howard government, when there were rivers of gold flowing into Australia because of the mining boom, nothing was done. Having worked in the mining sector, I have been up to Dalrymple Bay and places like that, flown over Newcastle and seen all those infrastructure bottlenecks where the government MAIN COMMITTEE",143,Appropriation Bill No 2 2009 2010 Appropriation Parliamentary Departments Bill No 1 2009 2010
279,Mr Perrett (Moreton) (10.59 Am),"It is a great honour to speak in support of the Apcould have stepped in and given a helping hand-a bit of guidance-which is what a good reform government does. It has an eye on the horizon rather than on election night. Maybe Howard and Costello were getting bad advice or something like that I am not sure-but they were obviously not prepared to do the heavy lifting and instead did nothing. The Rudd government has come into a situation in which the world’s books are a bit crook. So what do we do? We readjust to that. We look at the fact that we have to do what we can for the future. We have to do a bit of nation building. We have to have the commitment to go into places. We have to think of things like the Snowy River scheme. What is the modern day equivalent to the Snowy River scheme? It is broadband under our streets. That is why we have pumped 70 per cent of our economic stimulus into nation-building infrastructure that will improve all of our schoolsMr Briggs interjectingsaid, ‘We’re looking forward to our schools being improved,’ I am sure he would have said, ‘This is a fantastic way to spend our money.’ It is appropriate to undertake the biggest school modernisation program in Australia’s history. It is unbelievable. I was a school teacher for 11 years so I know how tough it can be for schools, both state and private. Going around my electorate and talking to the teachers, principals, P&C presidents and parents I have found that they love it. They absolutely love it. They, like every MP in this House, give it a big collective thumbs up. They love that we are investing in schools. Every community obviously has a school. But we are not just doing that. In building for the future we are also investing in roads, rail, ports, hospitals, broadband and major solar energy projects. Whether you are in the bush or in the city people are starting to see how we will reap the benefits in the future. ‘Productivity’ is a word that Peter Costello and John Howard did not talk about, or the fact that when they handed over government productivity was at zero. What was it again? Zero. Obviously we needed a budget that was about addressing some of the economic circumstances, because that is what a budget does. Obviously productivityMr Briggs interjectingnot a part of the economy? Productivity is the No. 1 indicator of a healthy economy. During a global economic downturn, such as this government has experienced, we obviously need to step in and do something and not, as is the opposition policy, wait and see. Now that is a great policy! When things are a bit tough, it is okay for any responsible, healthy household to borrow. If you have an income of a hundred grand it is not inappropriate to borrow five grand. No-one would suggest that that is a bad thing. So the government is taking responsible decisions to make sure that that borrowing can be paid off, that we can return the budget to surplus and ensure that our net debt remains the lowest of any major advanced economy in the world. It is great to go around the electorate and see what we have proposed. It is great to look at the black spot projects and how they will save lives. It is great to look at social housing. Now there is a quiet revolution. I think that what we have done and are doing for homelessness is wonderful. I think the Prime Minister’s first white paper was on homelessness. Why? Because MAIN COMMITTEE",147,Mitchell But Don T You Accept There Were Promises Broken Prime Minister Well We Re Talking About Exactly The Same Thing
280,Mr Perrett,When the member for Mayo went to those school meetings where they,148,Mitchell But Don T You Accept There Were Promises Broken Prime Minister Well We Re Talking About Exactly The Same Thing
281,Mr Perrett,"You are not suggesting are you, member for Mayo, that productivity isit is something that he cares passionately about. You judge a society by how it treats those who are less fortunate not how it looks after millionaires, the upper middle class and the like. You judge a society by how it looks after the unfortunate. When the Commonwealth government deserted the field when it came to public housing what did they do? They rewarded landlords. That is how they addressed homelessness. They did not build units of public housing; instead, they said, ‘Landlords, here’s a bit of extra money in your kitty,’ as if that was a good thing, as if that was good policy. Look at the policies we are rolling out which will stimulate jobs and ensure that the builder living next door to me-in fact, I have two builders living next door to me and a plumber living on the other side-will have work. They will be able to go to government web pages and phone up government helplines and find out where the work is. If they are not big enough to win the tender they can phone up the successful tenderer and say, ‘What work do you have for a plumber?’ or a builder, a painter, a glazier or whatever. It is great to be a part of a government that has a plan. We are not the wait-and-see government, we are a government that says, ‘Let’s get out and do the hard stuff.’ We will cop flak from those opposite but, as I said, it would be great to hear them propose rather than oppose; it would be great to hear them put together a proposition rather than just remain the opposition, as if that is their reason for being. It was great to see the other day that credit rating agency Standard& Poor’s reaffirmed Australia’s triple A rating, the highest rating that it gives to any country. That is a great pat on the back for the Prime Minister; it is similar to the pat on the back given to him by President Barack Obama in terms of his saying that this is what we need to do. I think he used the line, ‘IfI had done what the Prime Minister of Australia had suggested, we would all be in a much better place.’ That is high praise indeed from one of the most recognisable and powerful people in the world. So it is great to see that we are doing this responsibly rather than pulling out fancy corflutes in question time. The opposition use lots of stunts and lots of opportunities to say ‘no’ rather than say what they would do. What would be the responsible decisions they would take to make up for the significant income shortfall? Were they at the mining dinner last night? Did they talk to any of the mining companies and say how difficult it has been for the mining companies that have had to lay off person after person-even in a state like South Australia that has only nine or 10 mines? I know there are a couple more good projects on the horizon. for the mining industry it is not something I can support. Nevertheless, in a resource-rich state like Queensland the impact has been significant. People have lost their jobs and whole mining communities have been devastated by this downturn. What do we do? We do something practical. We do what we can to nation build and to give people work. I talked about housing, but we could also talk about the great practical initiative that will help save the planet and also put people in employment, which is our initiative to put insulation into homes and schools and to put solar panels on roofs. These are great policies that create work for both the unskilled and the skilled. There will be work in every community. I am sure the member for Mayo will be taking advantage of that government initiative. He will be getting pink batts in his house I am sure.

283,Mr Perrett,"I think you know my position on uranium. Even though I have workeding that. It will say, ‘Thanks for helping to save the country, Kevin.’ I am sure that sign will appear in the front of his house just as a ‘rainwater tank in use’ sign is used, for example. You have a water shortage in Adelaide, I am sure, because it is all up in Queensland! but I do not live in that town. Then we move onto other significant budget initiatives. If you look through the budget papers, as I am sure people have, we see that we have a plan to combat climate change. It is important that we get funds available to look after climate change, not just between now and election night and not just between now and next budget night but, more importantly, for our children’s sake and our grandchildren’s sake. We need to act now. All of those policies that I have talked about-solar panels, insulation and even infrastructure bottlenecks-are about making sure that we have got a competitive economy, but they are also about recognising the fact that the world has changed. No scientist would argue about the fact that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased significantly since the industrial age. We have got data going back to the early 1830s that scientifically prove that CO2 has increased. Why has it increased? No fair-minded person-although I think there might be a PhD graduate in the chamber who has a slightly different view of climate change-would disagree with the fact that we need to combat the activities that contribute to climate change. That is why the refusal, seven times, by those opposite to make a decision is reprehensible. We are now up to the eighth opportunity to do something but instead they use the good old stand-by policy of ‘Let’s wait, let’s see.’ That is no way to combat one of the most dreadful economic challenges for the country. I look forward to the budget taking effect in my electorate. I have had nothing but positive responses from all sorts of people-from the car sales people at the Moorooka Magic Mile to people involved in schools and P&Cs and people who look after the homeless and others who are doing it a bit tough. I have had positive responses from so many people in the community, including accountants and small businesses. Small businesses are happy to purchase equipment because of the tax breaks, which are not 30 per cent but are going up to 50 per cent. My friends in country electorates, where every pharmacist is a small business person, say that they are making decisions about purchasing, which then have a flow-on effect in the community, which creates wealth in those small communities. I commend the legislation to the House. Ms LEY (Farrer) (11.16 am)-I am pleased to speak today on the appropriation legislation before the House and also to make some comments, from my perspective as shadow minister for Customs, about the Rudd government’s cuts to Customs, broken election promises and the appalling neglect of our border security. But first to the budget and its effect on all Australians, including those in my electorate of Farrer. We have all been horrified at the numbers that have been brought before us in respect of this budget. I had an email this morning from somebody in my electorate who said: ‘Can you stop saying “billions” because we do not get an appreciation from that word about the size of the debt. Could you please start saying “thousand millions”.’ Yes, I can. It is worth reminding ourselves that the debt will rise to $315,000 million by 2015-16. The other point to make about the budget is the government’s response of, ‘We had the global financial crisis’. The only thing that Prime Minister Rudd used the global financial criMAIN COMMITTEE",149,Mitchell But Don T You Accept There Were Promises Broken Prime Minister Well We Re Talking About Exactly The Same Thing

285,Mr Perrett,"You have got to talk to the National Party senators. I am from that townsis for in the context of this budget was cover. It was cover for him to flood money into our communities at a rate not seen in Australia’s post World War II history. It was a cover to buy votes, to buy popularity and to make him and his government look good. The evidence is there in the budget, because it demonstrates that the spend-a-thon is new money that need not have been appropriated. And of course that is what these bills are doing. I and my constituents are alarmed, disgusted and quite afraid-and that is not putting too fine a point on it-when we confront this future debt. From 2006-07 to 2021 or 2022 is how long the Prime Minister and the government tell us it will take to get us back into a surplus position-and that in itself is highly problematic because who could possibly forecast that far into the future. It will take 13 years just to get us right back to where we started. Thirteen years is a long time. It is a lot longer than Mr Swan’s temporary deficit. It is a lifetime at school. It is one or two careers. It is half a mortgage. And to think that 13 years of this country’s history will be involved in this long, drawn out effort to repay debt that need not have been accumulated to this level in the first place is an absolute disgrace. When Mr Rudd comes into the parliament with his ministers and their hard hats, metaphorically speaking-although they are out in the community in their hard hats-and they talk about projects and they challenge whether opposition members support the projects in their electorates, it is a very cheap political stunt and it offends me and my constituents, I can assure you. It is a cheap political stunt because it is the same as saying to people receiving their $900 payment, ‘So you don’t want your $900?’ Of course people would appreciate a $900 payment, and of course people want to see projects, many of which were started under the Howard government, come to fruition in their electorates. It does not mean that we as local members sign off on the economic and financial strategy that has given rise to this expenditure. Again, we welcome new projects that make sense but we do not sign off on the strategy that created them. There has been a lot of talk about the infrastructure spending, and the hard-hat brigadethe 24-hour spin cycle which says ‘appear to be doing something, appear to be moving and travelling, appear to be contributing to the productive economy for the future’. But there was only $8½ billion worth of new infrastructure spending in the budget. There was a lot of talk about a $22 billion or even $25 billion figure-and apologies to my constituents; I cannot keep on saying thousand million. There was talk about this large appropriation, and of course that was raided from the previous government’s surplus. So the new spending is $8½ billion. They are talking it up big, with $1.7 billion of spending in the current financial year. They are not talking that up so big, because $1.7 billion this year is not really that much-not when you compare it to the stimulus packages, which totalled $23 billion. That has all gone out the door, flooding into the Australian community to buy popularity and votes. So we have $23 billion in the stimulus package and $8½ billion over the forward estimates on new spending for infrastructure-which is the Rudd government talking about? If the level of expenditure was so necessary and so important, why are they not shouting from the rooftops about the $900 payments? They don’t talk about those payments at all. I think, by now, they are somewhat ashamed of them. I have a constituent, who does not want to be named, who has received three payments-one for being a student, one for being on a low income and one for no particular reason. He, to his credit, went to Centrelink and said, ‘I have received three payments; this can’t be right’. ‘Oh no, that is right,’ they said, so he has received MAIN COMMITTEE three payments. Today we read in the press that deceased estates have received payments and overseas residents have received payments. I am fairly sure some pets have received payments, too. This stimulus package has been just a shovelling out the door of money at an unprecedented rate, and it all has such a temporary effect. I talk to retailers, and, yes, there may have been a surge in retail spending, but not as much as they thought and not in every retail outlet either. Many people have saved their $900, paid off their mortgage or paid off their credit card. So, yes, there has been an increase in recent retail spending but that is temporary. In another couple of months, when that $900 is gone, it is not going to guarantee that shoppers are going to continue to walk through the door. The essential fundamental problem is still there. The previous speaker and other speakers have talked about this investment in the productive economy. That was the one sad thing about the budget-that if we were going to borrow up big, $315,000 million, taking 13 years to get us back into surplus, you would think that we could have spent it on something productive for the long term. Only $1.7 billion of that has been allocated for infrastructure spending. They are so embarrassed about the infrastructure spending that the government has scooped up a broadband into that as well. On the subject of broadband, there has been no response to my questions to the government as to what happens to the many towns in my electorate that have fewer than a thousand people and miss out on the broadband plan. I do not think the broadband plan makes particularly good sense, and the more people who do not sign up to it, the more expensive it gets. So we have no concept of its cost, the time taken to implement it or the numbers of people who may choose to sign up to it. Many people probably would like these very high speeds and they will work well for them, but what I am detecting in their reaction to the government announcement is that the government is actually going to provide it for them and pay for it and that their costs will not go up. In fact, their costs will go up by perhaps three times. The number of people required to keep the cost at, say, $100 a month in today’s terms is quite large, so if people fall away and say they are happy with their current broadband and with their current speeds, the cost will go even higher. So, for the big regional towns that I represent with over a thousand people, there are big questions about cost. For many of the rural areas I represent, those questions do not arise because they are excluded from the plan; they have been told they will get some sort of satellite second-class option. The problem is that Mr Rudd and his ministers, not one of whom has lived a life in rural Australia, do not appreciate what life is like for us. Back to the budget. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry strenuously insists that drought funding is in place, or at least that the system that allocates it is in place, and that exceptional circumstances will continue. But there are no dollars in the forward years. Maybe they believe that the drought will end; maybe they know something that we do not. But unless they appropriate money to support farmers and rural communities during the drought then I do not buy the line that they are continuing to provide exceptional circumstances drought support. They have a disregard for the agricultural sector of this economy. The cuts to Biosecurity Australia and AQIS have been remarkable. Haven’t we learnt from equine influenza? The Beale review recommend $260 million minimum in new spending on quarantine, but instead we have staff positions and resources cut from AQIS. MAIN COMMITTEE The very department that administers AQIS and the agriculture budget, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, seems to have been singled out for special punishment in the budget because it has to meet a double efficiency dividend. In a previous life, I was the parliamentary secretary for agriculture. I thought and do think very highly of that department. There is no waste that resides there that needs to be extravagantly cut. I can only assume that in cabinet the minister did not sufficiently stick up for his department and the work that it does to prevent this extraordinary decision. The biggest reaction to the budget in my electorate has been the response to the changes to youth allowance. That has been spoken about much in this House and I will certainly return to it when the bills are introduced. I look forward to the opposition-initiated Senate inquiry, which will reveal the truth of the matter. That truth is that rural students from modest families are going to be excluded from going to university. If we want to be as equitable as we should be in terms of access to education, we should recognise this simple statistic: right now, twice as many students from the city are reflected in university attendees as are students from the country. We are already significantly underrepresented. That concerns me. It is not the case that students from the country are less bright or even less willing to go to university, but they are a hell of a lot less able to get there and pay their way. Parents carefully work out a plan to send their children to university. And remember that this is not parents signing cheques and young people sitting there living off their parents. Youth allowance is just a supplement. They need to work and their income is also supplemented by savings from their parents. The youth allowance is an important component of their support while studying away from home. By the way, those who are currently between school and university do not even get a mention. The clock seems to have to start for them again from 1 January next year. They have not been grandfathered in these provisions and that is totally out of order. In order to qualify for independent allowance, students will have to work 30 hours a week for an 18-month period within two years. It is not possible for students in small rural towns to find a job for 30 hours a week for 18 months, so they then have to leave home. If they leave home, they have to support themselves. If they cannot go to university, they have to leave home, set themselves up in separate accommodation somewhere and get a job to qualify for youth allowance two years later in order to go to university. Meanwhile, their university place has lapsed, because deferrals generally do not last for longer than 12 months. That means they have to reapply. What career advisers tell us is that by the end of two years students have lost interest, their life has taken a different direction or it has all just become too hard. Students have come to me and said, ‘IfI can see the financial pressure that this is going to place my mum and dad under, I just do not want to do it.’ We see that in the country a lot. We have seen it with the present drought. I see young people on farms in western New South Wales. I wonder what they are doing there because they have recently left school. I think they should be entering the next stage in their life, but they have come home from further study, often in Melbourne or Adelaide, to help because they cannot in all conscience leave their parents to struggle with a drought which, in many cases, has gone on for five or 10 years. We are going to see the same thing. We are going to see students saying: ‘I’ll do something else, Mum and Dad. I won’t go to university. It’s something I can pick up later.’ But do not MAIN COMMITTEE think that young people do not have a dream to go to university, if that is what they want, and do not think that the destruction of that dream by the present policy is anything short of appalling. We all have different philosophical perspectives and we come to this place with those different perspectives, and it is important that we respect alternative views-that is the foundation of our democracy-but I do not understand or accept this sudden, savage attack on rural students. That is whom it will affect. There are rallies being held across north-east Victoria and southern New South Wales. I hope that the strength of view that is expressed in those rallies is going to get through to the education minister and members opposite. They probably do not represent rural electorates to the same extent that we on this side do, but they certainly have regional students in their areas. I ask members opposite to get this message through. I understand that there were inconsistencies, even rorts, in the previous system. Fineattack those and use policy instruments to correct the loopholes that apparently very wealthy parents and students were able to find. I have no problem with that. I am not saying we should restore the system to what it was before. WhatI am saying is: please do not attack rural students so that we lose our best and brightest from universities. In the few minutes remaining I will talk about the effect on Customs, the area for which I am the opposition spokesperson. In spite of a promise to increase the level of air and sea cargo inspections made last year and the year before, the Rudd government has cut $58 million from the Customs budget. There was a promise prior to the last election that there would be an increase in the X-raying and inspection of containers arriving at our ports from overseas. In fact, we saw the first stage of that promise being implemented at the end of last year, with container inspections in Adelaide and Darwin nominated to increase from five per cent to 7½ per cent. Apparently all that is unnecessary now. A container that might have been risky before the budget is no longer risky, is no longer deserving of inspection and will not be looked at. One in 20 does not sound like very many containers to inspect. We understand that we use this risk based approach because you cannot inspect every container. Intelligence needs to be applied to which ones are likely to contain smuggled goods-including drugs, weapons, cigarettes and alcohol-on which excise is not being paid, but I can only assume that, without additional intelligence being applied and with the target being lowered, we will see more illegal drugs, weapons, narcotics, cigarettes, alcohol and smuggled wildlife. I will throw in illegal fishing, which does not come in a container, but illegal fishing is important too. All these events are going to occur. From the point of view of men and women on the street, we are going to see more drugs on our streets, more drugs being pushed in our nightclubs and more kids being subjected to this scourge. Do not think that it will not happen, because Australia is a top market for the sale of drugs. We have some of the highest prices for ecstasy and cocaine in the world. So, if you are pushing those drugs, come on down. This is where international drug syndicates know they can get the highest price for their products. Precursor chemicals do not attract a huge fine. Precursor chemicals for pseudoephedrine and amphetamine type stimulants are not necessarily illegal on their own, so sometimes the fine is not huge and the risk is low for someone to send perhaps several drums of these from South-East Asia. If they get caught with three, they might get one drum through. Once it is cooked into amphetamines the damage that it will wreak on our streets is, as we all know, enormous. It is a weakening of the Tough on Drugs strategy, on which the then opposition MAIN COMMITTEE agreed with the previous government. Tough on Drugs was a bipartisan position and this is a crack, a chink, in our armour. So a reduction in air and sea cargo inspections is not something we welcome. It is something we are very concerned about. There was a big fanfare on budget night about the increases to border protection because of the unauthorised arrivals et cetera. One of these increases concerned the bay class vessels, the Customs and Border Protection fleet of vessels that are nearing the end of their life. In Senate estimates yesterday, it was revealed that a further $1 million has been allocated to study what we should do after the Bay class vessels go out of service. So there was $1 million from the previous budget and $1 million from this budget. In estimates yesterday we could not get a response as to what value we had received for this $2 million. We are simply going to continue in a holding pattern, keeping the vessels that are nearing the end of their life and not making any plans for replacement. As we all know, you do not just click your fingers and say, ‘We’re going to replace our vessels.’ You actually have to embark on a program of ordering, construction et cetera, and that is nowhere near happening. The government talked up big about the Triton Customs vessel. In fact, all they were doing was extending its lease-business as usual-and bringing the Oceanic Viking from the Southern Ocean to the northern ocean, moving one asset. But I have not received a guarantee that the entire coastline of Australia is going to be protected in the same way, so we might be cannibalising hours spent patrolling other areas to move that vessel to the north. Serious infrastructure decisions are being delayed by this government. Yes, there are additional flying hours. They add up to 20 hours a week of aerial surveillance, with two additional leased aircraft, but I do not believe that is enough. The intelligence effort allocated to overseas countries is insufficient. (Time expired) the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2009-2010 and cognate bills. In beginning to do so, I want to address the economic background to the bills, the canvas against which the Treasurer needed to frame this budget. I want to note particularly that this seemed completely absent from the opposition leader’s reply. There was no consideration of the gravity and the magnitude of the global recession confronting Australia and pretty much every other country around the world-with the exception, perhaps, of North Korea. It is 75 years since we confronted anything of this magnitude. The global recession that we confront today has a depth and a breadth that none of us have ever confronted. Though it started in the American financial and housing markets, it has spread all around the world and no-one who is at all connected to the global economy is immune. It has impacted on equity markets and financial markets which around the world are still quite sclerotic. It has impacted on industrial production, on business investment, on consumer confidence and, importantly for these purposes, on government revenue, but most importantly it has impacted already and will continue to impact on jobs. Jobs is the central theme of this budget and the other responses which the Rudd Labor government has made to the global recession over the last five months. For the first time since World War II, the world economy will shrink. In 2009 it is forecast to shrink by about 1½ per cent. Although there have been quarters since World War II where the world economy has shrunk, this will be the first full year that sees shrinkage in world GDP. For example, following the 1974 oil shock and global economic downturn, the world MAIN COMMITTEE",150,Mitchell But Don T You Accept There Were Promises Broken Prime Minister Well We Re Talking About Exactly The Same Thing
286,Mr Butler (Port Adelaide) (11.36 Am),"It is a pleasure to rise and speak in favour ofeconomy that year still grew by two per cent. After the 1981 oil shock the global economy still grew by one per cent. This will have a very serious impact on the global economy. We will also see, for the first time since World War II, the sharpest downturn in world trade that any of us have seen, and this is particularly impacting on advanced economies. It is forecast that in 2009 the GDP of the advanced economies collectively will shrink by around 3¾ per cent, although we think our shrinkage will be limited to about half a per cent. There are particular countries where this downturn is impacting with very great severity, and I would point particularly to our largest export market, which is still Japan, where the economy is suffering a very severe contraction. Industrial production in the December quarter of 2008 in Japan shrank by 11 per cent. In the March quarter it shrank by 22 per cent. This industrial production is fuelled by Australian raw materials that have been exported to Japan for most of the postwar period and is the reason why Japan remains, although not our largest trading partner, our largest export market. There has been some recent recovery in Japan’s industrial production, which is pleasing, but it remains to be seen whether that has not been something of a dead cat bounce as Japanese producers seek to restore the inventories that they wound down over the last several months. Other major trading partners of Australia are suffering similar contractions, though not as severe as Japan’s. I point particularly to the US and the UK, both of which are suffering quite significant contractions, and to other countries of the EU and to Korea. In that picture of gloom, perhaps the only slightly hopeful note is China, where GDP growth appears to have come back to about six per cent. That sounds good, but we all know that the Chinese economy needs to grow at around eight per cent if it is going to absorb the many millions of workers who are moving from the countryside to the cities. Growth of 6.1 per cent is not sufficient to keep the Chinese economy going at the pace that is needed to absorb those workers. But what we have seen very recently is industrial production turning back up. We know that, in the October to February period, Chinese exports dropped by about 25 per cent. This is of very significant concern to Australia, given that our raw material exports drive industrial production, which in turn drives Chinese exports. We have seen, though, in the last month or so industrial production starting to turn up again in China, which is pleasing. Overall, our exports have been hit very hard. An industry very dear to my heart, and which does not attract as much public attention as some, is tourism. It is the largest service export industry in Australia and accounts for about 10 per cent of total Australian exports in services and goods. We have seen very big declines in traditional markets by way of international arrivals. In the traditional markets, we have seen a drop of 16 per cent in the 12 months to February in business arrivals, a drop of 29 per cent in convention based international arrivals and a drop of about six per cent in leisure arrivals. Those are for the 12 months to February. The figures that are out now for March and April show that those declines are continuing. We have seen continuing increases in the VFR-visiting friends and relatives-market and in the education market, which are mitigating those losses to some degree. But tourism is suffering already as a result of the global economic recession, and we expect it to suffer more as a result of the growing swine flu pandemic. But the greatest attention is being paid to resource exports, which are obviously being hit very hard as a result of the decline in industrial production in countries that I have mentioned, such as Japan and China. Global steel production has declined very significantly over the last MAIN COMMITTEE several months. There has been some pick-up in recent weeks in China. Again, one expects that is simply to rebuild inventories that were depleted over the last several months. It is too early to tell whether those increases in production will be sustained or whether they are short term. However, what we do know is that our major exports for steel production of iron ore and coking coal have dropped in the six months to March by about 12 per cent and 23 per cent respectively. Those are very significant declines in the country’s export earnings and, as a result, in government revenue. Inevitably, all of this has affected the Australian economy. The GDP figures for Australia are expected to decline by about half a per cent in 2009-10. Although this is a decline, it compares favourably to the advanced economies around the world that are expected to shrink by about 3¾ per cent. Business investment is expected to be hit especially hard. We are already seeing that flow through in the economy as some of the pipeline projects that were started before the impact of the recession come to an end. We expect business investment to decline by about 18½ per cent in 2009-10. These declines are across the board. We are already seeing declines in capital imports, which are having some good results for our current account deficit but which overall are bad. We are seeing very significant declines in non-residential construction, another very major part of business investment. Because of these impacts, the very important story for these purposes is a huge hit on government revenue-a hit which we expect to be of the order of $210 billion out to 2012-13, about $23 billion for the current financial year of 2008-09 and to grow to $50 billion for the next financial year, 2009-10. Compare this to the good fortune enjoyed by the previous Treasurer. In the last five years of his stewardship of the Australian budget, the BCA estimatesrevisions in his last five budgets totalling around $87 billion. We can all continue to wonder where that money went. Confronted with the magnitude of this global recession and its impact on the Australian economy, the Rudd government has acted, since the beginning of this recession and the impact of the global financial crisis around the world, decisively. That decisive action has come, effectively, in three stages. The first stage was the government’s Economic Security Strategy of October, which was rolled out in December 2008. That was effectively an adrenaline shot to the economy in order to prevent an immediate collapse in confidence and a resulting collapse in jobs. There were very clear targets there: household spending and residential construction. These were seen, on advice from the Treasury and other economic institutions, as being the best way to get money quickly into the economy and preserve jobs. All of the relevant figures show that that strategy worked. Anecdotally, in my electorate, the largish department store just across from my office reported to me that they were up by about 15 per cent over the Christmas period compared to the same period in 2007. One small business, which I spoke to when I asked them to do some work for me, reported that they had had their best summer period-December and Januaryin eight years. Hospitality venues were reporting the same thing to me. They were reporting very good takings in the food and beverage sections. Broadly, as I said, the macrofigures for MAIN COMMITTEE",155,Mitchell But Don T You Accept There Were Promises Broken Prime Minister Well We Re Talking About Exactly The Same Thing
287,Mr Briggs,You’re better than this. Come on!,157,Mitchell But Don T You Accept There Were Promises Broken Prime Minister Well We Re Talking About Exactly The Same Thing
288,Mr Butler,"that is, the member for Mayo’s good friends the BCA-showed upwardthe retail and housing sectors showed that the government’s strategy from October to December was spot on. The second stage of the government’s response to this recession was the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. It was opposed by the coalition, to their shame. It is currently being rolled out in every electorate around the country. There is no better way to disperse economic activity than by targeting schools. The $15 billion greatest school modernisation program in Australia’s history is being enjoyed by parents, teachers and students. It will be enjoyed by future parents and future students for many, many years to come. In spite of some pretty cynical media coverage in the days following the announcement of this plan, the response from teachers, principals, school councils and parents in my electorate has been overwhelmingly positive. The social and public housing aspects of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan will see the greatest injection of money and the greatest building program for public and social housing since World War II. This will be great for Australia as a whole. For a state like South Australia, which has a very proud history in this area, it will be a wonderful thing. The energy efficiency aspects of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan mean that 2.2 million homes will receive insulation and all of the economic and environmental benefits of that. Again, that has been very well received in my electorate. Finally, for the second stage, the Jobs and Training Compact initially targets seven regions around Australia, including northern and western Adelaide in my electorate of Port Adelaide. We have already seen unemployment figures in the 12 months to February 2009-and I cannot remember the precise figures off the top of my head-rising from something like 5.7 or 5.8 per cent to about 8.2 or 8.3 per cent. The Prime Minister has recognised that our region of South Australia-northern and western Adelaide-needs some very immediate action to support and sustain it and to create jobs. The third stage that I want to talk about briefly that is set out in this budget and in these bills is investing in Australia’s long-term economic infrastructure. Compare that to the way in which the previous Treasurer, the member for Higgins, frittered away the benefits of the mining boom and frittered away the upward revisions totalling about $87 billion in the last five budgets he handed down. At the end of his stewardship of Australia’s budget and Australia’s economy, the member for Higgins left Australia ranking somewhere around 20th out of 25 OECD nations in terms of infrastructure investment-a lack of activity that created bottlenecks in the Australian economy totalling around $8 billion to $10 billion of lost economic activity in Australia each year. Although it is hard to compare apples with apples, the best estimate you can make is that the infrastructure investment generated by the member for Higgins in the latter part of his stewardship of the Australian economy was around the same percentage of GDP as it was in the late 1980s. Given the economic good fortune that was enjoyed by Australia over the last decade, that was a shameful contribution to the long-term economic prosperity of our country. There are a couple of other budget measures I want to talk about briefly-firstly, pensions. There are over 30,000 people in my electorate, whom I represent, who receive one form of pension or another. Early last year I conducted an eight-page survey of older people in my electorate and had 2,500 responses, so there were 20,000 pages of data that someone in my office analysed. They analysed very clearly and specifically the income and expenditure of the average pensioner in my electorate. As a result, I was able to make a pretty substantial subMAIN COMMITTEE mission, I think, to the Harmer review, calling for an increase in the base rate of the pension, and I am very, very pleased that even in a very tough budget this government has been able to find its way through to a significant increase in the single age pension in particular, because all of us who have looked at this know that the single age pension needed a significant boost. Although we would have liked to see more money going to couples, the more you give to couples, the more you have to give to singles if you are going to reach that benchmark of two-thirds of the couple rate being the single rate. SoI think all of us realised that this one-off hit needed to have a bias in favour of singles, and I am glad to see it. Also, carers and those on the disability support pension, not just age pensioners, will be receiving this and more. One aspect of this budget that I am particularly pleased about is related to a concern that I picked up from my surveys and in the course of last year-that, for pensioners in public housing, whatever increase came from the federal government would be lost, to the tune of 25 per cent, to state public housing authorities. I took that up with our state government in South Australia by writing to the Treasurer some weeks before the budget, foreshadowing the likelihood of a significant increase in the pension and asking that the state government quarantine that increase from the public housing rents. I am proud to say that the South Australian state government was the first state government to respond to the Prime Minister’s call for state governments not to take 25 per cent of the pension increases that are flowing from this budget, something that I think is very important. I would also like to mention the provision for paid parental leave in this budget, which is long overdue in this country. This country remains one of only two OECD nations, the other being the United States of America, that does not have a statutory paid parental leave entitlement. Very quickly, what it means is that, although we rank 10th in the OECD in terms of female labour participation, we rank 23rd in the OECD for female participation at childbearing age. All the experts and research show a very clear correlation between supporting female workers during their early stages of motherhood and labour participation. This is not only an important social reform; this is very important economic reform to improve labour participation. If we were able to reach the labour participation rate for female workers in Canada, as a percentage of total females, we would add an extra 200,000 workers of prime working age to Australia’s labour force, and that would be a very significant contribution to the Australian economy. The last thing I will say in the very short time that remains is that I and the people in my electorate of Port Adelaide were very pleased to see budget support for the core elements of the defence white paper-in particular, confirmation that we will be building at least three air warfare destroyers over coming years in Port Adelaide. I hold out hope that we can make the case on an industry basis, but most importantly on an operational basis, for a fourth air warfare destroyer before the time comes for Port Adelaide’s expert workers to begin constructing the next generation of submarines. This was a tough budget but one I am very pleased to speak in support of. dress a couple of the issues raised in the debate. Firstly, I support the member for Port Adelaide on the last issue he raised about the capabilities of the South Australian defence industry to meet the government’s white paper desires. It is an industry which has been built up very MAIN COMMITTEE",157,Mitchell But Don T You Accept There Were Promises Broken Prime Minister Well We Re Talking About Exactly The Same Thing
289,Mr Briggs (Mayo) (11.56 Am),"by leave-I seek to make some further remarks to adstrongly in recent years, with a lot of support from the former government. It has the bipartisan support of those of us in South Australia. It does a very good job. We hope very much that this government is able to ensure that the work conducted in relation to building more defence assets is done through that industry in South Australia. It would benefit the member for Port Adelaide very much, of course. In this debate we heard from the last couple of speakers on the other side about the supposed great bars of gold raining down on the previous Australian government and that the previous Prime Minister and Treasurer did not have a very difficult task at all-that they had an amazing run of gold rush and so forth-which of course is simply not true. It was good management-dedicated and strong economic management-which led to surplus budgets and low unemployment. I will not hold up the Main Committee’s time and, on that note, will conclude my very brief remarks. 2009-2010 and cognate bills. The test for any budget is how well it addresses the needs of the present while also investing in a sustainable future. The 2009-10 Commonwealth budget reflects how the Rudd government has ably addressed this dual challenge. The current global economic crisis has presented the Rudd government with an additional challenge. However, despite the difficulties presented in the current economic climate, this budget represents the Rudd government’s commitment to stimulate the economy and support the jobs of millions of hard-working Australians. It provides the necessary stimulus to ensure that the Australian economy is well placed to emerge from the worse global recession since the Great Depression. Simultaneously, the budget lays the foundation for future productivity and prosperity by investing $22 billion in vital infrastructure such as transport, schools and hospitals. Put simply, this budget is about nation building for recovery. Prior to the last election, Labor warned that the Australian economy could not simply continue to ride on the back of the resources boom. We recognised the need to invest in infrastructure and education to support our productivity, to remain prosperous and to boost our international competitiveness. This budget shows that the Rudd government remains determined to fulfil this objective. The impact of the global recession highlights that Australia can no longer rely on record company tax receipts generated by an unprecedented resources boom to maintain a healthy fiscal position. Much of the $210 billion decline in revenue in this budget is a result of a shortfall in tax revenue, particularly company tax. The previous government wrongly assumed that our trading partners, particularly China, would continue to demand our commodities. They wrongly assumed that the resources boom would last indefinitely. Worse still, they squandered the benefits of this boom, using it to buy votes rather than invest it in nationbuilding infrastructure. Their misguided and short-sighted approach to economic policy has resulted in significant long-term problems. The global financial crisis shows that we can no longer rely solely on the commodities sector as the principal source of our economic prosperity. That is why we need to invest in infrastructure, schools and universities, hospitals and ports, roads and railways. We need to invest in infrastructure so as to diversify our economy and to ensure we no longer rely on one sector to keep our economy strong. A nation that does not invest in this productivity-boosting infrastructure is effectively robbing future generations of their prosperity. MAIN COMMITTEE",159,Mitchell But Don T You Accept There Were Promises Broken Prime Minister Well We Re Talking About Exactly The Same Thing
290,Mr Murphy (Lowe) (11.58 Am),"I rise today to support Appropriation Bill (No. 1)The infrastructure spending announced in the 2009-10 budget supports job creation in the short term whilst also providing the facilities with which to grow our economy. We are investing in a knowledge-based economy that values education and innovation. We are investing in a low carbon, low pollution economy that tackles the real challenge of climate change and supports green-collar jobs. And we are investing in a digital revolution that will increase the efficiency and productivity of businesses throughout Australia by building a national broadband network. Labor governments are nation-building governments and the Rudd government is certainly no exception. With a $22 billion investment in nation-building infrastructure, such as roads, ports, clean energy and universities, this budget ensures that Australia is well placed to emerge from the recession in a much stronger economic position than many other developed countries. I welcome a number of key measures that will develop much needed infrastructure in my electorate of Lowe. In particular, I note the provision of up to $6.95 million to local councils in my electorate through the Community Infrastructure Program. This ensures local councils have the necessary funds to build and renew local infrastructure such as community centres, town halls, parks and playgrounds, pools and sporting localities. This investment by the Rudd government will support jobs, small business and families. This is an economically and socially responsible program. The investment will support jobs and stimulate the local innerwest economy. The investment in infrastructure will deliver lasting social benefits and a stronger community. I also welcome the allocation of $1.16 million to local councils to assist in the upgrade and maintenance of local roads. Again, this funding will support jobs and provide lasting benefits with safer passage for people and goods. This budget also recognises the role that a strong education system plays in developing a productive and prosperous economy. Whilst the opposition preaches the virtues of unfair and unjust workplace laws as a means of boosting productivity, the Rudd government recognises that the answer lies in a world-class education system. That is why on budget night we allocated $2.6 billion over six years in infrastructure projects, including $613 million to fund 11 higher education and 12 vocational education and training projects. The Rudd government is committed to building a world-class tertiary education system. We aim to have an additional 50,000 students attend university by 2013 and we will achieve this by removing the cap on the number of public university places from 2012 to ensure that anyone who is eligible for a place of their choice can secure one. Moreover, we will spend $394 million over four years to encourage young people from low-income families to attend university. An individual’s socioeconomic background should not determine the attendance of a student at university. For this reason, I welcome the announcement by the Deputy Prime Minister prior to this year’s budget that the government will pursue vigorously the ambition that, by 2020, 20 per cent of higher education enrolments at an undergraduate level will be people from low socioeconomic backgrounds. In total, universities will share in $5.7 billion in new funding for education and innovation as a result of this budget. Secondary education, I am pleased to note, will receive over $62 billion from 2009 to 2012. The proposed funding by the Rudd government signifies our commitment to Building the Education Revolution. On this point, I would like to acknowledge that three schools in my electorate were successful in obtaining funding in the first round of the Primary Schools for MAIN COMMITTEE the 21st Century program. Combined, those schools will receive over $7 million to build new halls and libraries. Further, under the National School Pride program, the Rudd government has already delivered millions of dollars to my schools for projects such as covered outdoor learning areas, upgrades of playgrounds, replacement of old electrical wiring, refurbishment of dilapidated teaching areas and specific-purpose classrooms. The works on these facilities will support job creation and ensure that students at these schools enjoy the best possible education in the long term. Amazingly, the Liberal Party opposed this measure earlier this year, and the shadow Treasurer suggested on the ABC’s Q&A program on 14 May that the opposition opposed this measure. When asked what the Liberal Party would do to reduce the size of the deficit, the shadow Treasurer said: One of the hardest decisions we made was to oppose the $42 billion package that the government came up with earlier this year … a lot of that money is still to go out the door … and that’s where the $25 billion at least would be saved on the amount of money they’re spending today. It seems that the shadow Treasurer was suggesting that we should not spend the remaining $25 billion of the Nation Building and Jobs Plan. If this is the case, let us take a moment to consider what it would mean for our economy if the Liberal-National coalition were in government. A coalition government would have no choice but to cut much of the $14.7 billion allocated to schools as part of the Building the Education Revolution program. They would have no choice but to cut funding for ceiling insulation and solar hot water. They would also have no choice but to cut funding for public and community housing, as well as defence housing. Therefore, the stimulatory benefits generated by these projects would not eventuate, leaving our economy more exposed to the negative effects of the global recession, such as higher unemployment. This would be the stark picture if the coalition were in government. Thankfully, they are not. It is astounding that the opposition are still opposed to increased federal funding for schools. In my electorate of Lowe, local schools were delighted that the Rudd government finally recognised the shortfall of funding after 10 years of neglect from the coalition government led by the former Prime Minister John Howard. One principal in my electorate noted how her school desperately needed the funding for several important projects. She noted that an increase in enrolment numbers will now continue and that the construction and renovation of facilities under Building the Education Revolution were paramount for a safe and convivial learning environment. AndI am pleased to reiterate that, despite the difficult economic circumstances the Rudd government now face, we will continue to invest in education and to support our schools. We will continue to fund the education revolution, because it is the right decision, and the schools in Lowe clearly understand this. The budget reaffirms our commitment to building a highly skilled economy. As the global recession progresses, unemployment will naturally rise. Unfortunately, when people are unemployed they often lose skills and, understandably, some of them become less inclined to look for work. The Rudd government do not blame people for being unemployed. Rather, this budget demonstrates that we will do everything in our power to help the unemployed find work. The $1.5 billion over five years for the Jobs and Training Compact will support young Australians, retrenched workers and local communities. In particular, $438 million of the compact initiative will be allocated specifically to providing immediate assistance to reMAIN COMMITTEE trenched workers, including access to intensive employment services, 10,000 training places through the Productivity Places Program and increasing the liquid assets test threshold. In the last couple of months a number of my constituents have been made redundant and are seeking help in their search for work. I know that these services, provided under this budget, will be of valuable assistance to those people. Climate change is a real and serious economic challenge that cannot be ignored. This budget responds to the challenge by investing in green infrastructure that will lay the foundation for a low-carbon future. At the heart of this is a $4.5 billion investment in the Clean Energy Initiative. This includes $2 billion over nine years for carbon capture and storage demonstration projects and $1.5 billion over six years for up to four large-scale solar electricity generation projects. The Clean Energy Initiative highlights the Rudd government’s firm commitment to addressing climate change. These measures will assist Australia in becoming a lowcarbon, low-pollution economy. Unlike the opposition, we are committed to an emissions trading system. The coalition’s policy is to delay the introduction of such a system, which is a reflection of the climate change scepticism that exists among the coalition. Many of the opposition members, in my view, are not serious about addressing climate change. I am a firm believer that a society should be judged by how it treats its most vulnerable citizens, and for this reason I am also proud to be a member of the Rudd government which has provided much-needed support to pensioners in this budget. I applaud the increase of $32.49 per week to full-rate single pensioners and $10.14 per week to pensioner couples. I note that this will benefit more than 15,000 pensioners in my electorate of Lowe. I am also particularly pleased that carers have been recognised in the budget. I welcome the carer supplement of $600 per annum for carer payment recipients and the additional $600 per annum for carer allowance recipients for each eligible person in their care. Another important measure in the budget, a first in Australian history, is the introduction of a government funded paid parental leave scheme. I am extremely pleased that the Rudd government has taken the first steps to join the majority of the world in providing paid parental leave for working Australians. Prior to this budget, Australia and the United States were the only developed economies without a national paid parental leave program. Even the Congo and Ethiopia have had long standing paid maternal leave programs. In the budget the Treasurer announced that, from January 2011, Australia will finally have a federally funded paid parental leave scheme. This scheme will be paid at the federal minimum wage of $543.78 for 18 weeks. I also draw to the attention of the House comments by the Sex Discrimination Commissioner, Elizabeth Broderick, who said the scheme was a ‘major triumph for not only mothers and parents but for our community’. I could not agree more. Small businesses are the backbone of our national economy, and they are the backbone of the economy of Sydney’s inner west, where my electorate is. One of the finest features of the Lowe electorate is the large number of small businesses there. One has only to walk down the main streets of Lowe, including Majors Bay Road, Concord; Great North Road, Five Dock; or Burwood Road, Burwood-to name a few-to understand just how prominent and important these businesses are in my electorate. Since the budget was handed down I have spoken with numerous small business owners in my electorate. The overwhelming feeling is one of relief. They have welcomed measures that support small businesses and are appreciative of the support the Rudd government is providing to our economy. This includes $141 million to inMAIN COMMITTEE crease the tax breaks for small businesses from 30 per cent to 50 per cent for eligible assets costing at least $1,000 during 2009 for use by the end of 2010. Small business owners in my electorate have also expressed strong support for the newly announced Small Business Support Line, which will provide much needed assistance to small businesses during the economic downturn. I applaud the small business measures announced in the budget, and so do the majority of the small business people that I represent in this place. I mentioned at the beginning of my speech that Australia could no longer rely on record company tax receipts generated by the resources boom. Australia needs tax reform to ensure that any future slowdown in global economic growth never again results in such significant crippling of our revenue base. I eagerly await the release of the Henry tax review. I have no doubt that the recommendations of this review, coupled with the government’s infrastructure investment, will pave the way for future productivity growth and prosperity. The severe decline in government revenue as a result of the global recession has led to a deficit of $57.6 billion and has given us no choice but to borrow responsibly. The infrastructure investment contained in this budget, the investment in schools and universities and ports and rail, will boost the productive capacity of our economy and provide a source of future growth. As our economy grows as a result of this infrastructure, we will be in a strong position to repay our borrowings. It is basic economic theory that governments need to spend money in times of downturn to stimulate the economy. HSC students currently studying economics right through to prominent and respected economists like Saul Eslake, Stephen Long and Ross Gittins understand and accept this. Why, then, is the opposition so intent on running such a misguided fear campaign about deficits and debt? I refer the House to comments by Stephen Koukoulas, global strategist for TD Securities, who has described this budget as a ‘nine out of 10 budget, a solid effort in the middle of the great recession’. He went on to say, about the government: … it has limited the extent and time in which the Budget will be in deficit by offsetting some of the areas of economic stimulus with spending cuts and criteria tightening; it has a realistic set of economic parameters underpinning its projections and importantly, it is as clear as the smirk on Peter Costello’s face that the government will return the budget back to surplus as soon as economic conditions permit … This all adds up to a Budget that is a well balanced approach to economic management. To do less would have compelled the economy to an even weaker performance and even higher unemployment: To do more would have threatened to damage the country’s AAA credit rating. This is about right. The opposition, who criticise this budget, would do well to consider these wise words from Stephen Koukoulas. Then again, it does not surprise me that the Liberal Party is criticising the spending measures contained in this budget. After all, the Rudd government has done what the Howard government could not-invest in infrastructure that will drive Australia’s future economic prosperity. Perhaps we should ask ourselves then what the Liberal Party would have done if they were still in government. Indeed, the former Prime Minister, John Howard, indicated what he would have done in a recent interview with Sky News. When asked, Mr Howard began to eulogise his beloved Work Choices. That is right; he believes that the best way to address a recession is to continue with policies that strip the pay and conditions of hard working Australians. This would only serve to shatter consumer confidence, slash consumer spending and MAIN COMMITTEE further weaken aggregate demand. This raises an important question: how many members of the current parliamentary Liberal Party agree with their former leader? I give Mr Howard credit for one thing: at least he has indicated in some way how he would respond to the current economic crisis. It is a pity that the same cannot be said of the opportunistic federal opposition. The opposition have again displayed the audacious opportunism that Australians have come to expect of them since the last federal election. Playing politics in the midst of the worse global recession since the Great Depression is, in my view, very irresponsible. My electorate knows this and I believe that the wider electorate across the continent understands this. One minute the opposition claim they would not have to borrow despite the $210 billion shortfall in tax revenue. The next minute they admit that they would also need to borrow to make up for this revenue shortfall. One minute they would be implementing a $25 billion budget deficit; the next minute they would be in surplus. We have had the shadow minister for finance running around quoting former US President Herbert Hoover, the very man who sat back and refused to intervene in the early years of the Great Depression and merely exacerbated the problem. Members opposite have shown a frightening level of economic ignorance and a clear inability to articulate a consistent policy. For a group of people who regularly boast about their economic credentials, their budget reply leaves much to be desired, and the people of Australia are aware of this. Only the Liberal Party-the party that oppose this government’s $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan-would criticise a government that spends money to stimulate the economy in times of recession. Only the Liberal Party-the party that continues to espouse the flawed theory of neoliberalism-would stand on the floor of this parliament and put forward a recipe for disaster to get Australia out of this recession. It is discomfiting that the opposition seriously believe that you can restore a budget surplus by simultaneously cutting spending and cutting taxes. The difference between the government and the opposition could not be clearer. The Rudd government have a clear vision to stimulate the economy in the short term. Through our oneoff tax bonuses we have been able to promote the flow of income throughout the economy by boosting consumption. Now, in this budget, we turn to infrastructure to stimulate the economy and support job creation in the short term and to boost our long-term productivity and prosperity. This is a nation-building budget. It is a budget that meets the economic needs of the present while also laying the building blocks for future productivity and growth. It is a budget that diversifies our economy by ensuring we no longer rely on one sector alone to fuel our prosperity and it is a budget that builds a modern Australian economy-an economy that recognises that a strong education system is imperative for economic progress, values small business, supports green infrastructure, develops a national broadband network and looks after the most vulnerable people in our society. I commend the bills to the House. deficit versus building and infrastructure from the two tribes that go to war in this place on a regular basis. They are both very legitimate positions, and I will follow the debate closely. I continue to place faith in our national economics and in the budget, and in the Secretary to the Treasury, Ken Henry, who is a mid-North Coast person. I have a very high regard for him and MAIN COMMITTEE",160,Mitchell But Don T You Accept There Were Promises Broken Prime Minister Well We Re Talking About Exactly The Same Thing
291,Mr Oakeshott (Lyne) (12.19 Pm),"This House is hearing a great deal about debt and the role he plays, and the status he holds in the Australian Public Service. I therefore place faith in the general budget settings that we see implemented in these budget 2009-10 and associated appropriation bills. Whilst the debt and deficit versus building and infrastructure debate is all legitimate and very alive, my focus is on whether the mid-North Coast of New South Wales has a net gain or a net loss from these appropriation bills and the budget generally. Generally, in my view, we have net gains. In a lot of ways this budget allows the public participants and policymakers on the mid-North Coast to continue the long and difficult campaign to address some of the deep structural issues faced on the mid-North Coast. I am referring to some of the very real and too often undiscussed issues that the mid-North Coast and indeed the entire North Coast face when compared to the rest of the country. The mid-North Coast and North Coast areas of New South Wales have tertiary education levels among the lowest in the nation. Poverty levels for all four electorates-of Lyne, Cowper, Page and Richmond-are some of the highest in the nation. Employment rates and participation rates for the mid-North Coast region, Richmond-Tweed, are the lowest in the nation right now when compared with other electorates. We have some deep structural issues there. It is even worse when we consider that we have low employment and a low participation rate alongside some of the highest unemployment rates in the nation. Whilst we hear plenty of debate in this place about whether the national figures are going to tip over 10 per cent or not, we are there. Last month unemployment for the mid-North Coast and Richmond-Tweed went over 10 per cent. We hit 10.6 per cent in the last figures, and we are now down, right on 10 per cent. Hopefully this makes the point to everyone in this place that we have a very low participation market and, alongside that, a very high unemployment rate-so people are looking to participate-which indicates that we face some very substantial structural issues. As well, our region is not immune to what the rest of the nation is facing from the trigger of the situation we are in-the global banking collapse. The practical implications of that are seen in the fact that some of the local authorities have been significantly caught in regard to their investment portfolios. One local council has now written $25 million off its investments. That is a significant loss on investments for a regional local council, and the implications for future service delivery to the community cannot be understated. As well, in my home town of Port Macquarie we estimate that between 3,000 and 5,000 people in a private sense have been affected by the collapse of three locally managed funds. Again, this is in an area where we have a high population of retirees. Investment funds are incredibly important for people at that stage of life, and having three local managed funds in receivership is placing a great strain on many individual households and the community generally on the mid-North Coast. We are faced with a suite of issues, both structural and more immediate, in regard to people’s financial situation. This means the work that government does through measures such as appropriation bills and the general policy settings really do matter in a practical sense, on the ground. We can, of course, throw into the mix the more immediate and natural disasters which also have practical implications on the ground. For the third time in three months my region is currently going through a recovery process after the floods, winds and evacuations which occurred on the weekend. The question for me, then, as the federal member for this area, is how this budget fits in with that setting. MAIN COMMITTEE There are some pretty important net gains for my region, which the region is certainly appreciative of and which will make a difference with regard to some of those structural issues. Without doubt, the investment in the Pacific Highway and, in particular, the bringing online of the Kempsey bypass-a $618 million commitment of infrastructure-will make a significant difference. It will employ hundreds of people in the Macleay Valley in the short term. It will also remove one of the significant bottlenecks, which is currently the township of Kempsey. It will therefore, overall for the Pacific Highway and particularly the stretch from Hexham to the Queensland border, make a much safer and much more efficient dual carriage highway and be one step closer to the completion of a job that should have been done already. Plenty of political commitments and promises have been made by all sides of politics, and it is a frustration for many of the one million residents in the North Coast window that still only 50 per cent of the job has been done when it was promised in 1996 by Paul Keating and John Fahey. They were hand in hand up on the Tweed and said it was going to be a 10-year job, and we are 50 per cent there in the year 2009. It is a frustration-and it is dangerous. I think the figure is that there have been close to 500 deaths on the highway since those commitments were made. If each of those deaths equates in public policy terms to at least $1 million in coronials and the whole process around a highway death, in purely economic terms there is a very strong argument for fixing this highway a lot quicker than is being done-and that is before we get into the family and the emotional and moral arguments for it to happen. So any commitment that the federal government delivers for the Pacific Highway is certainly welcome. The $618 million in the budget for the Kempsey bypass had people jumping in the streets of Kempsey and the Macleay. So, to the minister involved, to the executive and to the government generally: thank you very much, on behalf of residents of that region. Also, some of the infrastructure projects did make a difference and have made a difference in this 12-month window. The commitment of the federal government to build a closer relationship with local authorities that we are seeing through the Community Infrastructure Program is a real winner on the ground on the mid-North Coast. The three councils that I represent are very happy and want to see that program continue. I again say to the executive and the minister in question that, when the mayors and shire presidents come together nationally at the end of June, I would certainly hope that coming out of that will be a re-commitment to the Community Infrastructure Program. Regardless of which side of politics is in government, I think there is a general recognition of the need to build a closer relationship between the federal government and local authorities. The previous government started to do it through various roads programs-Roads to Recovery springs to mind. We are now seeing this government take it a step further with community infrastructure. It is working. It does make a difference, it does have general support on the ground and it does make the federal government real for many communities. So it is a fantastic program. Our region is very happy that it has happened. As I have said, there has been record council funding from the federal government so far this year. I implore the minister and the government to continue that program, because it does very good work. As well, there were two larger projects in our region that were successful through this budget process that will be funded through these appropriations. One involved the Wauchope Bonny Hills Surf Life Saving Club, which was about to close its doors. Again, they were very, very happy with the money and will certainly be enjoying that new facility in a couple of MAIN COMMITTEE years time. It is not only a surf club facility but a general community facility for Wauchope, Bonny Hills, Lake Cathie and the Camden Haven region. In addition, the Taree recreational centre received a substantial amount of money. And, again, for the range of sports on offer in the Manning Valley-there is a very rich tradition of elite sports people coming from the region-this was very well received. It will make a difference and it will allow local communities to attract more events to the region. Our area is realising that there are some real financial benefits in having a strategy of trying to attract more and more sporting and general events to the region. But to do that good facilities are needed. Debate interrupted. That the Main Committee do now adjourn. Crime many of my constituents, and I say this with complete conviction, because I have stood at the front doors of residents of Cowan on more occasions than I can remember. They have presented me with their views about being dissatisfied with the administration of justice in the court system. Let me be clear about this: there is an expectation from the people that crime and antisocial behaviour will be properly dealt with. There are three parts to any justice system. They are: the enforcement of the laws by the police, the administration of the laws by the courts and the creating of the laws by parliament. I will start by speaking about the police. I can say that every decent Australian has support and the highest regard for the police. I know that the police will always execute the laws to the best of their ability. In Cowan we are well served by the teams at Wanneroo Police Station under Senior Sergeant Matt Ray, at Ballajura Police Station under Acting Senior Sergeant Narelle Woods and at Warwick Police Station under Senior Sergeant Craig Wanstall. They always do their part and the people of Cowan greatly appreciate their work. I commend them for the proactive work they do under very difficult circumstances. I would also like to note my appreciation for the assistance that Senior Sergeant Craig Wanstall and Senior Constable Ray Lee of Warwick Police provided in Girrawheen last week when we went around local shops and spoke with Vietnamese people in relation to crimes against them. I do not hear people complain about the police, but I do hear complaints in regard to the courts. The view of many of my constituents is that the penalties do not match the crime. The view of the vast majority of the constituents of Cowan is that they want criminals and other offenders to be held accountable for their crimes and their antisocial behaviour. Recently there was the reported case of Constable Mathew Butcher, a young police officer in the WA Police, being left partially paralysed and brain damaged after he was head-butted from behind. Constable Butcher was attending a fight outside a tavern in Joondalup when a man named Barry MacLeod ran at him from behind and leapt into the air in order to head-butt the police officer from behind. The sickening attack has been widely reported and was filmed on a mobile telephone. What is incredible is that Barry MacLeod was acquitted in the District Court. He ofMAIN COMMITTEE",165,Mitchell But Don T You Accept There Were Promises Broken Prime Minister Well We Re Talking About Exactly The Same Thing

293,Mr Simpkins (Cowan) (12.31 Pm),"I rise to speak about an issue of great concern tofered the excuse that he was worried about his father, who shortly after this incident had a heart attack, but later recovered in hospital. The people in Perth were not impressed and remain very angry about this failure by the courts to hold Barry MacLeod responsible for his actions. I should say that Barry MacLeod’s dad was no innocent bystander in this fight. Obviously, he has always set a pathetic and low standard for his sons, reinforced on that occasion by his own full participation in the fight. It is a harsh reality that some people in our society are just plain bad. They have no regard for others, they have no regard for the police and no regard for the law. The MacLeods are such people and they should have been dealt with appropriately by the courts. Instead justice was not served and I call it a disgrace and, in fact, a travesty of justice. I believe that the courts should represent the expectations of society and I know that many of my constituents share this belief. I wonder whether this can be achieved when magistrates and judges, who are akin to gods in their courtrooms and who are influenced by their backgrounds, mostly on the defence side in criminal matters, see the accused appear before them in a suit-maybe for the first time-shaved, sober and briefed by their lawyer. The person who appears before the magistrate or judge in these sorts of bodily harm cases is a far cry from the aggressive, drug or alcohol affected dangerous person that confronted police months earlier. When acquittals and soft sentences occur it is little wonder that most people do not believe that justice is dispensed by the courts. It is for that reason that governments have to step in and impose simpler laws in these cases. Simpler laws that clearly prescribe penaltiesunequivocal penalties-for such attacks on police will send a clear message about what society wants and requires its judicial officers to dispense. It requires judicial officers to dispense the right penalties. I therefore look forward to the new government in Western Australia taking steps to implement simpler but tougher laws that ensure the penalties that are dispensed meet the expectations of our community. I have met with the police minister, Rob Johnson, and I wish him and the Attorney-General, Christian Porter, every success in getting better laws through the WA parliament. I look forward to laws that will send a clear message about dealing with those who attack police. I also look forward to tougher search and seizure laws to deal with graffiti vandals and for the seizure and crushing of hoon vehicles. Finally, I would like to express my support for the police officers who protect our community well and also my gratitude to officers who are injured, like Constable Matt Butcher, and to those other officers who make the ultimate sacrifice for our community. The police need support and they need protection. The good people of Western Australia believe it is about time that the courts dispensed real justice. Foreign Aid number of letters from members of the Anglesea and Grovedale Baptist congregations in my electorate of Corangamite.

It is fantastic to see local people doing such good work in my electorate. MAIN COMMITTEE",168,Adjournment
294,Mr Cheeseman (Corangamite) (12.36 Pm),"I rise today to speak after receiving aThe federal government is committed to providing funding for the improvement of health care in the developing world. The federal government will spend an estimated $595 million or around 16 per cent of the total aid program on health in developing countries. Of this funding, 27 per cent will be aimed at sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV-AIDS. This will hopefully help so that fewer babies will be born with such diseases and there will be an improvement in life expectancy of adults with HIV. Therefore, this aid should enable parents with HIV to live longer and more active lives with their children. The federal government has committed around 21 per cent of its overseas aid budget to basic health for the developing world. This aid will provide such things as more doctors and nurses on the ground to give basic care for children in developing countries. The federal government will also provide an estimated 21 per cent to control infectious diseases. This will directly benefit children by providing them with immunisation to diseases that the developed world would never consider a risk to their children. It is Labor, when in government, that provides more funding for foreign aid to enable developing countries to better their health systems and so give their children a better chance to succeed due to their being much healthier. The Rudd government has increased the health aid budget by $155 million or three per cent since the last budget was handed down by the previous Howard government in 2007. The Rudd government is acutely aware of the need for Australia to play a major role in aid in the developing world. The government has committed to increase Australia’s official development assistance to a gross national income ratio of 0.5 per cent by 2015-16. The Millennium Development Goals agreed at the United Nations summit in 2000 provide a focus for international efforts to reduce global poverty by 2015. The Australian government is committed to the Millennium Development Goals and has brought them to the centre of Australia’s aid program. Three of the MDGs, Nos 4, 5 and 6, focus specifically on health issues. As the aid program grows, it is expected that health spending will also continue to grow. The Australian federal government understands the responsibility that the developed world has in helping undeveloped countries provide their people with better access to health care. I personally understand that all governments in the developed world have to continue to lift their standards of health for developing countries. Australia is no different. Thus we have to endeavour to continue raising our efforts in supporting and helping the developing world provide better health conditions for their children. I conclude by thanking the Anglesea Baptist Congregation and the Grovedale Baptist Congregation in fighting the battle for the less fortunate. I give my personal assurance that I will actively continue to pursue these matters in this place. I encourage the Anglesea and Grovedale Baptist congregations to continue their efforts in securing aid for the developed world. I thank the House.

295,Mr Ramsey (Grey) (12.40 Pm),"I rise today to bring to the House’s attention some ofbe the case and that the retail and hospitality industries in particular will be digging deeper into their pockets in order to keep their doors open. Changes such as 25 per cent penalties for weekday work after six o’clock and on Saturdays, currently paid at ordinary time, as well as a steep rise in penalties for Sundays to 100 per cent and public holidays to 150 per cent above ordinary time rates will ratchet up costs, particularly for small employers at a time when they can least afford it. When our unemployment queues are already growing at the fastest rate in the last 40 years, now is not the time for a new wages push in these high-employment sectors. In some cases the wage rises will lead to a reduction in services. The Australian public has made it abundantly clear how much it enjoys extended services-the demand is there and business has shown its commitment to responding-but, in the end, if you cannot make a profit, you will not open. Retailers in South Australia are currently governed by the state retail award. Some years ago, when the award was adjusted to meet the demands of extended shopping hours, adjustments were made resulting in higher ordinary time wages as a trade-off to the flattening out of penalty rates. It was recognised that these businesses were now required to trade longer hours in order to remain competitive and meet public demand. Now, as a result of the new awards, that higher base rate, put in place to compensate for lower penalties, is being protected and penalty rates are being reintroduced on top of it. It has, in fact, a ratcheting effect on wages. I have been contacted by John Sandercock, the operator of a medium sized supermarket in the progressive country town of Ardrossan within my electorate of Grey. John currently employs 30 full-time equivalent staff. He calculates that he will see his wages bill rise by $70,000 a year. This amounts to about two staff positions. He tells me he will have to make cuts to his workforce to meet the new constraints. How can this be productive? How can putting wages pressure on a small business at a time of great financial challenge be a good thing? The ramifications for the restaurant industry, which largely operates out of hours, will be even more telling. There is no doubt the Australian public were convinced that they should get rid of Work Choices. This side of parliament has heard the message and allowed it to happen. What the electorate did not ask for was a return to the 1970s. The time frame for introduction of the new awards is at best difficult-right in the middle of the Christmas-new year retail surge. The name ‘new modern award’ may be all of those things-that is, it may be new, it may be modern and it certainly is an award-but it is not simple. It’s an interesting use of words, isn’t it? New modern award implies simplicity; in fact, it is far more complex than the old award. In the eyes of business this is just more government red tape. Small businesses do not have human resources departments. Awards that have more pay scales and more restrictions on the mix of working hours just make life more difficult. There have been enormous changes in the Australian community over the last 20 years. There was a time when, on Sundays, buying petrol was difficult, restaurants, cafes and hotels were shut and hardware shops and boutiques were shut. Australians do not want to go back to that era, and yet many of the flexibilities in the workforce that allowed those services to evolve are now being attacked, no more so than by the reintroduction of totally prohibitive penalty rates. The imposition of a 150 per cent loading for public holidays will mean the only businesses which will open will, by and large, be those operated by family members. This is hardly a fair way to distribute the workload. The moves to lift casual loading to 25 per cent MAIN COMMITTEE are a blunt way of trying to force businesses to put on permanent employees. There is a paradox when at the same time we have reintroduced unfair dismissal laws, which will discourage employers from taking on permanent staff. I urge the Industrial Relations Commission to allow for a phase-in period of a number of years and a later start-up date, which avoids the Christmas-new year 2010 rush, to allow the industry to adapt to the new conditions. Braddon Electorate: Budget news in which the Commonwealth is involved in my electorate of Braddon, on the north-west coast of Tasmania. This is in addition to the Commonwealth entitlements that people receive and the major components of the two stimulus packages. In particular, I would like to mention that, in the housing affordability programs that the government has announced, Wynyard in my area will get savings on 30 dwellings. That will be a significant contribution to much more affordable housing in my region. King Island is being funded for 19 new building lots, which will come in very handy on that beautiful island. Tasmania will pioneer the first rolling out of the National Broadband Network, which was announced in April in my electorate by the Prime Minister and the Premier. We hope that by July the first digging for the rollout will take place. I look forward to the benefits of that for my electorate and Tasmania. There will be good lessons learned, as this will be rolled out throughout the rest of Australia. I am very pleased the government has initiated the National School Pride Program, with its fantastic investment in schools and, in particular, in primary schools. In round 1, $4 million was allocated to my electorate and, in round 2, there was $4.5 million allocated. A total of $8.5 million will go into providing not just much needed refurbishments in our primary schools but employment-that is, lots of employment for local people who will use local products and local services. Like those of other members in this House, 14 primary schools in my electorate will benefit from a total of $21.5 million from Primary Schools for the 21st Century. Again, that is $21.5 million for jobs-that is, for jobs locally, for jobs services and for those things that will be used to equip many of these projects. That $21.5 million investment in our primary schools will aid the teaching and learning process as well. There is $1.2 million for computers in 21 of our schools. That is much needed assistance with computers. Of course, this will provide employment for people as well. Again, it is stimulating our economy by investing in our schools and investing in our infrastructure. That is at the very heart of our budgetary strategy. We are also getting $1.5 million for a trade training centre at St Brendan-Shaw College, to be shared with Marist Regional College in Burnie. That will be very welcome indeed. Health is an area that needs investment and one that we are continuing to invest in, and we need to do this in partnership with the state government and health providers. Over $180 million is allocated to the Mersey Community Hospital. It is great to see the positive health outcomes from that, particularly integrating with the North West Regional Hospital as well. There is $7.5 million for two new superclinics in our region, and they have both gone to contract. There is $60,000 for the Penguin clinic and $1.25 million for the Sisters of Charity to provide much needed trauma counselling and mental health services. For patient transport there is $10 million.

(Time expired) Stirling Electorate: Roads matters of road safety within Perth city which exists in my electorate of Stirling. The Reid Highway is a major dual carriageway which passes east-west through the suburbs in the northern part of Stirling. A number of major roads cross the Reid Highway at significant and very busy intersections. Overpasses have been built where some of these roads intersect, and at some intersections there are no overpasses, although it was always intended that these overpasses would be built. They are very busy intersections at two very significant roads. The Mirrabooka Avenue intersection of Reid Highway has been identified as one of the worse black spots on Western Australian roads. Indeed, by some accounts it is the worse black spot in Western Australia. Thousands of cars traverse these roads every day, leading to congestion and frustration during peak periods and after school. Cars inevitably run the gauntlet out of frustration and the die is of course cast for tragic road accidents. Statistics show that there are over 50 crashes per year at this particular intersection. Many have been serious, including several fatalities, and it has been calculated that the 258 crashes in the five years to December 2007 have cost the community more than $19 million. When I quote that figure, that of course is insignificant compared to the lives that have been shattered by fatalities and very major injuries that have occurred because of this intersection. We all need to remind ourselves of the tragedy of road accidents, which of course is the human face behind the statistics that I have been quoting. The human and financial costs to my community in Stirling, including the drain on health and police resources, are enormous. People have written to me outlining gut-wrenching accounts of personal experiences of car accidents at this site. The Labor Party has completely forgotten about my community in Stirling and the community of Cowan by not delivering on a promised overpass at this intersection of Reid Highway and Mirrabooka Avenue. The Rudd Labor government has turned its back on these local Perth communities by failing to fund this overpass. Hundreds of local families have already signed an online petition that I started for this overpass to be built. I will continue to fight for this important project because building this overpass will save lives and eliminate a significant amount of road trauma and serious injury. My community has been promised this overpass at every federal and state election since 2001. In the 2007 election, I secured a promise from the coalition government that, if we were re-elected, we would provide $10 million for funding of this overpass. My Labor opponent at the time, on behalf of the elected Labor government, promised that this project would be considered. The Rudd Labor government must follow up on that promise for road safety and build this overpass at Mirrabooka Avenue and the Reid Highway. By not doing so they turn their backs on thousands of Perth families, especially in the communities of Mirrabooka, Balga, Westminster, Nollamara and Dianella. I have consistently asked both previous governments and this government to start work on this important project.

297,Mr Keenan (Stirling) (12.49 Pm),"I wish to talk today about one of the most seriousstructure, and the Mirrabooka Avenue overpass should be at the top of the list. This is exactly the type of construction the government should have been spending money on rather than throwing money around like confetti on cash splashes, which has not created a single new job as they promised it would. It would also have brought a significant cash injection to the local Mirrabooka economy through construction work and contract employees’ spending. The government is claiming to be kick-starting the economy during what is a difficult international economic period, yet the bulk of its infrastructure spending is actually not due to commence for another two years. Set against the backdrop of a whopping $315 billion of debt and $52 billion on cash splashes, the budget papers show that only a paltry $7.1 billion of new infrastructure money will be spent on projects in the next financial year, which of course is the period when we will need it most. Once again, it is all spin and no substance from a Labor government drunk on debt and reckless spending, with very little to show for it. The Western Australian Labor Party said in 2004 and again in 2005 that Mirrabooka Avenue was the worse black spot in Western Australia. They have consistently promised to do something about it, yet they have failed to take any action. I call on the federal government to join with the state Liberal government in Western Australia to look at building this much needed infrastructure in my local community. Budget Stirling and his diatribe in relation to the effects of the stimulus packages on local communities. He clearly does not get out and talk to people in the community about the effects they are actually having. In the seat of Dobell the cash payments that were made in the first part of the stimulus package had a remarkable effect on maintaining employment in the retail area. Retail on the Central Coast is the biggest employer. The purpose of those payments was to make sure that the retail sector did not collapse, as has happened around the world. To that extent, the cash stimulus was an overwhelming success in the seat of Dobell. I want to focus more on the spending of the Rudd government on education and schools. In the most recent announcement for round 2 of the National School Pride Program, 17 schools in my electorate of Dobell on the Central Coast of New South Wales will receive $2.55 million for minor infrastructure and refurbishment projects. This is part of the $4.4 million of total funding for the Central Coast region under the second round of the National School Pride Program. This program is one of the three elements of the Rudd government’s $14.7 billion Building the Education Revolution. It will deliver much needed funding for school infrastructure projects and, importantly, support local jobs. Each one of the 17 schools, plus the 30-odd schools that received funding in round 1, will become a mini job centre, with many local tradesmen being employed. Again, this is particularly important for my seat. There is a much higher proportion of tradies living in the seat of Dobell than in most other electorates. Unfortunately, a lot of those tradies have to commute to Sydney, a couple of hours away, every day. Not only is this providing work for them generally but it is providing work for them locally and that is beneficial for the local economy and has social implications as they do not have to have a four-hour round commute. Our local schools and communities benefit because of the vital school infrastructure and the jobs that are created. The $1.3 billion National School Pride Program will deliver much needed funding for school infrastructure projects and will support local jobs. Together with MAIN COMMITTEE",173,Adjournment
298,Mr Craig Thomson (Dobell) (12.55 Pm),"It is interesting to follow the member forround 1, the National School Pride Program will deliver $7.375 million to 45 primary and secondary schools in Dobell. That will have a major stimulus effect on local jobs and the community. In total, the two rounds will inject $16 million into the Central Coast economy. Construction and refurbishment work will commence as soon as possible, with many of the National School Pride projects planned to begin shortly. The next few months will be exciting as investment in our schools will flow down to local businesses and others in the construction industry. In the first round of Primary Schools for the 21st Century, three schools in Dobell were selected to receive much needed funds for infrastructure. Dooralong Public School will get $140,000 for a new COLA and $110,000 for a classroom upgrade. Tacoma Public School is getting $2 million for a new hall and COLA. Wyong Grove Public School will get money for a new hall and COLA too. Wyong Grove Public School is a particularly disadvantaged school. Many kids turn up to this school without having had breakfast, and the school has a very good breakfast program. This school would never have been able to get the infrastructure that is being provided if it were not for this program. The important part of this program is that these halls are also for community use. It is not just creating jobs and making the schools better for our children but also making sure there is this connection with the community. When we went to Tacoma Public School there was a huge welcome sign that said that this was the best thing that had happened to Tacoma, and I would have to concur with that. These projects are important. The stimulus package that the Rudd government introduced is having real effects locally-creating real jobs and assisting the community with vital infrastructure. Question agreed to. Main Committee adjourned at 1.00 pm MAIN COMMITTEE Employment (Question No. 523) Dr Southcott asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 4 December 2008: In respect of the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy (ESS) announced on 14 October 2008(1) As a result of this package, by sector, how many jobs does the Government estimate will be created in the (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10 and (c) 2010-11 financial years. (2) As a result of this package, what does the Government estimate will be the increase in Aggregate Demand in the (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, and (c) 2010-11 financial years. (3) What proportion of the $4.8 billion in pension payments does the Government estimate will contribute to (i) consumption, and (ii) savings. (4) What proportion of the $3.9 billion in family tax benefits does the Government estimate will contribute to (i) consumption, and (ii) savings. The Government’s estimates of the impacts of stimulus measures assume that a stimulus of 1 per cent of GDP can be expected to increase GDP growth by between ½ and 1 percentage point. This is based on the assumption of a fiscal multiplier of between 0.5 and 1 (that is, each additional dollar of fiscal stimulus results in additional GDP of between fifty cents and one dollar). Accordingly, the Government has estimated that the Economic Security Strategy would support the employment of up to 75,000 people, based on an employment elasticity of 0.75 (that is, each 1 percentage point increase in GDP growth is associated, on average, with a 0.75 percentage point increase in employment). The bulk of the impact occurs in the year immediately following the implementation of the ESS measures. The Budget provided more detail on the combined impacts of the stimulus packages, including the ESS, on a quarterly basis. The quarterly impact of the packages in supporting jobs builds up to a peak of 210,000 by the June quarter 2010. Employment (Question No. 524) Dr Southcott asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 3 December 2008: In respect of the $15.1 billion COAG Agreement of 29 November 2008(1) As a result of this agreement, by sector, how many jobs does the Government estimate will be created in the (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, (c) 2010-11, (d) 2011-12 and (e) 2012-13 financial years. (2) As a result of this agreement, what does the Government estimate will be the increase in Aggregate Demand in the (a) 2008-09, (b) 2009-10, (c) 2010-11, (d) 2011-12 and (e) 2012-13 financial years. The Government’s estimates of the impacts of stimulus measures assume that a dollar of fiscal stimulus increases GDP by a multiplier of between 0.5 and 1, as outlined in my answer to House of Representatives Question No. 523. Infrastructure spending is generally expected to have a multiplier at the higher end of this range. Each additional 1 per cent of GDP is estimated to support up to 75,000 jobs. The employment effects of spending over several years are based on the same assumptions, but the number of jobs supported at any point in time will vary depending on the profile of the spending over time, so it is a more complex calculation. A succession of overlapping temporary spending measures",174,Adjournment

300,Mr Swan,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:will each add to employment for a period until the particular stimulus ceases and the employment associated with it returns after a time to pre-stimulus levels. As these spending measures progressively come on stream over time (and some of the employment created by the earlier measures finishes) the number of jobs supported by the spending increases to a peak and then declines. The Budget provided more detail on the combined impacts of all the stimulus packages, including the COAG measures, on a quarterly basis. The quarterly impact of the packages in supporting jobs builds up to a peak of 210,000 by the June quarter 2010. Employment (Question No. 525) Dr Southcott asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 4 December 2008: (1) In respect of the $10.4 billion Economic Security Strategy announced on 14 October 2008: (a) what economic analysis or modelling has been done on the number of jobs forecast to be created by this package; (b) what are the assumptions of this economic analysis or modelling; (c) how were the job creation numbers calculated; and (d) what will be the effect of the stimulus over time. (2) In respect of the $15.1 billion COAG Agreement of 29 November 2008: (a) what economic analysis or modelling has been done on the number of jobs forecast to be created by this agreement; (b) what are the assumptions of this economic analysis or modelling; (c) how were the job creation numbers calculated; and (d) what will be the effect of the stimulus over time. The answers to these questions are provided in my answers to House of Representatives Question Nos. 523 and 524. Employment (Question No. 526) Dr Southcott asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 4 December 2008: In respect of the economic analysis or modelling underpinning the forecast creation of 133,000 jobs from the $15.1 billion COAG agreement: (a) what is the Treasury estimate of the number of jobs lost or replaced in the private sector; (b) what is the Treasury estimate of the gross number of jobs created and lost; (c) which components of the agreement are likely to generate the most jobs; (d) of the estimated 133,000 jobs, how many are attributable to each component of the agreement. The estimation methodology is outlined in my answers to House of Representatives Question Nos. 523 and 524. The estimates of employment impacts are for the effect on aggregate employment in the economy. The estimation methodology does not provide for estimates of employment impacts by sector. Salt Ash Air Weapons Range (Question No. 584) Mr Baldwin asked the Minister for Defence, in writing, on 9 February 2009: In respect of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Salt Ash Air Weapons Range (SAAWR)(1) What is the purpose of the SAAWR and how is it used. (2) When was the SAAWR opened. (3) What was the usage by FA18 Hornets and Lead In Fighters of the SAAWR from January 2008 to January 2009.

302,Mr Swan,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(a) 12 months, and (b) five years. (5) Does the RAAF currently use any other weapons range. (6) Can other weapons ranges be utilized for training instead of SAAWR. (7) How much of the local Defence air activity is a direct result of aircraft using weapons ranges. (8) What plans does Defence have to acquire noise affected properties around the SAAWR. (9) What steps have been taken to consult local residents and address their concerns in relation to the (10) Will the SAAWR be used by the Super Hornet. (11) Does the Super Hornet have a higher noise profile than the current FA18. (12) Will the SAAWR be used by the Joint Strike Fighter. (13) Does the Joint Strike Fighter have a higher noise profile that the current FA18. (14) If the Super Hornet and Joint Strike Fighter are to use the SAAWR, what plans are there for acquisition of noise affected properties. (15) Will there be a review of the use and application of the SAAWR; if so, (a) what will be its aim, (b) who will (i) conduct it, and (ii) be consulted, and (c) what is its proposed timeframe. (1) and (2) The Salt Ash Air Weapons Range (SAAWR), used by the Air Force continuously since 1946, is an essential resource for the development of fighter pilot air combat skills. The range enables F/A-18A/B Hornet, Hawk 127 and Pilatus P/C-9 pilots to hone air to surface gunnery and inert practice bombing skills. (3) Between January 2008 to January 2009, the Air Force’s Hawk 127s and F/A-18A/B Hornets flew a total of 176 missions that utilised the range. (4) (a) and (b) No. (5) The Air Force currently uses 36 Defence practice areas and test ranges spread geographically around Australia. (6) Studies in the late 1980s and 2000 concluded that there were no suitable or viable alternative sites for an air weapons range for aircraft based at RAAF Williamtown. These studies also stated that the nearby Singleton range was assessed as unsuitable for the Air Force’s requirements. Analysis of alternative basing structures indicates that the RAAF Williamtown/Salt Ash Air Weapons Range construct is the most cost effective means of achieving air combat training for Defence.

303,Mr Fitzgibbon,"The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:(12) Studies regarding the requirement for the use of SAAWR by the Joint Strike Fighter are currently underway, and are not expected to be completed until next year. However, initial indications are that the introduction of the Joint Strike Fighter will lead to reduced Range usage. (13) Defence funded extensive noise testing of the Joint Strike Fighter in late 2008 to better understand the noise characteristics and validate the early noise data. The tests indicate that, while not as noisy as originally expected, the JSF will be noisier than current F/A-18 A/B Hornet aircraft in some phases of flight but is less noisy in others. For example, the JSF will be quieter than the F/A-18 A/B in cruise and approach but will be noisier on take-off. (14) Defence has no current plans to acquire noise affected properties around the range. (15) Yes, the range was included in the Defence Strategic Training Area and Ranges Review, which was conducted in 2008. Defence will consider the review later this year. (a) To align the capability, force disposition and sustainability requirements of the Australian Defence Force’s training areas and test ranges for the longer term. (b) It was conducted by Parsons Brinckerhoff, with PS Management Consultants taking the management and technical lead. No consultation external to Defence was undertaken. (c) The review has already been conducted. Further studies regarding the requirement for the use of SAAWR by the Joint Strike Fighter are currently underway.
